At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Preston, with an update on the current environment and our most recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before opening the call to Q&A. I would like to start my comments by expressing my appreciation for the perseverance shown by our employees, as they work through the many challenges that we faced during 2020. Throughout the year, we maintained high employee engagement, while continuing to support surgeons and caregivers around the world. Our fourth quarter organic sales declined roughly 1%, reflecting the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, offset by continuation of emergent procedures and strong performance by our large capital products. We are also excited about closing the Wright Medical deal during the quarter and the category leadership that we gain in the fastest-growing segment within the orthopedics market. Preston will provide some additional updates on the integration shortly. Throughout the quarter, we maintained the financial discipline instituted at the beginning of the pandemic, which, combined with a favorable tax rate, led to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.81 in the quarter, up approximately 13% versus 2019. And we delivered impressive cash flow from operations, which exceeded $3 billion for the full-year. In addition to closing the Wright Medical acquisition, we also made progress in many areas that will provide future growth opportunities. We have established a structure focused on digital, robotics and enabling technology, where we see significant opportunity to create a company-wide unified digital ecosystem, including Mako. We maintained our commitment to drive innovation across our various business units, including Neurovascular, where we gained new product approvals across aspiration, stent retrievers and flow diverting stents. And in our MedSurg segment, where we continued product introductions with a focus on safety and prevention. Finally, we successfully launched our ASC sales model, which leverages the Stryker portfolio to provide end-to-end solutions to meet the growing demand and shifts to the outpatient setting. Our continued support for our customers and our commitment to innovation will position us well for growth as the pandemic eventually subsides. Turning to 2021, our people and culture of execution remain strong, which will allow us to deliver on our commitment to make healthcare better and to resume our customary strong organic sales growth and leverage earnings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Preston.\nPreston Wells: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and OrthoSensor. During the fourth quarter, elective procedures were negatively pressured in most regions globally as localized infection and hospitalization rates surged through the month of December. As a result, growth was uneven and correlated to the state of the pandemic in each region. The areas impacted the most include the U.S. and many of the countries in Western Europe, most notably, the United Kingdom, driven by a countrywide lockdown. Even with the procedural variability, we saw growth in emerging markets, including China, which grew double digits over prior year quarter. Looking forward, hospitals are better equipped to handle this resurgence and they are working to bring back the procedures that have been delayed, though we expect that the variability of elective procedures will continue through the first quarter until infection rates begin to decline and the distribution of the vaccines become more prevalent. This slowdown in elective procedures had a negative impact on our more deferrable businesses, which make up approximately 40% to 50% of our total sales. However, the slowdown this quarter was not as impactful as the decline in the second quarter as hospitals were better equipped to manage COVID patients, while maintaining some level of elective surgeries. Despite the overall slowdown, we experienced continued growth in our Neurovascular, Medical, Mako and upper extremities businesses. Specifically, demand for Medical's large capital products continued in the fourth quarter, driven by the focus on expanding bed capacity, the need for our emergency care products like power costs and the LUCAS device and the availability of some remaining CARES Act funding in the U.S. In addition, the early trends on the launch of our new ProCuity are positive and expected to continue into 2021. During the year, our Mako installed base grew by 33% and exceeded another milestone, with over 100 robots sold and installed in the fourth quarter. This growth continues to highlight the demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology, as well as our ongoing success at selling and installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs and competitive accounts. We are also excited about our recent approvals for Mako TKA in China, Russia and Brazil, which all provide opportunities for growth as these markets continue to embrace robotic, digital and enabling technologies. Turning to U.S. knee procedures. In the fourth quarter, approximately 44% of our total knees will make the knee procedures, a trend that continues to increase. The shift towards cementless needs also continued. And in the fourth quarter, cementless needs made up 42% of our U.S. knee procedures. During the pandemic, feedback from surgeons has pointed to limited trialing of competitive products and businesses like joint replacement, as surgeons worked to perform procedures restricted by cancellations and deferrals. However, as the pandemic subsides and we return to a more normal environment, we expect to continue to outpace the market, driven by our Mako installations throughout the year and our strong order book heading into 2021. We are also enthusiastic about the Wright Medical acquisition and the category leadership we gain in both upper extremities and foot and ankle through Wright's diverse portfolio of implants, biologics and enabling technologies. The combination of Stryker and Wright will continue to drive innovation that enhances our customers' ability to address patient needs across the more than $3 billion extremities market. The integration has been progressing well over the last few months. The long period from signed to close was used to ensure that the appropriate integration plans were in place, leveraging our years of deal experience. To date, the teams have been focused on moving quickly to align the new combined organization. Considerable progress has been made, including the creation of specialized business units and sales forces for Trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle, which is a key part of our overall decentralized strategy that allows us to remain close to the customer. The U.S. sales leadership organizational structure for these three specialized business units has been announced and the rollout and full alignment of territories will be finalized during the first quarter as planned. Outside the U.S., the leadership team is working to align the sales forces throughout the year. Our teams are executing the sales integration while continuing to drive day-to-day business. And during the quarter, there was minimal disruption caused by the closing and integration activities. Finally, I want to restate our ongoing commitment to M&A, which was most recently demonstrated by our acquisition of OrthoSensor, a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for joint replacement. Smart devices and implants will play an important role in the future of orthopedics and the addition of OrthoSensor will allow us to continue to innovate and advance smart sensor technologies, including intraoperative sensors, wearables and ultimately, smart implants. As it relates to 2021 guidance, Glenn will provide an update on our full-year guidance for sales, operating margin and EPS. Updates to this annual guidance will be made each quarter if necessary throughout the year. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q4 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.8% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales. Early in the quarter, there was continued momentum from Q3. However, during November, the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the related cancellations of procedures, primarily in the U.S. and Europe significantly impacted our sales momentum. However, we did see demand for certain capital products continue as we had strong results in our Mako, medical beds and emergency care products. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales declined 1.5%, reflecting the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, Medical products and Neurovascular products. International organic sales were flat, impacted by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in Europe, which was mostly offset by growth in Canada, China and Brazil. Organic sales decline for the year was 4.8%, with a U.S. decline of 5.8% and an international decline of 2.1%. 2020 had one additional selling day compared to 2019 and for the year, price had an unfavorable 0.7% impact on sales. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.81 increased 12.9% from the prior year, reflecting strong financial discipline, good operating expense control and a favorable operational tax rate. Our fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by $0.03 from foreign currency. Our full-year EPS was $7.43, which is a decline of 10%, reflecting the impact of lower sales, especially in Q2, as well as the impact of idling certain manufacturing facilities during the year, offset by strong expense discipline throughout the year. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 2.8% and an organic sales decline of 5.8%, including an organic decline of 5.7% in the U.S. This reflects a slowdown in elective procedures related to COVID-19 and a very strong prior year comparable as Q4 2019 U.S. organic growth was 7.2%. Other ortho grew 12.3% in the U.S., primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. The Trauma & Extremities business also delivered positive growth led by our core trauma and shoulder products. Internationally, Orthopaedics declined 6% organically, which also reflects the COVID-19 related procedural slowdown, especially in Europe. This was somewhat offset by stronger performances in Australia and Canada. During the quarter, the Wright Medical acquisition was successfully closed. For the quarter, Wright delivered flat growth on a comparable basis. This included positive performances in U.S. shoulder, double-digit growth in U.S. ankle, as well as strong international growth led by Australia. On a comparable basis for the full year, Wright had a 10.3% decline, mainly driven by the COVID-19 related slowdown in the second quarter. In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency growth of 1.5% and organic growth of 1.3%, which included 2.2% growth in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 4.5%. In the quarter, sales growth was driven by gains in its power tool, waste management and smoke evacuation products and its service business. Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 7%, primarily impacted by the slowdown in the capital businesses, offset by gains in the sports medicine business, which grew over 9% in the quarter. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 9.7%, reflecting solid performances in patient care, emergency care and at Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had an organic sales decline of 2.4%, reflecting a general slowdown in instruments and endoscopy businesses and strong comparables across most geographies. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 2.1%. This growth reflects many strong performances within our Neurotech product line, including neuro-powered drill, SONOPET and Neurovascular, offset by the impact of procedural deferrals, especially in the U.S. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic decline of 1.2%, as procedural deferrals impacted sales in the quarter. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 13.5%. This performance was driven by strong demand in Australia, Japan and China. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.1% was unfavorable, approximately 120 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin dilution was impacted by price, business mix and unabsorbed fixed cost as production was brought in line with reduced demand during the quarter. This was primarily offset by acquisitions and foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.5% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 30.3% of sales, which was favorable to the prior year quarter by 200 basis points. This reflects the continued focus on disciplined operating expense controls, which have been in place since the second quarter. These cover most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings and consultants. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 29.2% of sales, which is a 90 basis points improvement over the prior year quarter and reflects the impact of the spending discipline previously discussed. Related to other - related to other income and expense as compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding related to the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 8%. Our full-year effective tax rate was 12.6%. These rates reflect one-time operational fluctuations that arose due to the pandemic, with a mix of foreign losses related to lower foreign manufacturing activity, combined with reduced U.S. sourced income that resulted from the sharp drop in sales at the end of the year. For 2021, we do not anticipate these circumstances arising, as we expect to return to normalized operations during the year and we expect our full-year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $14 billion. During the quarter, we executed the Wright Medical acquisition, which resulted in the disbursement of $5.6 billion, inclusive of the retirement of Wright's convertible debt. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $3.3 billion. This historically strong performance resulted from the disciplined working capital management, somewhat offset by lower earnings. Turning to cash flow for 2021. We will not be repurchasing any shares and we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately $650 million. Anticipating a more normalized year in 2021 and a ramping of investment in our businesses, we expect the free cash flow conversion rate as a percent of adjusted net earnings, including the one - excluding the one-time impacts from the Wright Medical integration of 70% to 80%. And now, I will provide 2021 guidance on a standalone legacy basis and further guidance including Wright Medical. We are providing our guidance in comparison to 2019, as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. As Preston indicated, we will be providing annual guidance on an organic sales growth and earnings and will update this throughout the year as part of our regular earnings calls. As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. Given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2019. As a reference, our organic sales growth excludes Wright Medical. There are the same number of selling days in 2021 compared to 2019 and one less when comparing to 2020. Consistent with the pricing environment experienced in both 2019 and 2020, we would expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1%. Additionally, as we are comparing growth to 2019, our 2021 organic sales growth guidance includes two years of price reductions. The foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be modestly favorably impacted as compared to 2020 and 2019. For the full year 2021, we did not expect to deliver operating margin expansion as a result of the op margin dilution of the Wright Medical acquisition. However, excluding the dilutive impact from Wright, we do anticipate expansion of 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2021 for our legacy Stryker business compared to 2019. This includes anticipated increases in hiring, discretionary expenses and other costs that support future growth and business expansion as our businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels. Finally, for 2021, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $8.80 to $9.20 for the full year. This includes the previously announced $0.10 dilution, driven by the addition of the Wright Medical business for the full year. While Wright Medical is dilutive in 2021, we expect it to be accretive starting in 2022. As it relates to other aspects of Wright Medical, we expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be in the low to mid single digits in 2021 when compared to 2019. This includes the integration of Stry's legacy extremity business with Wright Medical, which will all be part of our trauma and extremities Division. This growth is impacted by the recovery from COVID-19, partially offset by the synergies from the integration activities in 2021. We also reiterate our previous guidance on cost saving synergies from the deal of approximately $100 million to $125 million over the next three years. And now I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore. You may proceed.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys, congrats on the Q here. –And I guess maybe a high-level start off on the guidance question here. Eight to nine organic for the base business, what are we assuming for Wright Medical here for growth for our fiscal 2021? Hello?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Hi, Vijay. Sorry I was on mute. Our organic guidance is 8% to 10% and the guidance that we provided related to Wright Medical, you have to understand that it's being integrated into our Trauma Extremities businesses. So we will be combining in our legacy extremities business with Wright Medical and running that combined group as part of our Trauma Extremities division. So when you mix all that together and you really look at what will trauma and extremities growth be in 2021 as compared to 2019, we do think it will be low to bit single digits, but keep in mind that also takes into account sales to synergies for Wright Medical that we fully expect will happen in 2021.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And Glenn, maybe if I could, just one quick one on margins off the cash. I mean Q4 was really impressive. The margin on the OpEx side, if I look at the guidance here, perhaps it seems a little conservative, and I look at the EPS guidance range, it's coming in a little bit lighter versus the typical Stryker in the guidance range, if you will. What would cause – I mean, that's almost a 100 basis point swing within the low-end and the high-end, perhaps talk about what goes in at the low-end and the high-end?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, it's - Vijay, I would tell you that based on what happened this year and the variability that we saw in our operations, we fully expect to continue to experience some variability on into Q2. And so our guidance range really reflects how that ramp comes back. On the low-end, it could be all the way through Q2. On the better end, we start to see much more improvement towards the beginning in Q2. And really - it really is going to be variable depending on that. I mean, we have passed our legacy Stryker business on the op margin front with 30 to 50 basis points improvement. But keep in mind if you look at Q4 or if you can even go back and look at Q3, it really reflected pretty draconian expense control in terms of hiring, travel, meetings, consultants, you name it, discretionary expenses and we put the lid on that. So that's not sustainable, especially if you think about our aspirations to grow at the high end of med device, so we will start seeing that spending pick up as we continue to supplement and hire our sales forces, as we meet with customers, as we add to our prototypes and loaner pools, all those things will start to add to our expenses. So that's really what's underlying the guidance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nBob Hopkins: Thanks and good afternoon. So just two quick things. Glenn, just to clarify that guidance on the revenue side, I appreciate that you're guiding to organic growth, but sounds like Wright Medical was flat in the quarter, which is actually pretty impressive. So, I come out a little bit over $17 billion for the year, just based on kind of your guidance of 8% to 10% organic, and then I'm just tacking on $900 million to $1 billion for Wright Medical, and getting to a little over $17 billion. So I was wondering, if you thought that was in the ballpark.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, Bob, again, I just can't reiterate the variability that we're seeing and so maybe that's sort of adding up the obvious set of numbers, if you will. I think we took the range 8% to 10% because we do feel like there is going to be some variability that we can't exactly forecast at this point in time and where we're sitting in Q1 and what we're seeing. As far as Wright Medical goes, we were pretty pleased with where their Q4 performance came out, but they are also subject to a lot of the same variability, which is why, we're looking that once we integrate it with trauma and extremities, we will have some sales, the synergies that just naturally occur. We felt that with K2 and Spine and we will fill that with Wright Medical. So taking into account that variability, you're really looking at 8% to 10% for the - for Stryker legacy and low to mid single digits as we look at the combined Wright and Trauma & Extremities.\nBob Hopkins: Okay, fair enough. And then, Kevin, just quickly for you, just curious to get your kind of macro perspective on what you're seeing out there as far as the current state of the business right now, hospitals willingness to buy capital, kind of where we are in terms of procedure growth, just would love an updates given the environment so volatile on what you're seeing right now. I think that would be helpful? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Bob, I would say, certainly at the end of the year, really did, we got that second wave spiking and certainly you saw that in the discretionary procedures, a pretty big slowdown after a pretty good month of October, and it really start to tail off November-December. On the large capital front, we're actually very excited. So what we experienced through Q2, Q3 and Q4 from an order book standpoint is continuing to be very strong. So that is really good news, it's good news for Mako, it's good news for Medical. On the small capital side, we've always said that that tends to lag a little bit, that the recovery in discretionary procedures and you certainly saw that within certainly the endoscopy division and the instruments division, where I would say that those orders are maybe going to take a little longer to really come back in the same way. But overall, I mean, we have enough confidence now with the hospitals being ready to do these procedures as soon as the pandemic starts to subside, as soon as the vaccines start to become more prevalent. But, they will turn it on pretty quickly and they'll be pretty agile, and that's why we feel pretty confident of being able to give a - I think a healthy guide certainly going back-half off of 2019 around 8% to 10% organic, so we - so it will spike throughout the year starting with a - obviously a slower Q1. And the good news is we have the whole year. So even if the discretionary procedures drag a little bit, we saw in Q3 a pretty big spike once things started getting healthy. So over the course of the year, we're hoping that and believe that the guidance will be - we will be able to sustain even if it's maybe a little softer in Q2 and little stronger maybe in Q3.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nDavid Lewis: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones from me. Kevin, I was sort of comparing the revenue guide, the earnings guidance. The earnings guidance is kind of interesting to me and that it's basically 12% earnings growth, what you guys are doing kind of last couple of years minus Wright Medical. But the revenue growth is a little higher, right? The 8% to 10% over 2019 is a little better than the earnings growth guidance. So it's above your structural growth rate, but I think some would argue probably should be just given a lot of the recovery. So how should we interpret that 8% to 10% number, Kevin, relative to the structural growth rate? And what are some of the key factors underpinning that? Or how do you think about the structural growth rate of Stryker here as we come out of October 2019? And I have a quick follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Sure, David. I mean without getting into every single division, what I would just give you as a macro comment is we feel that we have the right offense to continue to win in the market and continue the strong growth. You saw for seven straight years, we accelerated our organic growth. In 2019, we culminated with over 8% organic growth and I think that muscle that we developed, the structure that we have in our business units, the new product pipeline that we have, has positioned us to be an above-market grower and we expect, fully expect that, that will continue into 2021. There are obviously differences by divisions, but we feel like we're in a very healthy position overall. And that's what gives us confidence in the guide. Clearly, Wright Medical is a big acquisition. There are dis-synergies that we've assumed there. It was highly dilutive to the normal operation of our business. We'll see how that unfolds over the course of the year. The early signs of the integration are very positive, but we have put in some improvements there just based on what we've experienced with our K2M acquisition and what, frankly, all other implant companies have experienced with their integration.\nDavid Lewis: And then just lastly just on Ortho competitiveness. Kevin, I know the environment is very, very invisible. All we have is sort of one competitor results to go after here. Any reason to believe that your momentum has changed at all? I mean your robotic system placements are very strong and you kind of went from 30% knees and cementless, robotic to 40% pretty, pretty darn quickly during COVID. But any reason to believe that your relative positioning or relative share momentum versus other peers in '21 is going to look a lot different?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. No, we remain very bullish about our joint replacement business as well as Mako. And you saw just the increase in Mako is pretty remarkable. To have almost one out of two knees being done on Mako and it's not been that many years since we launched the system. So unlike navigation in the past, which obviously never had this type of an uptick, we continue to have strong, not only installations of robots, but utilization. And even hips, we're seeing that continue to increase as well and the new hip software was installed in about 400 accounts in Q4. So, we had the approval, obviously, earlier in the year but because of the pandemic, it's taken us time to actually be able to go and do the upgrades. But that will pick up steam again into 2021. So again, looking at one quarter, whether it's a positive or negative in a pandemic world, it's not something I am too concerned about it. It's just based on where your regional strength is. If you happen to be in a state or a locality that's doing procedures, then you got benefit and if you didn't do, that hurts. So it's a little bit random during the pandemic, but structurally, I think we're in great shape with that business.\nOperator: You next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nShagun Singh: Thank you so much. This is Shagun in for Larry. Yes, I wanted to touch on the acquisition of OrthoSensor. Kevin, the acquisition really marks your entry into the sensor technology, remote patient monitoring and smart implant space in a much more meaningful way. And I was wondering if you could comment on the timing here. Why now, given that you've had a relationship with them for several years with soft tissue balancing? And then how are you thinking about timelines for integration and launch with Mako? And then also the launch of smart implants, any timing you could share? And also if I could squeeze in one more. How are you thinking about the application of sensor technology beyond knees into shoulders and hips? Anything on timing would be great. Thank you.\nPreston Wells: Yes. Shagun, this is Preston. Just in terms of the timing of the deal itself, I mean, again, we are constantly looking at different opportunities and it was just the right time with the team to make this acquisition in terms of what we thought we were able to do with it. So, I think just the timing of it just happened to work out the way that it did. And we typically do look at our targets for a long period of time. In terms of other timelines about when we're going to be bringing some of the different things to market, at this point, we're not ready to disclose those timelines. Just know that the teams are getting to work, to develop pretty robust time - excuse me, robust pipeline around that sensor technology. And as we have more information, we'll certainly be bringing that to you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. You may proceed\nRobert Marcus: Kevin, I was hoping you could comment on, as you're thinking about later this year and into next year, there were lot of patients that didn't end up getting procedures in 2020 and probably the first half of 2021. How should we think about the potential for a bolus of patients? I realized there is limitations to what the system can do, but there is still lot of patients that need to be treated. So how are you thinking about that as an organization?\nPreston Wells: Robbie, it's Preston. I'll take that one. In terms of that patient backlog, certainly, we saw some of that being worked down in the third quarter as we saw the recovery starting to happen. And certainly then, we saw more deferrals happening in the fourth quarter. You saw more people being added back to that backlog. As Kevin and Glenn both articulated, as we see the recovery happening in 2021, we would expect to see some of that recovery include the backlog of patients that have been deferring now anywhere from three months to six months or so. And so we would expect to see some of that flowing back into the numbers through 2021. I think the one caveat I would give you is we won't necessarily see a dramatic spike in those numbers, just given certain aspects around capacity and things like that. So, you will still see surgeons and hospitals working to fit additional surgeries in and same things that we saw in the third quarter. But you certainly won't see a significant dramatic spike at any one point in time as a result of backlog.\nRobert Marcus: Great. And maybe just one more question on Neurovascular. I remember in 2019, back in the old days before COVID, you were hoping to at least accelerate that business in 2020. You had some new product launches. I was hoping you could just give us the update on where you're going to have new product launches in 2021 and how you're thinking about that business? Thanks.\nPreston Wells: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. First of all, Neurovascular had a really terrific year. They had double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. They were obviously just like everybody else affected in the second quarter and into the third quarter, but double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, extremely exciting portfolio of products, new product introductions. Obviously with Aspiration, we have the Vecta 74 catheter out. We have the pump. They're doing very well. Then we have this flow diverting stent, the second-generation flow diverting stent approved in the United States, the Surpass Evolve. We have the first-generation flow diverting stent approved in China, our Atlas stent, which is used in hemorrhagic segment. Our adjunctive stent is doing extremely well in China. So, we really have a great portfolio. And we have the NXT, the next generation stent retriever as well recently launched. So, a lot of new launches. This management team is truly outstanding. They've been in place since, frankly, we acquired the business. They have a very healthy pipeline of other products coming as well. So, I'm very, very bullish on the Neurovascular business. We ended the year with great momentum, and I expect we'll continue to be a very strong performer in the years to come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. And may proceed.\nPito Chickering: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you taking my questions. One quick guidance question for you. And I - understanding, you are not providing quarterly guidance at this time, but normally, you get about 23% of annual EPS in the first quarter. And because you are still seeing pressures in deferrable procedures in January. Is there any chance that some part that you can give us some cadence on the first quarter earnings versus your normal run rate?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Pito, I would just tell you - and this is - we're not in a normal run rate period, right? I mean, I think we're still coming out of some pretty variable trends that we saw in the fourth quarter and continuing certainly into the first quarter. A lot of it's going to depend on the localized hospitalization infection rates and really how those decline over time and how the vaccine is out there and more prevalent. So, I think that's what I will continue to look at, as we think about what that recovery - that recovery trend is going to be. At this point, it would be too hard really to give you too much guide on how that's going to exactly happen. And that's why you see the wider guidance that we provided.\nPito Chickering: And also, for follow-up, as more procedures are moving into the ASCs due to COVID to free up our space and capacity in the systems, have you seen hospitals change their purchasing habits to buy either cheaper - begin plans or push back on pricing or to adapt to the lower reimbursements in the ASCs.\nKevin Lobo: Yes not at this time, we have not seen any significant changes in that - in those habits at all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. You may proceed.\nMatt Hendrickson: This is Matt Hendrickson in for Joanne. First question we have is just around Mako and robotic knee systems, you guys had a great quarter, great momentum in the New Year. But J&J is coming out with their Velys robot. They received FDA approval, and also, Zimmer is kind of in full swing their launch. So just kind of putting the two together. Is there any change in your commercial plans as you've now have more technology out in the market?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So, this is Kevin. I'll take that. First thing, I would tell you is the introduction of competitive systems has not slowed down our Mako momentum whatsoever and we don't expect that to change with one more system on the market. If anything, it's just proves to further validate that robotics is here to stay in orthopedics. And we really believe, we have the best solution on the market as evidenced by the uptick in the procedures and we disclosed the fourth quarter, almost two knees in the United States being used with Mako. So surgeons absolutely love our system and are using it at very, very high rates. There also is a synergy with the way that our system ensures an absolutely perfect cut. And with HaptX, which we're the only ones to have but that is very complementary with cementless and you see both of those adoption rates moving in the same direction. So we love our chances of competing side by side with anybody and we think this provides a further tailwind in the adoption of robotics in orthopedics.\nMatt Hendrickson: Good color, thanks for that. And then for follow up, just going to the Wright Medical acquisition. Before they were acquired, they had always talked about their enabling technology, their preoperative planning software being kind of their main driver to capture share and to expand the market. Has that strategy changed at all? Now that you are beginning to integrate with them, are you going to continue kind of with that strategy of focusing with enabling technology first and. Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, what I would tell you is that certainly, we've always been believers of enabling technologies as evidenced by some of the different businesses that we've acquired with some of the different products that we've launched, and really with a focus on improving patient outcomes. And we believe that a lot of the technologies, including the blueprint technology that Wright had previously invested in are complementary really to some of the platforms that we have. And as part of the integration with the right organization, the R&D portfolio and technology teams, they are all working together really to build out what those long-term pipeline plans are going to be and really leveraging all of the different unique products and capabilities from both sides. So, we will continue to see investments in those areas.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with Truist. You may proceed.\nKaila Krum: Thanks for taking our questions. So, I appreciate the guidance that you gave for 2021. Can you just speak to how you think each segment of the business will grow relative to the total organic range you provided? And I guess, I'm most curious just looking at MedSurg and Orthopedics. I know you are assuming some of medical, the demand slows down in the coming quarters and that backlog picks up in ortho. And just any more detail on that would be super helpful.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Kaila, we don't typically provide any of that segment breakdown in terms of our guide, but I think if you just take a look at - that looks we are expecting to happen in the marketplace and what's really been happening through 2020 and as we go in - into 2021, certainly those businesses that we have that are affected are more affected by elective procedures should see the benefit of elective procedures returning throughout the year. The other thing I would just say, as Kevin had mentioned to our smaller capital products are really those products that are facilitating many of those elective procedures should also see some of that benefit. And then as it pertains to really the large capital segment, we've continued to see strong demand in those areas and would expect to continue to see some of that demand throughout '21 as well.\nKaila Krum: And then just a follow-up I guess to Peter's question earlier, is it fair to say that I mean, Q1 will be sort of the softest of the year, Q2 will have the higher growth kind of off an easier comp and the second part of this year should feel a little bit more normal?\nKevin Lobo: I think, it's certainly fair to say that the variability that we experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect that to continue into the first quarter and then we should see benefits happening as we progress throughout the remainder of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.\nSteven Lichtman: So first, I was wondering if you could provide some additional color around the ASC sales model that you're rolling out. Any details you could provide on what the model looks like and any early feedback from the field would be great?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So, I'm not going to get into too much detail just for competitive reasons, but I would say that I'm delighted with the ASC offense that we put in place. It involves people from different parts of Stryker that basically quarter backed the deal and bring in multiple divisions based on the unique needs of every ASC. Every ASC is unique. Every deal is a customized deal but the way we've navigated this enables incredible collaboration across our divisions. We've put just absolutely fantastic people in charge and really we have the breadth of our portfolio with capital equipment, disposables and implants and really for the first time as a company, we're really leveraging that in the United States. We have had success with such model sometimes in other countries around the world. But in the U.S., this ASC model has been truly fantastic, exceeded my expectations. And I'm bullish that they'll be able to continue to have great success in the ASCs and frankly, Mako is often part of that formula in the ASC, but not always. We obviously had a presence in performance sports, but that business, fortunately, has really started to grow as you even heard in the fourth quarter in spite of the pandemic, it grew over 9% and so having a strong sports business plus all of our other businesses and now with the Wright having extremities, category-leading position, we just have a fantastic portfolio to serve the needs of the ASC, and now a commercial offense again not getting too specific, but let's just say, we make it easy for the ASC and we provide customized solutions.\nSteven Lichtman: Thanks, Kevin. And then just a follow-up on the fourth quarter, how did your spine franchise specifically hold up during the recent spike in COVID cases and any thoughts on that? This is overall looking into 2021. Thanks.\nPreston Wells: Yes, I would say that the spine business held up a little bit better. We saw spine procedures in general holding up a little better than some of the other elective procedures, particularly for our spine business outside the United States performed well. And I think it's just a function of the successful integration that we've had with the K2M business and combining that with some of the enabling technologies like those that we acquired through Mobius. And again, we saw some continued performance in some of the markets outside the U.S. that had more stability in spine related procedures like Japan and Canada as well. So I think, all-in-all, it held up a little bit better. We definitely expect that business to continue to perform well, as we go into 2021 and really harnessing the power across K2M, our legacy spine business as well as the enabling technology.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS. You may proceed.\nMatt Taylor: Thank you for taking the question. So I thought the disclosures on Mako were really interesting and bullish and just had two follow-ups on that. One is where do you think you can push Mako penetration and cementless penetration in the U.S. over time, and would love to hear your thoughts O U.S. both on that question and just on the opportunity, again, you just had all these approvals in new geographies?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks. So certainly, I'm delighted with the progress, both with the Mako adoption as well as Mettler's. I don't think Mettlers will ever get to where it is with hips, just because of bone stability. It's a weight bearing joint, but clearly, we can now see, it's going to be significantly higher than 50%, which I think five years ago nobody would have believed if we had said that. So that's pretty remarkable. In terms of the actual use of Mako, as you saw, we have a lot of robots installed this year. So I would expect that that looking at the percentage of having these done with Mako will continue to increase, same with hips. Outside the United States, it's going to - it's taking a little longer obviously because of the approvals, but we're really excited about getting the total knee approved in China, Brazil and Russia and certainly Japan and China are going to be very, very good markets for us. Japan, we've made some progress already. Maybe the approvals took a little longer there as well. But the new hip software, of course, is also very important. As you know, there's a lot more hip procedures done in that part of the world. It's almost not the same as knees unlike the United States. So, we love the fact that we have multiple applications, all approved in those markets and we would expect you're going to see a similar kind of growth that you saw in the United States. They may not be quite as quick. You've seen that, frankly, with Intuitive in soft tissue robotics. The uptake is a little slower outside the United States, but we expect the same kind of runway longer term and are very bullish about the prospects, especially in China, Japan, Brazil, for sure, are going to be terrific markets for Mako.\nMatt Taylor: Maybe just a quick follow-up on that. With Wright in the house now, could you give us updated thoughts on some timing on the robotic solution for shoulders and for spine?\nKevin Lobo: We're not really ready to give timeline yet. We have to get a lot closer to launch before we're going to be specific about timelines. I would say that I'm extremely bullish about shoulder. I think I've said that in the past. It's a very difficult procedure to do. That our enabling technologies have been right, that were - our teams are working on with our Mako teams. And we'd be very excited to be able to bring that to the market with their market-leading implants. But I'm not yet ready for timelines and same with spine. Not yet ready for timelines. We have two options for spine. One is the robotic program that was being developed by Mobius prior to the acquisition as well as Mako. So, we have work done in both areas. But I'm just not ready to give timelines. Robotics is complicated. And we will keep you posted.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. You may proceed.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thanks for taking the questions. Just first for me. Kevin, around the capital equipment demand, I was just wondering if you can talk about kind of the dynamics in play in 2021. You've been very strong with that and you haven't talked much about maybe booms and lights. And so, is this a story of kind of the first half, second half and how to think about that composition of capital equipment moving from the first half to the second half and what that may entail in terms of your portfolio?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So, booms and lights certainly hasn't been as positive as Mako and the beds and stretchers. And certainly, the defibrillators because the medical capital really did - had to ride a bit of a pandemic tailwind, if you will. And booms and lights large construction sort of slowed down a little bit. That should pick up starting next year. And that's part of the drag that you see within the Endoscopy division with the booms and lights portion. But certainly in ASCs, they're busy, but certainly the large capital spend projects were delayed a little bit. They are starting to pick back up again. So, that's obviously a smaller business within the overall Stryker. But Medical, we continue to feel bullish. So, we did get a bit of a pandemic benefit, but this new bed that we launched is really a fantastic product, getting great customer feedback. Sage has also picked up. So, that was really hit hard in the second quarter, third quarter, had a nice pickup in Q4 and that business will presume its high growth as the pandemic subsides. So the diversity of our portfolio is really that gives us the optimism that we're going to continue to see strong growth in Medical. And it wasn't just sort of a pandemic bump and then will suddenly drop because of the innovation in our portfolio and frankly, just really, really strong commercial execution.\nRyan Zimmerman: And then just a follow-up from me. Another business that doesn't get a lot of attention is sustainability. And I'm just wondering if there's been any change in practice due to COVID and demand for that business and kind of that - the whole reprocessing market itself with hospitals. And how to think about that over time as we potentially normalize and the strength of what that can or can't do? And again, I'm appreciating that it's small.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. No, I would just say that it's - those products are used in discretionary elective procedures. So, they were directly hit in the same way that you saw our other deferrable procedures being hit. And so because of the nature of those products, as the pandemic subsides that growth will pick up. So, there's nothing more to read into than that. Our hospital behaviors didn't really change either positively or negatively. If you can do the procedures, they will use the products. If those procedures were sort of shut down, then those products weren't being used and then they weren't being purchased. So, I would expect it to follow a similar pattern just based on other elective procedures\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nAndrew Stafford: This is Drew on for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to start off briefly on Wright. Maybe you guys could help us by comparing and contrasting the Wright integration process to the one you went through with K2. What stage of the process have you already completed so far, considering the longer deal closed timeline? And then, I guess really what I'm trying to get at is, about a year into the K2 process, you're ran into a couple of additional challenges. Do you feel you have a good start with that for Wright, and what gives you confidence and the contribution you baked into guidance?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So certainly, as I think about those two acquisitions, there are some similarities and then there are some pretty big differences. The similarities maybe in the foot and ankle side, where there is more of a true integration that's happening between the Stryker business and the Wright business. But for the upper extremity side, it's much more of just bringing them into Stryker and continuing on with the growth that they've had. So it is a little bit different from that perspective, as we think about bringing on the acquisition of Wright versus K2. Just like with any and all of our previous acquisitions and we've learned along the way and leave those learnings as we plan for additional or new acquisitions that are coming, the same was true with Wright. And so we utilized really that year long period between sign and close to ensure that we're focused on getting the correct integration plans in place so that we can hit the ground running. And today, that's what the team has done. They have executed to the plan. And as I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've really done a lot of focus on ensuring that the sales organization are being integrated in a timely fashion. And so that's where we are at this point and certainly, we will continue to provide some updates as we continue with the integration throughout the year.\nAndrew Stafford: And then, I appreciate the commentary on Mako and ASCs. It sounds like your placement mix continued to shift a little bit today, ASC here in Q4. So, I guess the question is, as we look out a year and of course, COVID environment, do you see the interest from ASCs tapering down any? Or do you think it continues ramping over the long term? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I think the trend of the ASC is, it was already accelerating prior to the pandemic. It's going to continue without a doubt, especially for hip and knee procedures, foot and ankle procedures, even some of the spine procedures. So, I think this is a permanent trend. It will continue. And obviously, now we have reimbursement coverage for hips as well as knees through Medicare. So, this is a trend for the future. And I actually think it's not going to stop in the United States. There is already countries like the UK and even Canada are looking at moving to lower cost sites of care. It's a good thing for health care overall. And these surgery centers make good money. They're very profitable. They don't have the burden of the cost of a large inpatient hospital. So, you can debate with the actual pace of the curve, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is a - it's a trend that's going to continue to accelerate.\nKevin Lobo: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. You may proceed.\nRichard Newitter: A couple of quick ones on OrthoSensor and then a follow-up. On OrthoSensor, can you just remind us what you plan on doing with the intraoperative, the Verasense capability? I know that some of your competitors currently use that, use that system. Are you going to continue to sell that as an open architecture? And then - and then second on OrthoSensor is just - excuse me, should we think of when you do offer your first iteration of a product there, whether it's a wearable, external or whatever it looks like, is that going to be something that you'll charge separately for? Or do you think you will package it in with the procedure?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks for the question. So on OrthoSensor, obviously, it's new under the belt here a few weeks. And so it's not something that we have fully developed all the various plans in terms of how we are going to market for any of the product at this point in time. And so as that happens, we'll certainly be able to come back and give you updates with regards to how we're going to market and what the impacts might be in terms of what the legacy business was and what we expect it to be in the future. And I think the same holds true as we think about the future product launches, as well as I mentioned before, we haven't defined all those timelines yet. And so all of the items that you bring up in terms of how it will commercialize, how it will be sold, et cetera, will all be developed and done at that point.\nRichard Newitter: And if I could just one more on the M&A front. Congrats on getting Wright Medical finally over the finish line there. I guess, should we think of you as very much out in the market, size of deals, everything fair game and back to kind of normal Stryker M&A, not just small tuck-ins, or maybe anything you would if you care to comment on or share with respect to your view of the M&A outlook? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Sure. I think obviously we took on additional debt when we did the Wright Medical acquisition. We've also made commitments to reduce our debt over the next few years and so that will be something that's ongoing. And you'll see that in our financial performance. But because M&A is so important to our growth strategy and keep in mind that our normal M&A strategy is really just smaller tuck-in deals. It's what we do well, it's what we do best, and we can execute those quickly. So I think just like with OrthoSensor, you will see us continuing with smaller tuck-in acquisitions like we normally do through the year, and I don't anticipate that you'll see a - sort of a big acquisition of the size of Wright Medical for a couple of years. And frankly, if you think back to even when we did Sage, and when we did Physio, those were two very large acquisitions. We moved into a strategy for a year or two, just doing tuck-ins, which served us very well. And so I think, it will play out very similar to that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Matson with Needham & Company. You may proceed.\nMike Matson: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, I wanted to ask about the ProCuity bed launch, maybe you can give us an update on where things stand with that. And I was wondering, if you could give us an overview of the kind of smart bed capabilities that you're planning to that platform?\nKevin Lobo: Sure. So that is out in the market in a limited way in the fourth quarter, and really rolling out for a full launch as we think about the first quarter of 2021. In terms of the features and benefits, really it's a - three things I would probably point out to here, I think one, just advanced fall prevention really focusing on keeping patient safe, as well as we think about low height feature. I think the bed drops down to about 11 inches off the floor. And then also, it's - the first bed that's really truly wireless. And so really all of those items trying to meet some unmet needs in the marketplace to drive benefits in the bed market.\nMike Matson: And then, I know you're not giving specific guidance for the margins for 2021, but just given there's several moving parts, specifically with gross margin, you've got rate, which I think is coming in at a higher gross margin, but then you had some fixed cost absorption issues in 2020 that could spill into 2021. Can you give us any kind of insight into where you expect the gross margin to end up and kind of the sequence of that throughout the year?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Actually, I think you did a pretty good job of summarizing it. Wright will definitely come in and be accretive to our gross margin, as those products generally have a higher gross margin than sort of the average of our other business. I also think to - as you look at business mix that will normalize as the year goes forward and so we will also see kind of those higher margin orthopaedics products becoming a bigger share of the total. And I think, we will largely come back to sort of what our view is sort of normalized margins, as you look at 2019. Conversely though. Just as a reminder, moving down to op margin, you are going to see that discretionary spending pick up as we support growth. And so that will likely go the other way, and will be on a ramp largely as sales ramp throughout the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. You may proceed.\nEric Anderson: This is Eric over Josh. Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the 4Q performance and hips for a minute, this is a procedure category that we had been thinking, perhaps, would be a little more resilient to any pandemic headwinds in the quarter. I was just wondering, if you could share your thoughts on that business, particularly in the U.S., excuse me. And just help us understand what's behind that result. Thank you.\nPreston Wells: Yes. So I think Kevin outlined it pretty well before. I think overall, just looking at one quarter in the midst of a pandemic is tough to do because of the variability and really the localized impacts that we were seeing from a elective procedure standpoint. So certainly, you would expect that that hips, might be a little less deferrable than knees just given the nature of the disease and the degeneration. But at the same time, elective procedures depending on where you are in the world were being stopped and so hips were not immune to that, like some of our other elective procedures. As we look forward, certainly with the rollout of all of the installations to Mako that we've done this year, as well as our new hip software, we're really expecting continued above market growth from our hips and knees as we move forward.\nEric Anderson: Understood. Thank you. And then quickly, I was wondering if you're able to share what percent of the Wright business is levered to outpatient procedures?\nPreston Wells: No, that's not something that we're sharing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. You may proceed.\nJeff Johnson: Most of my questions have been answered, but I guess just one last one, just it sounds like China and Latin America held in better in the fourth quarter, have you seen any change in that trend line over the last few weeks or as we've gone into 1Q here just are those continuing to hold in better than some of the European and U.S. markets or anything we should be thinking about even in those markets early in the year? Thanks.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, I would tell you, we haven't seen any significant trend shifts heading - making that transition from fourth quarter into first quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Your line is open.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. I just had two questions. One, Kevin, you mentioned sports being a pocket of strength. Just wondering if you could flesh that out for us. Really, what's driving that as the new products that we should be focused on. And then secondarily, you talked a lot about building a connected ecosystem of implants enabling technologies. I think we understand the opportunity with Mako pretty well. You clearly got OrthoSensor, that's going to flow in. But maybe just help us understand what that means for the company longer term, does it bring you close to your customers and prevent share loss or competitive loss. Are there new revenue streams that come in? Just from a big picture perspective, how should we be thinking about that over the next several years?\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Sure. So I'll start with the second part, this, the world is obviously going more and more digital. We have a Stryker health cloud. There's all types of data that we're collecting from Mako that we want to be able to mine that data with thousands and thousands of procedures already being done. And really connect that with sensors. So we really see this as not just limited to joint replacement. It's going to be across all of our businesses whether it's trauma, whether it's cranial maxillofacial, sports. And so this is something we're really excited about and we named Robert Cohen, the head of that business on behalf of all of Stryker. And so we already had initiatives going on in different parts of the company, and we are sort of bringing it all together to really create more leverage and really be able to have centers of excellence around different types of technology blocks. And so to us, it's extremely exciting. Robert knows the company very, very well. It's - I think many of you know, Robert, very well positioned to lead this function for the company. And sorry, can you go - repeat the first question, again. I'm sorry with that. I didn't catch them.\nKyle Rose: Yes, just about the strength that you saw in the sports medicine - around them maybe just--\nKevin Lobo: Sports, yes, so sport has been just a fabulous story for Stryker. But when I joined the company almost 10 years ago, our sports medicine implant business was really tiny. Most people didn't even know we had a sports medicine implant business, and we have grown it pretty dramatically since then, primarily through internal innovation. But we've also done a series of very small acquisitions, and one of them was Pivot, you may recall for hip arthroscopy. More recently, we launched a lateral row anchor for shoulder which has been, we call it Omega product name, which is a fantastic product. We picked up, throughout the year, we picked up another product as well which - these are all key fundamental products, whether it's in knee, whether it's in hip or whether it's in shoulder. So we - now we have all three of the joints very well covered in sports, and we are just growing at again very, very robust rate. And the timing couldn't be better with the shift to the surgery center and being able to use sports combined with our other divisions. Again, we really ported on in the last few years in sports, because of lot of investment internally that we've done. And we have a fabulous year. That business is run out of Denver and we're really excited about the progress we've made in sports.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks so much for taking the questions. I think just one on shoulder and what I think one on, just a follow up on some of your comments on market share trend. So wondering, if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on the overlap of rates surgeon customers in shoulder with sort of your traditional end markets, and you know what, if any opportunity there is there for sort of cross selling or going through relationships that sort of thing. And then as I mentioned, just one quick follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. So clearly, Wright Medical had a much bigger shoulder business than Stryker. And a lot of the Stryker business frankly where with the hip and knee surgeons, but also did some volume of shoulder. And the teams are obviously working on that through the sales deployment, working out which surgeons are going to be allocated to which sales people. They made great progress on that front. And cross-selling opportunities will exist. But as Preston mentioned before, this integration is not going to be as tricky as the integration on foot and ankle, just given that we tended to - they tended to be strong with a, I'll call it, fully dedicated upper extremity surgeons. And we tended to be stronger with those surgeons that did a smaller number just as a general statement. So, I think this integration is going to be terrific. We were really thrilled that we'll have the leader from Wright Medical take over the combined business of upper extremities. And their Head of Sales is also running the combined sales organization and they're both outstanding leaders. And we are delighted not only to bring the business and the products of Wright Medical, but being able to bring over some of their key leadership. Even the leader of our combined foot and ankle business came from Wright Medical. So not only are we bringing over great technologies, we're also bringing over great talent with that acquisition.\nMatt Miksic: And then just a follow-up on sort of market trends. I think you mentioned here just in Q&A that you expect to continue to grow above the market in joints or Orthopaedics or knees, if I heard correctly. I'm just wondering for clarity, looking back on Q4, understanding lot going on and regional differences, et cetera, but is your expectation that your numbers there also represent sort of above end market procedure growth? Or is it just - or is it just too hard to talk about that, given the variability?\nKevin Lobo: Matt, I would just tell you, at this point, it's very difficult to really talk about just given the variability and it's not dissimilar to what we've seen really in second and third quarter as well in terms of how the surgeries are being deferred and where they are being deferred and how they're coming back. So, I think that really is difficult to use one quarter and certainly difficult in the midst of this pandemic to use one quarter. So I think, as we look at it, we're looking at, as we get to those normalized rates and knowing what we've done from a Mako, implement a Mako placement and install standpoint, that we have a lot of runway to go in terms of growing markets in knees.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: So, thank you all for joining our call. Like you, I'm very, very pleased to have 2020 behind us. And looking forward to a strong year in 2021. We have to get through, obviously, the remainder of this pandemic. But as you saw from our guide, we are feeling very confident about the future. And we look forward to sharing our Q1 results with you in April. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

I would like to start my comments by expressing my appreciation for the perseverance shown by our employees, as they work through the many challenges that we faced during 2020. Throughout the year, we maintained high employee engagement, while continuing to support surgeons and caregivers around the world. Our fourth quarter organic sales declined roughly 1%, reflecting the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, offset by continuation of emergent procedures and strong performance by our large capital products. We are also excited about closing the Wright Medical deal during the quarter and the category leadership that we gain in the fastest-growing segment within the orthopedics market. Preston will provide some additional updates on the integration shortly. Throughout the quarter, we maintained the financial discipline instituted at the beginning of the pandemic, which, combined with a favorable tax rate, led to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.81 in the quarter, up approximately 13% versus 2019. And we delivered impressive cash flow from operations, which exceeded $3 billion for the full-year. In addition to closing the Wright Medical acquisition, we also made progress in many areas that will provide future growth opportunities. We have established a structure focused on digital, robotics and enabling technology, where we see significant opportunity to create a company-wide unified digital ecosystem, including Mako. We maintained our commitment to drive innovation across our various business units, including Neurovascular, where we gained new product approvals across aspiration, stent retrievers and flow diverting stents. And in our MedSurg segment, where we continued product introductions with a focus on safety and prevention. Finally, we successfully launched our ASC sales model, which leverages the Stryker portfolio to provide end-to-end solutions to meet the growing demand and shifts to the outpatient setting. Our continued support for our customers and our commitment to innovation will position us well for growth as the pandemic eventually subsides. Turning to 2021, our people and culture of execution remain strong, which will allow us to deliver on our commitment to make healthcare better and to resume our customary strong organic sales growth and leverage earnings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Preston. Yes. Thanks, Bob, I would say, certainly at the end of the year, really did, we got that second wave spiking and certainly you saw that in the discretionary procedures, a pretty big slowdown after a pretty good month of October, and it really start to tail off November-December. On the large capital front, we're actually very excited. So what we experienced through Q2, Q3 and Q4 from an order book standpoint is continuing to be very strong. So that is really good news, it's good news for Mako, it's good news for Medical. On the small capital side, we've always said that that tends to lag a little bit, that the recovery in discretionary procedures and you certainly saw that within certainly the endoscopy division and the instruments division, where I would say that those orders are maybe going to take a little longer to really come back in the same way. But overall, I mean, we have enough confidence now with the hospitals being ready to do these procedures as soon as the pandemic starts to subside, as soon as the vaccines start to become more prevalent. But, they will turn it on pretty quickly and they'll be pretty agile, and that's why we feel pretty confident of being able to give a - I think a healthy guide certainly going back-half off of 2019 around 8% to 10% organic, so we - so it will spike throughout the year starting with a - obviously a slower Q1. And the good news is we have the whole year. So even if the discretionary procedures drag a little bit, we saw in Q3 a pretty big spike once things started getting healthy. So over the course of the year, we're hoping that and believe that the guidance will be - we will be able to sustain even if it's maybe a little softer in Q2 and little stronger maybe in Q3. Sure, David. I mean without getting into every single division, what I would just give you as a macro comment is we feel that we have the right offense to continue to win in the market and continue the strong growth. You saw for seven straight years, we accelerated our organic growth. In 2019, we culminated with over 8% organic growth and I think that muscle that we developed, the structure that we have in our business units, the new product pipeline that we have, has positioned us to be an above-market grower and we expect, fully expect that, that will continue into 2021. There are obviously differences by divisions, but we feel like we're in a very healthy position overall. And that's what gives us confidence in the guide. Clearly, Wright Medical is a big acquisition. There are dis-synergies that we've assumed there. It was highly dilutive to the normal operation of our business. We'll see how that unfolds over the course of the year. The early signs of the integration are very positive, but we have put in some improvements there just based on what we've experienced with our K2M acquisition and what, frankly, all other implant companies have experienced with their integration. Yes. No, we remain very bullish about our joint replacement business as well as Mako. And you saw just the increase in Mako is pretty remarkable. To have almost one out of two knees being done on Mako and it's not been that many years since we launched the system. So unlike navigation in the past, which obviously never had this type of an uptick, we continue to have strong, not only installations of robots, but utilization. And even hips, we're seeing that continue to increase as well and the new hip software was installed in about 400 accounts in Q4. So, we had the approval, obviously, earlier in the year but because of the pandemic, it's taken us time to actually be able to go and do the upgrades. But that will pick up steam again into 2021. So again, looking at one quarter, whether it's a positive or negative in a pandemic world, it's not something I am too concerned about it. It's just based on where your regional strength is. If you happen to be in a state or a locality that's doing procedures, then you got benefit and if you didn't do, that hurts. So it's a little bit random during the pandemic, but structurally, I think we're in great shape with that business. Yes. Pito, I would just tell you - and this is - we're not in a normal run rate period, right? I mean, I think we're still coming out of some pretty variable trends that we saw in the fourth quarter and continuing certainly into the first quarter. A lot of it's going to depend on the localized hospitalization infection rates and really how those decline over time and how the vaccine is out there and more prevalent. So, I think that's what I will continue to look at, as we think about what that recovery - that recovery trend is going to be. At this point, it would be too hard really to give you too much guide on how that's going to exactly happen. And that's why you see the wider guidance that we provided. Yes not at this time, we have not seen any significant changes in that - in those habits at all. Yes. So, this is Kevin. I'll take that. First thing, I would tell you is the introduction of competitive systems has not slowed down our Mako momentum whatsoever and we don't expect that to change with one more system on the market. If anything, it's just proves to further validate that robotics is here to stay in orthopedics. And we really believe, we have the best solution on the market as evidenced by the uptick in the procedures and we disclosed the fourth quarter, almost two knees in the United States being used with Mako. So surgeons absolutely love our system and are using it at very, very high rates. There also is a synergy with the way that our system ensures an absolutely perfect cut. And with HaptX, which we're the only ones to have but that is very complementary with cementless and you see both of those adoption rates moving in the same direction. So we love our chances of competing side by side with anybody and we think this provides a further tailwind in the adoption of robotics in orthopedics. Yes, what I would tell you is that certainly, we've always been believers of enabling technologies as evidenced by some of the different businesses that we've acquired with some of the different products that we've launched, and really with a focus on improving patient outcomes. And we believe that a lot of the technologies, including the blueprint technology that Wright had previously invested in are complementary really to some of the platforms that we have. And as part of the integration with the right organization, the R&D portfolio and technology teams, they are all working together really to build out what those long-term pipeline plans are going to be and really leveraging all of the different unique products and capabilities from both sides. So, we will continue to see investments in those areas. Yes. Kaila, we don't typically provide any of that segment breakdown in terms of our guide, but I think if you just take a look at - that looks we are expecting to happen in the marketplace and what's really been happening through 2020 and as we go in - into 2021, certainly those businesses that we have that are affected are more affected by elective procedures should see the benefit of elective procedures returning throughout the year. The other thing I would just say, as Kevin had mentioned to our smaller capital products are really those products that are facilitating many of those elective procedures should also see some of that benefit. And then as it pertains to really the large capital segment, we've continued to see strong demand in those areas and would expect to continue to see some of that demand throughout '21 as well. I think, it's certainly fair to say that the variability that we experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect that to continue into the first quarter and then we should see benefits happening as we progress throughout the remainder of the year. Yes. So, I'm not going to get into too much detail just for competitive reasons, but I would say that I'm delighted with the ASC offense that we put in place. It involves people from different parts of Stryker that basically quarter backed the deal and bring in multiple divisions based on the unique needs of every ASC. Every ASC is unique. Every deal is a customized deal but the way we've navigated this enables incredible collaboration across our divisions. We've put just absolutely fantastic people in charge and really we have the breadth of our portfolio with capital equipment, disposables and implants and really for the first time as a company, we're really leveraging that in the United States. We have had success with such model sometimes in other countries around the world. But in the U.S., this ASC model has been truly fantastic, exceeded my expectations. And I'm bullish that they'll be able to continue to have great success in the ASCs and frankly, Mako is often part of that formula in the ASC, but not always. We obviously had a presence in performance sports, but that business, fortunately, has really started to grow as you even heard in the fourth quarter in spite of the pandemic, it grew over 9% and so having a strong sports business plus all of our other businesses and now with the Wright having extremities, category-leading position, we just have a fantastic portfolio to serve the needs of the ASC, and now a commercial offense again not getting too specific, but let's just say, we make it easy for the ASC and we provide customized solutions. Yes, thanks. So certainly, I'm delighted with the progress, both with the Mako adoption as well as Mettler's. I don't think Mettlers will ever get to where it is with hips, just because of bone stability. It's a weight bearing joint, but clearly, we can now see, it's going to be significantly higher than 50%, which I think five years ago nobody would have believed if we had said that. So that's pretty remarkable. In terms of the actual use of Mako, as you saw, we have a lot of robots installed this year. So I would expect that that looking at the percentage of having these done with Mako will continue to increase, same with hips. Outside the United States, it's going to - it's taking a little longer obviously because of the approvals, but we're really excited about getting the total knee approved in China, Brazil and Russia and certainly Japan and China are going to be very, very good markets for us. Japan, we've made some progress already. Maybe the approvals took a little longer there as well. But the new hip software, of course, is also very important. As you know, there's a lot more hip procedures done in that part of the world. It's almost not the same as knees unlike the United States. So, we love the fact that we have multiple applications, all approved in those markets and we would expect you're going to see a similar kind of growth that you saw in the United States. They may not be quite as quick. You've seen that, frankly, with Intuitive in soft tissue robotics. The uptake is a little slower outside the United States, but we expect the same kind of runway longer term and are very bullish about the prospects, especially in China, Japan, Brazil, for sure, are going to be terrific markets for Mako. We're not really ready to give timeline yet. We have to get a lot closer to launch before we're going to be specific about timelines. I would say that I'm extremely bullish about shoulder. I think I've said that in the past. It's a very difficult procedure to do. That our enabling technologies have been right, that were - our teams are working on with our Mako teams. And we'd be very excited to be able to bring that to the market with their market-leading implants. But I'm not yet ready for timelines and same with spine. Not yet ready for timelines. We have two options for spine. One is the robotic program that was being developed by Mobius prior to the acquisition as well as Mako. So, we have work done in both areas. But I'm just not ready to give timelines. Robotics is complicated. And we will keep you posted. Yes. So, booms and lights certainly hasn't been as positive as Mako and the beds and stretchers. And certainly, the defibrillators because the medical capital really did - had to ride a bit of a pandemic tailwind, if you will. And booms and lights large construction sort of slowed down a little bit. That should pick up starting next year. And that's part of the drag that you see within the Endoscopy division with the booms and lights portion. But certainly in ASCs, they're busy, but certainly the large capital spend projects were delayed a little bit. They are starting to pick back up again. So, that's obviously a smaller business within the overall Stryker. But Medical, we continue to feel bullish. So, we did get a bit of a pandemic benefit, but this new bed that we launched is really a fantastic product, getting great customer feedback. Sage has also picked up. So, that was really hit hard in the second quarter, third quarter, had a nice pickup in Q4 and that business will presume its high growth as the pandemic subsides. So the diversity of our portfolio is really that gives us the optimism that we're going to continue to see strong growth in Medical. And it wasn't just sort of a pandemic bump and then will suddenly drop because of the innovation in our portfolio and frankly, just really, really strong commercial execution. Yes, sure. No, I would just say that it's - those products are used in discretionary elective procedures. So, they were directly hit in the same way that you saw our other deferrable procedures being hit. And so because of the nature of those products, as the pandemic subsides that growth will pick up. So, there's nothing more to read into than that. Our hospital behaviors didn't really change either positively or negatively. If you can do the procedures, they will use the products. If those procedures were sort of shut down, then those products weren't being used and then they weren't being purchased. So, I would expect it to follow a similar pattern just based on other elective procedures Yes. So certainly, as I think about those two acquisitions, there are some similarities and then there are some pretty big differences. The similarities maybe in the foot and ankle side, where there is more of a true integration that's happening between the Stryker business and the Wright business. But for the upper extremity side, it's much more of just bringing them into Stryker and continuing on with the growth that they've had. So it is a little bit different from that perspective, as we think about bringing on the acquisition of Wright versus K2. Just like with any and all of our previous acquisitions and we've learned along the way and leave those learnings as we plan for additional or new acquisitions that are coming, the same was true with Wright. And so we utilized really that year long period between sign and close to ensure that we're focused on getting the correct integration plans in place so that we can hit the ground running. And today, that's what the team has done. They have executed to the plan. And as I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've really done a lot of focus on ensuring that the sales organization are being integrated in a timely fashion. And so that's where we are at this point and certainly, we will continue to provide some updates as we continue with the integration throughout the year. Yes. I think the trend of the ASC is, it was already accelerating prior to the pandemic. It's going to continue without a doubt, especially for hip and knee procedures, foot and ankle procedures, even some of the spine procedures. So, I think this is a permanent trend. It will continue. And obviously, now we have reimbursement coverage for hips as well as knees through Medicare. So, this is a trend for the future. And I actually think it's not going to stop in the United States. There is already countries like the UK and even Canada are looking at moving to lower cost sites of care. It's a good thing for health care overall. And these surgery centers make good money. They're very profitable. They don't have the burden of the cost of a large inpatient hospital. So, you can debate with the actual pace of the curve, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is a - it's a trend that's going to continue to accelerate. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. You may proceed. Yes. Thanks for the question. So on OrthoSensor, obviously, it's new under the belt here a few weeks. And so it's not something that we have fully developed all the various plans in terms of how we are going to market for any of the product at this point in time. And so as that happens, we'll certainly be able to come back and give you updates with regards to how we're going to market and what the impacts might be in terms of what the legacy business was and what we expect it to be in the future. And I think the same holds true as we think about the future product launches, as well as I mentioned before, we haven't defined all those timelines yet. And so all of the items that you bring up in terms of how it will commercialize, how it will be sold, et cetera, will all be developed and done at that point. Sure. I think obviously we took on additional debt when we did the Wright Medical acquisition. We've also made commitments to reduce our debt over the next few years and so that will be something that's ongoing. And you'll see that in our financial performance. But because M&A is so important to our growth strategy and keep in mind that our normal M&A strategy is really just smaller tuck-in deals. It's what we do well, it's what we do best, and we can execute those quickly. So I think just like with OrthoSensor, you will see us continuing with smaller tuck-in acquisitions like we normally do through the year, and I don't anticipate that you'll see a - sort of a big acquisition of the size of Wright Medical for a couple of years. And frankly, if you think back to even when we did Sage, and when we did Physio, those were two very large acquisitions. We moved into a strategy for a year or two, just doing tuck-ins, which served us very well. And so I think, it will play out very similar to that. Sure. So that is out in the market in a limited way in the fourth quarter, and really rolling out for a full launch as we think about the first quarter of 2021. In terms of the features and benefits, really it's a - three things I would probably point out to here, I think one, just advanced fall prevention really focusing on keeping patient safe, as well as we think about low height feature. I think the bed drops down to about 11 inches off the floor. And then also, it's - the first bed that's really truly wireless. And so really all of those items trying to meet some unmet needs in the marketplace to drive benefits in the bed market. Okay. Sure. So I'll start with the second part, this, the world is obviously going more and more digital. We have a Stryker health cloud. There's all types of data that we're collecting from Mako that we want to be able to mine that data with thousands and thousands of procedures already being done. And really connect that with sensors. So we really see this as not just limited to joint replacement. It's going to be across all of our businesses whether it's trauma, whether it's cranial maxillofacial, sports. And so this is something we're really excited about and we named Robert Cohen, the head of that business on behalf of all of Stryker. And so we already had initiatives going on in different parts of the company, and we are sort of bringing it all together to really create more leverage and really be able to have centers of excellence around different types of technology blocks. And so to us, it's extremely exciting. Robert knows the company very, very well. It's - I think many of you know, Robert, very well positioned to lead this function for the company. And sorry, can you go - repeat the first question, again. I'm sorry with that. I didn't catch them. Sports, yes, so sport has been just a fabulous story for Stryker. But when I joined the company almost 10 years ago, our sports medicine implant business was really tiny. Most people didn't even know we had a sports medicine implant business, and we have grown it pretty dramatically since then, primarily through internal innovation. But we've also done a series of very small acquisitions, and one of them was Pivot, you may recall for hip arthroscopy. More recently, we launched a lateral row anchor for shoulder which has been, we call it Omega product name, which is a fantastic product. We picked up, throughout the year, we picked up another product as well which - these are all key fundamental products, whether it's in knee, whether it's in hip or whether it's in shoulder. So we - now we have all three of the joints very well covered in sports, and we are just growing at again very, very robust rate. And the timing couldn't be better with the shift to the surgery center and being able to use sports combined with our other divisions. Again, we really ported on in the last few years in sports, because of lot of investment internally that we've done. And we have a fabulous year. That business is run out of Denver and we're really excited about the progress we've made in sports. Yes, sure. So clearly, Wright Medical had a much bigger shoulder business than Stryker. And a lot of the Stryker business frankly where with the hip and knee surgeons, but also did some volume of shoulder. And the teams are obviously working on that through the sales deployment, working out which surgeons are going to be allocated to which sales people. They made great progress on that front. And cross-selling opportunities will exist. But as Preston mentioned before, this integration is not going to be as tricky as the integration on foot and ankle, just given that we tended to - they tended to be strong with a, I'll call it, fully dedicated upper extremity surgeons. And we tended to be stronger with those surgeons that did a smaller number just as a general statement. So, I think this integration is going to be terrific. We were really thrilled that we'll have the leader from Wright Medical take over the combined business of upper extremities. And their Head of Sales is also running the combined sales organization and they're both outstanding leaders. And we are delighted not only to bring the business and the products of Wright Medical, but being able to bring over some of their key leadership. Even the leader of our combined foot and ankle business came from Wright Medical. So not only are we bringing over great technologies, we're also bringing over great talent with that acquisition. Matt, I would just tell you, at this point, it's very difficult to really talk about just given the variability and it's not dissimilar to what we've seen really in second and third quarter as well in terms of how the surgeries are being deferred and where they are being deferred and how they're coming back. So, I think that really is difficult to use one quarter and certainly difficult in the midst of this pandemic to use one quarter. So I think, as we look at it, we're looking at, as we get to those normalized rates and knowing what we've done from a Mako, implement a Mako placement and install standpoint, that we have a lot of runway to go in terms of growing markets in knees. So, thank you all for joining our call. Like you, I'm very, very pleased to have 2020 behind us. And looking forward to a strong year in 2021. We have to get through, obviously, the remainder of this pandemic. But as you saw from our guide, we are feeling very confident about the future. And we look forward to sharing our Q1 results with you in April. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q4 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.8% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales. Early in the quarter, there was continued momentum from Q3. However, during November, the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the related cancellations of procedures, primarily in the U.S. and Europe significantly impacted our sales momentum. However, we did see demand for certain capital products continue as we had strong results in our Mako, medical beds and emergency care products. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales declined 1.5%, reflecting the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, Medical products and Neurovascular products. International organic sales were flat, impacted by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in Europe, which was mostly offset by growth in Canada, China and Brazil. Organic sales decline for the year was 4.8%, with a U.S. decline of 5.8% and an international decline of 2.1%. 2020 had one additional selling day compared to 2019 and for the year, price had an unfavorable 0.7% impact on sales. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.81 increased 12.9% from the prior year, reflecting strong financial discipline, good operating expense control and a favorable operational tax rate. Our fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by $0.03 from foreign currency. Our full-year EPS was $7.43, which is a decline of 10%, reflecting the impact of lower sales, especially in Q2, as well as the impact of idling certain manufacturing facilities during the year, offset by strong expense discipline throughout the year. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 2.8% and an organic sales decline of 5.8%, including an organic decline of 5.7% in the U.S. This reflects a slowdown in elective procedures related to COVID-19 and a very strong prior year comparable as Q4 2019 U.S. organic growth was 7.2%. Other ortho grew 12.3% in the U.S., primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. The Trauma & Extremities business also delivered positive growth led by our core trauma and shoulder products. Internationally, Orthopaedics declined 6% organically, which also reflects the COVID-19 related procedural slowdown, especially in Europe. This was somewhat offset by stronger performances in Australia and Canada. During the quarter, the Wright Medical acquisition was successfully closed. For the quarter, Wright delivered flat growth on a comparable basis. This included positive performances in U.S. shoulder, double-digit growth in U.S. ankle, as well as strong international growth led by Australia. On a comparable basis for the full year, Wright had a 10.3% decline, mainly driven by the COVID-19 related slowdown in the second quarter. In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency growth of 1.5% and organic growth of 1.3%, which included 2.2% growth in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 4.5%. In the quarter, sales growth was driven by gains in its power tool, waste management and smoke evacuation products and its service business. Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 7%, primarily impacted by the slowdown in the capital businesses, offset by gains in the sports medicine business, which grew over 9% in the quarter. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 9.7%, reflecting solid performances in patient care, emergency care and at Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had an organic sales decline of 2.4%, reflecting a general slowdown in instruments and endoscopy businesses and strong comparables across most geographies. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 2.1%. This growth reflects many strong performances within our Neurotech product line, including neuro-powered drill, SONOPET and Neurovascular, offset by the impact of procedural deferrals, especially in the U.S. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic decline of 1.2%, as procedural deferrals impacted sales in the quarter. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 13.5%. This performance was driven by strong demand in Australia, Japan and China. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.1% was unfavorable, approximately 120 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin dilution was impacted by price, business mix and unabsorbed fixed cost as production was brought in line with reduced demand during the quarter. This was primarily offset by acquisitions and foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.5% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 30.3% of sales, which was favorable to the prior year quarter by 200 basis points. This reflects the continued focus on disciplined operating expense controls, which have been in place since the second quarter. These cover most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings and consultants. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 29.2% of sales, which is a 90 basis points improvement over the prior year quarter and reflects the impact of the spending discipline previously discussed. Related to other - related to other income and expense as compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding related to the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 8%. Our full-year effective tax rate was 12.6%. These rates reflect one-time operational fluctuations that arose due to the pandemic, with a mix of foreign losses related to lower foreign manufacturing activity, combined with reduced U.S. sourced income that resulted from the sharp drop in sales at the end of the year. For 2021, we do not anticipate these circumstances arising, as we expect to return to normalized operations during the year and we expect our full-year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $14 billion. During the quarter, we executed the Wright Medical acquisition, which resulted in the disbursement of $5.6 billion, inclusive of the retirement of Wright's convertible debt. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $3.3 billion. This historically strong performance resulted from the disciplined working capital management, somewhat offset by lower earnings. Turning to cash flow for 2021. We will not be repurchasing any shares and we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately $650 million. Anticipating a more normalized year in 2021 and a ramping of investment in our businesses, we expect the free cash flow conversion rate as a percent of adjusted net earnings, including the one - excluding the one-time impacts from the Wright Medical integration of 70% to 80%. And now, I will provide 2021 guidance on a standalone legacy basis and further guidance including Wright Medical. We are providing our guidance in comparison to 2019, as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. As Preston indicated, we will be providing annual guidance on an organic sales growth and earnings and will update this throughout the year as part of our regular earnings calls. As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. Given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2019. As a reference, our organic sales growth excludes Wright Medical. There are the same number of selling days in 2021 compared to 2019 and one less when comparing to 2020. Consistent with the pricing environment experienced in both 2019 and 2020, we would expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1%. Additionally, as we are comparing growth to 2019, our 2021 organic sales growth guidance includes two years of price reductions. The foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be modestly favorably impacted as compared to 2020 and 2019. For the full year 2021, we did not expect to deliver operating margin expansion as a result of the op margin dilution of the Wright Medical acquisition. However, excluding the dilutive impact from Wright, we do anticipate expansion of 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2021 for our legacy Stryker business compared to 2019. This includes anticipated increases in hiring, discretionary expenses and other costs that support future growth and business expansion as our businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels. Finally, for 2021, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $8.80 to $9.20 for the full year. This includes the previously announced $0.10 dilution, driven by the addition of the Wright Medical business for the full year. While Wright Medical is dilutive in 2021, we expect it to be accretive starting in 2022. As it relates to other aspects of Wright Medical, we expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be in the low to mid single digits in 2021 when compared to 2019. This includes the integration of Stry's legacy extremity business with Wright Medical, which will all be part of our trauma and extremities Division. This growth is impacted by the recovery from COVID-19, partially offset by the synergies from the integration activities in 2021. We also reiterate our previous guidance on cost saving synergies from the deal of approximately $100 million to $125 million over the next three years. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Yes. Hi, Vijay. Sorry I was on mute. Our organic guidance is 8% to 10% and the guidance that we provided related to Wright Medical, you have to understand that it's being integrated into our Trauma Extremities businesses. So we will be combining in our legacy extremities business with Wright Medical and running that combined group as part of our Trauma Extremities division. So when you mix all that together and you really look at what will trauma and extremities growth be in 2021 as compared to 2019, we do think it will be low to bit single digits, but keep in mind that also takes into account sales to synergies for Wright Medical that we fully expect will happen in 2021. Yes, it's - Vijay, I would tell you that based on what happened this year and the variability that we saw in our operations, we fully expect to continue to experience some variability on into Q2. And so our guidance range really reflects how that ramp comes back. On the low-end, it could be all the way through Q2. On the better end, we start to see much more improvement towards the beginning in Q2. And really - it really is going to be variable depending on that. I mean, we have passed our legacy Stryker business on the op margin front with 30 to 50 basis points improvement. But keep in mind if you look at Q4 or if you can even go back and look at Q3, it really reflected pretty draconian expense control in terms of hiring, travel, meetings, consultants, you name it, discretionary expenses and we put the lid on that. So that's not sustainable, especially if you think about our aspirations to grow at the high end of med device, so we will start seeing that spending pick up as we continue to supplement and hire our sales forces, as we meet with customers, as we add to our prototypes and loaner pools, all those things will start to add to our expenses. So that's really what's underlying the guidance. Yes, Bob, again, I just can't reiterate the variability that we're seeing and so maybe that's sort of adding up the obvious set of numbers, if you will. I think we took the range 8% to 10% because we do feel like there is going to be some variability that we can't exactly forecast at this point in time and where we're sitting in Q1 and what we're seeing. As far as Wright Medical goes, we were pretty pleased with where their Q4 performance came out, but they are also subject to a lot of the same variability, which is why, we're looking that once we integrate it with trauma and extremities, we will have some sales, the synergies that just naturally occur. We felt that with K2 and Spine and we will fill that with Wright Medical. So taking into account that variability, you're really looking at 8% to 10% for the - for Stryker legacy and low to mid single digits as we look at the combined Wright and Trauma & Extremities. Yes. Actually, I think you did a pretty good job of summarizing it. Wright will definitely come in and be accretive to our gross margin, as those products generally have a higher gross margin than sort of the average of our other business. I also think to - as you look at business mix that will normalize as the year goes forward and so we will also see kind of those higher margin orthopaedics products becoming a bigger share of the total. And I think, we will largely come back to sort of what our view is sort of normalized margins, as you look at 2019. Conversely though. Just as a reminder, moving down to op margin, you are going to see that discretionary spending pick up as we support growth. And so that will likely go the other way, and will be on a ramp largely as sales ramp throughout the year. Yes, I would tell you, we haven't seen any significant trend shifts heading - making that transition from fourth quarter into first quarter."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and OrthoSensor. During the fourth quarter, elective procedures were negatively pressured in most regions globally as localized infection and hospitalization rates surged through the month of December. As a result, growth was uneven and correlated to the state of the pandemic in each region. The areas impacted the most include the U.S. and many of the countries in Western Europe, most notably, the United Kingdom, driven by a countrywide lockdown. Even with the procedural variability, we saw growth in emerging markets, including China, which grew double digits over prior year quarter. Looking forward, hospitals are better equipped to handle this resurgence and they are working to bring back the procedures that have been delayed, though we expect that the variability of elective procedures will continue through the first quarter until infection rates begin to decline and the distribution of the vaccines become more prevalent. This slowdown in elective procedures had a negative impact on our more deferrable businesses, which make up approximately 40% to 50% of our total sales. However, the slowdown this quarter was not as impactful as the decline in the second quarter as hospitals were better equipped to manage COVID patients, while maintaining some level of elective surgeries. Despite the overall slowdown, we experienced continued growth in our Neurovascular, Medical, Mako and upper extremities businesses. Specifically, demand for Medical's large capital products continued in the fourth quarter, driven by the focus on expanding bed capacity, the need for our emergency care products like power costs and the LUCAS device and the availability of some remaining CARES Act funding in the U.S. In addition, the early trends on the launch of our new ProCuity are positive and expected to continue into 2021. During the year, our Mako installed base grew by 33% and exceeded another milestone, with over 100 robots sold and installed in the fourth quarter. This growth continues to highlight the demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology, as well as our ongoing success at selling and installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs and competitive accounts. We are also excited about our recent approvals for Mako TKA in China, Russia and Brazil, which all provide opportunities for growth as these markets continue to embrace robotic, digital and enabling technologies. Turning to U.S. knee procedures. In the fourth quarter, approximately 44% of our total knees will make the knee procedures, a trend that continues to increase. The shift towards cementless needs also continued. And in the fourth quarter, cementless needs made up 42% of our U.S. knee procedures. During the pandemic, feedback from surgeons has pointed to limited trialing of competitive products and businesses like joint replacement, as surgeons worked to perform procedures restricted by cancellations and deferrals. However, as the pandemic subsides and we return to a more normal environment, we expect to continue to outpace the market, driven by our Mako installations throughout the year and our strong order book heading into 2021. We are also enthusiastic about the Wright Medical acquisition and the category leadership we gain in both upper extremities and foot and ankle through Wright's diverse portfolio of implants, biologics and enabling technologies. The combination of Stryker and Wright will continue to drive innovation that enhances our customers' ability to address patient needs across the more than $3 billion extremities market. The integration has been progressing well over the last few months. The long period from signed to close was used to ensure that the appropriate integration plans were in place, leveraging our years of deal experience. To date, the teams have been focused on moving quickly to align the new combined organization. Considerable progress has been made, including the creation of specialized business units and sales forces for Trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle, which is a key part of our overall decentralized strategy that allows us to remain close to the customer. The U.S. sales leadership organizational structure for these three specialized business units has been announced and the rollout and full alignment of territories will be finalized during the first quarter as planned. Outside the U.S., the leadership team is working to align the sales forces throughout the year. Our teams are executing the sales integration while continuing to drive day-to-day business. And during the quarter, there was minimal disruption caused by the closing and integration activities. Finally, I want to restate our ongoing commitment to M&A, which was most recently demonstrated by our acquisition of OrthoSensor, a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for joint replacement. Smart devices and implants will play an important role in the future of orthopedics and the addition of OrthoSensor will allow us to continue to innovate and advance smart sensor technologies, including intraoperative sensors, wearables and ultimately, smart implants. As it relates to 2021 guidance, Glenn will provide an update on our full-year guidance for sales, operating margin and EPS. Updates to this annual guidance will be made each quarter if necessary throughout the year. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Yes. Shagun, this is Preston. Just in terms of the timing of the deal itself, I mean, again, we are constantly looking at different opportunities and it was just the right time with the team to make this acquisition in terms of what we thought we were able to do with it. So, I think just the timing of it just happened to work out the way that it did. And we typically do look at our targets for a long period of time. In terms of other timelines about when we're going to be bringing some of the different things to market, at this point, we're not ready to disclose those timelines. Just know that the teams are getting to work, to develop pretty robust time - excuse me, robust pipeline around that sensor technology. And as we have more information, we'll certainly be bringing that to you guys. Robbie, it's Preston. I'll take that one. In terms of that patient backlog, certainly, we saw some of that being worked down in the third quarter as we saw the recovery starting to happen. And certainly then, we saw more deferrals happening in the fourth quarter. You saw more people being added back to that backlog. As Kevin and Glenn both articulated, as we see the recovery happening in 2021, we would expect to see some of that recovery include the backlog of patients that have been deferring now anywhere from three months to six months or so. And so we would expect to see some of that flowing back into the numbers through 2021. I think the one caveat I would give you is we won't necessarily see a dramatic spike in those numbers, just given certain aspects around capacity and things like that. So, you will still see surgeons and hospitals working to fit additional surgeries in and same things that we saw in the third quarter. But you certainly won't see a significant dramatic spike at any one point in time as a result of backlog. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. First of all, Neurovascular had a really terrific year. They had double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. They were obviously just like everybody else affected in the second quarter and into the third quarter, but double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, extremely exciting portfolio of products, new product introductions. Obviously with Aspiration, we have the Vecta 74 catheter out. We have the pump. They're doing very well. Then we have this flow diverting stent, the second-generation flow diverting stent approved in the United States, the Surpass Evolve. We have the first-generation flow diverting stent approved in China, our Atlas stent, which is used in hemorrhagic segment. Our adjunctive stent is doing extremely well in China. So, we really have a great portfolio. And we have the NXT, the next generation stent retriever as well recently launched. So, a lot of new launches. This management team is truly outstanding. They've been in place since, frankly, we acquired the business. They have a very healthy pipeline of other products coming as well. So, I'm very, very bullish on the Neurovascular business. We ended the year with great momentum, and I expect we'll continue to be a very strong performer in the years to come. Yes, I would say that the spine business held up a little bit better. We saw spine procedures in general holding up a little better than some of the other elective procedures, particularly for our spine business outside the United States performed well. And I think it's just a function of the successful integration that we've had with the K2M business and combining that with some of the enabling technologies like those that we acquired through Mobius. And again, we saw some continued performance in some of the markets outside the U.S. that had more stability in spine related procedures like Japan and Canada as well. So I think, all-in-all, it held up a little bit better. We definitely expect that business to continue to perform well, as we go into 2021 and really harnessing the power across K2M, our legacy spine business as well as the enabling technology. Yes. So I think Kevin outlined it pretty well before. I think overall, just looking at one quarter in the midst of a pandemic is tough to do because of the variability and really the localized impacts that we were seeing from a elective procedure standpoint. So certainly, you would expect that that hips, might be a little less deferrable than knees just given the nature of the disease and the degeneration. But at the same time, elective procedures depending on where you are in the world were being stopped and so hips were not immune to that, like some of our other elective procedures. As we look forward, certainly with the rollout of all of the installations to Mako that we've done this year, as well as our new hip software, we're really expecting continued above market growth from our hips and knees as we move forward. No, that's not something that we're sharing."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with some perspectives on the recovery trends across our diverse businesses. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. I'm pleased to report that we returned to growth in Q3, posting organic sales growth of 3%. This represents a rapid improvement in our business, driven by a progressive return of elective procedures, ongoing demand for our medical capital products, and continued strong Mako performance. In the quarter, we saw uneven growth globally that correlates to the state of the pandemic. Preston will speak to this in his section. While we are pleased with the recovery of our business, the environment remains uncertain as flare ups of positive COVID cases are continuing. We had many achievements in the quarter that exemplify our commitment to innovation and providing our customers with the technologies needed to serve their patients. Beginning with Mako, we celebrated the installation of our 1,000th robotic system in the quarter. We've seen tremendous success with Mako since the launch of the total knee application in 2016 and this quarter was no different. We continue to believe that we're well positioned for sustained future success with Mako. Our spine and trauma and extremities businesses benefited from numerous recent product launches and Wright medical launched an exciting new acute care bed. Our neurovascular business also achieved some new product approvals in important market, which helped contribute to their double-digit global growth in the quarter. We maintained many of the policies put in place at the beginning of the pandemic focused on maintaining the safety of our employees and customers and aggressively managing spending. While sales and manufacturing have approached more normal levels, our spending levels were unusually low given the uncertainty regarding the pace of the recovery. Our R&D spending on an adjusted basis was 6.1% of sales slightly below our expectations as a result of COVID-related execution challenges, and some timing of spending. But none of this has caused any meaningful delays to new product timelines. The combination of sales growth and suppressed spending resulted in adjusted earnings per share $2.14 cents, up 12% versus the prior year. While some of our measures will remain in place -- our spending measures, we do expect some returns to hiring and investments to support future growth in Q4. Due to the continued uncertainty and lack of stability in many markets, we are not providing Q4 guidance at this time. We saw good momentum across many of our businesses in Q3, although the recovery curve acceleration moderated meaningfully in August and September, and has been on a similar trend so far in October. We are proceeding with the integration efforts related to the Wright medical transaction and are working cooperatively with regulators to obtain the necessary approvals for this transaction. This includes as previously announced the proposed divestiture of our STAR, Total Ankle Replacement product. We expect to close the transaction in November. Please note beyond this update, we will not be taking any questions regarding Wright Medical on today's call. Finally, I would like to thank our employees for continuing to serve our customers and finding ways to succeed during such challenging times. From our sales and service personnel in the field every day, with our customers to the marketing and R&D teams that are finding creative ways to connect globally, to advance new innovations, to our manufacturing teams and office staff who ensured the continuity of our business. We are living our mission statement, which is, together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better. And now over to Preston.\nPreston Wells: Thanks Kevin. Today my comments will focus on providing additional thoughts on the current environment and the recovery of select devices and geographies during the third quarter. We've generally seeing a V-shaped recovery through the second quarter with the continued momentum and growth in the third quarter, although at a more moderated level of month-over-month improvement. The sales growth and improved performance in the third quarter was driven by three main factors, the continued acceleration of electric procedures, strong demand for many of our large capital products, and the return of our more event-driven businesses like trauma and stroke. Small capital products, including our video cameras and power tools show nice improvement for the lack of other products in their recovery. These products generally trail electric procedure volumes by a few months. Despite a resurgence in infection rates globally, we saw sales growth in most developed markets led by strong recovery in the United States, Australia, Germany, and Canada. These markets were operating around pre-COVID levels throughout the quarter. Our China business returns to double-digit growth in the quarter, with procedures returning to more normal levels despite the government taking a more aggressive approach to lockdowns around COVID infection. The UK, India, and parts of our Latin American businesses continue to lag as they work through heightened impacts of the pandemic. Procedural areas that were deferred or soft during the second quarter showed significant improvements in the quarter, our knee, spine, trauma and extremities and sports medicine businesses all achieved year-over-year growth. This also showed significant improvement in the quarter reaching prior year levels. Each of these businesses benefited from the acceleration of electrodes procedures during the quarter that was fueled by the addition of new patients and the recovery of the previously differed backlog. Surgeons and healthcare providers continue to work through the new and existing backlog by adding incremental procedures to their normal schedules. With the continued variability of infection rate, we believe that hospitals are better prepared to ensure that these types of elective procedures can still be performed at some level, unlike the dramatic drop that we saw in April. However, the efficient ratio remains fluid and procedural impact and recovery will continue to vary across geography. Demand for our large capital products drove strong growth in the quarter, including ongoing high demand for our Mako robotic technology. In the third quarter, we were very pleased with the acceleration of Mako installations both within the U.S. and markets outside the U.S., so we continue to expand our Mako presence. Recently, Brazil approved full use of our Mako robotic technology for both hip and knee procedures. We are also experiencing increased utilization with a growing percentage of hip and knee surgeries being performed with a Mako robot. Within our medical division we saw strengthen our emergency care business along with continued high demand for our beds and stretchers, demonstrating improved financial stability of our customers aided by government subsidies like the CARES Act, and the resurgence of the positive cash flow driven by the continuation of elective procedures. As a result, our order book remains a robust for both Mako and many of our medical practice. The launch of the new acute care bed security is a contributor to that order book and a demonstration of our ongoing commitment innovation during the pandemic. With our specialized unit, category-leading product portfolio, and innovative technologies, we are well-positioned to continue our above marketing Medtech growth. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks Preston. Today I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 3.3% in the quarter. These results included growth in the U.S. of 3.5% and international growth of 2.8%. As a reminder, the quarter included the same number of selling days as Q3 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4% from the prior year quarter while foreign currency had a favorable 0.4% impact on sales. During the quarter, we return to growth this demand for our procedural base products came back strongly in most key geographies and demand for large capital primarily Mako and medical beds remained strong. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.14 represents growth of 12% from the prior year quarter. The foreign currency impact on the third quarter EPS was a creative by $0.01. The strong EPS growth was mainly driven by sales dropped through, favorable sales mix, discipline cost control, and better than expected gross margin leverage as our manufacturing output returned to more normal production levels. I will now provide some brief comments on our segment sales. Orthopedics had constant currency and organic growth of 3.8%. This included us growth of 7.5%. We saw growth across knees, hips, trauma, extremities, and Mako which grew 30.2% in the quarter. Additionally, all these products are growing up strong U.S. comparables from Q3 2019. Internationally, orthopedics had an organic decline of 4.7%, which reflects the slower recovery of elective procedures in Europe as a result of COVID restrictions, partially offset by a positive Mako performance. Medsurg had constant currency growth of 2.9% and organic growth of 2.5%, which included organic growth of 1.4% in the U.S. Instruments had us organic sales growth of 1.9%, reflecting increased demand for our safety related products, including waste management and smoke evacuation products, the latter of which had double-digit growth. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 1%. This reflects a return to growth primarily driven by our sports medicine business, where we had double-digit growth. This was partially offset by moderate declines in core endoscopy and communications businesses. The medical division had U.S. organic growth of 3%, resulting from strong demand across its bed business, growing double-digits and emerging emergency care business growing high single-digits. These were partially offset by a decline in our [Indiscernible] business. Internationally, Medsurg had organic sales of 6.7%, reflecting very strong demand for medical products combined with positive performances across most of our Medsurg product categories in all major geographies. Neuro technology and spine had a constant currency growth of 5.5% in organic growth of 4.3%. Our U.S. neurotech business posted constant currency growth of 3.1%, including 1.7% of organic growth for the quarter. Overall, this reflects positive performances in our spine, CMF, and neurovascular businesses and included double-digit growth in our ischemic products. Internationally, neuro technology and spine had organic growth of 9.8% including double-digit performances in our hemorrhagic and ischemic products, and a very strong performance in our spine business. Now, I will discuss our operating metrics in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.9% was favorable 20 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin was favorably impacted by volume and business mix, which was partially offset by price and some unabsorbed fixed costs. Although our manufacturing output returned to more normalized levels during the quarter, there was a somewhat negative impact related to our idle manufacturing lines at the beginning of the quarter. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.1% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 31.7% of sales, which was 210 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, SG&A was favorably impacted by operating expense savings action enacted in March, which continued in the third quarter. In summary for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 28% of sales. All of the spend control measures that were enacted in March continued through Q3. These measures covered most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments and hiring travel, meetings, and outside consultants. As our businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels, we do anticipate that there will be increases in hiring, discretionary expenses, and other costs that support future growth and business expansion. Related to other income and expense compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and an increase in interest expense related to additional debt outstanding. Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 16.1%. Turning to cash flow and liquidity, we ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of $7.2 billion, which includes $5 billion of funds related to the Wright medical acquisition. We also generated approximately $830 million of cash from operations in the quarter, which was again ahead of our internal targets. This strong operating cash flow reflects strong net earnings and a reduction in poor working capital versus the prior year. The actions that were implemented in the first quarter to conserve cash continued in Q3, which included discretionary spending controls, reductions in planned capital expenditures and project spending, focusing on opportunities and accounts payable, and slowing our M&A activities. As it relates to guidance for Q4 and the full year, we reaffirm our previously announced decision to withdraw guidance, given the continued significance of uncertainties at this time. And now I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nKevin Lobo: Vijay, we can't hear you.\nPreston Wells : Vijay, are you on mute?\nVijay Kumar: Okay, guys. Can you hear me?\nKevin Lobo: Perfect.\nPreston Wells : We can now.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. Well, congrats on a really strong print, Kevin. So -- and I guess, looking at these numbers here, some of the peers in quarter, you’re seeing low single-digit declines. You guys are seeing a positive declines, maybe parse out, what is that the underlying market versus this constant theme of Stryker gaining share? Is that what's happening? What's driving this trend here? And perhaps also touch upon new trends you're seeing here and for any reason. Now, I saw that we didn't have a Q4 guidance, but perhaps in a sequential trends we're seeing here in Q4, is there any reason to believe as Q4 trends should be perhaps different from what we saw in 3Q?\nGlenn Boehnlein : So thanks, Vijay. We're pretty excited about the performance in our business. It's not a one quarter thing. I think you've seen our joint replacement division, which includes hips, knees and Mako have been performing well for some time. And that momentum is continuing. I mentioned in my opening remarks that we're pleased with October, it's going well so far in the month. But I really don't want to speculate on November, December, just given all the products that are occurring, assuming that the market stays fairly stable, we're going to have a good fourth quarter. But that's a big assumption given this is, obviously a once in a lifetime type of pandemic. So I don't want to get ahead of myself, but we were feeling good about the business through the month of October.\nVijay Kumar: Got you. And then maybe one on the capital side, you guys did mentioned strong order book for Mako, large capital. I know you guys just launched a new bed, perhaps just talk about that the visibility you have on the capital side of the business and is that a confidence that you can perhaps extrapolate into next year or is this -- perhaps Q4 and then we'll see how the market shakes out for next year?\nPreston Wells: Hey, Vijay, it’s Preston. Just to expand on that a little bit, I mean, we do continue to have confidence in our capital business. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if you look at our large capital business and demand that we saw on Mako, and then on the medical business in particular, we feel really, really good about that. Small capital, as we talked about in the remarks as well, we expect that to continue to come along and recovery curve as well. Although, it has shown that improvement but lags a little bit, some of the other products in terms of that recovery. And I think overall we feel good about it, we feel good about where orders have come in, feel good about where our customers are in terms of their financial stability at this point in time, certainly compared to where it was a quarter ago and because of those items, we feel confident in where our capital business is headed. I think all of that is underscored, as Kevin said by the uncertainty that still remains with regards to debt flare ups and how the virus continues to kind of move through different regions.\nOperator: Next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. And again, congrats on a much better than expected quarter. Kevin, how should we think about interpreting the comments on a go forward basis in respect to how much of a backlog is worked through, are there still patient to deferred procedures that that still need to get into queue here. And because it sounds like July was probably the best quarter, third quarter with fourth quarter current trends hold be similar, better or worse than third quarter here?\nPreston Wells : Hey, Robbie. It’s Preston. So, I’d say, in general, it's hard to predict exact percentages with regards to how much of a backlog has been worked through versus what are new patients that are coming into that funnel. Based on the feedback that we've got, we know that surgeons are continuing to work through that backlog, and that they're also adding new patients. So, it's definitely a mix of the two. We also know that there are some patients that are still waiting with anxiety to get their procedures done. But all-in-all clinics and surgeons remain busy, and they're continuing to look to add additional shifts or additional opportunities to add surgery or even a shift to the outpatient setting. Our expectation is that that trend will continue, again, barring any major disruptions from a COVID perspective.\nRobbie Marcus: Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Once again, you had another great Mako quarter here even in the tough times of COVID. And I was wondering if you could speak to how willing your hospital systems are to go out still and by the large capital, considering it seems like your main competitor in robotics has shifted strategy to place a lot more units rather than recognize revenue up front, it appears you're still able to recognize a healthy amount. So just wondering what the environment is like, and if you're seeing them on the competitive side? Thanks.\nPreston Wells : Yes, look, we continue to feel very bullish about Mako, I think in Q4, we're going to have to unless something bizarre happens in the marketplace, it'll be a record quarter in Q4, because the order book is still very strong, with over 1,000. And we've kind of hit an inflection point. And in robotics, the interest in robotics is increasing every day, teaching hospitals are adopting robotics. And they're feeling the pressure to have robotics as part of their programs. And in some cases, they've been holding off a little bit. So for us, the momentum is palpable, it's continuing, it's strong. And it's even starting to pick up in other markets such as Japan and countries in Europe, they did a little bit of a pause in that second quarter. We saw them coming back, frankly, in the third quarter. So, the outlook for Mako continues to be very bullish. And it's really irrespective of competition. This is sort of a market trend that's changing the market shifting. And we really love the offering that we have in this category.\nOperator: Next question we have is David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Questions. Kevin, I wonder if we could just talk maybe 2021, if we can't get the specific numbers, either relative to 2019 baseline or maybe just some top line qualitative commentary about how you're sort of seeing the top and bottom line for 2021, or specific product launches, and innovation pipeline, we should be thinking about for 2021. And then I have quick follow-up.\nKevin Lobo : Yes, David, we're not going to really get into sort of guidance for 2021. We do that in every January, and right now we're planning to provide that in January. I think we've gotten good momentum across a lot of our businesses, you saw the trauma number, we posted a really strong number, they've launched a number of new products and feeling very good about that. And that's frankly before Wright Medical kicks in. So we're really excited about the momentum we're going to see across trauma and extremities next year. Neurovascular would be one that point that I'm really excited about. We have the surpass evolved next gen, flow-diverting stents stents approved in the United States and that had very good growth even though we're still having to go through the pains of posturing, but in the midst of a pandemic, so liberally from a small base, but that's going to pick up steam next year, as well our aspiration offerings with the neurovascular. So, neurovascular are very good as I look through into next year. And of course Mako will continue its positive trajectory that affects not just the Mako business, but of course hips and knees. And so those are all going well, instruments continues to be a really strong business for us and smoke evacuation you see is now becoming a standard in many areas called safety push, I think will continue beyond frankly the pandemic. And we've really established a really great stable of products related to safety. So, a lot of tailwinds. I think that will continue on a underlying basis. The big unknown is sort of how this pandemic evolved. It's still going to be with us obviously through the first half of next year in some way shape performing. And so that's not the big unknown, but a lot of the businesses that we have, we’re feeling good about the momentum and the product cadence in your product, which I've already touched on some of them, we think will position as well for 2021.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Very, very helpful. And the one business I wanted to highlight was just spine, obviously, that's been the sore point is last several quarters in years, some of your performance frankly was better than some of the emerging mid-cap spine players. Just what you're seeing in spine, have you finally the turn the corner from an integration perspective, you see more traction on sort of rep hiring, but it was a surprisingly strong quarter for you in spine just curious the underlying drivers. Thank you.\nKevin Lobo : Yes, we're really pleased with the performance of the spine. I think that K2M, which was obviously tough integration. We knew would be tough, it was tough. We feel that that's largely behind us. I think we actually got a little bit of reprieve in the second quarter, honestly, to sort of get our inventory and get our position more stabilized. OUS, it’s has been strong frankly from the beginning, but it getting that U.S. business on a better footing. We feel very good about that. They launched some new products, including Niagara, which is a lateral access product, a Corpectomy Cage. And so getting back to launching products, which is a big part of the K2M offense, excited that we're now back to launching new products versus sort of dealing with all of the integration challenges as it relates to sales force very stable. In fact, we're actually having sales reps wanting to come to join Stryker now in spine. So we really do feel the tide is starting to shift in spine and was definitely very good quarter.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nBob Hopkins: Hey, thanks and good afternoon. Just first question, I want to ask Kevin about your hip growth in the quarter and then just hit generally, your hip growth in the quarter was India's major below peers. So just wanted to talk about or ask you about dynamics there. But probably more importantly, also want to get your view on your pipeline in hips. And when you've got new launches coming, because I think in previous conversations, you’ve talked about some exciting launches potentially in that area?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, Thanks, Bob. We're actually very pleased with our hip performance. We had a good growth in hips, and we had a very tough comp from the prior year quarter where we outperformed the market in hip. So, overall, yes, competitors did well in hips. We also did well in hips. As you know, hips are a little less deferrable than knees, which really speaks to the strength we added in knees. But as it relates, the hips were very excited about two aspects of the pipeline. The first is the on Mako, we have a new software upgrade for hips that we launched in the second quarter, because of the pandemic, we haven't really been able to roll that out fully. It will get fully rolled out probably by the end of Q4. So it's a progressive rollout, but really will have more of an impact next year and in the second part of the pipeline is a new standard that we have planned sometime in the middle of next year, we'll get more specific around timing maybe in the January call. But that's going to be an exciting span, which has some features that surgeons like in a little bit of a gap in our portfolio. But overall, still pretty good quarter.\nBob Hopkins: Yes, yes. Okay, thank you. And then I also want to ask you a little bit about the potential for durability of growth in the medical division. And I'm not asking about fourth quarter, I'm thinking a little bit more longer-term, because there are a lot of moving pieces in that division. Right now it sounds like Sage might be struggling a little bit, but then OUS strength has been enormous. You're launching a new bed, and then there's the corner underlying bed market, maybe just talk about your thoughts on the durability of the growth outlook for that business in light of all the moving pieces?\nPreston Wells : Hey, Bob, it’s Preston. I think as I mentioned specifically on the capital side, we feel very confident where we're heading in terms of durability on that business, particularly as we think about things like beds and stretchers, with the launch of the new bed adding to that portfolio, very, very excited about what that's going to bring and do for us. Sage, Sage had a smaller quarter in terms of hips growth, obviously, an improvement from the second quarter, but still a little bit of a decline versus prior year. Given that business in terms of stocking and the purchase cycle, we really do expect that business can turn the corner as well as we go into the next quarter and into 2021. So I think we'll see some positive dynamics from that business. And then overall, obviously, we've seen some impact on the pandemic. And we would expect that we'll continue to see momentum on our businesses as we go forward. Specifically, as it relates to the OUS business, as you noted, we had a very strong Q3 performance really across both emergency care and our acute care business. I think it's important to note that we were really having big performances in the OUS space even before really the impact of the pandemic. And our expectation would be that even though while we're seeing some benefits, certainly from the pandemic, that we will continue to build on the momentum that I started giving before that as we go forward. So I think all-in-all, feeling very good about the future from a medical standpoint.\nOperator: Next question comes from--\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Just like to add one comment. The other part of the physio business is called public access. So that's outside of the emergency in the hospitals. And that business really got very, very quiet in the second quarter, it came to a halt almost. And so that'll come back, that'll probably be a little slower, maybe more in the first quarter, second quarter of next year. So, Sage will come back a little bit sooner, maybe towards the end of the year, and then public access will come back, maybe in the first or second quarter of next year. So there are parts of the business that are drags right now that will turn positive. And now of course, some pops that took off in the pandemic that will start to moderate. But we love our medical business. We love the leadership we have in that business, and it will continue to be a really good performer for us.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks so much for taking the question. Kevin, I just had a follow-up on this, ASC strategy have been pursuing and talking about a little bit. And I didn't want to tip your hands too much as to exactly how that all is going to work. But we'd love to get anything you are willing to share, progress so far, how it complements the another efforts to grow and maybe how it complements your relationships with some of the larger networks, which have an outpatient channel often? And I have one follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, look, I'm not going to get into too many of the details about how we're doing it. But we are very pleased with our performance in ASCs, Mako number in the third quarter and ASC's with the highest number we've had so far in ASC, so Mako is part of the solution. We had double-digit growth in our sports medicine business. And of course, that plays in the ASC primarily. And so those are the proxy that you could use to figure out sort of how we're doing in the ACSs as we look at our sports med business. Look at the growth that we're having with Mako, there's a lot of other products that we have played very well in the surgery center market. And we just basically created an align offerings that aligns our divisions. As you know, in the hospital, we tend to operate very separately, and we go in by product category, we're not doing that in the ASC and this aligned offerings is really working very well. And I want to give credit to Eddie Pearson, the entire team that sort of established this office. It's working ahead of what I was expecting, and feel very bullish about it going forward.\nMatt Miksic: That’s terrific. And then just follow-up, you mentioned strengthen growth in China, despite some of the pandemic controls you are putting back into effect there. And you've mentioned last call on the call before just about the move into China was Mako going forward and understanding that I'm guessing that a lot of that early activity is in the sort of premium self-pay market. And maybe any update or progress as to how that's going and any early results that you've seen in terms of feedback or uptake?\nKevin Lobo: Sure, thanks, Matt. So let me start with Mako. So we only have the hip approved right now in China, we don't have yet have a total knee, we hope to get that in the first or second quarter of next year. It's taking longer than we had expected. But we're on track so we won't get it eventually approved. But we are getting sales with Mako for hip. But of course once you get the knee on the robot, and of course the sales will start to really accelerate. There's just been a general pickup in general. So the pandemic they've done a good job controlling the pandemic in the country. We've seen a pickup both in our Carson business, which is our lower priced products, as well as in the premium segment. So it's kind of I would say an across the board pickup that's occurring and really related to the Coronavirus. I think we had a great year last year in China, our best year on record in a good year, the year before we have strong management team both on the trusting side and in the premium segment. As you know, that's been a more recent thing for Stryker. So I would expect that we'll continue to see that kind of performance since the market conditions improved markedly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nLarry Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. To Kevin on the operating margin. In Q3, it obviously stood out the 260 basis points or so improvement year-over-year. And I heard the comments that, some of it was spending that you deferred because of the pandemic. But my question is, how much of this may be durable because of things you've learned, to do more efficiently during the pandemic, and how does it make you feel about, the 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin improvement on an annual basis that you you've targeted?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Hi, Larry, this is Glenn. You're right during Q2 and Q3, we obviously continued a lot of the cost containment measures that we had enacted in March. And these were kind of things that other companies probably have looked at travel, meetings, training, consulting. And just the real whole gamut of discretionary spending was really kind of locked down. We also slowed our hiring. We slowed project spending on sort of non R&D type projects. And I would say, coming out of this, you're absolutely right, we've learned sort of new ways to work. We're doing this call virtually, and it seems to be working fine. We also have launched virtual training with customers, and also internally that has worked very well. And so I would say, some of that very definitely will carry over to the future in terms of how we sort of emerged from the pandemic and what our operating structure looks like. That being said though, as we get back to more normalized operations, and back to a growth trend that we expect to be at, there will be increases to all those expenses. And some of them will return to pre-COVID levels just because that's what we'll need to support sort of the growth assertions that we'll have. Key projects will start back up. We'll see hiring pick back up. So all of that will start to grow with -- as we emerge from this. So, if you think about the 30 to 50 basis points, I do think that probably a more normalized basis to look at would be looking at 2019 in terms of an off margin that that we might assert relative growth off of. But we have not backed away at all from our financial assertions, we will grow at the high-end of Medtech. And we will continue to expand our off margin 30 to 50 basis points.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's super helpful, Glenn. And one follow-up question. Just I think for Kevin, on M&A, with the exception of the right deal, you've been relatively quiet on the M&A front. Any thoughts? And is it due to valuations, just any thoughts on kind of your appetite and pipeline for M&A? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks. We intentionally slowed down M&A in the second quarter, just because we were not sure what was going to happen with the pandemic. We asked the teams to sort of put their pencils down, stay active in discussions. But we really wanted to be sure that -- we didn't know that recovery would happen quite this quickly. So we're pleased with that. We do have our M&A teams back up and running. Because of the right medical and the debt that we're taking on because of that, we don't expect to be doing very large deals in the next year or so. But we look for more tuck-in deals. And we do want to stay busy with M&A. And we've said that to the rating agencies. Our teams are actively looking at targets but they sort of never really stopped. It did just slowed down a little bit, while we saw sort of a pace of recovery. But you should expect us to get back to our normal kind of tuck-in offense, which will complement the right medical acquisition.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. This is Patrick on for Matt. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I want to start with Mako. You've done a really nice job with placing Mako and the underlying demand is really strong. But I'm curious if you could give us more color on the sales cycle. Specifically, I'm wondering if there's a chance that the sales cycle kind of over the longer term remains elongated as some of these hospitals work through financial pressures. So any color you have there would be really helpful? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Just to answer that, no, we don't expect that the sales cycles elongate. Matter of fact, it's one of the things that we've seen over the last couple of quarters is we've actually been able to get out and drive Mako even faster. And so there's still quite a bit of runway as you think about opportunities for Mako. So don't expect that that cycle to elongate.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That's really helpful color. And briefly, I know this might be kind of a long -- longer way out higher level. But I'm just curious if there's any changes to the way you guys are thinking about the robotic offering in spine, either through a Mako platform or the Mobius asset. I'm just kind of curious about how you're thinking about that pipeline as the spine business really picks up momentum and starts heading in the right direction? Thanks for taking the questions.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks. We're really not ready yet to publicly talk about what the robotic offering is. It will be important for our sponsors. It's no question. Mobius did come with a robotic pipeline product. Once we're ready, we'll share. We're actively working on an offering we're just not quite ready to share what that will be and what the timeline is. But stay tuned.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. You may proceed.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you. Appreciate taking the questions. Congrats in the quarter. Kevin, you call about Sage performance being maybe a little weaker than expected, was that a reflection of procedural volume? Or is there anything from a protocol perspective in terms of preoperative sterilization that may have changed for some customers given the pandemic?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, look, I will tell you, first of all, we weren't surprised by the STAR there wasn't weaker than expected, it was certainly negative sales growth. In fact, it was -- everything we had was a little better than expected in terms of the pace of recovery. The nature of the sales cycle per Sage, you need to have a lot of activity in the hospital where you have procedures being done, where the products are being used, because they're consumed, as you have people in the ICU, that people that are getting procedures done. And so the census in the hospital was lower in the second quarter for sure. And certainly even in third quarter. And these products are bought in bulk, and they're put on the shelf, because they're consumed daily. So you have this sales cycle that it sort of has to be depleted, the inventories have to be depleted before they're reordered. So that's not at all a surprise the fact that the sales were negative, it just sort of explains why that was a drag in the U.S. on our medical business, we don't have a very big stage business outside the U.S., it's more of a U.S. phenomenon. But we love the products. In fact, we launched a new product, a self-oral care product, which is really exciting in the midst of the pandemic, which is getting great customer feedback. But of course, that's just going to take time for that to be ordered. And then they put on the shelf. So once the ordering, once the usage starts to happen, and the inventory start to bleed down, we're going to get sort of this bolus of reordering. And again, that may not occur fully in the fourth quarter, but towards the end of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. We'll expect that Sage to get back to its normal very strong growth.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, one on Mako, not so much on the unit volumes, although it's certainly encouraging. But I think there was a software upgrade cycle earlier in the year, I could be wrong on that. I certainly call that the hip software upgrades. But how should we think about, the upgrade cycle for software of Mako in the install base, and what that can do for growth, maybe over the next 12 to 24 months within the existing customer base?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, look, software upgrades are important. They just help with the ease of use and billing productivity for the surgeon. We did a software upgrade on hips in the second quarter. We are working on one for knees as well. The hip one had some very important -- but it wasn't just a software upgraded that had easy to use to do with registration, which is one of the frustration points perhaps, but it also provides new information to the surgeon on pelvic tilt, which they're finding really beneficial. So I do expect it will cause -- it was already increasing the use of nickel for hips, but that'll probably accelerate into next year. But that software upgrade is still being deployed in the field and then we'll share more about the new software upgrade when that happens as well. So we're -- this is not new, we constantly look to provide better usability and usage factors to our surgeons. And that's a common thing. But I wouldn't call that inflection point. It's just a continued good customer experience, which we'd like to have with all our products. The real boon is just the adoption of Mako, the success surgeons are having, the hospitals purchasing their second and third and fourth Mako’s, the growth in teaching hospital, the growth in surgery centers. So there's just -- it's just kind of the inflection point that we're seeing that I think will continue to last for many quarters ahead.\nOperator: Next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good evening, and very nice quarter. Two questions. The first one is Mako related. There's a lot on this call. So I'll turn line in. Can you give us an idea of what percentage of hospitals currently have a robot? And where do you think it ultimately goes to? And instead of a cheaper question, because when we do our survey work, I talked to hospital administrators and physicians that have one, two, three, they seem to not be able to get enough robots or enough type of robots. I'd love your sort of view on the landscape. And then really, the second question has to do with seasonality. Is there anything happening in the big broad world outside of the pandemic that you think will impact the fourth quarter? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Thanks, Joanne. So look, the first question it's really just about when you're in a new market adoption, it's not easy to predict, right? How far will it go? Should robotics become standard of care, as we've seen happen in some other procedure areas? Maybe. And if it becomes standard of care, you can do the math of how many hospitals will do robotic procedures and surgery centers that are being added that do robotic procedures, there's a -- there's a huge number of robots still to be sold. And so that's -- that's the underlying question is, will it become the standard of care, that's expected in all procedures, and we're obviously striving for that. And the industry is moving in this direction, the pace of the curve is really hard to predict. But your points, right, and what we're seeing is, we always like to have certain champions with every robot that we sell. So we don't do mass sales of robots, we don't do C-suite sales of robots without certain champions, that's just not the way we operate. And so what happens is, the robots that we do sell, get used to right away. And when they're used, the surgeon shares their experience in the surgeon rounds with the other orthopedic surgeons, and then they want to watch this procedure, they get interested, and then they'd like to use it. And then what happens is, the robots fully booked, and that that surgeon gets frustrated, and then goes to the administrator and says, I'd like a robot for my procedures. That's a dynamic that we've seen happen over and over again. And that will continue. So at this point, how many hospitals there are that do the procedures? It's a large number. And we think that there's a long, long runway. We're still in the early stages of robotic adoption, in orthopedic procedures. Sorry, I lost the quote. The second question again, Joanne, do you mind repeating?\nJoanne Wuensch: Of course, second question that is in on seasonality, I can't we have a pandemic\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So, seasonality -- sorry. On the seasonality question, Q4 is normally our strongest seasonally quarter that we have. And so November, December, it's really hard to predict this year will we see the same type of seasonal impacts? The surgeons are saying they still want to be busy hospitals and realize the importance of elective procedures to their own profitability. And so will we see the normal push? I don't know, I know, the surgeons we talked to seem to think that they're going to be busy. But it's a question I can't answer because we really, we've never been through this with a pandemic. But right now, we're not seeing any signs of something changing. It seems like there's a normal dynamic outside of a pandemic. So as long as surgeons can go to operate, they're going to operate and they've become very creative in terms of figuring out how to do their cleaning protocols. They're actually very efficient. Some hospitals are opening longer hours, or even opening up on a Friday or on the weekends to stay busy. So we'll have to watch it closely. But I really don't have any new insights to provide, I don't expect something different from what we've seen in the past.\nOperator: Next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen. You may proceed.\nJosh Jennings: Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on the strong recovery. Wanted to ask future medical indication question, I you're not giving timelines. But just thinking about the development of the shoulder indication should be thinking about the development they’re being exclusive for right medical extremity portfolio? And those just the push out of that acquisition do anything to the timeline of make shoulder indication?\nKevin Lobo: We're not really going to get into the timeline. We believe that the robotic -- robotics shoulder is going to be compelling. Shoulder is a very difficult procedure to do as sort of more akin to partial knee than it is to total knee or total hips. And we believe it's going to be very, very compelling. We're excited about the progress that our team has made on the application and we're not going to talk yet about what implants are going to be married with the robot. But we will be sharing that at a later date.\nJosh Jennings: Okay. Understood. And then follow-up of STAR ankle divestiture, just thinking about the Stryker extremities portfolio, are there any other divestitures that need to occur before the close of the deal? And then just wondering, if you could help us with that as we think about forecasting out in 2021 and making sure we account for any other divestitures outside of STAR? Thanks a lot for taking the questions, guys.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. No, problem. So as we talked about, we're not going to get into too much more in terms of medical offering. Kevin mentioned the divestiture of STAR. We believe that we're on path with regulatory agencies to close the deal in November. And so we'll leave it at that.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kaila Krum with Truist. You may proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Sam on for Kaila. Thanks for taking my question. First one, I just wanted to ask about the Arrow System, Mobius -- curious how you described about a year end and now how that's performing? And then generally, how the -- capital market for imaging versus say the strength in robotics is performing? And then any impact you're seeing on call through to other businesses from that system?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Listen, we were thrilled with the Mobius acquisition, we bought a terrific technology. Our biggest challenge honestly, has been scaling up the manufacturing. So we've had very, very high demand for Mobius. It was a small company based in Shirley, Massachusetts where just large challenges really scale up and it’s the same challenge we've had, frankly, the TSO3, which is the sterilizing company that we bought, and a lot of times when we buy smaller companies, the demand tends to overwhelm us. And we have to go back to the design robustness and be able to scale the manufacturing, build new production lines. And so that's a high class problem, I would call it, we really, really pleased with the aero product, it performs extremely well. It frankly, had an increase in demand. In some cases, they were using it to look to do imaging for COVID. And so we've been frankly struggling to keep pace, but it's -- like I said, a high class probably -- we are really excited about, they also have good products in their pipeline as well. So it's a deal that -- that will be very much help correspondences for the long term. But we're still in the scale update.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And then just with resuming more spend on rep hiring into the fourth quarter, if you've maybe, maybe tease that out a little bit, we actually think about that in terms of more returned to normal rep hiring? Or are you thinking about maybe pressing your strength a little bit and getting a little more aggressive? While some competitors may be struggling? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. It's a good question, Sam. You know, I think I think it's the divisions look out towards 2021. And they're planning sort of their -- their budgets and where they can get to, it always will include new rep hiring. And so an absolutely our regular cycle is that we would get started on that in Q4. So I think that, most divisions are planning to expand their rep sales forces towards the end of Q4, and certainly on into January of next year. And that would be just part of the sort of the general territory management that we go to every single year.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thank you for taking the question. The first one I had, I want to follow-up on your comments on your bed launch and the bed market. And it had kind of a two part question. Really trying to understand, if you're seeing a trend towards bed market expanding and that could create more opportunity for you? And then was just hoping that you could comment on, how this new rollout to go you expect it to go into your own dates and do mostly conversion of your older beds? Or do you think there's a share game opportunity?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. So in terms of the bed market itself, I think there's probably a bit of both right. So there's, there's obviously going to be the replacing cycle of beds, it's going to continue to happen. But I think the pandemic is also created some opportunity for expansion in the market as well. So I think there's going to be a mix of both of those items as we go forward. With regards to productivity, and what that's going to do for us, again, we feel really strongly about that bed and the opportunity. And there will be some opportunity, like I said, both in terms of replacing a cycle that'll fit into and then expanding into competitive opportunities as well.\nMatt Taylor: And can I just ask the follow-up those really interested in your comments about standard of care robotics of Mako, and I think we've seen the knee value proposition is very strong. And I was wondering, if you also think that you can convert that to be the standard of care for hips over time and other areas that your vision that will be standard in many areas or more siloed?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. No, the vision is for it to be standard care everywhere where we have an application now. I think it will take longer, you've seen the adoption of hips has trailed the knees, the adoption in partial knee which very, very strong. I think the adoption a shoulder will be very, very strong. Knees will continue. And I think it's eventually just it's just going to take a little longer because frankly, the satisfaction level of patients with hips has been quite good relative to knee, so relative to shoulder. And I think over time, total ankles, there's many other areas that robotics will play in. And that's our expectation is that it will become standard of care. Just a question of how long will that take? And what iterations are required for us to get there.\nOperator: Next question comes from Richard Newitter with SVB. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Jamie on for Rich. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess. The first one I wanted ask you guys been pulled out some strength and smoke evacuation product line? I wanted to make sure I heard you correctly. Did you say that that grew double digits in the quarter? And then just kind of, digging into that a little bit what's really driving the strength in that product category? Is it something that you're really starting to see pickup now kind of just in the wake of COVID?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure. On the smoke evacuation, yes, I did reference that we had double digit growth in that product line. And honestly, even before COVID, most hospitals and caregivers have been very focused on safety and smoke evacuate lines up extremely well with that safety focus. I think with COVID, it's a sort of even more emphasized in terms of what that product does to the environment that they operate in, and how it contributes to the overall safety sort of platform and focus that we're seeing across all hospitals.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just as my follow-up. Talking about double digit growth in the neurovascular business, just curious and to get your thoughts on how sustainable you think that is with some of the new product launches you have had into 2021? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, we're accustomed to seeing our neurovascular burdens through double digit growth. This is something they've been doing for -- since we acquired the business almost once the target launches got rolled out and phoenix segments started to grow. And now that we have proposed a voting stance in the U.S. market, the China markets continuing to grow very strongly. So we expect continued double digit growth for some time with the tailwind in phoenix. And now, you're really addressing quarterly stance and aspiration. We really got a -- we had a terrific management team for a long time. They continue to be humming, and we expect that business to continue to perform extremely well.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nSteve Beuchaw: Hi. Thanks. I wonder if you could spend a bit more time on the ASC and outpatient environment. I think once upon a time, there were questions around the category that were probably rooted in some concern about pricing. But in this environment, it's clearly a tailwind. I know there was a question already about market share. But can you speak a little bit about the procedure growth trends and ASC and outpatients relative to hospitals? How much you think that's a sustainable trend beyond COVID? And how do you think about that commercially in as much as it could be a structural advantages of multi-line player versus a more concentrated line specific player? And then I do have a follow-up? \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, first, let's start by keeping in mind that a small number of our procedures, let's call it around 10%, of our large joint spine procedures are being done in the ASC. So it's not a big part of our business yet. But the trend is no doubt headed for more of these procedures being done in the ASC, part of that changing Medicare around needs. And we expect that to happen in hips. And so it's a trend that was already happening pre pandemic, it's a trend that will accelerate going forward. There's all kinds of prognostications about how much it'll be, could it be 50% of our procedures, it's hard to predict, how fast it'll move. But we believe we're really, really well positioned for this trend. And we do intend to be a multi-line player, that's what the ASC actually wants. It's unlike how the hospital but they have a different buying pattern in the surgery center. And the breadth of our portfolio is a huge advantage. And we plan to really leverage that strength wherever we can. So, we're feeling very good about it. It's a trend that in terms of pricing, we're not seeing really any change so far in the pricing dynamics, there is a constraint around capital ASCs are much more capital sensitive. So, we do tend to have more financing involved in surgery centers, but the overall equipped to do that without Flex Financial, we've been doing financing for a long, long time. So we're feeling very good about our position to be able to win in the ASC. And we do think it's going to be more important, and the trend will accelerate.\nSteve Beuchaw: Okay. That was actually a fantastic answer. You answered my next question. So I'll leave it there. Thank you so much.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And at this time, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo.\nKevin Lobo: So thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q4 results with you in January. And that's concludes the call.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with some perspectives on the recovery trends across our diverse businesses. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. I'm pleased to report that we returned to growth in Q3, posting organic sales growth of 3%. This represents a rapid improvement in our business, driven by a progressive return of elective procedures, ongoing demand for our medical capital products, and continued strong Mako performance. In the quarter, we saw uneven growth globally that correlates to the state of the pandemic. Preston will speak to this in his section. While we are pleased with the recovery of our business, the environment remains uncertain as flare ups of positive COVID cases are continuing. We had many achievements in the quarter that exemplify our commitment to innovation and providing our customers with the technologies needed to serve their patients. Beginning with Mako, we celebrated the installation of our 1,000th robotic system in the quarter. We've seen tremendous success with Mako since the launch of the total knee application in 2016 and this quarter was no different. We continue to believe that we're well positioned for sustained future success with Mako. Our spine and trauma and extremities businesses benefited from numerous recent product launches and Wright medical launched an exciting new acute care bed. Our neurovascular business also achieved some new product approvals in important market, which helped contribute to their double-digit global growth in the quarter. We maintained many of the policies put in place at the beginning of the pandemic focused on maintaining the safety of our employees and customers and aggressively managing spending. While sales and manufacturing have approached more normal levels, our spending levels were unusually low given the uncertainty regarding the pace of the recovery. Our R&D spending on an adjusted basis was 6.1% of sales slightly below our expectations as a result of COVID-related execution challenges, and some timing of spending. But none of this has caused any meaningful delays to new product timelines. The combination of sales growth and suppressed spending resulted in adjusted earnings per share $2.14 cents, up 12% versus the prior year. While some of our measures will remain in place -- our spending measures, we do expect some returns to hiring and investments to support future growth in Q4. Due to the continued uncertainty and lack of stability in many markets, we are not providing Q4 guidance at this time. We saw good momentum across many of our businesses in Q3, although the recovery curve acceleration moderated meaningfully in August and September, and has been on a similar trend so far in October. We are proceeding with the integration efforts related to the Wright medical transaction and are working cooperatively with regulators to obtain the necessary approvals for this transaction. This includes as previously announced the proposed divestiture of our STAR, Total Ankle Replacement product. We expect to close the transaction in November. Please note beyond this update, we will not be taking any questions regarding Wright Medical on today's call. Finally, I would like to thank our employees for continuing to serve our customers and finding ways to succeed during such challenging times. From our sales and service personnel in the field every day, with our customers to the marketing and R&D teams that are finding creative ways to connect globally, to advance new innovations, to our manufacturing teams and office staff who ensured the continuity of our business. We are living our mission statement, which is, together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better. And now over to Preston. Vijay, we can't hear you. Perfect. Yes, David, we're not going to really get into sort of guidance for 2021. We do that in every January, and right now we're planning to provide that in January. I think we've gotten good momentum across a lot of our businesses, you saw the trauma number, we posted a really strong number, they've launched a number of new products and feeling very good about that. And that's frankly before Wright Medical kicks in. So we're really excited about the momentum we're going to see across trauma and extremities next year. Neurovascular would be one that point that I'm really excited about. We have the surpass evolved next gen, flow-diverting stents stents approved in the United States and that had very good growth even though we're still having to go through the pains of posturing, but in the midst of a pandemic, so liberally from a small base, but that's going to pick up steam next year, as well our aspiration offerings with the neurovascular. So, neurovascular are very good as I look through into next year. And of course Mako will continue its positive trajectory that affects not just the Mako business, but of course hips and knees. And so those are all going well, instruments continues to be a really strong business for us and smoke evacuation you see is now becoming a standard in many areas called safety push, I think will continue beyond frankly the pandemic. And we've really established a really great stable of products related to safety. So, a lot of tailwinds. I think that will continue on a underlying basis. The big unknown is sort of how this pandemic evolved. It's still going to be with us obviously through the first half of next year in some way shape performing. And so that's not the big unknown, but a lot of the businesses that we have, we're feeling good about the momentum and the product cadence in your product, which I've already touched on some of them, we think will position as well for 2021. Yes, we're really pleased with the performance of the spine. I think that K2M, which was obviously tough integration. We knew would be tough, it was tough. We feel that that's largely behind us. I think we actually got a little bit of reprieve in the second quarter, honestly, to sort of get our inventory and get our position more stabilized. OUS, it's has been strong frankly from the beginning, but it getting that U.S. business on a better footing. We feel very good about that. They launched some new products, including Niagara, which is a lateral access product, a Corpectomy Cage. And so getting back to launching products, which is a big part of the K2M offense, excited that we're now back to launching new products versus sort of dealing with all of the integration challenges as it relates to sales force very stable. In fact, we're actually having sales reps wanting to come to join Stryker now in spine. So we really do feel the tide is starting to shift in spine and was definitely very good quarter. Yes, Thanks, Bob. We're actually very pleased with our hip performance. We had a good growth in hips, and we had a very tough comp from the prior year quarter where we outperformed the market in hip. So, overall, yes, competitors did well in hips. We also did well in hips. As you know, hips are a little less deferrable than knees, which really speaks to the strength we added in knees. But as it relates, the hips were very excited about two aspects of the pipeline. The first is the on Mako, we have a new software upgrade for hips that we launched in the second quarter, because of the pandemic, we haven't really been able to roll that out fully. It will get fully rolled out probably by the end of Q4. So it's a progressive rollout, but really will have more of an impact next year and in the second part of the pipeline is a new standard that we have planned sometime in the middle of next year, we'll get more specific around timing maybe in the January call. But that's going to be an exciting span, which has some features that surgeons like in a little bit of a gap in our portfolio. But overall, still pretty good quarter. Yes. Just like to add one comment. The other part of the physio business is called public access. So that's outside of the emergency in the hospitals. And that business really got very, very quiet in the second quarter, it came to a halt almost. And so that'll come back, that'll probably be a little slower, maybe more in the first quarter, second quarter of next year. So, Sage will come back a little bit sooner, maybe towards the end of the year, and then public access will come back, maybe in the first or second quarter of next year. So there are parts of the business that are drags right now that will turn positive. And now of course, some pops that took off in the pandemic that will start to moderate. But we love our medical business. We love the leadership we have in that business, and it will continue to be a really good performer for us. Yes, look, I'm not going to get into too many of the details about how we're doing it. But we are very pleased with our performance in ASCs, Mako number in the third quarter and ASC's with the highest number we've had so far in ASC, so Mako is part of the solution. We had double-digit growth in our sports medicine business. And of course, that plays in the ASC primarily. And so those are the proxy that you could use to figure out sort of how we're doing in the ACSs as we look at our sports med business. Look at the growth that we're having with Mako, there's a lot of other products that we have played very well in the surgery center market. And we just basically created an align offerings that aligns our divisions. As you know, in the hospital, we tend to operate very separately, and we go in by product category, we're not doing that in the ASC and this aligned offerings is really working very well. And I want to give credit to Eddie Pearson, the entire team that sort of established this office. It's working ahead of what I was expecting, and feel very bullish about it going forward. Sure, thanks, Matt. So let me start with Mako. So we only have the hip approved right now in China, we don't have yet have a total knee, we hope to get that in the first or second quarter of next year. It's taking longer than we had expected. But we're on track so we won't get it eventually approved. But we are getting sales with Mako for hip. But of course once you get the knee on the robot, and of course the sales will start to really accelerate. There's just been a general pickup in general. So the pandemic they've done a good job controlling the pandemic in the country. We've seen a pickup both in our Carson business, which is our lower priced products, as well as in the premium segment. So it's kind of I would say an across the board pickup that's occurring and really related to the Coronavirus. I think we had a great year last year in China, our best year on record in a good year, the year before we have strong management team both on the trusting side and in the premium segment. As you know, that's been a more recent thing for Stryker. So I would expect that we'll continue to see that kind of performance since the market conditions improved markedly. Yes, thanks. We intentionally slowed down M&A in the second quarter, just because we were not sure what was going to happen with the pandemic. We asked the teams to sort of put their pencils down, stay active in discussions. But we really wanted to be sure that -- we didn't know that recovery would happen quite this quickly. So we're pleased with that. We do have our M&A teams back up and running. Because of the right medical and the debt that we're taking on because of that, we don't expect to be doing very large deals in the next year or so. But we look for more tuck-in deals. And we do want to stay busy with M&A. And we've said that to the rating agencies. Our teams are actively looking at targets but they sort of never really stopped. It did just slowed down a little bit, while we saw sort of a pace of recovery. But you should expect us to get back to our normal kind of tuck-in offense, which will complement the right medical acquisition. Just to answer that, no, we don't expect that the sales cycles elongate. Matter of fact, it's one of the things that we've seen over the last couple of quarters is we've actually been able to get out and drive Mako even faster. And so there's still quite a bit of runway as you think about opportunities for Mako. So don't expect that that cycle to elongate. Yes, thanks. We're really not ready yet to publicly talk about what the robotic offering is. It will be important for our sponsors. It's no question. Mobius did come with a robotic pipeline product. Once we're ready, we'll share. We're actively working on an offering we're just not quite ready to share what that will be and what the timeline is. But stay tuned. Yes, look, I will tell you, first of all, we weren't surprised by the STAR there wasn't weaker than expected, it was certainly negative sales growth. In fact, it was -- everything we had was a little better than expected in terms of the pace of recovery. The nature of the sales cycle per Sage, you need to have a lot of activity in the hospital where you have procedures being done, where the products are being used, because they're consumed, as you have people in the ICU, that people that are getting procedures done. And so the census in the hospital was lower in the second quarter for sure. And certainly even in third quarter. And these products are bought in bulk, and they're put on the shelf, because they're consumed daily. So you have this sales cycle that it sort of has to be depleted, the inventories have to be depleted before they're reordered. So that's not at all a surprise the fact that the sales were negative, it just sort of explains why that was a drag in the U.S. on our medical business, we don't have a very big stage business outside the U.S., it's more of a U.S. phenomenon. But we love the products. In fact, we launched a new product, a self-oral care product, which is really exciting in the midst of the pandemic, which is getting great customer feedback. But of course, that's just going to take time for that to be ordered. And then they put on the shelf. So once the ordering, once the usage starts to happen, and the inventory start to bleed down, we're going to get sort of this bolus of reordering. And again, that may not occur fully in the fourth quarter, but towards the end of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. We'll expect that Sage to get back to its normal very strong growth. Yes, look, software upgrades are important. They just help with the ease of use and billing productivity for the surgeon. We did a software upgrade on hips in the second quarter. We are working on one for knees as well. The hip one had some very important -- but it wasn't just a software upgraded that had easy to use to do with registration, which is one of the frustration points perhaps, but it also provides new information to the surgeon on pelvic tilt, which they're finding really beneficial. So I do expect it will cause -- it was already increasing the use of nickel for hips, but that'll probably accelerate into next year. But that software upgrade is still being deployed in the field and then we'll share more about the new software upgrade when that happens as well. So we're -- this is not new, we constantly look to provide better usability and usage factors to our surgeons. And that's a common thing. But I wouldn't call that inflection point. It's just a continued good customer experience, which we'd like to have with all our products. The real boon is just the adoption of Mako, the success surgeons are having, the hospitals purchasing their second and third and fourth Mako's, the growth in teaching hospital, the growth in surgery centers. So there's just -- it's just kind of the inflection point that we're seeing that I think will continue to last for many quarters ahead. Okay. Thanks, Joanne. So look, the first question it's really just about when you're in a new market adoption, it's not easy to predict, right? How far will it go? Should robotics become standard of care, as we've seen happen in some other procedure areas? Maybe. And if it becomes standard of care, you can do the math of how many hospitals will do robotic procedures and surgery centers that are being added that do robotic procedures, there's a -- there's a huge number of robots still to be sold. And so that's -- that's the underlying question is, will it become the standard of care, that's expected in all procedures, and we're obviously striving for that. And the industry is moving in this direction, the pace of the curve is really hard to predict. But your points, right, and what we're seeing is, we always like to have certain champions with every robot that we sell. So we don't do mass sales of robots, we don't do C-suite sales of robots without certain champions, that's just not the way we operate. And so what happens is, the robots that we do sell, get used to right away. And when they're used, the surgeon shares their experience in the surgeon rounds with the other orthopedic surgeons, and then they want to watch this procedure, they get interested, and then they'd like to use it. And then what happens is, the robots fully booked, and that that surgeon gets frustrated, and then goes to the administrator and says, I'd like a robot for my procedures. That's a dynamic that we've seen happen over and over again. And that will continue. So at this point, how many hospitals there are that do the procedures? It's a large number. And we think that there's a long, long runway. We're still in the early stages of robotic adoption, in orthopedic procedures. Sorry, I lost the quote. The second question again, Joanne, do you mind repeating? Yes. So, seasonality -- sorry. On the seasonality question, Q4 is normally our strongest seasonally quarter that we have. And so November, December, it's really hard to predict this year will we see the same type of seasonal impacts? The surgeons are saying they still want to be busy hospitals and realize the importance of elective procedures to their own profitability. And so will we see the normal push? I don't know, I know, the surgeons we talked to seem to think that they're going to be busy. But it's a question I can't answer because we really, we've never been through this with a pandemic. But right now, we're not seeing any signs of something changing. It seems like there's a normal dynamic outside of a pandemic. So as long as surgeons can go to operate, they're going to operate and they've become very creative in terms of figuring out how to do their cleaning protocols. They're actually very efficient. Some hospitals are opening longer hours, or even opening up on a Friday or on the weekends to stay busy. So we'll have to watch it closely. But I really don't have any new insights to provide, I don't expect something different from what we've seen in the past. We're not really going to get into the timeline. We believe that the robotic -- robotics shoulder is going to be compelling. Shoulder is a very difficult procedure to do as sort of more akin to partial knee than it is to total knee or total hips. And we believe it's going to be very, very compelling. We're excited about the progress that our team has made on the application and we're not going to talk yet about what implants are going to be married with the robot. But we will be sharing that at a later date. Yes. Listen, we were thrilled with the Mobius acquisition, we bought a terrific technology. Our biggest challenge honestly, has been scaling up the manufacturing. So we've had very, very high demand for Mobius. It was a small company based in Shirley, Massachusetts where just large challenges really scale up and it's the same challenge we've had, frankly, the TSO3, which is the sterilizing company that we bought, and a lot of times when we buy smaller companies, the demand tends to overwhelm us. And we have to go back to the design robustness and be able to scale the manufacturing, build new production lines. And so that's a high class problem, I would call it, we really, really pleased with the aero product, it performs extremely well. It frankly, had an increase in demand. In some cases, they were using it to look to do imaging for COVID. And so we've been frankly struggling to keep pace, but it's -- like I said, a high class probably -- we are really excited about, they also have good products in their pipeline as well. So it's a deal that -- that will be very much help correspondences for the long term. But we're still in the scale update. Yes. It's a good question, Sam. You know, I think I think it's the divisions look out towards 2021. And they're planning sort of their -- their budgets and where they can get to, it always will include new rep hiring. And so an absolutely our regular cycle is that we would get started on that in Q4. So I think that, most divisions are planning to expand their rep sales forces towards the end of Q4, and certainly on into January of next year. And that would be just part of the sort of the general territory management that we go to every single year. Yes. No, the vision is for it to be standard care everywhere where we have an application now. I think it will take longer, you've seen the adoption of hips has trailed the knees, the adoption in partial knee which very, very strong. I think the adoption a shoulder will be very, very strong. Knees will continue. And I think it's eventually just it's just going to take a little longer because frankly, the satisfaction level of patients with hips has been quite good relative to knee, so relative to shoulder. And I think over time, total ankles, there's many other areas that robotics will play in. And that's our expectation is that it will become standard of care. Just a question of how long will that take? And what iterations are required for us to get there. Yes. Look, we're accustomed to seeing our neurovascular burdens through double digit growth. This is something they've been doing for -- since we acquired the business almost once the target launches got rolled out and phoenix segments started to grow. And now that we have proposed a voting stance in the U.S. market, the China markets continuing to grow very strongly. So we expect continued double digit growth for some time with the tailwind in phoenix. And now, you're really addressing quarterly stance and aspiration. We really got a -- we had a terrific management team for a long time. They continue to be humming, and we expect that business to continue to perform extremely well. Yes. Look, first, let's start by keeping in mind that a small number of our procedures, let's call it around 10%, of our large joint spine procedures are being done in the ASC. So it's not a big part of our business yet. But the trend is no doubt headed for more of these procedures being done in the ASC, part of that changing Medicare around needs. And we expect that to happen in hips. And so it's a trend that was already happening pre pandemic, it's a trend that will accelerate going forward. There's all kinds of prognostications about how much it'll be, could it be 50% of our procedures, it's hard to predict, how fast it'll move. But we believe we're really, really well positioned for this trend. And we do intend to be a multi-line player, that's what the ASC actually wants. It's unlike how the hospital but they have a different buying pattern in the surgery center. And the breadth of our portfolio is a huge advantage. And we plan to really leverage that strength wherever we can. So, we're feeling very good about it. It's a trend that in terms of pricing, we're not seeing really any change so far in the pricing dynamics, there is a constraint around capital ASCs are much more capital sensitive. So, we do tend to have more financing involved in surgery centers, but the overall equipped to do that without Flex Financial, we've been doing financing for a long, long time. So we're feeling very good about our position to be able to win in the ASC. And we do think it's going to be more important, and the trend will accelerate. Okay. Great. Thank you. So thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q4 results with you in January. And that's concludes the call."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks Preston. Today I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 3.3% in the quarter. These results included growth in the U.S. of 3.5% and international growth of 2.8%. As a reminder, the quarter included the same number of selling days as Q3 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4% from the prior year quarter while foreign currency had a favorable 0.4% impact on sales. During the quarter, we return to growth this demand for our procedural base products came back strongly in most key geographies and demand for large capital primarily Mako and medical beds remained strong. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.14 represents growth of 12% from the prior year quarter. The foreign currency impact on the third quarter EPS was a creative by $0.01. The strong EPS growth was mainly driven by sales dropped through, favorable sales mix, discipline cost control, and better than expected gross margin leverage as our manufacturing output returned to more normal production levels. I will now provide some brief comments on our segment sales. Orthopedics had constant currency and organic growth of 3.8%. This included us growth of 7.5%. We saw growth across knees, hips, trauma, extremities, and Mako which grew 30.2% in the quarter. Additionally, all these products are growing up strong U.S. comparables from Q3 2019. Internationally, orthopedics had an organic decline of 4.7%, which reflects the slower recovery of elective procedures in Europe as a result of COVID restrictions, partially offset by a positive Mako performance. Medsurg had constant currency growth of 2.9% and organic growth of 2.5%, which included organic growth of 1.4% in the U.S. Instruments had us organic sales growth of 1.9%, reflecting increased demand for our safety related products, including waste management and smoke evacuation products, the latter of which had double-digit growth. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 1%. This reflects a return to growth primarily driven by our sports medicine business, where we had double-digit growth. This was partially offset by moderate declines in core endoscopy and communications businesses. The medical division had U.S. organic growth of 3%, resulting from strong demand across its bed business, growing double-digits and emerging emergency care business growing high single-digits. These were partially offset by a decline in our [Indiscernible] business. Internationally, Medsurg had organic sales of 6.7%, reflecting very strong demand for medical products combined with positive performances across most of our Medsurg product categories in all major geographies. Neuro technology and spine had a constant currency growth of 5.5% in organic growth of 4.3%. Our U.S. neurotech business posted constant currency growth of 3.1%, including 1.7% of organic growth for the quarter. Overall, this reflects positive performances in our spine, CMF, and neurovascular businesses and included double-digit growth in our ischemic products. Internationally, neuro technology and spine had organic growth of 9.8% including double-digit performances in our hemorrhagic and ischemic products, and a very strong performance in our spine business. Now, I will discuss our operating metrics in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.9% was favorable 20 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin was favorably impacted by volume and business mix, which was partially offset by price and some unabsorbed fixed costs. Although our manufacturing output returned to more normalized levels during the quarter, there was a somewhat negative impact related to our idle manufacturing lines at the beginning of the quarter. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.1% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 31.7% of sales, which was 210 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, SG&A was favorably impacted by operating expense savings action enacted in March, which continued in the third quarter. In summary for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 28% of sales. All of the spend control measures that were enacted in March continued through Q3. These measures covered most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments and hiring travel, meetings, and outside consultants. As our businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels, we do anticipate that there will be increases in hiring, discretionary expenses, and other costs that support future growth and business expansion. Related to other income and expense compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and an increase in interest expense related to additional debt outstanding. Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 16.1%. Turning to cash flow and liquidity, we ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of $7.2 billion, which includes $5 billion of funds related to the Wright medical acquisition. We also generated approximately $830 million of cash from operations in the quarter, which was again ahead of our internal targets. This strong operating cash flow reflects strong net earnings and a reduction in poor working capital versus the prior year. The actions that were implemented in the first quarter to conserve cash continued in Q3, which included discretionary spending controls, reductions in planned capital expenditures and project spending, focusing on opportunities and accounts payable, and slowing our M&A activities. As it relates to guidance for Q4 and the full year, we reaffirm our previously announced decision to withdraw guidance, given the continued significance of uncertainties at this time. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. So thanks, Vijay. We're pretty excited about the performance in our business. It's not a one quarter thing. I think you've seen our joint replacement division, which includes hips, knees and Mako have been performing well for some time. And that momentum is continuing. I mentioned in my opening remarks that we're pleased with October, it's going well so far in the month. But I really don't want to speculate on November, December, just given all the products that are occurring, assuming that the market stays fairly stable, we're going to have a good fourth quarter. But that's a big assumption given this is, obviously a once in a lifetime type of pandemic. So I don't want to get ahead of myself, but we were feeling good about the business through the month of October. Yes. Hi, Larry, this is Glenn. You're right during Q2 and Q3, we obviously continued a lot of the cost containment measures that we had enacted in March. And these were kind of things that other companies probably have looked at travel, meetings, training, consulting. And just the real whole gamut of discretionary spending was really kind of locked down. We also slowed our hiring. We slowed project spending on sort of non R&D type projects. And I would say, coming out of this, you're absolutely right, we've learned sort of new ways to work. We're doing this call virtually, and it seems to be working fine. We also have launched virtual training with customers, and also internally that has worked very well. And so I would say, some of that very definitely will carry over to the future in terms of how we sort of emerged from the pandemic and what our operating structure looks like. That being said though, as we get back to more normalized operations, and back to a growth trend that we expect to be at, there will be increases to all those expenses. And some of them will return to pre-COVID levels just because that's what we'll need to support sort of the growth assertions that we'll have. Key projects will start back up. We'll see hiring pick back up. So all of that will start to grow with -- as we emerge from this. So, if you think about the 30 to 50 basis points, I do think that probably a more normalized basis to look at would be looking at 2019 in terms of an off margin that that we might assert relative growth off of. But we have not backed away at all from our financial assertions, we will grow at the high-end of Medtech. And we will continue to expand our off margin 30 to 50 basis points. Yes. No, problem. So as we talked about, we're not going to get into too much more in terms of medical offering. Kevin mentioned the divestiture of STAR. We believe that we're on path with regulatory agencies to close the deal in November. And so we'll leave it at that. Yes. So in terms of the bed market itself, I think there's probably a bit of both right. So there's, there's obviously going to be the replacing cycle of beds, it's going to continue to happen. But I think the pandemic is also created some opportunity for expansion in the market as well. So I think there's going to be a mix of both of those items as we go forward. With regards to productivity, and what that's going to do for us, again, we feel really strongly about that bed and the opportunity. And there will be some opportunity, like I said, both in terms of replacing a cycle that'll fit into and then expanding into competitive opportunities as well. Sure. On the smoke evacuation, yes, I did reference that we had double digit growth in that product line. And honestly, even before COVID, most hospitals and caregivers have been very focused on safety and smoke evacuate lines up extremely well with that safety focus. I think with COVID, it's a sort of even more emphasized in terms of what that product does to the environment that they operate in, and how it contributes to the overall safety sort of platform and focus that we're seeing across all hospitals."

            "content": "Thanks Kevin. Today my comments will focus on providing additional thoughts on the current environment and the recovery of select devices and geographies during the third quarter. We've generally seeing a V-shaped recovery through the second quarter with the continued momentum and growth in the third quarter, although at a more moderated level of month-over-month improvement. The sales growth and improved performance in the third quarter was driven by three main factors, the continued acceleration of electric procedures, strong demand for many of our large capital products, and the return of our more event-driven businesses like trauma and stroke. Small capital products, including our video cameras and power tools show nice improvement for the lack of other products in their recovery. These products generally trail electric procedure volumes by a few months. Despite a resurgence in infection rates globally, we saw sales growth in most developed markets led by strong recovery in the United States, Australia, Germany, and Canada. These markets were operating around pre-COVID levels throughout the quarter. Our China business returns to double-digit growth in the quarter, with procedures returning to more normal levels despite the government taking a more aggressive approach to lockdowns around COVID infection. The UK, India, and parts of our Latin American businesses continue to lag as they work through heightened impacts of the pandemic. Procedural areas that were deferred or soft during the second quarter showed significant improvements in the quarter, our knee, spine, trauma and extremities and sports medicine businesses all achieved year-over-year growth. This also showed significant improvement in the quarter reaching prior year levels. Each of these businesses benefited from the acceleration of electrodes procedures during the quarter that was fueled by the addition of new patients and the recovery of the previously differed backlog. Surgeons and healthcare providers continue to work through the new and existing backlog by adding incremental procedures to their normal schedules. With the continued variability of infection rate, we believe that hospitals are better prepared to ensure that these types of elective procedures can still be performed at some level, unlike the dramatic drop that we saw in April. However, the efficient ratio remains fluid and procedural impact and recovery will continue to vary across geography. Demand for our large capital products drove strong growth in the quarter, including ongoing high demand for our Mako robotic technology. In the third quarter, we were very pleased with the acceleration of Mako installations both within the U.S. and markets outside the U.S., so we continue to expand our Mako presence. Recently, Brazil approved full use of our Mako robotic technology for both hip and knee procedures. We are also experiencing increased utilization with a growing percentage of hip and knee surgeries being performed with a Mako robot. Within our medical division we saw strengthen our emergency care business along with continued high demand for our beds and stretchers, demonstrating improved financial stability of our customers aided by government subsidies like the CARES Act, and the resurgence of the positive cash flow driven by the continuation of elective procedures. As a result, our order book remains a robust for both Mako and many of our medical practice. The launch of the new acute care bed security is a contributor to that order book and a demonstration of our ongoing commitment innovation during the pandemic. With our specialized unit, category-leading product portfolio, and innovative technologies, we are well-positioned to continue our above marketing Medtech growth. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Vijay, are you on mute? We can now. Hey, Vijay, it's Preston. Just to expand on that a little bit, I mean, we do continue to have confidence in our capital business. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if you look at our large capital business and demand that we saw on Mako, and then on the medical business in particular, we feel really, really good about that. Small capital, as we talked about in the remarks as well, we expect that to continue to come along and recovery curve as well. Although, it has shown that improvement but lags a little bit, some of the other products in terms of that recovery. And I think overall we feel good about it, we feel good about where orders have come in, feel good about where our customers are in terms of their financial stability at this point in time, certainly compared to where it was a quarter ago and because of those items, we feel confident in where our capital business is headed. I think all of that is underscored, as Kevin said by the uncertainty that still remains with regards to debt flare ups and how the virus continues to kind of move through different regions. Hey, Robbie. It's Preston. So, I'd say, in general, it's hard to predict exact percentages with regards to how much of a backlog has been worked through versus what are new patients that are coming into that funnel. Based on the feedback that we've got, we know that surgeons are continuing to work through that backlog, and that they're also adding new patients. So, it's definitely a mix of the two. We also know that there are some patients that are still waiting with anxiety to get their procedures done. But all-in-all clinics and surgeons remain busy, and they're continuing to look to add additional shifts or additional opportunities to add surgery or even a shift to the outpatient setting. Our expectation is that that trend will continue, again, barring any major disruptions from a COVID perspective. Yes, look, we continue to feel very bullish about Mako, I think in Q4, we're going to have to unless something bizarre happens in the marketplace, it'll be a record quarter in Q4, because the order book is still very strong, with over 1,000. And we've kind of hit an inflection point. And in robotics, the interest in robotics is increasing every day, teaching hospitals are adopting robotics. And they're feeling the pressure to have robotics as part of their programs. And in some cases, they've been holding off a little bit. So for us, the momentum is palpable, it's continuing, it's strong. And it's even starting to pick up in other markets such as Japan and countries in Europe, they did a little bit of a pause in that second quarter. We saw them coming back, frankly, in the third quarter. So, the outlook for Mako continues to be very bullish. And it's really irrespective of competition. This is sort of a market trend that's changing the market shifting. And we really love the offering that we have in this category. Hey, Bob, it's Preston. I think as I mentioned specifically on the capital side, we feel very confident where we're heading in terms of durability on that business, particularly as we think about things like beds and stretchers, with the launch of the new bed adding to that portfolio, very, very excited about what that's going to bring and do for us. Sage, Sage had a smaller quarter in terms of hips growth, obviously, an improvement from the second quarter, but still a little bit of a decline versus prior year. Given that business in terms of stocking and the purchase cycle, we really do expect that business can turn the corner as well as we go into the next quarter and into 2021. So I think we'll see some positive dynamics from that business. And then overall, obviously, we've seen some impact on the pandemic. And we would expect that we'll continue to see momentum on our businesses as we go forward. Specifically, as it relates to the OUS business, as you noted, we had a very strong Q3 performance really across both emergency care and our acute care business. I think it's important to note that we were really having big performances in the OUS space even before really the impact of the pandemic. And our expectation would be that even though while we're seeing some benefits, certainly from the pandemic, that we will continue to build on the momentum that I started giving before that as we go forward. So I think all-in-all, feeling very good about the future from a medical standpoint."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your Operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with some perspectives on the recovery trends across our diverse businesses. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. As we begin today's call, I would like to start by thanking all our employees for their continued commitment to ensuring the safety of their colleagues, their families, and our customers. I'm very pleased with the resiliency of our organization, which has maintained high employee engagement and customer connections through the pandemic, from our sales forces who remain present and essential to the doctors and caregivers they support, to our manufacturing teams that have worked around the clock to optimize supply with ever-changing demand, and across our workforce, most of whom continue to collaborate virtually, the Stryker's spirit remains alive and well. Our second quarter sales declined organically by 24%, reflecting the impacts of COVID-19 across all geographies and the majority of our product lines. The results reflect progressive improvement in overall sales through the quarter, but do vary by region. The sequential improvement can be tied to the initial cancellation and subsequent gradual return elective procedures during the quarter. As mentioned in our first quarter call, we took aggressive steps early on to ensure the safety of our employees and customers while managing discretionary spending across our P&L in response to the slowdown in sales. Our cost containment measures included significant reductions in travel and meetings, a slow down in hiring, and salary reductions across senior leaders. In addition, we made other efforts to focus on cash conservation, including the idling of select product lines and facilities across our network starting in May. These actions combined with our sales performance resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.64, a decline of nearly 68% versus the prior year. As we look at the quarter, the low point in sales occurred in April, and then improved sequentially through the end of June. As a reminder, implants and disposables represent about 75% of our sales, and small capital represents 16%. Small capital generally mirrors the performance and trends of implants and disposables. The largest improvements within the quarter were in hips, knees, spine trauma, sports medicine, and neurotechnology, reflecting the resumption of electric procedures, and the gradual opening of previously locked down communities and geographies. With respect to our large capital businesses, Medical Capital and Mako were standouts, both posting strong growth to the quarter. Our Mako Robotic technology remains in high demand with our customers, despite any financial constraints resulting from the pandemic. By geography, Japan and Canada performed well, while Europe, China, and Australia showed progressive improvements through the quarter. In contrast, Latin America and India continue to be weaker as the impacts of COVID-19 remain more widespread in those regions. In Q3, we expect the recovery to continue, but do not expect it to be linear, while local governments deal with varying degrees of resurgences. Our R&D programs continue to proceed despite logistical challenges caused by the pandemic, and we spent at a healthy rate in the quarter. We are actively engaging with our customers, while ensuring that our product supplies in a strong position to capitalize as procedures resume. However, given the fluid nature of this situation, we are not providing Q3 or full-year guidance. We are proceeding with the integration efforts regarding the Wright Medical transaction. We are working cooperatively with the regulators to obtain the necessary approvals for the transaction, and including as previously announced proposing to divest our STAR total ankle replacement product. This process is well underway and the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority recently announced that it will consider our proposed undertakings in lieu of a Phase 2 investigation. We continue to expect to close the transaction around the end of Q3 or beginning of Q4. Please note beyond this update, we will not be taking any questions regarding Wright Medical, or the pending transaction on today's call. This has been the most unique situation that most of us have ever experienced. While we have been impacted financially as a result of the government shutdowns and deferrals of elective procedures, this time has also allowed us opportunities to reevaluate and develop new ways to work and collaborate across our diverse group of businesses. We are prepared to emerge from the pandemic as stronger, more efficient company. I remain confident in our people, our culture, and our ability to partner with our customers to meet the needs of the many patients they serve. And now over to Preston.\nPreston Wells: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment and how certain countries and products performed during the quarter. We saw progressive improvement in sales throughout the quarter, with April being the low point. The improving trends were primarily driven by the resumption of elective procedures. That momentum is continuing into Q3 as July is trending better than June. We estimate that approximately 40% to 50% of our total global revenue includes procedures that are considered elective, or more accurately and be in many cases deferred for a period of time. This primarily includes hips and knees, extremities, spine, sports medicine, and our ENT business. Geographically, elective procedure recovery varied depending on the government action and severity of the pandemic. In addition to the U.S., countries like China, Australia, and Germany have also shown month-to-month improvements as elective procedures returned during the quarter, reaching approximately 85% to 90% of pre-COVID levels. The U.K., India, and Latin America lagged during the quarter at less than 50% of pre-COVID levels, as the pandemic continues to spread in these countries. During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our large capital products, specifically beds and stretchers within our medical division, and ongoing high demand for our Mako robotics technology. In the second quarter, we were very pleased with the Mako installations in the U.S., including increased sales to ASU and competitive accounts. We continue to see a growing percentage of both hip and knee replacement surgeries being performed with a Mako robot. As it relates to knee, there's an ongoing shift towards the metals. We also launched a new software upgrade for the Mako Hip program. That includes features, which improve the overall ease of use. Our leadership in orthopedic robotics, a strong order book, and a solid innovation pipeline positions us well to see continued above market growth in joint replacement. While we have made meaningful reductions and many discretionary spend items, our investment in R&D remains robust, as does our healthy cadence of new product introductions. During the first-half of the year, we are pleased with the customer feedback and results from several new products, some of which include spine [diagonal] [ph] lateral system, mini-frag plating and trauma, and Neurovascular Vecta 71 and 74 intermediate catheters. These and other launches will contribute to our performance for the rest of the year and position us well for the future. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a slowdown in elective procedures, it has also placed increased emphasis on the safety of healthcare providers and their patients. Over the years, we have built an extensive portfolio within our MedSurg businesses, addressing many of the challenges our customers face with the focus on accident, and infection prevention, and caregiver safety. This includes product just like our patient hygiene and disinfecting products, personal protective equipment, waste management and smoke evacuation devices along with the LUCAS chest compression system, which delivers high-quality automated CPR, while reducing the proximity of the caregiver to the patient. With the ongoing threat of COVID-19 infections, the Department of Defense identified automated compression devices, such as the LUCAS device as the best practice for delivery of CPR. Demand for these patients grew during the quarter in response to these increased safety concerns. We will continue to leverage our diverse portfolio to address changing trends and meet the expectations of our customers, caregivers, and patients. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results, related drivers, and liquidity matters. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales decline was 24% in the quarter. These results included a decline in the U.S. to 27.4%, and an international decline of 14.5%. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as compared to Q2, 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.2% from the prior quarter, and foreign currency had an unfavorable 0.8% impact on sales. During the quarter, our growth was significantly negatively impacted by reductions in elective surgeries, the effects of shelter in place orders across many geographies, and the pause in hospital capital spending as the medical community navigates this pandemic. Throughout the quarter, we saw progressive improvement in the expansion of elective surgeries across many geographies, which resulted in significant variability in our sales. On an overall basis, our sales declined range from minus 36% in April, to minus 10% in June. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $0.64 represents a decline of 67.7% from Q2 2019. The foreign currency impact on second quarter EPS was minimal. Certain other factors resulted in disproportionately negative impacts on EPS including the loss of higher margin sales and a loss of leverage related to manufacturing and operational fixed costs. These were partially offset by our strong focus on disciplined cost control within the quarter. I will now provide some brief comments on segment sales. Orthopedics has constant currency and organic sales decline of 29.3%. This included a U.S. decline of 28.8%. We saw declines across our hip, knee, and trauma businesses. We also saw very strong growth in our Mako business somewhat offset by declines in [indiscernible]. Internationally orthopedics had an organic decline of 30.4%, which reflects the downturn in electric procedures across most geographies. MedSurg had constant currency decline of 16.4% and organic sales decline of 17%, which included a 22.2% decline in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales decline of 38%, driven by power tools, waste management, and surg account. This was partially offset by increases in the instruments, PPE products, namely our plain helmet and other protective products. As a reminder, instruments also had a very high comparable in Q2, 2019 with 19% growth. Endoscopy at U.S. organic sales decline of 34.1%, this reflects a slowdown in its video general surgery, communications, and sports medicine businesses. The medical division had U.S. organic growth of 5.4%, reflecting strong demand across it's bad and emergency care businesses, resulting from demand tied to COVID-19, which was offset by declines in stage, related to less patient slum. Internationally MedSurg had organic sales growth of 4.6%, reflecting strong demand for products in Australia, Canada, Europe, and emerging markets. neurotechnology and spine had a constant currency decline of 28.9% and an organic decline of 29.9%. Our U.S. neurotech business posted a constant currency decline of 36.4% and a 37.5% organic decline for the quarter. This reflects a slowdown in procedures in the quarter related to all our neurotech businesses. The decline was most pronounced in our ENT neurosurgical and CMF businesses. Internationally neurotechnology and spine had an organic decline of 13%, reflecting slowdowns in Europe, Canada, and emerging markets, which was offset by a solid performance in our neurovascular business. Now I will discuss operating metrics in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 57.3% was unfavorable 850 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by fixed cost absorption and business mix. The fixed cost absorption was significant and related to certain costs associated with idle manufacturing that normally would be capitalized into inventory. During Q2, we operated at 60% of normal capacity and the related unabsorbed costs diluted our margin by approximately 400 basis points. We anticipate Q3 will be at an average capacity of approximately 85%, unabsorbed costs will continue to impact our margin until our manufacturing is operating at normal levels. Adjusted R&D spending was 7.6% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 37.1% of sales, which was 360 basis points unfavorable to the prior-year quarter. Compared to the prior-year, SG&A was unfavorably impacted by business mix and de-leveraging of selling and marketing costs partially offset by operating expense savings actions taken during the quarter. In summary, for the quarter our adjusted operating margin was 12.5% of sales. The measures we enacted in March, covering most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings and consulting, as well as the idling of certain manufacturing lines and facilities including furloughing the related workers continued throughout the second quarter. Related to other income and expense as compared to prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding. Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.4%. Turning to cash flow and liquidity, we ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of $6.6 billion, including $4.6 billion related to Wright Medical funding and generated approximately $620 million of cash from operations in the quarter, which was ahead of our internal targets. This reflects earnings and a reduction in working capital primarily driven by accounts receivable during the quarter. As I noted in January, we did not repurchased any shares in Q1 nor do we plan to do so the remainder of the year. The actions that we implemented in the first quarter to conserve cash continued in Q2, and included discretionary spending controls, reduction in planned capital expenditures and project spending, focusing on opportunities and accounts payable and slowing M&A activities. Concerning our cash holdings and available credit lines, from a liquidity standpoint, we continue to be well positioned. We currently have available credit lines, none of which are drawn on at this time of approximately $3 billion. In addition, our investment grade credit rating supports good access to the capital markets and we have taken advantage of historically low rates to execute additional funding in the quarter of approximately $2.3 billion for the Wright Medical transaction. As it relates to this transaction, we estimate completing the required funding in the third quarter with the execution of up to an additional $1 billion. In terms of other future capital requirements, our quarterly dividend is approximately $215 million and we have one $300 million bond maturity due in Q4. As it relates to guidance for Q3 and the full-year, we reaffirm our previously announced decision to withdraw guidance given the continued significance of uncertainties at this time. We will continue to evaluate operating circumstances and the market environment for stability prior to reinstitution of guidance. And now I will open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first call comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. I'm sorry. Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.\nBob Hopkins: Thanks. Can you hear me okay?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, we can Bob.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Hey, Kevin and Preston, thanks for taking the question. First question is, if I heard you correctly, this June revenues were down 10% for the whole company. Can you give me a sense as to how variable the growth was within divisions for June? I'm sure folks would love to hear kind of how hips and knees did in June relative to that 10%.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Sure, Bob. This is Glenn. I think in general, we are not giving specific guidance, but that minus 10% is directionally correct across most of our businesses, and then we fully expect to see continued momentum moving into July.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. So, that was the right number. Okay. And then, one other thing I'd add rather just in terms of thinking about the rest of the year, and appreciate you don't have guidance here, but most Medtech companies have offered up some comments on Q4 that suggests they think a reasonable first [cut at] [ph] Q4 is that they might be up a little bit, or down a little bit on the year, plus or minus zero is kind of what we are hearing from a lot of your peers. I know you're not giving full guidance, but is there any reason to think that Stryker might be way outside of that band is to the positive or the negative, given what you are seeing in your business?\nKevin Lobo: Bob, there's a reason we're not giving guidance, right, because we just don't know what's going to happen in the future, but there isn't any reason to think that there's something widely different about our business. We performed slightly better than the market, 100 to 200 basis points on top line we've done it for eight years in a row. You should expect us to continue to have the same type of performance, and it really does depend on what the market does, and once we have a better visibility we'll give guidance, but there's nothing unique about our business that would cause us to be widely out of line.\nBob Hopkins: Okay, thanks for that. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And pardon the interruptions as we work through a few logistics. And your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple for me here, one on Capital One strategic, for Kevin; so Kevin, just on the broader capital environment, I'm just curious, you did a distinction this afternoon of small capital versus large capital. Why don't you just give us a sense of how you see the capital environment, how hospitals are reacting to the CARES Act? I think a lot of investors are concerned about significant volatility or lack of demand for certain types of products, maybe you could help us with sort of small capital, large capital, with maybe some emphasis on -- the bed business is very strong, specifically strong internationally, and how durable you see that business? And I have a quick follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Okay, great. Well, so first of all, starting off with the CARES Act, so $175 billion that's been authorized to go to hospitals, only $115 billion has actually been disbursed. So, there's still another $60 billion to be disbursed, and that's prior to the next round of legislation, right. The next stimulation package will add to that, and so, money is flowing to the hospitals. We are really pleased with the performance of medical, obviously. Small capital tends not to be as much of a worry. They needed to do the procedures. So, that's why it tends to trend very, very closely with elective procedures. They need power tools to do the knee replacement. They need the cameras to do the general surgery products. So, that tends never to be really hit too much. It's more of a large capital that tends to be the constraint, but because of the coronavirus, a lot of our large capital in terms of beds and structures were actually necessary, and we saw those being purchased. Mako was really a pleasant surprise in the quarter to see the amount of robots we're able to install. There was more financing than normal, I would say in the second quarter, as hospitals tried to conserve as much short-term [caches] [ph] as they could, but it's hard to predict how this is going to play out over the course of the year, I would say for now, we're feeling very good about the state of our businesses. Internationally, we had a terrific performance out of medical, and a lot of that is governments around the world really saying this is really important to have LUCAS, chest compression devices, very important to have ICU beds, et cetera, and so, we had just a terrific performance. We also don't have stages as a much smaller business for medical outside the United States. So, that weighed heavily on our U.S. performance. We actually had strong medical capital in the United States as well, but we're feeling very good about the state of the capital business. It's not like the last time where you didn't have this kind of stimulation from the government to tickle going directly into hospitals, and hospitals are very motivated to increase their procedures.\nDavid Lewis: Okay, very helpful. And then, Kevin, as we head into next year, you seem very committed to the Wright Medical transaction. So, as we head into '21, your Stryker's balance sheet will be the most levered it's been in the most recent memory certainly. So, one of the hallmarks of the business has been the ability to be flexible and go after growth-oriented M&A, and you've been one of the two top most active acquirers in large cap Medtech. So, how should investors think about your ability to do deals in '21 and beyond for '21 and '22, and should they all be concerned about the inability to do deals having an impact on the growth rate over the next couple of years? Thanks so much.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thank you. So, clearly, we'll be at a high leverage point, and we do have intentions to start paying down that debt, but we haven't stopped our business development teams. They're still out looking at targets. I would expect that they won't be much necessarily as large as some of the targets we've done more recently, but you should expect us to continue to be busy with bolt-on type of acquisitions, and as you saw, we had a really strong performance in cash flow in the second quarter, as we generate cash we'll be able to both pay down debt and stay busy in the M&A market.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citigroup.\nJoanne Wuensch: Hi, everybody. Two questions; the first one is, is there a particular segment that you see recovering faster than others, and the second question really is, as you look into next year, help me understand how to think about the financial model and some sense of normalcy? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Well, I think we were pretty clear in the opening comments that our businesses really recover with the recovery of surgery, and so, as surgeries come back, all of our businesses are sort of resuming at a very similar pace. We don't have huge variability, I would say early on in the pandemic ENT because it was aerosolizing procedures are clearly the hardest hit, and then the hips and knees were sort of next hardest hit, but I would say, now as the economies reopening, we're really getting a nice uptick across full portfolio. There really isn't that much variability as it relates to the elective procedures. Capital is a little bit different. So, in large capital area, the booms and lights and that type of capital wasn't as robust as beds and stretchers and Mako. So, there is some variability, but again, not too dramatic, and so, I think you're going to see our business kind of come back as the economy comes back in a fairly synchronous manner. And I wasn't quite sure I got your question about next year's financial model. Joanne, do you mind repeating that?\nJoanne Wuensch: Sure. I'm just trying to look past this year in some ways, because investors are evaluating stocks on '21 and in some cases, '22, and so, I'm just trying to think of how do you think about next year, and it could be qualitatively or quantitatively?\nKevin Lobo: Glenn, I think you are muted.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Hey, sorry, Joanne, I was muted. I gave you a great answer, though.\nJoanne Wuensch: I read it all down. You're good.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Hey. So, Joanne, I'll speak qualitative to 2021. We're not really looking to guide just yet and expect that that will happen after we have our Q4 earnings call, but as we think about next year, we do think that there will be a progressive recovery more optimistic based on what we see right now, and so, that will obviously play forward into 2021. From a cost structure standpoint, we are sort of experiencing sort of new ways of working and being more virtual and obviously saving on travel and other things, and I think there will be lots of examples of how that might play into our operating structure in the future. We currently have a whole taskforce made up of our senior leadership team that's really looking at [technical difficulty] and how we might come back. So, I fully expect that as we look at our financial model and our operating structure for next year, we'll expect to see sort of the impact of some of that.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse.\nMatt Miksic: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. I had one, one follow-up on Mako and robotic surgery. Kevin, you'd mentioned a couple of times the strength in the quarter, and we rewind back to the beginning of Q2, I think there were questions as to how inactive hospitals will be in bringing in new systems, and it sounds like it's kind of a much stronger. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the mix or the regional aspects of the strength and how you're pushed into ASCs, the sort of ASC offering strategy is playing into that? And I have one follow-up on spine?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure, Matt. We're not going to get into specific numbers as we stopped providing that, as you know a couple of quarters ago, but I would tell you that we had slightly higher competitive placements than we had typically before, and a bit more activity in the ASCs and we've been selling to the ASCs before, so that's not new, but clearly, there's an accelerating trend towards the ASCs, it was already starting to ramp and I think the pandemic is causing that to increase further. Keep in mind, there's only about 5% to 10% of joint replacement procedures done in ASC, so even though the ramp is picking up, it's going to take time before it becomes a very meaningful portion of procedures, but I would say those are the two areas that were higher than normal, which ASC is in competitive accounts. And then, what I tell you is overall I was pleasantly surprised you know, not knowing how hospitals are going to react. Our team did an awesome job in the quarter of being able to place a lot of robots and even though some more than we're financing the normal, we're totally fine with that, that's something in front of our office for a long time, and hospitals understandably are trying to preserve their options, but the demand and the pull for Mako was very strong. The order book is also very helpful, so this isn't just a one quarter issue and that all goes very well for us as every time we push a Mako, the percent of procedures done on the robot is increasing, and it tends, especially for our knees. It tends to cause an increase in some analysts as well, so those trends are continuing to rise, so it's just lifting all about within drug replacement.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks, it's great to hear. And then, on the spine side, just curious if you have any color on sort of seasonality, as in summertime months typically now with [K2M] [ph] under the verge at Stryker, you know there is the kind of upswing in scoliosis surgery and wondering if you've seen that or seen any trends ASCs or strong cervical, stronger lumbar given just the challenges early in Q2. And then, how that's shaping up heading into Q3 here?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, it's such a messy quarter honestly with I think all the closings that are happening and shutdowns, but scoliosis obviously is seasonal every year, and that's one of the crown jewels of the K2M portfolio, is there a complex deformative system, but there's nothing unusual that I want to call out and because there's so much noise, it's really hard for us to parse it out. There's just a lot of noise and as a it relates to ASCs. Obviously, spinal procedures are done in ASCs, it's not giant today, I think that will increase in the same way that it's increasing in large time procedures.\nMatt Miksic: Fair enough. Thanks, Kevin.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on solid executions there. Glenn, maybe the first one for you, I think, I heard some comments around capacity utilization on that manufacturing side being at 60% in 2Q stepping up to 85% in 3Q. One, I want to make sure I heard those numbers correct and in the implication on the gross margin side, it's implication that you step up by a couple of 100 basis points because now you're absorbing manufacturing variances better?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, hi, Vijay. Yes, you actually, you heard those numbers right. Capacity was around 65%, on average for Q2. And we actually do see it stepping up on an average to about 85% in Q3, but in Q2 it was about 400 basis points impact in terms of sort of fixed period costs that we had the expense as a result of some of those idlings. You could probably do the math on that number, relative to the 85% in Q3 and come pretty close to what we anticipate the amount will be. Keep in mind though that we're forecasting where we think the ramp might be and where it actually might be could be somewhat different and that certainly would impact how we ramp up manufacturing.\nVijay Kumar: I was about to say the step up and not capacity as a proxy for revenues, but thanks for clarifying that. I -- Kevin, I have one for you, if I had to get two months without a setup pricing is going to be quite bad. This is really remarkable pricing is faking out, how much of this is a function of perhaps bear discipline on your part in the industry in general, or is there something else going on in the industry? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks for the question. We've been focused on price for a long time, as you've seen over the past couple of years, the pricing overall has moderated within our overall portfolio. So part of it is certainly our efforts, and part of it's just a stable environment, the pricing environment has been fairly stable for some period of time and obviously our portfolio also has evolved over time, and with our portfolio being a higher percentage of MedSurg relative to the total and really some great discipline showing in some of our divisions. If I look at our CMF business as an example there's just terrific price discipline, and a lot of great innovations that we've been launching that. That continued to demand good prices, and so, we're going to continue to focus on that and we continue to expect a pretty stable pricing environment going forward.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks guys.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could spend a minute on two areas that the straight numbers by a good amount, neurotech and instruments, and I was wondering if you could add any extra commentary, I know I guess people weren't taking into account, how much some of the ENT might have been down in the quarter, but any other color you could add on instruments and neurotech and the trends there. Obviously, related to COVID, but just any color you could add?\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Sure, I'll take the neurotech part and then I'll -- maybe I'll ask Glenn to comment on instruments. So, within neurotech, we have four businesses, so we have our neurovascular business, our cranial maxillofacial business, our neurosurgery business, which is think about the neuro powered instruments and our portfolio of neurosurgical products and ENT. So within those four businesses, a lot of neurovascular is the largest on a global basis, but it's very, it's more heavily weighted to your -- to outside the United States. So roughly 60% of their sales are all U.S. So in the U.S., you have a much higher waiting on ENT, CMF and neurosurgical all three of which obviously were heavily impacted by the pandemic. Neurovascular was less impacted by the pandemic. Conversely, those three businesses don't have a very high percentage of their sales outside the United States. So when you're looking at a neurotech basket. You can see that impact in international being much better -- having much better performance than in the United States, just given the mixes of those businesses, but that's I think perhaps why a lot of times when speaking to investor, sometimes they sort of simplify that neurovascular is the neurotech business, but it's really just one of the core businesses, and ENT was the most heavily impacted business of all of the business of Stryker given the aerosolized and procedures. And then, Glenn do you want comment on that?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure, sure. On instruments, you know, they primarily have two very large segments, one of those being orthopedic solutions, which is powered instruments that are primarily used in orthopedic procedures. And then, the other surgical technologies, which has our safety products, our waste management products, you know obviously the orthopedic solutions scaled downward with just the elective procedure drop offs in orthopedics. On the surgical technology front, I would tell you that. Yes, I watched some of their equipment was significantly down there you know, personal protective equipment and products that relate to that did very well. I would also tell you that, and I suddenly said this in my earnings script that last year instruments grew almost 19% in the quarter. And so, it was a very, very high comparable and bar that they would have to overcome to even come close to growth and I think you see that impact in the decline they had for the quarter.\nRobbie Marcus: Appreciate that. And maybe just a quick follow-up, you guys spend a billion dollars in R&D and have a very active pipeline. We've heard from some of the cardio names that have bigger trials with longer timelines that they're seeing about six month's delays. The R&D is down modestly in second quarter, how should we think about any potential delays to the pipeline, if at all at Stryker? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, I wouldn't expect much in the way of delays. Some of the reasons for the lower spending is just access to labs to do testing, and so, the pandemic did crimp us a little bit, but very modestly, and keep in mind that we really only have two divisions that have PMA products on neurovascular division and our Physio-Control business. And PMA products are the ones that really do demand those clinical trials. And we just have launched a series of terrific products within neurovascular. So we actually have an innovation pipeline that that has is very, very healthy and refreshed within neurovascular. We weren't on the cusp of something brand-new. In fact, we had some really great news in the last quarter on some new approvals. Our surpass evolved, which is our newer flow diverting stent was approved in the United States. Our original flow diverting stent streamline was approved in China and our Atlas stent was also approved in China. So that was all good news, but don't expect much in the way of delays. Our product pipelines continue to march ahead. And I think the makeup of our business being much more 510(k) gives us the ability to continue to launch products at a very healthy pace.\nRobbie Marcus: Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum from SunTrust.\nKaila Krum: Great. Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking our questions tonight. So I know you're not going to talk about the STAR divestiture process, but I think you sit in a pretty interesting spot right now just having the perspective of a company trying to divest a business, but also opening -- open to evaluating tuck-ins at this time. So I just would be curious if you could comment high level on the M&A market today. What you're seeing in terms of just deal volume, potential sellers and buyer pool in this market, just as compared with perhaps what you had seen a year ago?\nKevin Lobo: Well, I think, the pandemic caused a slowdown clearly, a lot of activity got slowed down. We slowed down our own activities to some degree, continue to evaluate targets, but put a pause because obviously we were in sort of cash conservation mode, not knowing how long is this going to go on for, but I would say that our DD teams are just as busy as ever, engaging with targets, and I think this will come back just as it always has in the past. There are still a lot of companies within MedTech, a lot of small -- smaller and innovative companies, and we're going to continue to be busy. The divestiture process relates to the regulatory process for the deal. And we're going to continue to stay active on the BD front. Obviously, as I mentioned before, we're taking on a lot of depths with this Wright Medical acquisition, and so, part of our commitment with cash is going to be to pay down some of the debt, but it won't be exclusively and we've told that we will continue to stay active on M&A, but it will be obviously smaller tuck-in type of deals for the near-term.\nKaila Krum: Great. Thanks, Kevin. And then I just would like to touch about on vendor consolidation. Obviously, vendor consolidation has been a trend over time, but I'd love to hear if you're seeing any uptick in that more recently. Is it coming up more often in conversations with your hospital customers? Or is it just kind of more of the same at this point? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, I'd say it's more -- a bit more of the same at this point. Hospitals are have been looking to consolidate vendors by service lines. We actually embrace that approach because we're very, very deep in each of our service lines and category leaders in the segments that we plan. We are seeing with our ASC offense that having everything that ASC needs, whether it's blooms and lights and operating tables to make robots as well as implants, it really does give us a terrific position in ASC. So, that's an area of strength, but I would say overall not much change.\nKaila Krum: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin, you know, I appreciate the negative 10% growth in June and the improving commentary for July. I just want to give you a chance to comment on this. I assume people come off this call thinking that Q3 should be better than that negative 10% in June given the July trend. Is that -- are you guys comfortable with that without saying whether you'll grow or not, but Q3 should be better than down 10%?\nKevin Lobo: Well, certainly, if the current marketplace continues, it will be much better obviously because July is trending better than June as we mentioned, but as long as we don't have an outbreak or have to go back to shelter-in-place, as long as this trend line continues where we're feeling good about Q3.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And then did that improvement in July also applied to the U.S.? And if so, you know, qualitatively, how are hospitals in the U.S. dealing with the spikes that we're all obviously seeing here? Thanks for taking the question.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, it certainly includes the United States, and obviously, our business is more heavily weighted to the U.S. And so as that U.S. recovery improves that certainly is terrific for Stryker. Even in Florida today, we're seeing hospitals continuing to do surgeries. And so that -- it's not as if we were -- we're going through what we went through in April. Hospitals for the most part have been pretty well equipped. They are segregating their COVID patients from the areas where they can do surgery. I'm not saying that universally, some hospitals in Arizona, they chose to close elective surgeries down for a week. We saw that, but then they resumed a week after. So I think this notion of complete shutdowns, I don't think we're going to see that unless we have some type of rampant change in the way the virus is mutating and spreading. So, I don't expect that. I think we will have flare ups. And the reason we don't want to give guidance is it's hard to predict the nature of those flare ups and how big those flare ups will be, but even today in the -- in Texas and in Florida and in Arizona surgeries are going on, and that gives us cause for optimism for -- certainly for Q3 and beyond.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays.\nKristen Stewart: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I just have a question regarding some of the -- I guess, charges that you took in the quarter for in process asset impairment. It sounds that you guys were suspending some investments. I'm just wondering what exactly, I guess, are you suspending if there are any sort of projects that R&D projects or anything like that that are noteworthy just to explain? And then I noticed that you guys were taking some additional charges related to -- I'm not sure if they're just the European MDR or if they're related to any sort of quality system improvement, is there anything there worth mentioning just from how long, I guess, you anticipate taking these charges? And just any update on kind of cash flows for the rest of the year. Thanks.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Okay, Kristen, I will try to cover both of those in one fell swoop here. So you're right in the non-GAAP table, you can see that we recorded charges of about $170 million, and they were related to in-process asset impairments, product lines, and just sort of some other exit costs that that really resulted from our decision to suspend certain investments due to pandemic related constraints. I would tell you that the lion's share of those costs and those in-process costs were related to our 2020 ERP implementation, which we pause as a result of the pandemic. And really just in accordance with kind of the accounting rules and due to all the uncertainties of the situation, we were unsure of what the restart date would be of our ERP project at this time. And so thus we impaired some of those related in-process costs that had been previously capitalized. And then, on the other questions, yes, we continue to have costs that are related to EU MDR. And we'll have those flowing into next year that are just like everyone else of our peers are recorded in our non-GAAP charges and we expected that program will likely continue for about three years, and then on the cash flow front, we -- I think if you look at our cash flow, we just -- for the quarter it just really reflected good working capital performance. You combine strong collections with relatively flat inventories. We continue to work with our vendors on payment terms, and then all of that was just complimented by just the discretionary spending controls as well as measured CapEx spend, and I think all of that combined to produce a really positive cash flow result for the quarter.\nKristen Stewart: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel.\nRick Wise: Good afternoon, Kevin.\nKevin Lobo: Good afternoon.\nRick Wise: You have said in your opening comments something like we're prepared to emerge from the pandemic, a stronger, more efficient company, and I obviously see no reason to doubt that and you're highlighting cutting discretionary spend, et cetera, focusing on the pipeline, but I'm just curious what that means in your mind? And what -- how we should hear you? Are you saying -- Rick, as we get -- or to all of us -- are -- as we get back to a more normal procedure environment, we're going to grow as we did, and our margins are going to be what they were? Or are you saying something more that you're trying to position the company to grow even faster with even better margins because you're taking special actions, special initiatives to plan for that? Do you see what I'm asking?\nKevin Lobo: Well, I know exactly what you're asking and my CFO on my preceding screen is waving his head saying, please don't give guidance. So Rick, what I would tell you, I'll give you some qualitative commentary. So the qualitative commentary is what the pandemic has provided us has really shown us how effective we can be without having to be the high cost, high travel company we've been historically. We were a very high touch culture. We're realizing that there's a lot that we can do virtually that will be permanent. There's a lot of education, the MedEd, something that you have to do in person in cadaver lab type, but there's others that you don't. You can do very, very effectively and efficiently virtually the buildings and facilities that we have. A lot of we're going to embrace flexible work arrangements going forward, and we are not going to need the same real-estate by any stretch that we have today, and a lot of our CapEx over the past few years has been on office buildings and because of our growth and all the headcount we've been adding and all the companies we've been acquiring. And frankly, we're seeing a big change and what's going to be required in the future. So those are all areas on the efficiency front. And what I would tell you is this pandemic has shrunk our company. Our divisions are collaborating more than ever. And I think the nature of the pandemic has caused our divisions to work more together, and that's sort of one of the untapped assets of Stryker's as we collaborate, we're seeing it with our ASC offense. We're seeing it with the 3D printing. We're seeing it with sort of technology areas where different divisions can tap into enabling technologies as an example, and we're collaborating better than we ever have before, and I think that will continue once we go back to let's say some more normal environment. And it's really unleashing a different kind of potential. So I can't put a fine point on numbers related to this, Rick, but I am feeling a tremendous momentum in the company and the culture is very strong, and these changes are going to make us better as an organization going forward. How we use out those efficiencies that we regenerate? It certainly gives us more confidence and we'll get back to the nice soft margin expansion you saw with the past couple of years. That gives us tremendous confidence. We can continue that, but I think there's some untapped potential in our divisions and through collaboration that we're going to start to see manifest itself in our results.\nRick Wise: Interesting. And Kevin, just a last one for me, we haven't maybe focused a ton on this call on international. You've spent amount of time rethinking Europe over the years. You highlighted that Latin America, India so weak. We haven't touched much on China. Can you give us just at a high level, what you're feeling good about, what you're feeling concerned about as we think about the recovery? Or what initiatives you have underway there just your high level thoughts internationally right now? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. So first of all, I would start off with the developed countries internationally. I feel very strong about that, strong about Japan, Australia, Canada, Europe. I mean, we are really in great position in all the developed markets, even Korea feel very, very strong about our position in developed markets. Emerging markets is the big area of opportunity for Stryker over the next 5, 10 years. I feel very good about the leaders we put in place. We put in terrific leaders in our major priority countries, whether it's China, India, Turkey, Latin America, for sure just fantastic leaders, and we had a terrific year in 2019. We grew roughly 20% in the emerging markets and it was outstanding. And we were really heading into this year with the wind at our backs. Unfortunately, the pandemic has thrown a huge wrench into that. When we talked about the problems in India and the problems in Latin America, they're really not Stryker problems. They're pandemic related challenges that we have. I am expecting us to get back into the winning spirit that we had towards the end of the last year, and I feel that because we have the right leadership in place. We have the right kind of models in place. We've gone a little bit more direct in some countries. Turkey is a good example where we bought our distributor. So I do think we have the right infrastructure and it took us time, right? You remember a lot four or five years ago, we were struggling in many of those countries. And -- but I do feel we're on a solid footing and we will recover as those markets recover related to this pandemic.\nRick Wise: Thanks again.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nPatrick Bartoski: Good afternoon, guys. This is Patrick on from Matt. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Just one for us, I just would love to go back to the financing from Mako specifically. I'm curious about the Flex Financial program. I know as more ASCs acquire Mako systems, you talked about this being an important element for those placements, but have larger hospitals been using the Flex Financial program as well? And -- or are you actually finding that things are operating on a more ad hoc basis when it comes to some of these financing agreements you've been having with systems? Any color there would be really appreciated. Thank you.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure. Hi, Patrick, this is Glenn. I'll answer that. What our Flex business is as busy as it's ever been. And I would tell you that just given in the current conditions and maybe some of the uncertainties hospitals may have about their liquidity, and I think that the fact that we can use Flex Financial to sort of customize these financial options for our customers is certainly making a very big impact on those capital businesses. I would tell you that during Q2, Mako sales were quite robust and we supported our customers through a variety of financing options. And then lastly -- the last bit of color I'll say is that just, given the circumstances, we definitely are seeing a shift to financing more deals than we have historically experienced. And I fully believe that that will continue throughout the rest of this year.\nPatrick Bartoski: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.\nXuyang Li: Thanks. This is actually Xuyang for Matt. I guess maybe a question on Mako. I am just going back to the comments on the competitive account wins. Are you going up against the other robotics systems in the field more and more and winning directly? Or are those competitive account wins and accounts that don't currently have robotics yet?\nPreston Wells: This is Preston, and I'll take that one. Just as we think about where we're going and the expansion of Mako, the opportunity still exists given the penetration that that's currently we're today. I think we have opportunities all throughout. So whether they're competitive accounts that are in or out, we're really just going to all of those different accounts and trying to find areas to place Mako.\nXuyang Li: Okay, great, very helpful. And I guess another question is from the sort of your visibility into surgical calendars, and maybe the type of patients that's getting procedures. I'm just trying to understand how much of the surgeries are working through the backlog versus new patients and if you have visibility into that? Thanks.\nPreston Wells: Yes, what I would tell you, as you think about the catch up, there was clearly as we came into the recovery, some level of patients that had previously deferred procedures that were catching up and having those procedures done. We also know that that the backlog was big, and there still are some patients that are out there that have some level of anxiety and maybe they continue to defer some of those procedures for some bit of time. I think it's important though, if you think about the products that we have and the disease states that we serve. Those disease states don't really improve over time, and so, we believe that many of those patients will return to have those procedures done at some point in time. The other thing I would say is, as this pandemic was happening, we do know that surgeons were not only cleaning and clearing through the backlog, but they were also seeing new patients, whether that was in office sometimes or through telemedicine. So, because of those things, we believe that the backlog remain strong into Q3.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Richard Newitter from Silicon Valley Bank.\nRichard Newitter: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So I just wanted to follow up on the AS -- the trends in the ASC, specifically as it relates to robotics, very, very encouraged to hear that you're seeing increased demand for Mako there, and that drove some of the placements. I guess -- I'm just curious, we've heard in the past that that robotics in the ASC setting might be a harder sell. So I looked this year, what the -- where the value proposition is resonating the strongest? And in particular, one of the things that we've heard from our competitors who are offering robotic systems and specifically saying that they're better positioned to potentially sell to the ASC relates to the CT scan or the lack -- lack of a need for a CT scan. So if you could just comment there, the extent to which that has been a barrier at all in the past and any comments that you can offer further on the receptivity in this care setting for robotics? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks. The surgeons that are operating the SCs want to have the best technology, they want to be able to do the same kind of procedures they used to do in the hospital. And I would say the CT scanner, it's not been a barrier whatsoever, at least not recently, I would say when Mako was earlier on, when we were initially launching our Totalknee, we had little flare-ups here and there across the country, about getting the CT scan done, but if you want to do this, the most accurately you need them and very, very accurate scan to be able to do the procedure the best way possible. And right now, I would say it's just a whimper of a sound. We really don't hear much of anything. And frankly, there's a huge degree of interest for Mako and the ASC and that we saw that in the actual numbers in this quarter.\nRichard Newitter: That's helpful. And just on the topic of ASC, Kevin, appreciate the insights as to how Stryker might be uniquely positioned to serve that care setting with your diverse platform. And in fact that you're effectively deep across a variety of service lines as a one stop shop for the needs of the surgeons on the pricing side, particularly on implant pricing. Do you see the trend towards ASC is eventually having an impact on pricing, is it going to get worse and implant pricing kind of set to go downwards as an increased number of procedures performed there?\nKevin Lobo: Well, I can tell you right now, we're not seeing, you saw the price numbers that we posted, and I will tell you, we're not seeing much of a difference in pricing in the ASC versus the hospital today. A lot of things really does, I think it's going to depend on the ownership structure of the ASC, is it affiliated with the hospital. I can't predict what's going to happen five years from now, ASCs run very, very profitable. Today, their EBITDAs are very healthy. They're actually, they are financially minded, and they're good business people, but -- so, our hospitals have been pushing us on price for years, and so will there be pressure from the ASC? Sure. Is it going to be unique and different? I don't really see that at least we're not seeing any signs of that right now, but we'll see how that evolves over time.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: Good afternoon. Thanks, Kevin and Glenn, just one question for me. I appreciate all the detail you provided in terms of the improvement, sequential improvement in procedures. I was hoping you could maybe lay out some trends into quarter and maybe even into July on what you're seeing in terms of the demand for your capital that's considered COVID essential within hospitals has done very well. In Q2, are you still seeing elevated demand? Or should we be thinking about that tapering-off as COVID is getting more under control? Thanks for taking the question.\nPreston Wells: Absolutely, Josh this is Preston. Just to think about you're right. I think with the COVID response for some of that margin capital, certainly saw the big uptick early in the quarter. It's hard to say given where we are and some of the continuation of flare-ups and then shift around of demand, what's really pull forward versus what's going to be the normal, but I would say as we think about that, we still see a strong order book as we exited in our capital businesses, and at this point in time, we've not seen any significant stockpiling of our capital equipment either. So I would say it's hard to tell where that's going to be as we look forward, but certainly strong throughout the quarter, second quarter.\nJoshua Jennings: Appreciate it, thanks.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: Great, thank you for taking the question. Just one for me, very encouraged to see the strength of Mako in the quarter. And I know a lot has been asked here, but I wondered, Kevin, if you could just give us more of a higher level perspective of the orthopedic robotics market at this point. I mean are the customers you're seeing, are they still, the early adopters looking to differentiate themselves in the market? Are these purchases, more defensive because the hospital on the other side of town acquired one? And then how do you view the size of the market just from pure units that can be placed in the field, particularly given the accelerated interest from not just the hospital side, but also the ASC side?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, that's a great question, predicting S-curve adoption rates or new technology. It's always a challenge, right because it's not something we do every day. It's not like launching a new power tool or launching a new camera, we can predict those curves pretty effectively. I would tell you that there's critical mass is really starting to happen. There's a momentum, there's a belief that this is the future. And so we're past the early adopter phase now, we have hospitals buying their second, third, fourth, fifth, Mako large systems and we have competitive pressures of course that occur related to that, but the evidence and that the happy patients that are telling their stories and surgeons seeing great results, I think we still have a long way to go. It's still very early in the cycle, and we're pretty excited about the degree of interest even through a pandemic to be able to have that type of interest means, we really are getting to the point where it's starting to become accepted. It's starting to people are seeing the benefits. They wouldn't be buying their second or third or fourth, if they really didn't see clear benefits to these procedures. So that gives us a lot of excitement about the future, but I would say we're still in this very early innings. Given that there're 5,000 hospitals out there and a large number of them do orthopedic procedures. We're still at a very early, early phase.\nOperator: And your last question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you for squeezing me in. Kevin, I think if I recall, the neurovascular market saw slowdown last quarter, which certainly a bit concerning clinically, but taking your commentary today about neurovascular at more normalized levels. I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on that dynamic, relative to your expectations and kind of as the market back to the level you expect, there's a room for that to come back further, and anything competitively that may have impacted during the quarter, just given the performance. Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks. No, it's not all the way back yet to the sort of the robust growth I'd had before, but it made a big step forward as the quarter as we sort of move towards the end of the quarter, and we were surprised that we really thought neurovascular is more like trauma, core trauma, that patients get a stroke or going to rush-in and they stayed away from hospitals, it was a bit of a surprise that it went down. And I don't think that was unique to us. We didn't see anything materially different from the competitive landscape, the impacts of the business were really market related, and as the market improves, we feel we're going to be in very good position, especially with the new products. So the new, large-bore catheters that we launched, just a limited launch and even the surpass of all flow-diverting stents, we weren't able to get to all the proctoring and training that you have to do, so that's been sort of a limited launch. So if anything, we have a bit of a new product tailwind. As we get out into or take the latter parts of Q3 and into Q4 but not much on the competitive front, it's really has been a market dynamic issue. Where I guess hemorrhagic stroke, some of it is quasi or let's call it semi-elective, which I would have never thought, but those are coming back, and I say I expect that the market of neurovascular will really improve going ahead.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay, thank you. And then just really briefly for me, how much within Mako, the order book in terms of existing orders that are in process versus maybe the other side of the funnel? I think investors have had somewhat of a concern that well capital cycles are still robust. They may not reflect necessary weakness, they don't get this way but six months from now, they could be weak as there starts to be a gap in capital. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate just on that strong order book that you did call out. Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, I think even in capital constrained times, there's certain capital people really want and they will find the money, it means they're going to not spend money in other areas to be able to supply the technology they want, and what we're seeing with Mako is this is technology they want, and they're going to find a way to get it, and if that means using Flex Financial, great, they'll use Flex Financial, if that means curbing certain capital expenditure to funnel it into our business. That's what's going to happen, when surgeons are demanding it and there are surgeons that make a lot of money, one of the silver linings of this whole pandemic and of course, aren't many, but there are some, one of the silver linings is understanding just how profitable our procedures are to hospitals. Most hospitals know it, but when you watch your bottom line sort of evaporates, because you're not doing these high value procedures, and we play in a lot of spaces with high value procedures, neurosurgery, spine, joint replacement. They really want to be able to get that going again and doing that with great technology is very profitable for the hospital. And so, I think there's been some recognition. I've certainly heard that from certain hospitals about how important these procedures are. So our belief is we have just outstanding technology, that that improves outcomes and that the surgeons wants and if the surgeons really wanted, they're going to find a way to purchase it, and so, that may not apply to all of our capital, but it certainly applies to Mako.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: So, thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in October. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Lobo",
            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with some perspectives on the recovery trends across our diverse businesses. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. As we begin today's call, I would like to start by thanking all our employees for their continued commitment to ensuring the safety of their colleagues, their families, and our customers. I'm very pleased with the resiliency of our organization, which has maintained high employee engagement and customer connections through the pandemic, from our sales forces who remain present and essential to the doctors and caregivers they support, to our manufacturing teams that have worked around the clock to optimize supply with ever-changing demand, and across our workforce, most of whom continue to collaborate virtually, the Stryker's spirit remains alive and well. Our second quarter sales declined organically by 24%, reflecting the impacts of COVID-19 across all geographies and the majority of our product lines. The results reflect progressive improvement in overall sales through the quarter, but do vary by region. The sequential improvement can be tied to the initial cancellation and subsequent gradual return elective procedures during the quarter. As mentioned in our first quarter call, we took aggressive steps early on to ensure the safety of our employees and customers while managing discretionary spending across our P&L in response to the slowdown in sales. Our cost containment measures included significant reductions in travel and meetings, a slow down in hiring, and salary reductions across senior leaders. In addition, we made other efforts to focus on cash conservation, including the idling of select product lines and facilities across our network starting in May. These actions combined with our sales performance resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.64, a decline of nearly 68% versus the prior year. As we look at the quarter, the low point in sales occurred in April, and then improved sequentially through the end of June. As a reminder, implants and disposables represent about 75% of our sales, and small capital represents 16%. Small capital generally mirrors the performance and trends of implants and disposables. The largest improvements within the quarter were in hips, knees, spine trauma, sports medicine, and neurotechnology, reflecting the resumption of electric procedures, and the gradual opening of previously locked down communities and geographies. With respect to our large capital businesses, Medical Capital and Mako were standouts, both posting strong growth to the quarter. Our Mako Robotic technology remains in high demand with our customers, despite any financial constraints resulting from the pandemic. By geography, Japan and Canada performed well, while Europe, China, and Australia showed progressive improvements through the quarter. In contrast, Latin America and India continue to be weaker as the impacts of COVID-19 remain more widespread in those regions. In Q3, we expect the recovery to continue, but do not expect it to be linear, while local governments deal with varying degrees of resurgences. Our R&D programs continue to proceed despite logistical challenges caused by the pandemic, and we spent at a healthy rate in the quarter. We are actively engaging with our customers, while ensuring that our product supplies in a strong position to capitalize as procedures resume. However, given the fluid nature of this situation, we are not providing Q3 or full-year guidance. We are proceeding with the integration efforts regarding the Wright Medical transaction. We are working cooperatively with the regulators to obtain the necessary approvals for the transaction, and including as previously announced proposing to divest our STAR total ankle replacement product. This process is well underway and the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority recently announced that it will consider our proposed undertakings in lieu of a Phase 2 investigation. We continue to expect to close the transaction around the end of Q3 or beginning of Q4. Please note beyond this update, we will not be taking any questions regarding Wright Medical, or the pending transaction on today's call. This has been the most unique situation that most of us have ever experienced. While we have been impacted financially as a result of the government shutdowns and deferrals of elective procedures, this time has also allowed us opportunities to reevaluate and develop new ways to work and collaborate across our diverse group of businesses. We are prepared to emerge from the pandemic as stronger, more efficient company. I remain confident in our people, our culture, and our ability to partner with our customers to meet the needs of the many patients they serve. And now over to Preston. Yes, we can Bob. Bob, there's a reason we're not giving guidance, right, because we just don't know what's going to happen in the future, but there isn't any reason to think that there's something widely different about our business. We performed slightly better than the market, 100 to 200 basis points on top line we've done it for eight years in a row. You should expect us to continue to have the same type of performance, and it really does depend on what the market does, and once we have a better visibility we'll give guidance, but there's nothing unique about our business that would cause us to be widely out of line. Okay, great. Well, so first of all, starting off with the CARES Act, so $175 billion that's been authorized to go to hospitals, only $115 billion has actually been disbursed. So, there's still another $60 billion to be disbursed, and that's prior to the next round of legislation, right. The next stimulation package will add to that, and so, money is flowing to the hospitals. We are really pleased with the performance of medical, obviously. Small capital tends not to be as much of a worry. They needed to do the procedures. So, that's why it tends to trend very, very closely with elective procedures. They need power tools to do the knee replacement. They need the cameras to do the general surgery products. So, that tends never to be really hit too much. It's more of a large capital that tends to be the constraint, but because of the coronavirus, a lot of our large capital in terms of beds and structures were actually necessary, and we saw those being purchased. Mako was really a pleasant surprise in the quarter to see the amount of robots we're able to install. There was more financing than normal, I would say in the second quarter, as hospitals tried to conserve as much short-term [caches] [ph] as they could, but it's hard to predict how this is going to play out over the course of the year, I would say for now, we're feeling very good about the state of our businesses. Internationally, we had a terrific performance out of medical, and a lot of that is governments around the world really saying this is really important to have LUCAS, chest compression devices, very important to have ICU beds, et cetera, and so, we had just a terrific performance. We also don't have stages as a much smaller business for medical outside the United States. So, that weighed heavily on our U.S. performance. We actually had strong medical capital in the United States as well, but we're feeling very good about the state of the capital business. It's not like the last time where you didn't have this kind of stimulation from the government to tickle going directly into hospitals, and hospitals are very motivated to increase their procedures. Yes, thank you. So, clearly, we'll be at a high leverage point, and we do have intentions to start paying down that debt, but we haven't stopped our business development teams. They're still out looking at targets. I would expect that they won't be much necessarily as large as some of the targets we've done more recently, but you should expect us to continue to be busy with bolt-on type of acquisitions, and as you saw, we had a really strong performance in cash flow in the second quarter, as we generate cash we'll be able to both pay down debt and stay busy in the M&A market. Well, I think we were pretty clear in the opening comments that our businesses really recover with the recovery of surgery, and so, as surgeries come back, all of our businesses are sort of resuming at a very similar pace. We don't have huge variability, I would say early on in the pandemic ENT because it was aerosolizing procedures are clearly the hardest hit, and then the hips and knees were sort of next hardest hit, but I would say, now as the economies reopening, we're really getting a nice uptick across full portfolio. There really isn't that much variability as it relates to the elective procedures. Capital is a little bit different. So, in large capital area, the booms and lights and that type of capital wasn't as robust as beds and stretchers and Mako. So, there is some variability, but again, not too dramatic, and so, I think you're going to see our business kind of come back as the economy comes back in a fairly synchronous manner. And I wasn't quite sure I got your question about next year's financial model. Joanne, do you mind repeating that? Glenn, I think you are muted. Yes, sure, Matt. We're not going to get into specific numbers as we stopped providing that, as you know a couple of quarters ago, but I would tell you that we had slightly higher competitive placements than we had typically before, and a bit more activity in the ASCs and we've been selling to the ASCs before, so that's not new, but clearly, there's an accelerating trend towards the ASCs, it was already starting to ramp and I think the pandemic is causing that to increase further. Keep in mind, there's only about 5% to 10% of joint replacement procedures done in ASC, so even though the ramp is picking up, it's going to take time before it becomes a very meaningful portion of procedures, but I would say those are the two areas that were higher than normal, which ASC is in competitive accounts. And then, what I tell you is overall I was pleasantly surprised you know, not knowing how hospitals are going to react. Our team did an awesome job in the quarter of being able to place a lot of robots and even though some more than we're financing the normal, we're totally fine with that, that's something in front of our office for a long time, and hospitals understandably are trying to preserve their options, but the demand and the pull for Mako was very strong. The order book is also very helpful, so this isn't just a one quarter issue and that all goes very well for us as every time we push a Mako, the percent of procedures done on the robot is increasing, and it tends, especially for our knees. It tends to cause an increase in some analysts as well, so those trends are continuing to rise, so it's just lifting all about within drug replacement. Yes, it's such a messy quarter honestly with I think all the closings that are happening and shutdowns, but scoliosis obviously is seasonal every year, and that's one of the crown jewels of the K2M portfolio, is there a complex deformative system, but there's nothing unusual that I want to call out and because there's so much noise, it's really hard for us to parse it out. There's just a lot of noise and as a it relates to ASCs. Obviously, spinal procedures are done in ASCs, it's not giant today, I think that will increase in the same way that it's increasing in large time procedures. Thank you. Yes. Thanks for the question. We've been focused on price for a long time, as you've seen over the past couple of years, the pricing overall has moderated within our overall portfolio. So part of it is certainly our efforts, and part of it's just a stable environment, the pricing environment has been fairly stable for some period of time and obviously our portfolio also has evolved over time, and with our portfolio being a higher percentage of MedSurg relative to the total and really some great discipline showing in some of our divisions. If I look at our CMF business as an example there's just terrific price discipline, and a lot of great innovations that we've been launching that. That continued to demand good prices, and so, we're going to continue to focus on that and we continue to expect a pretty stable pricing environment going forward. Okay. Sure, I'll take the neurotech part and then I'll -- maybe I'll ask Glenn to comment on instruments. So, within neurotech, we have four businesses, so we have our neurovascular business, our cranial maxillofacial business, our neurosurgery business, which is think about the neuro powered instruments and our portfolio of neurosurgical products and ENT. So within those four businesses, a lot of neurovascular is the largest on a global basis, but it's very, it's more heavily weighted to your -- to outside the United States. So roughly 60% of their sales are all U.S. So in the U.S., you have a much higher waiting on ENT, CMF and neurosurgical all three of which obviously were heavily impacted by the pandemic. Neurovascular was less impacted by the pandemic. Conversely, those three businesses don't have a very high percentage of their sales outside the United States. So when you're looking at a neurotech basket. You can see that impact in international being much better -- having much better performance than in the United States, just given the mixes of those businesses, but that's I think perhaps why a lot of times when speaking to investor, sometimes they sort of simplify that neurovascular is the neurotech business, but it's really just one of the core businesses, and ENT was the most heavily impacted business of all of the business of Stryker given the aerosolized and procedures. And then, Glenn do you want comment on that? Yes, I wouldn't expect much in the way of delays. Some of the reasons for the lower spending is just access to labs to do testing, and so, the pandemic did crimp us a little bit, but very modestly, and keep in mind that we really only have two divisions that have PMA products on neurovascular division and our Physio-Control business. And PMA products are the ones that really do demand those clinical trials. And we just have launched a series of terrific products within neurovascular. So we actually have an innovation pipeline that that has is very, very healthy and refreshed within neurovascular. We weren't on the cusp of something brand-new. In fact, we had some really great news in the last quarter on some new approvals. Our surpass evolved, which is our newer flow diverting stent was approved in the United States. Our original flow diverting stent streamline was approved in China and our Atlas stent was also approved in China. So that was all good news, but don't expect much in the way of delays. Our product pipelines continue to march ahead. And I think the makeup of our business being much more 510(k) gives us the ability to continue to launch products at a very healthy pace. Well, I think, the pandemic caused a slowdown clearly, a lot of activity got slowed down. We slowed down our own activities to some degree, continue to evaluate targets, but put a pause because obviously we were in sort of cash conservation mode, not knowing how long is this going to go on for, but I would say that our DD teams are just as busy as ever, engaging with targets, and I think this will come back just as it always has in the past. There are still a lot of companies within MedTech, a lot of small -- smaller and innovative companies, and we're going to continue to be busy. The divestiture process relates to the regulatory process for the deal. And we're going to continue to stay active on the BD front. Obviously, as I mentioned before, we're taking on a lot of depths with this Wright Medical acquisition, and so, part of our commitment with cash is going to be to pay down some of the debt, but it won't be exclusively and we've told that we will continue to stay active on M&A, but it will be obviously smaller tuck-in type of deals for the near-term. Yes, I'd say it's more -- a bit more of the same at this point. Hospitals are have been looking to consolidate vendors by service lines. We actually embrace that approach because we're very, very deep in each of our service lines and category leaders in the segments that we plan. We are seeing with our ASC offense that having everything that ASC needs, whether it's blooms and lights and operating tables to make robots as well as implants, it really does give us a terrific position in ASC. So, that's an area of strength, but I would say overall not much change. Well, certainly, if the current marketplace continues, it will be much better obviously because July is trending better than June as we mentioned, but as long as we don't have an outbreak or have to go back to shelter-in-place, as long as this trend line continues where we're feeling good about Q3. Yes, it certainly includes the United States, and obviously, our business is more heavily weighted to the U.S. And so as that U.S. recovery improves that certainly is terrific for Stryker. Even in Florida today, we're seeing hospitals continuing to do surgeries. And so that -- it's not as if we were -- we're going through what we went through in April. Hospitals for the most part have been pretty well equipped. They are segregating their COVID patients from the areas where they can do surgery. I'm not saying that universally, some hospitals in Arizona, they chose to close elective surgeries down for a week. We saw that, but then they resumed a week after. So I think this notion of complete shutdowns, I don't think we're going to see that unless we have some type of rampant change in the way the virus is mutating and spreading. So, I don't expect that. I think we will have flare ups. And the reason we don't want to give guidance is it's hard to predict the nature of those flare ups and how big those flare ups will be, but even today in the -- in Texas and in Florida and in Arizona surgeries are going on, and that gives us cause for optimism for -- certainly for Q3 and beyond. Good afternoon. Well, I know exactly what you're asking and my CFO on my preceding screen is waving his head saying, please don't give guidance. So Rick, what I would tell you, I'll give you some qualitative commentary. So the qualitative commentary is what the pandemic has provided us has really shown us how effective we can be without having to be the high cost, high travel company we've been historically. We were a very high touch culture. We're realizing that there's a lot that we can do virtually that will be permanent. There's a lot of education, the MedEd, something that you have to do in person in cadaver lab type, but there's others that you don't. You can do very, very effectively and efficiently virtually the buildings and facilities that we have. A lot of we're going to embrace flexible work arrangements going forward, and we are not going to need the same real-estate by any stretch that we have today, and a lot of our CapEx over the past few years has been on office buildings and because of our growth and all the headcount we've been adding and all the companies we've been acquiring. And frankly, we're seeing a big change and what's going to be required in the future. So those are all areas on the efficiency front. And what I would tell you is this pandemic has shrunk our company. Our divisions are collaborating more than ever. And I think the nature of the pandemic has caused our divisions to work more together, and that's sort of one of the untapped assets of Stryker's as we collaborate, we're seeing it with our ASC offense. We're seeing it with the 3D printing. We're seeing it with sort of technology areas where different divisions can tap into enabling technologies as an example, and we're collaborating better than we ever have before, and I think that will continue once we go back to let's say some more normal environment. And it's really unleashing a different kind of potential. So I can't put a fine point on numbers related to this, Rick, but I am feeling a tremendous momentum in the company and the culture is very strong, and these changes are going to make us better as an organization going forward. How we use out those efficiencies that we regenerate? It certainly gives us more confidence and we'll get back to the nice soft margin expansion you saw with the past couple of years. That gives us tremendous confidence. We can continue that, but I think there's some untapped potential in our divisions and through collaboration that we're going to start to see manifest itself in our results. Yes, sure. So first of all, I would start off with the developed countries internationally. I feel very strong about that, strong about Japan, Australia, Canada, Europe. I mean, we are really in great position in all the developed markets, even Korea feel very, very strong about our position in developed markets. Emerging markets is the big area of opportunity for Stryker over the next 5, 10 years. I feel very good about the leaders we put in place. We put in terrific leaders in our major priority countries, whether it's China, India, Turkey, Latin America, for sure just fantastic leaders, and we had a terrific year in 2019. We grew roughly 20% in the emerging markets and it was outstanding. And we were really heading into this year with the wind at our backs. Unfortunately, the pandemic has thrown a huge wrench into that. When we talked about the problems in India and the problems in Latin America, they're really not Stryker problems. They're pandemic related challenges that we have. I am expecting us to get back into the winning spirit that we had towards the end of the last year, and I feel that because we have the right leadership in place. We have the right kind of models in place. We've gone a little bit more direct in some countries. Turkey is a good example where we bought our distributor. So I do think we have the right infrastructure and it took us time, right? You remember a lot four or five years ago, we were struggling in many of those countries. And -- but I do feel we're on a solid footing and we will recover as those markets recover related to this pandemic. Yes, thanks. The surgeons that are operating the SCs want to have the best technology, they want to be able to do the same kind of procedures they used to do in the hospital. And I would say the CT scanner, it's not been a barrier whatsoever, at least not recently, I would say when Mako was earlier on, when we were initially launching our Totalknee, we had little flare-ups here and there across the country, about getting the CT scan done, but if you want to do this, the most accurately you need them and very, very accurate scan to be able to do the procedure the best way possible. And right now, I would say it's just a whimper of a sound. We really don't hear much of anything. And frankly, there's a huge degree of interest for Mako and the ASC and that we saw that in the actual numbers in this quarter. Well, I can tell you right now, we're not seeing, you saw the price numbers that we posted, and I will tell you, we're not seeing much of a difference in pricing in the ASC versus the hospital today. A lot of things really does, I think it's going to depend on the ownership structure of the ASC, is it affiliated with the hospital. I can't predict what's going to happen five years from now, ASCs run very, very profitable. Today, their EBITDAs are very healthy. They're actually, they are financially minded, and they're good business people, but -- so, our hospitals have been pushing us on price for years, and so will there be pressure from the ASC? Sure. Is it going to be unique and different? I don't really see that at least we're not seeing any signs of that right now, but we'll see how that evolves over time. Yes, that's a great question, predicting S-curve adoption rates or new technology. It's always a challenge, right because it's not something we do every day. It's not like launching a new power tool or launching a new camera, we can predict those curves pretty effectively. I would tell you that there's critical mass is really starting to happen. There's a momentum, there's a belief that this is the future. And so we're past the early adopter phase now, we have hospitals buying their second, third, fourth, fifth, Mako large systems and we have competitive pressures of course that occur related to that, but the evidence and that the happy patients that are telling their stories and surgeons seeing great results, I think we still have a long way to go. It's still very early in the cycle, and we're pretty excited about the degree of interest even through a pandemic to be able to have that type of interest means, we really are getting to the point where it's starting to become accepted. It's starting to people are seeing the benefits. They wouldn't be buying their second or third or fourth, if they really didn't see clear benefits to these procedures. So that gives us a lot of excitement about the future, but I would say we're still in this very early innings. Given that there're 5,000 hospitals out there and a large number of them do orthopedic procedures. We're still at a very early, early phase. Yes, thanks. No, it's not all the way back yet to the sort of the robust growth I'd had before, but it made a big step forward as the quarter as we sort of move towards the end of the quarter, and we were surprised that we really thought neurovascular is more like trauma, core trauma, that patients get a stroke or going to rush-in and they stayed away from hospitals, it was a bit of a surprise that it went down. And I don't think that was unique to us. We didn't see anything materially different from the competitive landscape, the impacts of the business were really market related, and as the market improves, we feel we're going to be in very good position, especially with the new products. So the new, large-bore catheters that we launched, just a limited launch and even the surpass of all flow-diverting stents, we weren't able to get to all the proctoring and training that you have to do, so that's been sort of a limited launch. So if anything, we have a bit of a new product tailwind. As we get out into or take the latter parts of Q3 and into Q4 but not much on the competitive front, it's really has been a market dynamic issue. Where I guess hemorrhagic stroke, some of it is quasi or let's call it semi-elective, which I would have never thought, but those are coming back, and I say I expect that the market of neurovascular will really improve going ahead. Yes, I think even in capital constrained times, there's certain capital people really want and they will find the money, it means they're going to not spend money in other areas to be able to supply the technology they want, and what we're seeing with Mako is this is technology they want, and they're going to find a way to get it, and if that means using Flex Financial, great, they'll use Flex Financial, if that means curbing certain capital expenditure to funnel it into our business. That's what's going to happen, when surgeons are demanding it and there are surgeons that make a lot of money, one of the silver linings of this whole pandemic and of course, aren't many, but there are some, one of the silver linings is understanding just how profitable our procedures are to hospitals. Most hospitals know it, but when you watch your bottom line sort of evaporates, because you're not doing these high value procedures, and we play in a lot of spaces with high value procedures, neurosurgery, spine, joint replacement. They really want to be able to get that going again and doing that with great technology is very profitable for the hospital. And so, I think there's been some recognition. I've certainly heard that from certain hospitals about how important these procedures are. So our belief is we have just outstanding technology, that that improves outcomes and that the surgeons wants and if the surgeons really wanted, they're going to find a way to purchase it, and so, that may not apply to all of our capital, but it certainly applies to Mako. So, thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in October. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results, related drivers, and liquidity matters. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales decline was 24% in the quarter. These results included a decline in the U.S. to 27.4%, and an international decline of 14.5%. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as compared to Q2, 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.2% from the prior quarter, and foreign currency had an unfavorable 0.8% impact on sales. During the quarter, our growth was significantly negatively impacted by reductions in elective surgeries, the effects of shelter in place orders across many geographies, and the pause in hospital capital spending as the medical community navigates this pandemic. Throughout the quarter, we saw progressive improvement in the expansion of elective surgeries across many geographies, which resulted in significant variability in our sales. On an overall basis, our sales declined range from minus 36% in April, to minus 10% in June. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $0.64 represents a decline of 67.7% from Q2 2019. The foreign currency impact on second quarter EPS was minimal. Certain other factors resulted in disproportionately negative impacts on EPS including the loss of higher margin sales and a loss of leverage related to manufacturing and operational fixed costs. These were partially offset by our strong focus on disciplined cost control within the quarter. I will now provide some brief comments on segment sales. Orthopedics has constant currency and organic sales decline of 29.3%. This included a U.S. decline of 28.8%. We saw declines across our hip, knee, and trauma businesses. We also saw very strong growth in our Mako business somewhat offset by declines in [indiscernible]. Internationally orthopedics had an organic decline of 30.4%, which reflects the downturn in electric procedures across most geographies. MedSurg had constant currency decline of 16.4% and organic sales decline of 17%, which included a 22.2% decline in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales decline of 38%, driven by power tools, waste management, and surg account. This was partially offset by increases in the instruments, PPE products, namely our plain helmet and other protective products. As a reminder, instruments also had a very high comparable in Q2, 2019 with 19% growth. Endoscopy at U.S. organic sales decline of 34.1%, this reflects a slowdown in its video general surgery, communications, and sports medicine businesses. The medical division had U.S. organic growth of 5.4%, reflecting strong demand across it's bad and emergency care businesses, resulting from demand tied to COVID-19, which was offset by declines in stage, related to less patient slum. Internationally MedSurg had organic sales growth of 4.6%, reflecting strong demand for products in Australia, Canada, Europe, and emerging markets. neurotechnology and spine had a constant currency decline of 28.9% and an organic decline of 29.9%. Our U.S. neurotech business posted a constant currency decline of 36.4% and a 37.5% organic decline for the quarter. This reflects a slowdown in procedures in the quarter related to all our neurotech businesses. The decline was most pronounced in our ENT neurosurgical and CMF businesses. Internationally neurotechnology and spine had an organic decline of 13%, reflecting slowdowns in Europe, Canada, and emerging markets, which was offset by a solid performance in our neurovascular business. Now I will discuss operating metrics in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 57.3% was unfavorable 850 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by fixed cost absorption and business mix. The fixed cost absorption was significant and related to certain costs associated with idle manufacturing that normally would be capitalized into inventory. During Q2, we operated at 60% of normal capacity and the related unabsorbed costs diluted our margin by approximately 400 basis points. We anticipate Q3 will be at an average capacity of approximately 85%, unabsorbed costs will continue to impact our margin until our manufacturing is operating at normal levels. Adjusted R&D spending was 7.6% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 37.1% of sales, which was 360 basis points unfavorable to the prior-year quarter. Compared to the prior-year, SG&A was unfavorably impacted by business mix and de-leveraging of selling and marketing costs partially offset by operating expense savings actions taken during the quarter. In summary, for the quarter our adjusted operating margin was 12.5% of sales. The measures we enacted in March, covering most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings and consulting, as well as the idling of certain manufacturing lines and facilities including furloughing the related workers continued throughout the second quarter. Related to other income and expense as compared to prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding. Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.4%. Turning to cash flow and liquidity, we ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of $6.6 billion, including $4.6 billion related to Wright Medical funding and generated approximately $620 million of cash from operations in the quarter, which was ahead of our internal targets. This reflects earnings and a reduction in working capital primarily driven by accounts receivable during the quarter. As I noted in January, we did not repurchased any shares in Q1 nor do we plan to do so the remainder of the year. The actions that we implemented in the first quarter to conserve cash continued in Q2, and included discretionary spending controls, reduction in planned capital expenditures and project spending, focusing on opportunities and accounts payable and slowing M&A activities. Concerning our cash holdings and available credit lines, from a liquidity standpoint, we continue to be well positioned. We currently have available credit lines, none of which are drawn on at this time of approximately $3 billion. In addition, our investment grade credit rating supports good access to the capital markets and we have taken advantage of historically low rates to execute additional funding in the quarter of approximately $2.3 billion for the Wright Medical transaction. As it relates to this transaction, we estimate completing the required funding in the third quarter with the execution of up to an additional $1 billion. In terms of other future capital requirements, our quarterly dividend is approximately $215 million and we have one $300 million bond maturity due in Q4. As it relates to guidance for Q3 and the full-year, we reaffirm our previously announced decision to withdraw guidance given the continued significance of uncertainties at this time. We will continue to evaluate operating circumstances and the market environment for stability prior to reinstitution of guidance. And now I will open it up for Q&A. Yes. Sure, Bob. This is Glenn. I think in general, we are not giving specific guidance, but that minus 10% is directionally correct across most of our businesses, and then we fully expect to see continued momentum moving into July. Hey, sorry, Joanne, I was muted. I gave you a great answer, though. Yes. Hey. So, Joanne, I'll speak qualitative to 2021. We're not really looking to guide just yet and expect that that will happen after we have our Q4 earnings call, but as we think about next year, we do think that there will be a progressive recovery more optimistic based on what we see right now, and so, that will obviously play forward into 2021. From a cost structure standpoint, we are sort of experiencing sort of new ways of working and being more virtual and obviously saving on travel and other things, and I think there will be lots of examples of how that might play into our operating structure in the future. We currently have a whole taskforce made up of our senior leadership team that's really looking at [technical difficulty] and how we might come back. So, I fully expect that as we look at our financial model and our operating structure for next year, we'll expect to see sort of the impact of some of that. Yes, hi, Vijay. Yes, you actually, you heard those numbers right. Capacity was around 65%, on average for Q2. And we actually do see it stepping up on an average to about 85% in Q3, but in Q2 it was about 400 basis points impact in terms of sort of fixed period costs that we had the expense as a result of some of those idlings. You could probably do the math on that number, relative to the 85% in Q3 and come pretty close to what we anticipate the amount will be. Keep in mind though that we're forecasting where we think the ramp might be and where it actually might be could be somewhat different and that certainly would impact how we ramp up manufacturing. Sure, sure. On instruments, you know, they primarily have two very large segments, one of those being orthopedic solutions, which is powered instruments that are primarily used in orthopedic procedures. And then, the other surgical technologies, which has our safety products, our waste management products, you know obviously the orthopedic solutions scaled downward with just the elective procedure drop offs in orthopedics. On the surgical technology front, I would tell you that. Yes, I watched some of their equipment was significantly down there you know, personal protective equipment and products that relate to that did very well. I would also tell you that, and I suddenly said this in my earnings script that last year instruments grew almost 19% in the quarter. And so, it was a very, very high comparable and bar that they would have to overcome to even come close to growth and I think you see that impact in the decline they had for the quarter. Okay, Kristen, I will try to cover both of those in one fell swoop here. So you're right in the non-GAAP table, you can see that we recorded charges of about $170 million, and they were related to in-process asset impairments, product lines, and just sort of some other exit costs that that really resulted from our decision to suspend certain investments due to pandemic related constraints. I would tell you that the lion's share of those costs and those in-process costs were related to our 2020 ERP implementation, which we pause as a result of the pandemic. And really just in accordance with kind of the accounting rules and due to all the uncertainties of the situation, we were unsure of what the restart date would be of our ERP project at this time. And so thus we impaired some of those related in-process costs that had been previously capitalized. And then, on the other questions, yes, we continue to have costs that are related to EU MDR. And we'll have those flowing into next year that are just like everyone else of our peers are recorded in our non-GAAP charges and we expected that program will likely continue for about three years, and then on the cash flow front, we -- I think if you look at our cash flow, we just -- for the quarter it just really reflected good working capital performance. You combine strong collections with relatively flat inventories. We continue to work with our vendors on payment terms, and then all of that was just complimented by just the discretionary spending controls as well as measured CapEx spend, and I think all of that combined to produce a really positive cash flow result for the quarter. Sure. Hi, Patrick, this is Glenn. I'll answer that. What our Flex business is as busy as it's ever been. And I would tell you that just given in the current conditions and maybe some of the uncertainties hospitals may have about their liquidity, and I think that the fact that we can use Flex Financial to sort of customize these financial options for our customers is certainly making a very big impact on those capital businesses. I would tell you that during Q2, Mako sales were quite robust and we supported our customers through a variety of financing options. And then lastly -- the last bit of color I'll say is that just, given the circumstances, we definitely are seeing a shift to financing more deals than we have historically experienced. And I fully believe that that will continue throughout the rest of this year."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment and how certain countries and products performed during the quarter. We saw progressive improvement in sales throughout the quarter, with April being the low point. The improving trends were primarily driven by the resumption of elective procedures. That momentum is continuing into Q3 as July is trending better than June. We estimate that approximately 40% to 50% of our total global revenue includes procedures that are considered elective, or more accurately and be in many cases deferred for a period of time. This primarily includes hips and knees, extremities, spine, sports medicine, and our ENT business. Geographically, elective procedure recovery varied depending on the government action and severity of the pandemic. In addition to the U.S., countries like China, Australia, and Germany have also shown month-to-month improvements as elective procedures returned during the quarter, reaching approximately 85% to 90% of pre-COVID levels. The U.K., India, and Latin America lagged during the quarter at less than 50% of pre-COVID levels, as the pandemic continues to spread in these countries. During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our large capital products, specifically beds and stretchers within our medical division, and ongoing high demand for our Mako robotics technology. In the second quarter, we were very pleased with the Mako installations in the U.S., including increased sales to ASU and competitive accounts. We continue to see a growing percentage of both hip and knee replacement surgeries being performed with a Mako robot. As it relates to knee, there's an ongoing shift towards the metals. We also launched a new software upgrade for the Mako Hip program. That includes features, which improve the overall ease of use. Our leadership in orthopedic robotics, a strong order book, and a solid innovation pipeline positions us well to see continued above market growth in joint replacement. While we have made meaningful reductions and many discretionary spend items, our investment in R&D remains robust, as does our healthy cadence of new product introductions. During the first-half of the year, we are pleased with the customer feedback and results from several new products, some of which include spine [diagonal] [ph] lateral system, mini-frag plating and trauma, and Neurovascular Vecta 71 and 74 intermediate catheters. These and other launches will contribute to our performance for the rest of the year and position us well for the future. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a slowdown in elective procedures, it has also placed increased emphasis on the safety of healthcare providers and their patients. Over the years, we have built an extensive portfolio within our MedSurg businesses, addressing many of the challenges our customers face with the focus on accident, and infection prevention, and caregiver safety. This includes product just like our patient hygiene and disinfecting products, personal protective equipment, waste management and smoke evacuation devices along with the LUCAS chest compression system, which delivers high-quality automated CPR, while reducing the proximity of the caregiver to the patient. With the ongoing threat of COVID-19 infections, the Department of Defense identified automated compression devices, such as the LUCAS device as the best practice for delivery of CPR. Demand for these patients grew during the quarter in response to these increased safety concerns. We will continue to leverage our diverse portfolio to address changing trends and meet the expectations of our customers, caregivers, and patients. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. This is Preston, and I'll take that one. Just as we think about where we're going and the expansion of Mako, the opportunity still exists given the penetration that that's currently we're today. I think we have opportunities all throughout. So whether they're competitive accounts that are in or out, we're really just going to all of those different accounts and trying to find areas to place Mako. Yes, what I would tell you, as you think about the catch up, there was clearly as we came into the recovery, some level of patients that had previously deferred procedures that were catching up and having those procedures done. We also know that that the backlog was big, and there still are some patients that are out there that have some level of anxiety and maybe they continue to defer some of those procedures for some bit of time. I think it's important though, if you think about the products that we have and the disease states that we serve. Those disease states don't really improve over time, and so, we believe that many of those patients will return to have those procedures done at some point in time. The other thing I would say is, as this pandemic was happening, we do know that surgeons were not only cleaning and clearing through the backlog, but they were also seeing new patients, whether that was in office sometimes or through telemedicine. So, because of those things, we believe that the backlog remain strong into Q3. Absolutely, Josh this is Preston. Just to think about you're right. I think with the COVID response for some of that margin capital, certainly saw the big uptick early in the quarter. It's hard to say given where we are and some of the continuation of flare-ups and then shift around of demand, what's really pull forward versus what's going to be the normal, but I would say as we think about that, we still see a strong order book as we exited in our capital businesses, and at this point in time, we've not seen any significant stockpiling of our capital equipment either. So I would say it's hard to tell where that's going to be as we look forward, but certainly strong throughout the quarter, second quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. On today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Katherine with some perspectives on our mix of deferrable and capital businesses. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarter results and liquidity position before we open the call to Q&A.  As you know, Katherine will be shifting out of her role on June 1, so this will be her last Stryker earnings call. While this is not quite the finish she had in mind at the end of February, I did want to take a moment to express my gratitude for her outstanding work the past 13 years. She has been a great help to me and the management team of Stryker. Also if you include her time covering Stryker as a sell-side analyst, this will be her 97th Stryker earnings call. She has seen a lot, but nothing quite like what we are going through right now.  On today's call, we will review our first quarter results and provide additional details regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses in March and into the second quarter. I would also highlight many initiatives underway to ensure we maintain a strong cash position through stringent controls to manage through this unprecedented environment.  For Q1, we achieved organic sales growth of 2.4%, reflecting strong momentum through the first two months of the quarter and into March, followed by a marked slowdown tied principally to a deferral in elective procedures. We took a number of steps in March to aggressively limit travel to ensure the safety of our employees and customers, while ensuring our essential personnel were available to support health care workers around the world. These efforts, along with other cost controls, helped to mitigate some of the impact on earnings, from the slowdown in sales resulting in adjusted per share earnings of $1.84, a decline of 2% versus the prior year. The sales drop became more pronounced towards the end of March, and in the last week of the month, our company sales declined 30% versus the prior year. The biggest declines were in hips, knees, spine and endoscopy, offset by our other businesses. By geography, Japan, Canada, and smaller countries in Europe and emerging markets performed well, while China was clearly the weakest.  In Q2, we expect a recovery in China, but most other geographies will get worse, given the spread of the virus. For the month of April, our company sales will decline by 35% to 40% versus 2019. Looking at the remainder of the quarter, we are encouraged by the planned gradual resumption of elective surgeries in the U.S. and abroad. Portfolio products are being impacted by COVID-19 in numerous ways. Clearly, we are seeing a deferral in elective procedures, particularly within our orthopedics and spine businesses. We fully expect, given the chronic and progressive nature of the conditions impacting these patients, that the vast majority of them will be treated in the coming months, recognizing that the exact timing of a broad resumption of elective procedures is too fluid to predict. And as hospital needs to treat COVID-19 patients escalated sharply in March and into April, we saw a significant increase in the demand of products across our roughly $2 billion medical portfolio, which Katherine will discuss in more detail. In response, our manufacturing teams have been aggressively ramping capacity of much needed products while also ensuring we scale back other plants where demand has been negatively impacted.  Overall, given our mix of businesses and the cost control initiatives underway, coupled with our strong balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to manage through this slowdown. Given the fluid nature of the current situation, we are not providing Q2 or full year guidance. However, we expect to maintain the cost control efforts for most of 2020.  We are also setting ourselves up to respond quickly as customer demands return. We are providing financial assistance to hold our sales forces in place and continue to invest in our pipeline of new products. We are proceeding with integration efforts regarding Wright Medical. And given the impact of the virus on competitive hiring, we are expecting a minimal level of sales force attrition. As was publicly announced, Wright held its shareholder meeting on Friday, April 24, and the deal was approved. This reduced the tender of threshold from 95% to 80%. The tender offer was extended until June 30, which is customary as we continue to work through the closing conditions. We expect to close around the end of Q3 2020.  Please note, beyond this update, we have no new information to share with you regarding Wright Medical and we will not be taking any questions on this pending acquisition during today's call.  Before I turn the call over to Katherine, I would like to take a moment to thank all of our employees around the globe for their commitment to ensuring the safety of their colleagues, their families and our customers. Our sales forces across our businesses who are essential to supporting doctors and caregivers have demonstrated unwavering commitment during this pandemic.  Our manufacturing teams have worked tirelessly to optimize the plant network and to ramp capacity where needed. And we have created rapid innovations in response to the pandemic. We will continue to support our employees and our customers as they work to meet the needs of the many patients that will need treatment. While our many year growth momentum has been temporarily derailed, the Stryker spirit is alive and well and we remain poised to capitalize as the situation improves.  And now over to Katherine.\nKatherine Owen: Thanks, Kevin. My update today will focus on providing greater granularity around our mix of businesses that are particularly impacted by the COVID-19 virus. Overall, we estimate that 40% to 50% of our total global revenue include procedures that are considered elective, or more accurately, can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. This includes primarily our orthopedic businesses, including hips and knees, extremities as well as spine and Neurotech's ENT. There are also procedures within our endoscopy portfolio that can be deferred, including some of the scoping procedures and sports medicine.  Additionally, with many states and countries having implemented or recently come out of state-at-home orders, we have seen a slowdown in trauma. This can be attributed to fewer people out driving, a slowdown in construction and general decline in overall activity that traditionally drives trauma procedures. Unlike truly elective procedures, the patients deferring surgeries addressed by our products will not improve with time, rather, their underlying conditions generally continue to deteriorate. So while the exact timing of the resumption of elective procedures to more normalized level is difficult to predict at this point in time, we do anticipate the vast majority of patients treated by our products will return. We also assume the resumption of procedures will continue to vary by country, state and municipality as they increasingly move past the peak impact of the virus.  In contrast to the impact we are seeing from deferred surgeries, other parts of our portfolio are experiencing significantly heightened demand, as Kevin noted. This is most noteworthy for our medical business, which had sales of roughly $2.3 billion in 2019 or approximately 15% of total Stryker revenue and is comprised primarily of capital equipment. It's important to recognize that our capital equipment portfolio, which represented about 25% of our total sales in 2019, includes both large capital and small capital at about 9% and 16%, respectively.  Our large capital equipment offering includes Mako, beds and structures within medical, Endoscopy's communication portfolio and Spine's enabling technology, which includes Mobius and navigation. Turning to smaller capital equipment, this bucket includes medical emergency costs and defibrillators, Endoscopy's cameras, Instrument's power tools and waste management, and neuro-powered instruments that are reported within Neurotechnology. Of note, small capital is typically used in the OR and, as such, tracks more closely to growth in procedures.  Against that backdrop, we are seeing strong demand across essentially the entirety of the medical offering, including beds and stretchers, physio, emergency cost and Sage. We are also seeing meaningful increase in demand for Instruments flight personal protection offerings, which is included in their base product portfolio within surgical technologies.  Across the board, we have ramped capacity to meet the current demand and what we anticipate will be ongoing demand as hospitals look to better position their capacity and stockpiles going forward. In late March, we developed the Stryker emergency release bed, which helps emergency responders manage patients efficiently during this critical time. We started manufacturing this low-cost bed at the end of March, which broadens our medical offering beyond ICU and MedSurg beds to better meet customer needs. Other efforts to assist with responding to COVID-19 include the production of face shields for health care professionals and a new patient protective covering product, which attaches to our ambulant structures.  Overall, while the slowdown in elective procedures has and will continue to impact our top line, we are able to leverage our unique product portfolio and offset part of that impact through the demand for our medical and instrument offered. We expect this trend will continue into Q2 with an ongoing gradual increase in elective procedures.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Katherine. Your comments are as insightful as always. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results, related drivers and certain liquidity matters. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.  Our organic sales growth was 2.4% in the quarter. These results included U.S. growth of 2% and international growth of 3.3%, recognizing that approximately 75% of total sales, our business is significantly weighted in the U.S. As a reminder, this quarter included 1 additional selling day as compared to Q1 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.4% from the prior year quarter, while foreign currency had an unfavorable 0.9% impact on sales. During the quarter, our growth was significantly negatively impacted by reductions in elective surgeries that occurred in the last 2 weeks of March. This impact was most pronounced on our joint replacement procedures. In light of the current environment, we wanted to provide additional detail with respect to our businesses and geographies. For the month of April, our U.S. Orthopedics and spine sales were down roughly 65%, while MedSurg and Neurotechnology posted declines of roughly 25%.  Asia Pacific declined roughly 20%, while Europe was down nearly 55%. Our Latin American business was solid, delivering 20% growth for the month of April. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.84 represents a decline of 2.1% from Q1 2019. Our first quarter EPS was negatively impacted by $0.02 from foreign currency, which was slightly higher than our previous expectations, given currency fluctuations. Certain other factors resulted in disproportionately negative impacts on EPS, including the loss of higher-margin sales and a loss of leverage related to manufacturing and operational fixed costs. In addition, the lack of share buybacks in Q1 2020 resulted in a higher-than-average share count outstanding.  I will now provide some brief comments on segment sales. Orthopaedics had constant currency and organic decline of 1.2%. This included U.S. growth of 0.3%. This growth included positive impacts from knees, trauma and extremities and Mako. Internationally, Orthopaedics had an organic decline of 4.3%, which primarily reflects an earlier downturn in certain geographies. MedSurg had constant currency growth of 7% and organic growth of 6.3%, which included a 5.6% increase in the U.S.  Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.8%, driven by gains in their surgical cutting blades, waste management, Steri-Shield, Surg account and smoke evacuation product lines. This performance was particularly impressive given the tough comps from Q1 2019 and further validates our decision to split the sales force into orthopaedic instruments and surgical technologies.  Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 2.9%. This reflects positive growth in its core video and general surgery products, offset by a slowdown in its communications and sports medicine businesses. The medical division had U.S. organic growth of 9.1%, reflecting strong demand across its bed and emergency care businesses, which accelerated meaningfully in the latter part of March, owing to demand tied to COVID-19.  Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 9.1%, reflecting a slower impact to capital businesses in key geographies. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 1.5% and an organic growth of 0.3%. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted constant currency growth of 0.2% and a 0.6% organic decline for the quarter. This reflects a slowdown in procedures in the latter half of March and some temporary supply disruptions during the quarter. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 9% and reflects balanced growth across most geographies and businesses.  Now I will discuss operating metrics for the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.3% was unfavorable 50 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by price, acquisitions, business mix and fixed cost absorption, the latter 2 of which were more pronounced during the second half of March.  Adjusted R&D spending was 6.4% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 34.8% of sales, which was 40 basis points unfavorable to the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year, SG&A was unfavorably impacted by business mix, deleveraging of selling and marketing costs and foreign exchange, and this was partially offset by operating expense savings actions taken during March.  In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24% of sales. Given the current environment, we enacted measures in March covering most of our discretionary spending. These included curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings, consultants as well as the idling of certain manufacturing lines and facilities, including furloughing the related workers. Subsequent to March, we also have enacted salary reductions impacting most of our leadership positions.  Related to other income and expense, we saw a benefit in investment income, which was partially offset by increased interest expense related to the eurobond offering that was completed late last year. Moving forward, though, given an unexpected decline in investment income earned on deposits and the impact of other rate changes, OI&E will increase by approximately $5 million to $8 million per quarter. This does not include the impact of any additional debt issuance for Wright Medical.  Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.3%. This included the benefit related to stock compensation expense and other discrete items.  Turning to cash flow and liquidity. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of $4 billion and generated approximately $591 million of cash from operations in the quarter. This is ahead of our internal targets and significantly more than in Q1 2019. This reflects increased earnings and a reduction in working capital, primarily driven by accounts receivable during the quarter. As I noted in January, we did not repurchase any shares in Q1, nor do we plan to do so during the remainder of the year.  In addition to the discretionary spending controls I previously outlined, we have also taken steps to conserve cash. Including reductions in planned capital expenditures and project spending, focusing on opportunities and accounts payable and slowing M&A activities. Considering our cash holdings and available credit lines, from a liquidity standpoint, we are well positioned. We currently have available credit lines, none of which are drawn on at this time of approximately $3 billion.  In addition, our investment-grade credit rating supports good access to the capital markets, and we would anticipate taking advantage of historically low rates to complete the funding for Wright Medical. In terms of future capital requirements, our quarterly dividend is approximately $215 million, and we have 1 $300 million bond maturity due in Q4. As it relates to guidance for Q2 and the full year, we reaffirm our previously announced decision to withdraw guidance, given the significance of uncertainties at this time.  We will continue to evaluate operating circumstances in the market environment for stability prior to reinstitution of guidance. And now, I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. \nRobert Hopkins: Congrats to Katherine, 97 is a big number. A couple of -- two quick things. One, first, Kevin, for you. I'd love some help. And I think about your capital businesses. I'm curious, are there scenarios where you think the increase in demand that you're seeing lasts more than a few quarters? And then just generally, what could happen to growth on the other side of the demand surge?\nKevin Lobo: So Bob, I'll take that, the first part, and then I'll pass it to Katherine. As it relates to large capital, I think Katherine provided you the breakdown of our large capital in her prepared remarks. The beds and stretchers are the ones experiencing kind of a spike in demand. And at this point, it's really too difficult to ascertain whether that's pull forward or whether that's just extra demand because there is this need to build stockpiles. There is this need to have beds -- certain number of beds and expansion of beds, primarily related to coronavirus, but it may not be something that's just pull forward, it may be additional demand.  As it relates to the other large capital communications, Mako and those other components, those -- that's going to start to slow down, as you probably would imagine. We're not seeing orders being canceled, but there is a bit of deferral going on. And that I would expect would continue to pick up in the future. And maybe I'll turn it to Katherine to talk about small capital.\nKatherine Owen: Yes, Bob, first of all, thank you. It's -- I would say, if you look at small capital, that's about 16% of the total, and it does tend to track with surgeries. So that business has not benefited anywhere near to the same degree as the medical, particularly beds and stretchers have. So I think you're going to see that be more in line with our elective procedures come back on. And some of it is going to be tied to hospital liquidity. And keep in mind, through Flex Financial, we have a lot of ability here to help hospitals think about different constructs to finance those purchases.  So it's very different from the Great Recession in terms of how medical business is being impacted. But I do think there's going to be continued uncertainty around the pull forward because we just don't have a strong sense yet what the new norm is going to look like for stockpiling.\nRobert Hopkins: And I guess just one quick follow-up, sort of another big picture question. Kevin, a few of the other medical device CEOs have offered up that they think growth could return by the fourth quarter. And I'm just curious if you -- from what you're seeing in the world and in terms of what you're seeing from your customers, do you share that optimism? Or are you a little bit more cautious?\nKevin Lobo: Well, thanks, Bob. As you can imagine, we've run a lot of scenarios, and I don't have a crystal ball, but certainly, that is a scenario that we think could very well happen. The pent-up demand is there. I think the recovery will probably come in waves. So you have a number of employees that are furloughed that would love to get their procedures done now while they have health care coverage, worried about what could happen in the future. That could be a first wave of resumption of procedures. And then you also have people who have taken time off and that may not be able to take time off later, so that could cause a slight dip and then a resumption again. But it really is going to relate to how the overall economy recovers and how the virus evolves in the future. But that certainly is a scenario that we believe could happen. But again, this is unchartered water. So we'll see.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: I'm going to echo Bob's comments, Katherine. Congratulations. Just a couple of quick questions for me. I wanted to follow up a little bit on maybe a different way of focusing on Bob's question. But there's a view, Kevin, right now that amongst some of your peers, economic exposure to recon is somehow different, so first, there's other device procedures that's somewhat less -- that are more less deferrable, orthopaedics is sort of more deferrable. What are your thoughts around the economic sensitivity of hips and knees be? It's sort of the perception that they are very economically sensitive but the data is not exactly clear initially into a notion that people think ortho would recover after other types of medical device implantable procedures. What's your view on that economic exposure and your recovery relative to other med tech?\nKevin Lobo: Well, David, I mean, obviously, this is uncharted waters, as I mentioned at the end of my answer to Bob's question. But what I would say is the hospitals are very motivated to do our procedures. If you think about orthopedics and spine procedures, they are moneymakers for hospitals. And the hospitals who are treating coronavirus patients now are bleeding in their P&LS. So there's a financial motivation. Also, patients certainly that are suffering would like to get those procedures done. So I'm not in some of the other spaces of other elective procedures, so it's hard for me to do a compare and contrast. But the hospital CEOs and the surgeons that I've spoken to are all absolutely gearing up to start bringing back their patients. And the surveys they've done with patients have suggested that patients are very comfortable coming back. As soon as the hospitals say it's going to be safe for them, I think those patients will be coming back. So I don't believe that there's something unique about orthopaedic surgery that would cause that to be pushed to the back of the line. On the contrary, given its economic impact to the hospitals, I think it could be moved earlier in the chain.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Very helpful. And then just a related question. Just Glenn gave us some numbers on the percent decline in April procedures. So a couple of questions there were just have you seen in recent days or a rolling 7-day average, a recovery or any kind of bounce off the trough for your Orthopaedic procedures? And there's been a lot of discussion around inpatient versus outpatient. Have you seen a difference in terms of how procedures are recovering if they are in inpatient versus outpatient? Is there an opportunity to use this particular pandemic as a way of pushing more procedures to the outpatient market?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, David, there's a couple of questions in that. I think the first one, the percentages that I gave you are absolutely up to date. And so I don't have any sort of further data or information that would support a bifurcation of that. In terms of looking at what's going to outpatient or what's inpatient, I think it's still too early and it's still dynamic, and it's evolving in the moment. So it's something that we obviously are watching very closely. And as soon as we have data or monitoring on it, we would provide that. But I'll let Katherine comment on that as well.\nKatherine Owen: Yes. I just would follow-up, David. Just keep in mind, the shift to recon procedures in the ASC setting is already underway. This probably continues us down that path, but there's only so much capacity. There are about 300 ASCs in the U.S. that are doing hip and knee procedures. They are essentially running at full capacity. Now they may be able to do more by staying later on working weekends. But that is really dwarfed by the number of hospitals in the U.S., which is about 5,000. So I think you're going to see the shift continue, but I wouldn't expect some massive climate change in the trend because the capacity just isn't there to absorb it.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Maybe one on the robotics side. I know it falls into the large capital bucket. Is there a view that either hospitals see this as a differentiated investment as a way of differentiating themselves from peers. So when we think about in the post-COVID world, that demand should normalize for something like Mako? Or just maybe give us some color on how we should be thinking of what Mako, because there is a view of that as systems are capacity constrained, maybe utilization of robotics might be -- might lag a little bit here.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks for the question. I would say that those surgeons that are believers in Mako or believers in robotics will resume their normal amount of work. We had terrific momentum. You can even see if you look at the line of other Orthopaedics, it performed very well in the quarter. We did see a bit of a slowdown in some of the Mako orders being delayed a little bit. So liquidity of the hospitals is important when you're outlaying large amounts of money. But we see tremendous signs of continued interest. No order is being canceled, just being delayed a little bit until elective surgeries resumes. And yes, hospitals do see it as a differentiator, and we continue to be very bullish about the prospects of Mako.  Underscoring what Katherine said earlier about Flex Financial, I think that's something that we're going to use even more probably as ASCs want to acquire Makos, and they don't typically have the same size of capital budgets, but we have a number of different vehicles to help them finance their capital. And so we do expect to Mako to absolutely resume the kind of trajectory we're on once the elective surgery comes back in force.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Kevin. And maybe one for Glenn. On the cost structure, fixed versus variable, how should we think about decremental margins here as you think about the next, call it, 3 to 12 months?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. At this point, just given sort of the fluidity of the situation and looking forward, I'm not sure that I can guide you to an exact sort of margin number. I will say that to the extent expenses are discretionary, what I've mentioned, travel meetings, consulting and many other things, we have curtailed those or discontinued those. We discontinued most of our hiring, and we furloughed manufacturing employees that are at facilities where we've slowed down or stopped certain lines. It's really difficult to sort of predict our exact operating state. I do think some of those expenses, obviously, will come back as we ramp back up. But at this point in time, as I think about our future cost structure, I do anticipate that many of these things will be impacted and we'll feel the impact from them throughout the remainder of this year and, frankly, on into 2021.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Crédit Suisse.\nMatthew Miksic: Just one follow-up, if I could, on ASC for Katherine, your comments on the number of orthopaedic-oriented sort of ASCs out there. Could you talk a little bit about the potential impact on spine? And then I had 1 follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Sure. I can take the first part of that. Okay. Sorry, Katherine. I'll start that. So spine procedures are done in the ASCs, but they tend to be the more basic procedures like ACDS. So it's not an enormous part of the overall spine market, and we think we're well positioned there to be able to deliver the products need for those procedures. Sorry, Katherine, go ahead.\nKatherine Owen: No, nothing additional. Just to say, it's probably low single digits, the percent of spine procedures that are done in the ASC setting at this time.\nMatthew Miksic: Got it. Okay. And then on just some of the -- to your point about the bulk of the lift here in terms of returning to elective orthopedic procedures, sounds like from your description, needs to happen in acute care centers. What are the next steps that you see happening there? What are the constraints, I guess? States are just starting to open up. Is it the middle of May? Is it some percentage of utilization that we start to see? What would be the things that you expect to see over the next several weeks to help us understand if that's happening and to what degree?\nKatherine Owen: I think it's going to be very gradual. We're seeing states, and not just in the U.S., overseas, they're moving slowly, and it really just depends where they are in meeting guidelines, where they are in peak cases. So we don't have a perfect formula to tell you what it's going to look like. It just seems to be pointing in the direction, and this is uncharted territory, but pointing in the direction that we're going to continue to see more and more states resume elective procedures. Those patients need to be treated.  As Kevin indicated, it's a profitable procedure for hospitals. And so I think it's just going to be gradual. So we're probably in a better position a month from now than we are today, but it's also very much a wait and see as hospitals get increasingly comfortable and start to recognize the new normal of how they deal with COVID patients while also recognizing they have to treat the broader spectrum of patients.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. The only thing I'd add to that comment is a lot of hospitals are actually gearing up to be able to work extra hours even on weekends. They won't do that day one. Obviously, they're going to gradually start to bring patients back, but that's something that they're planning for in the back half of the year. And so I do expect, as I mentioned before, seeing this recovery come back in waves is pretty likely.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: One product question and one kind of big picture question. Just on the April trend of negative 25%, I think, for Neurotechnology and Spine, did that apply to your neurovascular business as well? Or has that been more resilient? And I had 1 follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, Larry. Yes, that did include our neurovascular business as well in that statistic.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Got it. And Kevin, just taking a step back, what do you think the long-term implications are of this -- of coronavirus for med tech? And how are you positioning Stryker for success in a post coronavirus world?\nKevin Lobo: No, thanks. That's a big question. I would tell you that I think we're very well positioned given the diversity -- diversification of our portfolio. Obviously, elective surgeries are very important to us, but we're not only an elective surgery company. And the fact that MedSurg is the largest of our 3 segments certainly helps protect us and insulate us from the full effect. I think that diversification will serve us well, but -- and we believe still in our strategy. And this is not going to cause a change in our strategy of category leadership and leading positions in all the segments we choose to play in. It's not going to take us off our approach to M&A. We will emerge from this, and we believe the fact that we've stayed and conserved a fairly conservative balance sheet has really helped us. And even with the upcoming Wright Medical acquisition, we have a very good and strong financial position.  Things will change. There will be a lot less travel. I could tell you that we've learned a lot about technology. The way we're engaging with customers through this has been amazing for me to watch, surgeon engagement, hospital engagement. And even our employees, we tend to be a high-touch culture and we're learning that technologies, you can do a lot of really amazing education things with technology. So that, I think, will become a more permanent thing. And our R&D teams are learning how to work very, very effectively, including surgeon collaborations virtually.  So those are the things that will be more, I think, more permanent. The trend to ASCs will only accelerate. But as Katherine mentioned, a long way to go still. But that pace will increase. Those are probably the 2 things I would point out to. But other than that, I think we're just going to be getting back to the regular offense that we had before.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank.\nPhilip Chickering: I want to echo thanks to Katherine for lots of your help over the years. First question is, as several states are moving to allow surgeries to start happening again, what is your sales force in those states telling you about what the doctors are planning? And how does OR block schedules look in those states?\nKatherine Owen: Thanks, Pito. I don't have any definitive data because it really does vary. You have hospitals, even in New York, where we know they're gearing up to resume procedures, elective procedures, hip and knees, in particular, in May. And I think it's really going to depend on the type of hospital or teaching institution or where they're located geographically. So they may be doing more procedures over the weekends, more procedures in the evening. I think they're all going to be highly motivated. We do know that their waitlist of patients is pretty high. We are hearing that the patients -- I know there's some concerns, will they be willing to go back to hospitals, what we're hearing when we talk to customers, their waitlist remain healthy and patients are listening to their doctors. They listen to them when they said, don't have the surgery right now. And when they tell them it's safe to come back in and they realize they're not going to be going in to get their hip and need done through the emergency room, where their concerns are much greater, they're comfortable with it. But there's no perfect model to say this is how they're going to deal with it. I think there's going to be flexibility and a number of different methods that take place to address the backlog of these patients that need to be treated.\nPhilip Chickering: Great. And then for neuro, like you mentioned that there are some supply disruptions that you saw for neuro supply. Can you look at that a little more and talk about which other facilities you idled and like how are your inventory levels for these products?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. We had, as you probably heard, an earthquake in Salt Lake City, which is one of our manufacturing facilities for neurovascular. That caused a slight disruption in that business. And then we also had a bit of supply challenges with the Neuro Powered Instruments portfolio. And those, again, are temporary nature. This happens to us from time to time over the years. You hear this. In 1 quarter, we might have a slight disruption in supply. And so those are the two things that hit the Neurotechnology business, both of which are largely resolved or will be resolved certainly by the time we get to Q3, Q4.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Kaila Krum from SunTrust.\nKaila Krum: So you mentioned that you've made several cost-cutting adjustments. So my question is, if demand does return sort of fairly quickly in the second part of this year, are you comfortable that you have the infrastructure, supply and manufacturing employees in place to support that demand?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Kaila. It's one of the things that literally we are meeting almost every other day on in terms of how do we need to position ourselves to ramp back up and getting a good feel for what products will be in demand and where are we from an inventory standpoint with those products. And also, how are we preparing for our employees to come back to work so that we can meet that demand. So I do feel like we are positioning ourselves very well, and we have a pretty good understanding of where we think demand will peak, and we're doing all we can to be ready for that to happen.\nKaila Krum: Okay. That's helpful. And then you guys mentioned you're slowing M&A activity. Does that effectively mean we shouldn't expect any M&A activity outside of Wright for the rest of the year? Or what would be sort of a catalyst to push you guys to be more sort of opportunistic on M&A in this environment?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. And you mentioned Wright, we actually have the biggest M&A going on right now that we've ever had ever. So that's one thing that we obviously are focused on. I guess I would say that business development remains sort of an ongoing part of our long-term strategy. And obviously, we'll balance potential opportunities with our liquidity position and where we want to be even next year and the following year on liquidity. But I could see that we would get back to smaller tuck-in acquisitions. We have slowed it. We have paused it. We have not turned it off. We're keeping close to the market just to understand. But I think, in some ways, it will allow us to have more time over target and be smarter about where we are choosing to execute on M&A opportunities.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Great. I wanted to ask about MedSurg. You gave some great clarity into the areas that are benefiting. And Kevin, I think you said it really well, you don't have a crystal ball, you don't know what's going to happen. But maybe in the 2 scenarios, one where there is a second wave, one where there is not, is this a business that you think saw stockpiling or acceleration of purchases here? Or do you think there's still a lot more to come through the rest of the year? Should we see another wave of infections?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I think the demand -- we're -- in some of our categories, we're selling everything we can make right now. So I would say we're a long way from having filled up any stockpiles. So I think if this coronavirus continues at an accelerated pace or if there's a second wave, I would expect a commensurate increase in the sales of those products, be it the flight protection, system and instruments or the majority of the medical portfolio.\nRobert Marcus: Great. And maybe on the financial side, how should we be thinking about free cash flow this year relative to earnings? Are you going to be building inventory here? Anything that we should pay attention to that would change the conversion rate materially from free cash flow -- from net income to free cash flow?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I think, Robbie, the single biggest thing we're going to feel in the coming quarters related to free cash flow is just going to be reduced earnings. And frankly, if there's less sale, there's less accounts receivable to collect. And so that will be the single biggest impact, I think, that we'll feel. We obviously -- with manufacturing slowed and certain manufacturing lines idled, we're mindful of not building inventories and where we do think that we might have to build inventories. We're very selective in terms of how we think that will come back. So I really think, given the uncertainties that we will be facing, we're making very prudent decisions relative to cash conservation.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel.\nFrederick Wise: Congratulations, Katherine. We'll miss you. First, Kevin, maybe you could expand on your comments on the international business generally. You highlighted, obviously, China was the weakest in the first quarter internationally. And you gave us the April down 35% to 40%. I think that was a worldwide. Now I wasn't sure if that was worldwide or U.S. But regardless, are you seeing any signs of recovery in some of the weakest international markets? If yes, maybe you could just give us a little additional color about how you expect those weaker international areas to recover and whether that informs your thinking at all about the U.S.?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Rick. What I would say is, certainly, China was the most negative in the first quarter. The 35% to 40% number I gave was a global number. So that's what April is finishing, but I don't have the exact number because, is it the last day? We haven't closed a month, but it will be in that 35% to 40% range.  What we saw in the first quarter, certainly, China was very negative. That is recovering. I think they're back to roughly 60% to 70% of where they normally were prior to the virus. And it's sort of gradually improving. So China is getting healthier. Japan, we had a terrific first quarter in Japan, and I think that will get marginally worse in the second quarter. But they've done a very good job of managing it. Same thing with South Korea. We had a very good first quarter, and we're not seeing South Korea slow down.  The big wildcard in the international market is Europe. And even Australia, to some degree, where Australia had initially said that they were going to cancel all elective surgeries for the entire quarter. And now 2 weeks later, 25% of the procedures are now back and being scheduled. So that's how fluid it is. Just in 2 weeks, they went from nothing for the whole quarter to back to 25%.  So all this to say, it's going to be difficult to predict what happens in the U.K., what's going to happen in Germany. And so Europe is the wildcard area. I think it's certainly going to be worse than it was in the first quarter. And how much worse, it's hard to say right now. I think for us, Europe was something in the 55% down range in April. And I think that's likely going to continue throughout this quarter. It should get better towards the end of the quarter. But again, it's hard to predict.\nFrederick Wise: And just as a follow-up on the knee business. Maybe you could just again give us a little more color and your high-level thinking. I know we don't have all the numbers yet, more to come, but your U.S. knee business held up relatively well. I mean, honestly. And maybe talk about some of the initiatives that you're pursuing to sustain what would have seemed to be likely outperformance in the first quarter and even under challenging conditions in the second quarter. Some of the detailed initiatives that you're undertaking with surgeons using Mako. Just any additional commentary would be very welcome.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Thanks, Rick. I'll start. Maybe Katherine can add to it. What I would say is there's nothing magical about our first quarter knee. It's the continuation of the trend of the last 4 years or 5 years where we've been consistently taking market share. I'm very proud of the work that our team has done on Mako as well as cementless. Both of which, as you saw over the last 2 or 3 years, have had steep increases in their adoption rates. And that continued in the first quarter.  I could tell you, at the end of February, we were feeling really, really good about our knee number. And then just like everybody else, there was a falloff that occurred about midway through March. The fact that it still ended the quarter in a positive territory for U.S. knees is pretty incredible. We're really pleased with that. And so again, it's just continued amazing momentum with Mako and with cementless, which are both huge portions of the knee sales that we have. And surgeons are very, very loyal to both Mako and to cementless based on the great outcomes they're getting with their patients.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Matt O'Brien from Piper Sandler.\nPatrick Bartoski: This is Patrick on for Matt. I'd like to start on your spine business. In 2019, you made a lot of good progress integrating K2M and getting that business up and running. So prior to the COVID-19 disruptions, I'd love to hear more color as to the dynamics that was happening within that business in January and February.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, I'm very pleased with how our spine business is progressing. Certainly, in the international markets, you see very good numbers. We even posted pretty good numbers in the first quarter. That's a continuation of what we saw last year. In the U.S., we started to see the improvement really in the November, sort of December time frame. That was continuing into January and February, and a number of new products were launched in the first quarter. Unfortunately, that got derailed, just like everybody else's spine business, around the middle of March, and we're not immune from that. But I would say I feel as good as I felt about our spine business since the acquisition of K2M. Every day, we sort of continue to build momentum.  And even the Mobius business, which we acquired towards the end of last year, is seeing tremendous demand as some hospitals are actually using it to do x-rays of the chest for the coronavirus. So we're actually trying to ramp our capacity of Mobius, which is, as you know, a mobile CT scan and really the only one in the market that's mobile, and they're using it for coronavirus. So we're actually ramping that capacity. So overall, the outlook for the future for spine is positive, as positive as we felt kind of entering the year.\nPatrick Bartoski: Great. That's really helpful color. And I had a quick follow-up, if you don't mind. I'd like to talk about clinical trials. We're hearing from other med tech peers that they're seeing anywhere from 6 months of delays on some of their trials. I know Stryker has had a great track record of new product introductions and has a lot of clinical trial catalysts. So is there anything material we need to think about from a clinical trial or new product perspective? And is 6 months the right way to think about some delays due to coronavirus?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. We're actually pretty fortunate that we don't have any major launches upcoming that are contingent to clinical trials. It's always a timing issue. If you just look at where our neurovascular or our PMA products portfolios are in their life cycle, we really don't have anything major pending. I think 6 months is a good way to look at it. We do have some minor delays in approvals. So some products, just getting them approved. If you think about our aspiration products in neurovascular, getting them approved in Europe. They are approved in the U.S. and we had a limited launch in the first quarter, which is proving very successful, but those aren't yet approved in Europe. So Europe is just overwhelmed with UMDR and other product approval site. That's more probably in the 3-month time frame than 6-month. But what's affecting us, at least in the short term, is more around getting products approved outside of clinical trials, and there really isn't anything major that's holding us back from a clinical trial standpoint.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Barclays.\nKristen Stewart: I'll echo the commentary on Katherine. It's been really great, knowing you both from the sell-side perspective and on the company perspective. You've done a great job just in your role, both on the IR and on the business development front. So I guess, one, I just wanted to go back to the question on this Medsurg and Neurotech down 25 because I would imagine a lot of different moving parts within those 2 kind of categories. Is there any way just to kind of give us a little bit more detail there to just kind of help us understand some of the puts and takes out of -- imagine on the medical side, you're seeing quite a bit of a benefit probably within the neurovascular. As Larry was kind of saying, it's probably one that's pretty defensive. And then maybe within some other areas within MedSurg, you're probably seeing a little bit more of a downtick just as some of that's more kind of capital. So any way to just kind of frame some of those moving parts or quantify some of the benefit that you're seeing from COVID? That would be really helpful. And I have 1 follow-up.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Okay. Yes. I think why you -- you did a pretty good summary. But I guess what I would say is, as you look at the number, you're right, medical is showing fairly strong positive numbers. I would say, across the rest of the portfolio, it was negative and it ranged anywhere, negative from 20% to as much as maybe 40% or 50%, depending on the business. Capital is a little lumpy, too. So some of the capital businesses were able to deliver and make deliveries during the month of April. And so they saw a little more favorability. I do think that as we move into May, we'll continue to see some of those downturns in that similar trend that we saw in April. And it might be a little more pronounced as some of the capital businesses trail off.\nKristen Stewart: Any way to quantify medical? And then my follow-up would just be on gross margins, how should we just think about as some of the plants are seeing lower throughput and you have some sitting idle, are you going to be expensing some of those -- the manufacturing absorption costs as period costs? Or will some of that be capitalized into inventory? And will that be a drag that will just kind of sit there and be recognized through cost of goods sold in future periods?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Okay. Sure. Yes. On the medical, I mean, let's leave it that it's positive. And that in the short term, we do sort of see that demand will still be heavy. Moving out, I think medical will be impacted, especially their beds and stretchers business. To the extent that, that's large capital and there could be liquidity issues with hospitals. On the gross margin question, you're absolutely right, the single biggest thing that will probably be a big impact in Q2 will be fixed cost absorption. And right now, we don't see that we would be capitalizing that in the balance sheet. We would only be able to capitalize to the extent we actually produce the inventory. And so you'll see that flow through the P&L, and that will be more significant and more pronounced than it certainly was in Q1.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies.\nRajbir Denhoy: I just really had one question, just a follow-up to the earlier question on the ASC or the ambulatory surgery center side. I appreciate that the capacity there is still somewhat limited, but I think one of the trends people are hearing about with COVID is that perhaps more volume will shift there over time. And so one of the things I was curious about is if you could maybe just ground us in kind of what the pricing environment is, the profitability environment is for you guys when you sell joint into that channel.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks. Right now, the profit profile is very similar to what we see in the hospitals. Most ASCs are affiliated with hospitals. Hospitals have a partial ownership, of course, in the ASC. And they tend to buy the implants on the same price contract that we have for their hospitals. So for us, the profit profile is very similar to what we see in the hospital.  Keep in mind that the biggest savings that they have, they make more money in procedures in the ASC. The surgeon usually has a part ownership, so they're very motivated. But the EBITDA of ASCs is higher than hospital, and the big reason for the -- is the savings and the facility costs. That's really why they make more money in the procedure. They don't need to drive down our implant prices to be able to drive that higher degree of profitability.  Obviously, they're different kind of facilities. You have to make life easy for them in terms of buying. We've created an entire offense around the ASC that I'm really excited about. If you asked me 3 or 4, 5 years ago, I was kind of concerned about ASCs, not sure how it would be for Stryker's business. Now I'm actually believing that it's going to be a very good thing for us because we have the booms, the lights, the operating tables, the Makos, all the capital power tools, Neptune waste management, everything that they need for their surgery, we can help them, and we have the disposables and the implants. And wrapping that up in a financing solution gives us a really tremendous advantage as more and more procedures go to the ASCs. So really, as of this point, we haven't seen much in the way of severe price pressure.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Richard Newitter from SVB Silicon Valley.\nRichard Newitter: I wanted to ask on the -- any protocol changes that are happening or that you're hearing about from your customers with respect to reps and the way you deliver your implant businesses to the physicians being allowed in the ORs and the hospital. How is that going to change, if at all? And then I have a follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So far, we haven't really seen any change. As you know, today, many of our reps are in the hospitals, our trauma reps, our neurovascular reps. So today, and even if you think about revision surgery or oncology surgeon within joint replacement, our reps are in the operating room today, arm and arm with the medical staff doing those procedures. And so we've heard some -- there could be some testing required for our sales reps in some places. That's -- it's very, very early, making sure they have the right PPE, that they're equipped correctly to make sure that they're not transmitting the coronavirus. But other than that, we haven't heard, really, any discussion about a blocking access or limiting access. Again, it's pretty early. Hospitals are preparing their plans. But mostly what we've heard so far is PPE and are they trained. And do they know how to put the proper PPE on and potentially having some degree of testing. The same expectation that they would have for their own staff who would be attending those surgeries.\nRichard Newitter: Great. And then just on the big ticket capital items, I was just curious, you said no one's really canceling as right now is more a postponement. I'm curious, what are they saying that they're going to need to see as you have the conversations? What do they need to see to potentially resume their decision-making process? And are you getting the sense these are 6- to 12-month delays or truly just indefinite?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I think they're temporary delays. I don't think they're indefinite. Look, there's a lot of uncertainty right now. They don't know if they're going to get a bolus of new patients for coronavirus. And the hospitals that are, let's say, New Jersey, New York, those that are at the epicenter or even Detroit, they lose a lot of money while their hospitals are not having elective surgery and while they're treating coronavirus patients. So obviously, the first $30 billion has been doled out to the hospitals. The next $30 billion is coming. The general allocation method didn't provide extra money to those patients, those hospitals that were treating coronavirus patients. $10 billion of the next $30 billion is going to be disproportionately pushed to those hospitals. So waiting to receive the money and seeing how much each hospital get is very important to their overall liquidity profile.  And then as they resume elective surgeries, as I mentioned earlier, that is really going to help shore up their financial situation. And so that's what they're waiting for. If the governors declare delays in the elective surgery ramp, their financial situation deteriorates, just like ours does. And so that's the -- that uncertainty has to be sort of lifted. And even if they're not back to 100%, if they're back doing elective procedures and they have some line of sight to financial stability, then they'll be inclined to start to make those purchases because they do want to differentiate themselves. They do want to deliver great service to their customers. And so it's just the uncertainty around their financial stability and their liquidity, which is -- which they're waiting to resolve.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: Katherine, congratulations. I have two questions that are related. How do you think about the recovery in the procedures that have been postponed? Another management team thought that maybe 0% to 15% would come back in the back half of this year. Can you comment on that? And then big picture in your portfolio, which ones of your procedures come back first?\nKevin Lobo: I'm not sure I got the first part, Joanne, 0% to 15% of procedures...\nJoanne Wuensch: Those procedures that have been delayed. So if you had 100 procedures that have been delayed in the month of April or March, what percentage of them come back this year or next year or ever?\nKevin Lobo: I think in our -- in the procedures that we operate in, virtually all of these procedures come back. I mean these are -- osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition. These people are going to need these procedures. And so I would expect that they would come back, at least in hips and knees and spine. What we're seeing a little bit in the stroke area, which is kind of sad, is a lot of patients are afraid of going to the ER. And so we thought that, that would be largely protected, just like trauma cases. That's actually not true. And so they're not -- they're actually suffering with strokes at home. And so part of that is actually elective, which I would never have guessed. As they get more comfort and as the incident rates and death rates start or continue to decline, which they're doing in many locations, they'll start to get more comfortable going to the ER, and you'll see that volume resume. But to me, 0% to 15% seems like a historically low number. We would expect a lot more to come back. What I can't predict is how fast will they come back.\nJoanne Wuensch: I'm sorry, that 0% to 15% had to do with those coming back in 2020.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Again, I believe, to me, that seems awfully low. I mean, with the surgeon surveys that are surgeons in hospitals that I've spoken to, the patients that are on the waiting lists, they're not -- they don't want to leave the waiting list, they would like to get their procedures done. But the big wild card is just how deep is this recession and how -- if there are more layoffs, will those people get their procedures. Those are things I can't predict. But to me, that sounds low in my view. Again, I don't have a crystal ball. But that sounds awfully low to me. I don't know, Katherine, if you'd want to add anything?\nKatherine Owen: No, I agree, Kevin. It's -- I think we just have to wait and see how it plays out if this is a V or a U-shaped recovery. It has different implications. But I don't think we could give any more granularity or specificity.\nJoanne Wuensch: And then of your procedures, which ones come back first.\nKevin Lobo: Again, I can't really answer that because it really depends on the locations, the hospitals. Are they equipped. Can they have a separate facility that's separate from their coronavirus patients. If they can, they'll do whatever procedures they've got the equipment for in those ORs. So for us, I'm hearing a lot of pent-up demand certainly in the orthopaedic side. Those -- a lot of those physicians are not employed by hospitals. They might have an affiliation with the hospital, but they're not employed and they are eager -- I would say, very eager to get back to work. And they are very lucrative procedures for hospitals. So I do believe those procedures will come back fairly quickly.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman from BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: I just want to follow-up on Raj's earlier question, and it's really around pricing. MedSurg came in positive the first time, and I think 8 quarters on pricing. And it just seems that pricing is a little less pronounced right now. And is that a function of hospitals maybe taking their foot off the gas there? And kind of what are your expectations for pricing in the back half of the year, maybe when they have a little more time to focus on it? Could we see that increase a little bit?  And then the second one is a follow-up to that. And you didn't call out pricing in spine in the press release. I'm just curious if you could comment on some of the pricing dynamics there in that segment of the market.\nKevin Lobo: Sure. So first off, in terms of pricing and you think about our portfolio of businesses, generally, on the orthopaedic side, we have more pricing pressure than on the MedSurg side. And actually, even within MedSurg, if you look at some of our businesses that largely sometimes have positive pricing, medical, it would be one of those businesses.  So I would say that as you look at Q1 or you think about Q2, business mix is going to really influence where pricing is going to land. And if there's sort of less ortho and more MedSurg, I would say pricing would be a little muted. I do think, though, moving forward, the same controls and pricing, sort of procedures and functions that exist in the hospitals will always continue to exist. We have always felt pricing pressure and I don't expect that, that will let off at all. So I do think that it's not really a function of hospitals getting back to it for us. It's really going to be a function of sort of business mix within our sales line.  And then on the spine front, I don't have any real specific guidance on spine pricing. I mean, spine is probably within orthopaedics. One of the most sort of price sensitive product lines that we sell. There's loads of spine companies. I would say, if anything, maybe the current environment will drive out some of the spine competitors. And so with less competitors, maybe spine pricing will level out a little bit. But it's really uncertain at this point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: Just two quick questions. First is, just wanted to check in on development programs, particularly the Mako new indication development. Spine and extremity, I think you have talked about historically, you haven't provided time lines, but this crisis delay, any time lines, even though we don't know what they are at this point for one. And then second, just Kevin, being the Chairman of AdvaMed, any core initiatives the group is pursuing to support the med tech industry?\nKevin Lobo: Sure. On the first front, I would tell you, if you look at the R&D spend we had in the first quarter, it was very much in line with our normal spend. We are not taking our foot off the gas at all with respect to our R&D pipeline, and that includes Mako and future indications. We aren't going to get specific about time lines yet because we're not really ready to do so, and we'll keep you posted, but full speed ahead with all of our R&D.  As it relates to AdvaMed, yes, it's been a very busy time. I happen to be Chairman. This is my -- going to my second year of my 2-year term. And so we're on weekly calls with all of our CEOs within the industry. I would say the first big focus was ventilators, as you could probably imagine. And now the major focus is on testing because the diagnostic companies are also members of AdvaMed. And really just working with the administration and FEMA, in particular, to make sure that they have a clear supply signal and trying to get them to get the demand signal, so we can kind of have some kind of matching. And obviously, it's not our job to define the protocols for when do you do live virus testing and when is antibody testing appropriate and serology testing and what companies should do. But we're in active discussions, and I would say testing is it's moved away from ventilators.  And PPE is still a common topic that we're talking about, but much more of the focus right now has shifted to testing as governments around the world are trying to figure out and states are trying to figure out how to bring people back to work. So that's the big focus right now on testing. And it's really -- when you're part of that trade association, it really -- it makes you appreciate this industry. It's an amazing industry that does so much for people, especially in these kind of trying times. And I'm really proud of how the industry has stepped forward to really to help our customers.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS.\nXuyang Li: This is actually young Xuyang Li for Matt. Maybe just one question. I was wondering, when it comes to your hospital customer finances, do you have a view on maybe how many of them are a little bit distressed in this environment? And how can that disrupt the recovery curve?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I don't have insights into what hospitals may be distressed. I mean my guess is that, obviously, their cash flow of most hospitals is under stress just because they don't earn as much money treating COVID patients as they might during elected procedures.  I do think that between government grants, external financing, once hospitals can demonstrate positive cash flow again. And even our own programs with Flex finance, there's plenty of capital availability for hospitals. And so I think that moving forward, once things settle down and we see sort of a trajectory ahead, that a lot of those programs will kick in and allow hospitals to sort of reinstate capital buying programs.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Kyle Rose from Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: Great. So just wanted to talk just a little bit about maybe the commercial structure, it's -- particularly with the backdrop of some of the cost changes you've discussed. Are you seeing any big picture trends with respect to changing, I guess, the support level or the requirements for what the sales rep does on a case-by-case basis. And I guess, the secondary question that's coming out of that is we've seen the potential for rep-less models or maybe there's a virtual model in the operating room. What does that do from the cost structure of what the SG&A line looks from a long-term perspective.\nKevin Lobo: So look, at this point in time, we're not really seeing any change to the way our reps provide service and support our customers. I think what we're learning about virtual tools is they can be additive to our offense. The idea of completely replacing our sales reps, you know companies have tried this in the past, and it has met with pretty big failure. But I do think there is a role for technology. We are seeing a little bit of this in Japan. And so I think technology can be an additional tool in our arsenal, certainly for training. And even in terms of support that it could provide some benefits, potentially some benefits in SG&A. But I would say those are very modest at this time. It's very early. And I think as things resume, it's going to resume much more in the manner that we saw prior to coronavirus and then potentially you could see acceleration afterwards.  I think rehab, for sure, the patients are very comfortable going home and trying to do their rehab at home and using virtual tools. I think you're going to see a lot more of that. There has been some movement. That's increasing. I think the surgeon consultations that used to occur in surgeon offices, that's going to be a lot more virtual, that's happening now. And certainly, the payers are a lot more comfortable paying for that, which they weren't before. But as it relates to the nuts and bolts of our procedures in the operating room, I don't see any dramatic change at this time.\nKyle Rose: Just 1 follow-up on a pricing perspective. I appreciate the earlier commentary around spine. I just -- you talked a lot about physicians in hospitals coming under financial distress. Just -- are there any expectations for potentially some increased price pressure, specifically when you think about the recon side of the business?\nKevin Lobo: We haven't seen any sort of step change impetus for price change within implants. And this has been going on for some time. Certainly, our prices go down every year. They have moderated. There really isn't -- this is not a new impetus to drive significantly reduced pricing. And so I don't expect -- I think our price outlook will stay very similar moving forward.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: As I said in my opening remarks, I would like to once again thank the frontline health care professionals and first responders for everything that they have done and continue to do. I'm also proud of the efforts of our employees who are showing great resiliency in continuing to serve our customers in this difficult time. Thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q2 results with you in July.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Lobo",
            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. On today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Katherine with some perspectives on our mix of deferrable and capital businesses. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarter results and liquidity position before we open the call to Q&A.  As you know, Katherine will be shifting out of her role on June 1, so this will be her last Stryker earnings call. While this is not quite the finish she had in mind at the end of February, I did want to take a moment to express my gratitude for her outstanding work the past 13 years. She has been a great help to me and the management team of Stryker. Also if you include her time covering Stryker as a sell-side analyst, this will be her 97th Stryker earnings call. She has seen a lot, but nothing quite like what we are going through right now.  On today's call, we will review our first quarter results and provide additional details regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses in March and into the second quarter. I would also highlight many initiatives underway to ensure we maintain a strong cash position through stringent controls to manage through this unprecedented environment.  For Q1, we achieved organic sales growth of 2.4%, reflecting strong momentum through the first two months of the quarter and into March, followed by a marked slowdown tied principally to a deferral in elective procedures. We took a number of steps in March to aggressively limit travel to ensure the safety of our employees and customers, while ensuring our essential personnel were available to support health care workers around the world. These efforts, along with other cost controls, helped to mitigate some of the impact on earnings, from the slowdown in sales resulting in adjusted per share earnings of $1.84, a decline of 2% versus the prior year. The sales drop became more pronounced towards the end of March, and in the last week of the month, our company sales declined 30% versus the prior year. The biggest declines were in hips, knees, spine and endoscopy, offset by our other businesses. By geography, Japan, Canada, and smaller countries in Europe and emerging markets performed well, while China was clearly the weakest.  In Q2, we expect a recovery in China, but most other geographies will get worse, given the spread of the virus. For the month of April, our company sales will decline by 35% to 40% versus 2019. Looking at the remainder of the quarter, we are encouraged by the planned gradual resumption of elective surgeries in the U.S. and abroad. Portfolio products are being impacted by COVID-19 in numerous ways. Clearly, we are seeing a deferral in elective procedures, particularly within our orthopedics and spine businesses. We fully expect, given the chronic and progressive nature of the conditions impacting these patients, that the vast majority of them will be treated in the coming months, recognizing that the exact timing of a broad resumption of elective procedures is too fluid to predict. And as hospital needs to treat COVID-19 patients escalated sharply in March and into April, we saw a significant increase in the demand of products across our roughly $2 billion medical portfolio, which Katherine will discuss in more detail. In response, our manufacturing teams have been aggressively ramping capacity of much needed products while also ensuring we scale back other plants where demand has been negatively impacted.  Overall, given our mix of businesses and the cost control initiatives underway, coupled with our strong balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to manage through this slowdown. Given the fluid nature of the current situation, we are not providing Q2 or full year guidance. However, we expect to maintain the cost control efforts for most of 2020.  We are also setting ourselves up to respond quickly as customer demands return. We are providing financial assistance to hold our sales forces in place and continue to invest in our pipeline of new products. We are proceeding with integration efforts regarding Wright Medical. And given the impact of the virus on competitive hiring, we are expecting a minimal level of sales force attrition. As was publicly announced, Wright held its shareholder meeting on Friday, April 24, and the deal was approved. This reduced the tender of threshold from 95% to 80%. The tender offer was extended until June 30, which is customary as we continue to work through the closing conditions. We expect to close around the end of Q3 2020.  Please note, beyond this update, we have no new information to share with you regarding Wright Medical and we will not be taking any questions on this pending acquisition during today's call.  Before I turn the call over to Katherine, I would like to take a moment to thank all of our employees around the globe for their commitment to ensuring the safety of their colleagues, their families and our customers. Our sales forces across our businesses who are essential to supporting doctors and caregivers have demonstrated unwavering commitment during this pandemic.  Our manufacturing teams have worked tirelessly to optimize the plant network and to ramp capacity where needed. And we have created rapid innovations in response to the pandemic. We will continue to support our employees and our customers as they work to meet the needs of the many patients that will need treatment. While our many year growth momentum has been temporarily derailed, the Stryker spirit is alive and well and we remain poised to capitalize as the situation improves.  And now over to Katherine. So Bob, I'll take that, the first part, and then I'll pass it to Katherine. As it relates to large capital, I think Katherine provided you the breakdown of our large capital in her prepared remarks. The beds and stretchers are the ones experiencing kind of a spike in demand. And at this point, it's really too difficult to ascertain whether that's pull forward or whether that's just extra demand because there is this need to build stockpiles. There is this need to have beds -- certain number of beds and expansion of beds, primarily related to coronavirus, but it may not be something that's just pull forward, it may be additional demand.  As it relates to the other large capital communications, Mako and those other components, those -- that's going to start to slow down, as you probably would imagine. We're not seeing orders being canceled, but there is a bit of deferral going on. And that I would expect would continue to pick up in the future. And maybe I'll turn it to Katherine to talk about small capital. Well, thanks, Bob. As you can imagine, we've run a lot of scenarios, and I don't have a crystal ball, but certainly, that is a scenario that we think could very well happen. The pent-up demand is there. I think the recovery will probably come in waves. So you have a number of employees that are furloughed that would love to get their procedures done now while they have health care coverage, worried about what could happen in the future. That could be a first wave of resumption of procedures. And then you also have people who have taken time off and that may not be able to take time off later, so that could cause a slight dip and then a resumption again. But it really is going to relate to how the overall economy recovers and how the virus evolves in the future. But that certainly is a scenario that we believe could happen. But again, this is unchartered water. So we'll see. Well, David, I mean, obviously, this is uncharted waters, as I mentioned at the end of my answer to Bob's question. But what I would say is the hospitals are very motivated to do our procedures. If you think about orthopedics and spine procedures, they are moneymakers for hospitals. And the hospitals who are treating coronavirus patients now are bleeding in their P&LS. So there's a financial motivation. Also, patients certainly that are suffering would like to get those procedures done. So I'm not in some of the other spaces of other elective procedures, so it's hard for me to do a compare and contrast. But the hospital CEOs and the surgeons that I've spoken to are all absolutely gearing up to start bringing back their patients. And the surveys they've done with patients have suggested that patients are very comfortable coming back. As soon as the hospitals say it's going to be safe for them, I think those patients will be coming back. So I don't believe that there's something unique about orthopaedic surgery that would cause that to be pushed to the back of the line. On the contrary, given its economic impact to the hospitals, I think it could be moved earlier in the chain. Yes. Thanks for the question. I would say that those surgeons that are believers in Mako or believers in robotics will resume their normal amount of work. We had terrific momentum. You can even see if you look at the line of other Orthopaedics, it performed very well in the quarter. We did see a bit of a slowdown in some of the Mako orders being delayed a little bit. So liquidity of the hospitals is important when you're outlaying large amounts of money. But we see tremendous signs of continued interest. No order is being canceled, just being delayed a little bit until elective surgeries resumes. And yes, hospitals do see it as a differentiator, and we continue to be very bullish about the prospects of Mako.  Underscoring what Katherine said earlier about Flex Financial, I think that's something that we're going to use even more probably as ASCs want to acquire Makos, and they don't typically have the same size of capital budgets, but we have a number of different vehicles to help them finance their capital. And so we do expect to Mako to absolutely resume the kind of trajectory we're on once the elective surgery comes back in force. Yes. Sure. I can take the first part of that. Okay. Sorry, Katherine. I'll start that. So spine procedures are done in the ASCs, but they tend to be the more basic procedures like ACDS. So it's not an enormous part of the overall spine market, and we think we're well positioned there to be able to deliver the products need for those procedures. Sorry, Katherine, go ahead. Yes. The only thing I'd add to that comment is a lot of hospitals are actually gearing up to be able to work extra hours even on weekends. They won't do that day one. Obviously, they're going to gradually start to bring patients back, but that's something that they're planning for in the back half of the year. And so I do expect, as I mentioned before, seeing this recovery come back in waves is pretty likely. Yes, Larry. Yes, that did include our neurovascular business as well in that statistic. No, thanks. That's a big question. I would tell you that I think we're very well positioned given the diversity -- diversification of our portfolio. Obviously, elective surgeries are very important to us, but we're not only an elective surgery company. And the fact that MedSurg is the largest of our 3 segments certainly helps protect us and insulate us from the full effect. I think that diversification will serve us well, but -- and we believe still in our strategy. And this is not going to cause a change in our strategy of category leadership and leading positions in all the segments we choose to play in. It's not going to take us off our approach to M&A. We will emerge from this, and we believe the fact that we've stayed and conserved a fairly conservative balance sheet has really helped us. And even with the upcoming Wright Medical acquisition, we have a very good and strong financial position.  Things will change. There will be a lot less travel. I could tell you that we've learned a lot about technology. The way we're engaging with customers through this has been amazing for me to watch, surgeon engagement, hospital engagement. And even our employees, we tend to be a high-touch culture and we're learning that technologies, you can do a lot of really amazing education things with technology. So that, I think, will become a more permanent thing. And our R&D teams are learning how to work very, very effectively, including surgeon collaborations virtually.  So those are the things that will be more, I think, more permanent. The trend to ASCs will only accelerate. But as Katherine mentioned, a long way to go still. But that pace will increase. Those are probably the 2 things I would point out to. But other than that, I think we're just going to be getting back to the regular offense that we had before. Yes, sure. We had, as you probably heard, an earthquake in Salt Lake City, which is one of our manufacturing facilities for neurovascular. That caused a slight disruption in that business. And then we also had a bit of supply challenges with the Neuro Powered Instruments portfolio. And those, again, are temporary nature. This happens to us from time to time over the years. You hear this. In 1 quarter, we might have a slight disruption in supply. And so those are the two things that hit the Neurotechnology business, both of which are largely resolved or will be resolved certainly by the time we get to Q3, Q4. Yes. Thanks, Kaila. It's one of the things that literally we are meeting almost every other day on in terms of how do we need to position ourselves to ramp back up and getting a good feel for what products will be in demand and where are we from an inventory standpoint with those products. And also, how are we preparing for our employees to come back to work so that we can meet that demand. So I do feel like we are positioning ourselves very well, and we have a pretty good understanding of where we think demand will peak, and we're doing all we can to be ready for that to happen. Yes. And you mentioned Wright, we actually have the biggest M&A going on right now that we've ever had ever. So that's one thing that we obviously are focused on. I guess I would say that business development remains sort of an ongoing part of our long-term strategy. And obviously, we'll balance potential opportunities with our liquidity position and where we want to be even next year and the following year on liquidity. But I could see that we would get back to smaller tuck-in acquisitions. We have slowed it. We have paused it. We have not turned it off. We're keeping close to the market just to understand. But I think, in some ways, it will allow us to have more time over target and be smarter about where we are choosing to execute on M&A opportunities. Yes. I think the demand -- we're -- in some of our categories, we're selling everything we can make right now. So I would say we're a long way from having filled up any stockpiles. So I think if this coronavirus continues at an accelerated pace or if there's a second wave, I would expect a commensurate increase in the sales of those products, be it the flight protection, system and instruments or the majority of the medical portfolio. Yes. I think, Robbie, the single biggest thing we're going to feel in the coming quarters related to free cash flow is just going to be reduced earnings. And frankly, if there's less sale, there's less accounts receivable to collect. And so that will be the single biggest impact, I think, that we'll feel. We obviously -- with manufacturing slowed and certain manufacturing lines idled, we're mindful of not building inventories and where we do think that we might have to build inventories. We're very selective in terms of how we think that will come back. So I really think, given the uncertainties that we will be facing, we're making very prudent decisions relative to cash conservation. Yes. Thanks, Rick. What I would say is, certainly, China was the most negative in the first quarter. The 35% to 40% number I gave was a global number. So that's what April is finishing, but I don't have the exact number because, is it the last day? We haven't closed a month, but it will be in that 35% to 40% range.  What we saw in the first quarter, certainly, China was very negative. That is recovering. I think they're back to roughly 60% to 70% of where they normally were prior to the virus. And it's sort of gradually improving. So China is getting healthier. Japan, we had a terrific first quarter in Japan, and I think that will get marginally worse in the second quarter. But they've done a very good job of managing it. Same thing with South Korea. We had a very good first quarter, and we're not seeing South Korea slow down.  The big wildcard in the international market is Europe. And even Australia, to some degree, where Australia had initially said that they were going to cancel all elective surgeries for the entire quarter. And now 2 weeks later, 25% of the procedures are now back and being scheduled. So that's how fluid it is. Just in 2 weeks, they went from nothing for the whole quarter to back to 25%.  So all this to say, it's going to be difficult to predict what happens in the U.K., what's going to happen in Germany. And so Europe is the wildcard area. I think it's certainly going to be worse than it was in the first quarter. And how much worse, it's hard to say right now. I think for us, Europe was something in the 55% down range in April. And I think that's likely going to continue throughout this quarter. It should get better towards the end of the quarter. But again, it's hard to predict. Okay. Thanks, Rick. I'll start. Maybe Katherine can add to it. What I would say is there's nothing magical about our first quarter knee. It's the continuation of the trend of the last 4 years or 5 years where we've been consistently taking market share. I'm very proud of the work that our team has done on Mako as well as cementless. Both of which, as you saw over the last 2 or 3 years, have had steep increases in their adoption rates. And that continued in the first quarter.  I could tell you, at the end of February, we were feeling really, really good about our knee number. And then just like everybody else, there was a falloff that occurred about midway through March. The fact that it still ended the quarter in a positive territory for U.S. knees is pretty incredible. We're really pleased with that. And so again, it's just continued amazing momentum with Mako and with cementless, which are both huge portions of the knee sales that we have. And surgeons are very, very loyal to both Mako and to cementless based on the great outcomes they're getting with their patients. Yes, I'm very pleased with how our spine business is progressing. Certainly, in the international markets, you see very good numbers. We even posted pretty good numbers in the first quarter. That's a continuation of what we saw last year. In the U.S., we started to see the improvement really in the November, sort of December time frame. That was continuing into January and February, and a number of new products were launched in the first quarter. Unfortunately, that got derailed, just like everybody else's spine business, around the middle of March, and we're not immune from that. But I would say I feel as good as I felt about our spine business since the acquisition of K2M. Every day, we sort of continue to build momentum.  And even the Mobius business, which we acquired towards the end of last year, is seeing tremendous demand as some hospitals are actually using it to do x-rays of the chest for the coronavirus. So we're actually trying to ramp our capacity of Mobius, which is, as you know, a mobile CT scan and really the only one in the market that's mobile, and they're using it for coronavirus. So we're actually ramping that capacity. So overall, the outlook for the future for spine is positive, as positive as we felt kind of entering the year. Yes. We're actually pretty fortunate that we don't have any major launches upcoming that are contingent to clinical trials. It's always a timing issue. If you just look at where our neurovascular or our PMA products portfolios are in their life cycle, we really don't have anything major pending. I think 6 months is a good way to look at it. We do have some minor delays in approvals. So some products, just getting them approved. If you think about our aspiration products in neurovascular, getting them approved in Europe. They are approved in the U.S. and we had a limited launch in the first quarter, which is proving very successful, but those aren't yet approved in Europe. So Europe is just overwhelmed with UMDR and other product approval site. That's more probably in the 3-month time frame than 6-month. But what's affecting us, at least in the short term, is more around getting products approved outside of clinical trials, and there really isn't anything major that's holding us back from a clinical trial standpoint. Yes, thanks. Right now, the profit profile is very similar to what we see in the hospitals. Most ASCs are affiliated with hospitals. Hospitals have a partial ownership, of course, in the ASC. And they tend to buy the implants on the same price contract that we have for their hospitals. So for us, the profit profile is very similar to what we see in the hospital.  Keep in mind that the biggest savings that they have, they make more money in procedures in the ASC. The surgeon usually has a part ownership, so they're very motivated. But the EBITDA of ASCs is higher than hospital, and the big reason for the -- is the savings and the facility costs. That's really why they make more money in the procedure. They don't need to drive down our implant prices to be able to drive that higher degree of profitability.  Obviously, they're different kind of facilities. You have to make life easy for them in terms of buying. We've created an entire offense around the ASC that I'm really excited about. If you asked me 3 or 4, 5 years ago, I was kind of concerned about ASCs, not sure how it would be for Stryker's business. Now I'm actually believing that it's going to be a very good thing for us because we have the booms, the lights, the operating tables, the Makos, all the capital power tools, Neptune waste management, everything that they need for their surgery, we can help them, and we have the disposables and the implants. And wrapping that up in a financing solution gives us a really tremendous advantage as more and more procedures go to the ASCs. So really, as of this point, we haven't seen much in the way of severe price pressure. Yes. So far, we haven't really seen any change. As you know, today, many of our reps are in the hospitals, our trauma reps, our neurovascular reps. So today, and even if you think about revision surgery or oncology surgeon within joint replacement, our reps are in the operating room today, arm and arm with the medical staff doing those procedures. And so we've heard some -- there could be some testing required for our sales reps in some places. That's -- it's very, very early, making sure they have the right PPE, that they're equipped correctly to make sure that they're not transmitting the coronavirus. But other than that, we haven't heard, really, any discussion about a blocking access or limiting access. Again, it's pretty early. Hospitals are preparing their plans. But mostly what we've heard so far is PPE and are they trained. And do they know how to put the proper PPE on and potentially having some degree of testing. The same expectation that they would have for their own staff who would be attending those surgeries. Yes. I think they're temporary delays. I don't think they're indefinite. Look, there's a lot of uncertainty right now. They don't know if they're going to get a bolus of new patients for coronavirus. And the hospitals that are, let's say, New Jersey, New York, those that are at the epicenter or even Detroit, they lose a lot of money while their hospitals are not having elective surgery and while they're treating coronavirus patients. So obviously, the first $30 billion has been doled out to the hospitals. The next $30 billion is coming. The general allocation method didn't provide extra money to those patients, those hospitals that were treating coronavirus patients. $10 billion of the next $30 billion is going to be disproportionately pushed to those hospitals. So waiting to receive the money and seeing how much each hospital get is very important to their overall liquidity profile.  And then as they resume elective surgeries, as I mentioned earlier, that is really going to help shore up their financial situation. And so that's what they're waiting for. If the governors declare delays in the elective surgery ramp, their financial situation deteriorates, just like ours does. And so that's the -- that uncertainty has to be sort of lifted. And even if they're not back to 100%, if they're back doing elective procedures and they have some line of sight to financial stability, then they'll be inclined to start to make those purchases because they do want to differentiate themselves. They do want to deliver great service to their customers. And so it's just the uncertainty around their financial stability and their liquidity, which is -- which they're waiting to resolve. I'm not sure I got the first part, Joanne, 0% to 15% of procedures... I think in our -- in the procedures that we operate in, virtually all of these procedures come back. I mean these are -- osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition. These people are going to need these procedures. And so I would expect that they would come back, at least in hips and knees and spine. What we're seeing a little bit in the stroke area, which is kind of sad, is a lot of patients are afraid of going to the ER. And so we thought that, that would be largely protected, just like trauma cases. That's actually not true. And so they're not -- they're actually suffering with strokes at home. And so part of that is actually elective, which I would never have guessed. As they get more comfort and as the incident rates and death rates start or continue to decline, which they're doing in many locations, they'll start to get more comfortable going to the ER, and you'll see that volume resume. But to me, 0% to 15% seems like a historically low number. We would expect a lot more to come back. What I can't predict is how fast will they come back. Yes. Again, I believe, to me, that seems awfully low. I mean, with the surgeon surveys that are surgeons in hospitals that I've spoken to, the patients that are on the waiting lists, they're not -- they don't want to leave the waiting list, they would like to get their procedures done. But the big wild card is just how deep is this recession and how -- if there are more layoffs, will those people get their procedures. Those are things I can't predict. But to me, that sounds low in my view. Again, I don't have a crystal ball. But that sounds awfully low to me. I don't know, Katherine, if you'd want to add anything? Again, I can't really answer that because it really depends on the locations, the hospitals. Are they equipped. Can they have a separate facility that's separate from their coronavirus patients. If they can, they'll do whatever procedures they've got the equipment for in those ORs. So for us, I'm hearing a lot of pent-up demand certainly in the orthopaedic side. Those -- a lot of those physicians are not employed by hospitals. They might have an affiliation with the hospital, but they're not employed and they are eager -- I would say, very eager to get back to work. And they are very lucrative procedures for hospitals. So I do believe those procedures will come back fairly quickly. Sure. So first off, in terms of pricing and you think about our portfolio of businesses, generally, on the orthopaedic side, we have more pricing pressure than on the MedSurg side. And actually, even within MedSurg, if you look at some of our businesses that largely sometimes have positive pricing, medical, it would be one of those businesses.  So I would say that as you look at Q1 or you think about Q2, business mix is going to really influence where pricing is going to land. And if there's sort of less ortho and more MedSurg, I would say pricing would be a little muted. I do think, though, moving forward, the same controls and pricing, sort of procedures and functions that exist in the hospitals will always continue to exist. We have always felt pricing pressure and I don't expect that, that will let off at all. So I do think that it's not really a function of hospitals getting back to it for us. It's really going to be a function of sort of business mix within our sales line.  And then on the spine front, I don't have any real specific guidance on spine pricing. I mean, spine is probably within orthopaedics. One of the most sort of price sensitive product lines that we sell. There's loads of spine companies. I would say, if anything, maybe the current environment will drive out some of the spine competitors. And so with less competitors, maybe spine pricing will level out a little bit. But it's really uncertain at this point. Sure. On the first front, I would tell you, if you look at the R&D spend we had in the first quarter, it was very much in line with our normal spend. We are not taking our foot off the gas at all with respect to our R&D pipeline, and that includes Mako and future indications. We aren't going to get specific about time lines yet because we're not really ready to do so, and we'll keep you posted, but full speed ahead with all of our R&D.  As it relates to AdvaMed, yes, it's been a very busy time. I happen to be Chairman. This is my -- going to my second year of my 2-year term. And so we're on weekly calls with all of our CEOs within the industry. I would say the first big focus was ventilators, as you could probably imagine. And now the major focus is on testing because the diagnostic companies are also members of AdvaMed. And really just working with the administration and FEMA, in particular, to make sure that they have a clear supply signal and trying to get them to get the demand signal, so we can kind of have some kind of matching. And obviously, it's not our job to define the protocols for when do you do live virus testing and when is antibody testing appropriate and serology testing and what companies should do. But we're in active discussions, and I would say testing is it's moved away from ventilators.  And PPE is still a common topic that we're talking about, but much more of the focus right now has shifted to testing as governments around the world are trying to figure out and states are trying to figure out how to bring people back to work. So that's the big focus right now on testing. And it's really -- when you're part of that trade association, it really -- it makes you appreciate this industry. It's an amazing industry that does so much for people, especially in these kind of trying times. And I'm really proud of how the industry has stepped forward to really to help our customers. Yes. I don't have insights into what hospitals may be distressed. I mean my guess is that, obviously, their cash flow of most hospitals is under stress just because they don't earn as much money treating COVID patients as they might during elected procedures.  I do think that between government grants, external financing, once hospitals can demonstrate positive cash flow again. And even our own programs with Flex finance, there's plenty of capital availability for hospitals. And so I think that moving forward, once things settle down and we see sort of a trajectory ahead, that a lot of those programs will kick in and allow hospitals to sort of reinstate capital buying programs. So look, at this point in time, we're not really seeing any change to the way our reps provide service and support our customers. I think what we're learning about virtual tools is they can be additive to our offense. The idea of completely replacing our sales reps, you know companies have tried this in the past, and it has met with pretty big failure. But I do think there is a role for technology. We are seeing a little bit of this in Japan. And so I think technology can be an additional tool in our arsenal, certainly for training. And even in terms of support that it could provide some benefits, potentially some benefits in SG&A. But I would say those are very modest at this time. It's very early. And I think as things resume, it's going to resume much more in the manner that we saw prior to coronavirus and then potentially you could see acceleration afterwards.  I think rehab, for sure, the patients are very comfortable going home and trying to do their rehab at home and using virtual tools. I think you're going to see a lot more of that. There has been some movement. That's increasing. I think the surgeon consultations that used to occur in surgeon offices, that's going to be a lot more virtual, that's happening now. And certainly, the payers are a lot more comfortable paying for that, which they weren't before. But as it relates to the nuts and bolts of our procedures in the operating room, I don't see any dramatic change at this time. We haven't seen any sort of step change impetus for price change within implants. And this has been going on for some time. Certainly, our prices go down every year. They have moderated. There really isn't -- this is not a new impetus to drive significantly reduced pricing. And so I don't expect -- I think our price outlook will stay very similar moving forward. As I said in my opening remarks, I would like to once again thank the frontline health care professionals and first responders for everything that they have done and continue to do. I'm also proud of the efforts of our employees who are showing great resiliency in continuing to serve our customers in this difficult time. Thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q2 results with you in July."

            "name": "Katherine Owen",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My update today will focus on providing greater granularity around our mix of businesses that are particularly impacted by the COVID-19 virus. Overall, we estimate that 40% to 50% of our total global revenue include procedures that are considered elective, or more accurately, can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. This includes primarily our orthopedic businesses, including hips and knees, extremities as well as spine and Neurotech's ENT. There are also procedures within our endoscopy portfolio that can be deferred, including some of the scoping procedures and sports medicine.  Additionally, with many states and countries having implemented or recently come out of state-at-home orders, we have seen a slowdown in trauma. This can be attributed to fewer people out driving, a slowdown in construction and general decline in overall activity that traditionally drives trauma procedures. Unlike truly elective procedures, the patients deferring surgeries addressed by our products will not improve with time, rather, their underlying conditions generally continue to deteriorate. So while the exact timing of the resumption of elective procedures to more normalized level is difficult to predict at this point in time, we do anticipate the vast majority of patients treated by our products will return. We also assume the resumption of procedures will continue to vary by country, state and municipality as they increasingly move past the peak impact of the virus.  In contrast to the impact we are seeing from deferred surgeries, other parts of our portfolio are experiencing significantly heightened demand, as Kevin noted. This is most noteworthy for our medical business, which had sales of roughly $2.3 billion in 2019 or approximately 15% of total Stryker revenue and is comprised primarily of capital equipment. It's important to recognize that our capital equipment portfolio, which represented about 25% of our total sales in 2019, includes both large capital and small capital at about 9% and 16%, respectively.  Our large capital equipment offering includes Mako, beds and structures within medical, Endoscopy's communication portfolio and Spine's enabling technology, which includes Mobius and navigation. Turning to smaller capital equipment, this bucket includes medical emergency costs and defibrillators, Endoscopy's cameras, Instrument's power tools and waste management, and neuro-powered instruments that are reported within Neurotechnology. Of note, small capital is typically used in the OR and, as such, tracks more closely to growth in procedures.  Against that backdrop, we are seeing strong demand across essentially the entirety of the medical offering, including beds and stretchers, physio, emergency cost and Sage. We are also seeing meaningful increase in demand for Instruments flight personal protection offerings, which is included in their base product portfolio within surgical technologies.  Across the board, we have ramped capacity to meet the current demand and what we anticipate will be ongoing demand as hospitals look to better position their capacity and stockpiles going forward. In late March, we developed the Stryker emergency release bed, which helps emergency responders manage patients efficiently during this critical time. We started manufacturing this low-cost bed at the end of March, which broadens our medical offering beyond ICU and MedSurg beds to better meet customer needs. Other efforts to assist with responding to COVID-19 include the production of face shields for health care professionals and a new patient protective covering product, which attaches to our ambulant structures.  Overall, while the slowdown in elective procedures has and will continue to impact our top line, we are able to leverage our unique product portfolio and offset part of that impact through the demand for our medical and instrument offered. We expect this trend will continue into Q2 with an ongoing gradual increase in elective procedures.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Yes, Bob, first of all, thank you. It's -- I would say, if you look at small capital, that's about 16% of the total, and it does tend to track with surgeries. So that business has not benefited anywhere near to the same degree as the medical, particularly beds and stretchers have. So I think you're going to see that be more in line with our elective procedures come back on. And some of it is going to be tied to hospital liquidity. And keep in mind, through Flex Financial, we have a lot of ability here to help hospitals think about different constructs to finance those purchases.  So it's very different from the Great Recession in terms of how medical business is being impacted. But I do think there's going to be continued uncertainty around the pull forward because we just don't have a strong sense yet what the new norm is going to look like for stockpiling. Yes. I just would follow-up, David. Just keep in mind, the shift to recon procedures in the ASC setting is already underway. This probably continues us down that path, but there's only so much capacity. There are about 300 ASCs in the U.S. that are doing hip and knee procedures. They are essentially running at full capacity. Now they may be able to do more by staying later on working weekends. But that is really dwarfed by the number of hospitals in the U.S., which is about 5,000. So I think you're going to see the shift continue, but I wouldn't expect some massive climate change in the trend because the capacity just isn't there to absorb it. No, nothing additional. Just to say, it's probably low single digits, the percent of spine procedures that are done in the ASC setting at this time. I think it's going to be very gradual. We're seeing states, and not just in the U.S., overseas, they're moving slowly, and it really just depends where they are in meeting guidelines, where they are in peak cases. So we don't have a perfect formula to tell you what it's going to look like. It just seems to be pointing in the direction, and this is uncharted territory, but pointing in the direction that we're going to continue to see more and more states resume elective procedures. Those patients need to be treated.  As Kevin indicated, it's a profitable procedure for hospitals. And so I think it's just going to be gradual. So we're probably in a better position a month from now than we are today, but it's also very much a wait and see as hospitals get increasingly comfortable and start to recognize the new normal of how they deal with COVID patients while also recognizing they have to treat the broader spectrum of patients. Thanks, Pito. I don't have any definitive data because it really does vary. You have hospitals, even in New York, where we know they're gearing up to resume procedures, elective procedures, hip and knees, in particular, in May. And I think it's really going to depend on the type of hospital or teaching institution or where they're located geographically. So they may be doing more procedures over the weekends, more procedures in the evening. I think they're all going to be highly motivated. We do know that their waitlist of patients is pretty high. We are hearing that the patients -- I know there's some concerns, will they be willing to go back to hospitals, what we're hearing when we talk to customers, their waitlist remain healthy and patients are listening to their doctors. They listen to them when they said, don't have the surgery right now. And when they tell them it's safe to come back in and they realize they're not going to be going in to get their hip and need done through the emergency room, where their concerns are much greater, they're comfortable with it. But there's no perfect model to say this is how they're going to deal with it. I think there's going to be flexibility and a number of different methods that take place to address the backlog of these patients that need to be treated. No, I agree, Kevin. It's -- I think we just have to wait and see how it plays out if this is a V or a U-shaped recovery. It has different implications. But I don't think we could give any more granularity or specificity."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks, Katherine. Your comments are as insightful as always. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results, related drivers and certain liquidity matters. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.  Our organic sales growth was 2.4% in the quarter. These results included U.S. growth of 2% and international growth of 3.3%, recognizing that approximately 75% of total sales, our business is significantly weighted in the U.S. As a reminder, this quarter included 1 additional selling day as compared to Q1 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.4% from the prior year quarter, while foreign currency had an unfavorable 0.9% impact on sales. During the quarter, our growth was significantly negatively impacted by reductions in elective surgeries that occurred in the last 2 weeks of March. This impact was most pronounced on our joint replacement procedures. In light of the current environment, we wanted to provide additional detail with respect to our businesses and geographies. For the month of April, our U.S. Orthopedics and spine sales were down roughly 65%, while MedSurg and Neurotechnology posted declines of roughly 25%.  Asia Pacific declined roughly 20%, while Europe was down nearly 55%. Our Latin American business was solid, delivering 20% growth for the month of April. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.84 represents a decline of 2.1% from Q1 2019. Our first quarter EPS was negatively impacted by $0.02 from foreign currency, which was slightly higher than our previous expectations, given currency fluctuations. Certain other factors resulted in disproportionately negative impacts on EPS, including the loss of higher-margin sales and a loss of leverage related to manufacturing and operational fixed costs. In addition, the lack of share buybacks in Q1 2020 resulted in a higher-than-average share count outstanding.  I will now provide some brief comments on segment sales. Orthopaedics had constant currency and organic decline of 1.2%. This included U.S. growth of 0.3%. This growth included positive impacts from knees, trauma and extremities and Mako. Internationally, Orthopaedics had an organic decline of 4.3%, which primarily reflects an earlier downturn in certain geographies. MedSurg had constant currency growth of 7% and organic growth of 6.3%, which included a 5.6% increase in the U.S.  Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.8%, driven by gains in their surgical cutting blades, waste management, Steri-Shield, Surg account and smoke evacuation product lines. This performance was particularly impressive given the tough comps from Q1 2019 and further validates our decision to split the sales force into orthopaedic instruments and surgical technologies.  Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 2.9%. This reflects positive growth in its core video and general surgery products, offset by a slowdown in its communications and sports medicine businesses. The medical division had U.S. organic growth of 9.1%, reflecting strong demand across its bed and emergency care businesses, which accelerated meaningfully in the latter part of March, owing to demand tied to COVID-19.  Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 9.1%, reflecting a slower impact to capital businesses in key geographies. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 1.5% and an organic growth of 0.3%. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted constant currency growth of 0.2% and a 0.6% organic decline for the quarter. This reflects a slowdown in procedures in the latter half of March and some temporary supply disruptions during the quarter. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 9% and reflects balanced growth across most geographies and businesses.  Now I will discuss operating metrics for the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.3% was unfavorable 50 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by price, acquisitions, business mix and fixed cost absorption, the latter 2 of which were more pronounced during the second half of March.  Adjusted R&D spending was 6.4% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 34.8% of sales, which was 40 basis points unfavorable to the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year, SG&A was unfavorably impacted by business mix, deleveraging of selling and marketing costs and foreign exchange, and this was partially offset by operating expense savings actions taken during March.  In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24% of sales. Given the current environment, we enacted measures in March covering most of our discretionary spending. These included curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings, consultants as well as the idling of certain manufacturing lines and facilities, including furloughing the related workers. Subsequent to March, we also have enacted salary reductions impacting most of our leadership positions.  Related to other income and expense, we saw a benefit in investment income, which was partially offset by increased interest expense related to the eurobond offering that was completed late last year. Moving forward, though, given an unexpected decline in investment income earned on deposits and the impact of other rate changes, OI&E will increase by approximately $5 million to $8 million per quarter. This does not include the impact of any additional debt issuance for Wright Medical.  Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.3%. This included the benefit related to stock compensation expense and other discrete items.  Turning to cash flow and liquidity. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of $4 billion and generated approximately $591 million of cash from operations in the quarter. This is ahead of our internal targets and significantly more than in Q1 2019. This reflects increased earnings and a reduction in working capital, primarily driven by accounts receivable during the quarter. As I noted in January, we did not repurchase any shares in Q1, nor do we plan to do so during the remainder of the year.  In addition to the discretionary spending controls I previously outlined, we have also taken steps to conserve cash. Including reductions in planned capital expenditures and project spending, focusing on opportunities and accounts payable and slowing M&A activities. Considering our cash holdings and available credit lines, from a liquidity standpoint, we are well positioned. We currently have available credit lines, none of which are drawn on at this time of approximately $3 billion.  In addition, our investment-grade credit rating supports good access to the capital markets, and we would anticipate taking advantage of historically low rates to complete the funding for Wright Medical. In terms of future capital requirements, our quarterly dividend is approximately $215 million, and we have 1 $300 million bond maturity due in Q4. As it relates to guidance for Q2 and the full year, we reaffirm our previously announced decision to withdraw guidance, given the significance of uncertainties at this time.  We will continue to evaluate operating circumstances in the market environment for stability prior to reinstitution of guidance. And now, I will open up the call for Q&A. Yes, David, there's a couple of questions in that. I think the first one, the percentages that I gave you are absolutely up to date. And so I don't have any sort of further data or information that would support a bifurcation of that. In terms of looking at what's going to outpatient or what's inpatient, I think it's still too early and it's still dynamic, and it's evolving in the moment. So it's something that we obviously are watching very closely. And as soon as we have data or monitoring on it, we would provide that. But I'll let Katherine comment on that as well. Yes. At this point, just given sort of the fluidity of the situation and looking forward, I'm not sure that I can guide you to an exact sort of margin number. I will say that to the extent expenses are discretionary, what I've mentioned, travel meetings, consulting and many other things, we have curtailed those or discontinued those. We discontinued most of our hiring, and we furloughed manufacturing employees that are at facilities where we've slowed down or stopped certain lines. It's really difficult to sort of predict our exact operating state. I do think some of those expenses, obviously, will come back as we ramp back up. But at this point in time, as I think about our future cost structure, I do anticipate that many of these things will be impacted and we'll feel the impact from them throughout the remainder of this year and, frankly, on into 2021. Okay. Yes. I think why you -- you did a pretty good summary. But I guess what I would say is, as you look at the number, you're right, medical is showing fairly strong positive numbers. I would say, across the rest of the portfolio, it was negative and it ranged anywhere, negative from 20% to as much as maybe 40% or 50%, depending on the business. Capital is a little lumpy, too. So some of the capital businesses were able to deliver and make deliveries during the month of April. And so they saw a little more favorability. I do think that as we move into May, we'll continue to see some of those downturns in that similar trend that we saw in April. And it might be a little more pronounced as some of the capital businesses trail off. Okay. Sure. Yes. On the medical, I mean, let's leave it that it's positive. And that in the short term, we do sort of see that demand will still be heavy. Moving out, I think medical will be impacted, especially their beds and stretchers business. To the extent that, that's large capital and there could be liquidity issues with hospitals. On the gross margin question, you're absolutely right, the single biggest thing that will probably be a big impact in Q2 will be fixed cost absorption. And right now, we don't see that we would be capitalizing that in the balance sheet. We would only be able to capitalize to the extent we actually produce the inventory. And so you'll see that flow through the P&L, and that will be more significant and more pronounced than it certainly was in Q1."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter and our annual Mako update. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. As a reminder, as announced during our Analyst Day in November, we have reclassified our reporting segments into two groups: MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Orthopaedics and Spine. This better aligns to how our businesses are managed internally. We have also pulled out Neurovascular on its own line and have the business units of neurosurgical instruments, CMF and ENT now grouped under Neurocranial. As we have done all year, we will comment on our performance versus 2019 which we believe is a better basis for comparison. For the quarter, organic sales growth exceeded 6% versus 2019, driven by double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses but offset by softer sales of our Hips, Knees and Spine as COVID and hospital staffing challenges had a meaningful impact on elective procedures during the quarter. We posted double-digit organic growth in international compared to 2019 as our globalization efforts continue to bear fruit and where COVID impacts were generally less severe than in the U.S. While our more deferrable businesses were challenged, we saw excellent results from our Mako robotic technology, capital products across our metric portfolio and continued double-digit organic growth in Neurovascular which reached approximately $1.2 billion in sales for the year. Despite the unanticipated Omicron variant, we were able to achieve full year sales growth and adjusted EPS within our latest guidance ranges. Our full year organic growth exceeded 7% and reflects strong demand for our Mako and MedSurg capital equipment and strong double-digit sales growth within Neurovascular and Neurocranial. In addition, we are very pleased with the Wright Medical integration, particularly in the U.S. Our full year adjusted EPS grew 10% versus 2019 and we delivered free cash flow conversion of 85%. The EPS growth was a strong result given the inflationary pressures that grew in the quarter and the COVID impact on our implant procedures. We continued to invest in R&D at a healthy rate of 6.6% of sales for the year and our new product pipelines are poised for continued success. Our strong cash flow performance provided us with additional flexibility to execute on M&A opportunities in the quarter, including Thermedx, a small tuck-in within endoscopy and the recently announced agreement to acquire Vocera. Despite the impacts of the pandemic throughout the year, we were able to surpass $15 billion, $16 billion and $17 billion in revenue for the first time. And we remain confident in the outlook for our business as the pandemic recedes. We continue to execute on our key growth strategies, including the expansion of our ASC offense, continued product innovation and category leadership across our businesses. Turning to 2022; the volatility caused by COVID variants remains ongoing and is further impacted by hospital staffing challenges and supply chain disruptions. In spite of this, we expect to continue to deliver above-market sales growth. However, given the pressures on our supply chain within MedSurg, we do not expect to deliver our typical degree of earnings leverage. We continue to be disciplined with our spending. However, we will continue to fuel new products with healthy R&D spending and will maintain our focus on above-market growth while we work through these cost pressures. As noted in the press release, we are guiding to 6% to 8% full year organic sales growth and adjusted EPS of $9.60 to $10 per share. As I conclude my comments, I remain confident in our strategy, talent and culture. I would like to thank our teams for continuing to persevere in these challenging times. I will now turn the call over to Preston.\nPreston Wells: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the latest impacts of COVID-19 across certain products during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on Mako and recent acquisitions, including the continued integration of Wright Medical and the performance of our combined Trauma and Extremities business. During the quarter, hospital bed and operating room capacities were challenged because of the Delta variant early in the quarter and most recently by the Omicron variant which started to pressure elective procedural volumes in December. In addition, ongoing nursing staffing shortages disrupted hospital scheduling of procedural volumes. The delay in procedural volumes primarily impacted our implant-related businesses, including hips knees, spine and foot and ankle which can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. However, we know that most of these patients will eventually return to have those procedures completed as the impacts from COVID decline and procedural volumes return to more normal levels. Demand for our capital products was strong in the quarter, including double-digit orders and sales which created a strong order book for capital products. Despite the strong capital demand, there were some headwinds in the quarter that primarily impacted our Medical business, including installation delays caused by hospital staffing challenges and raw material shortages primarily related to electronics that created some supply disruptions. For the full year 2021 versus 2020, our global Mako installed base grew by 27% and we now have an installed base that is approaching 1,500 Mako robots. This continues to grow -- this growth continues to highlight the high demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology. The strong double-digit growth also underscores our ongoing success installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs and competitive accounts, as well as our focus on expanding into international markets. In the fourth quarter, we saw a meaningful increase in the percentage of robots installed into competitive accounts. Turning to U.S. knee procedures. In the fourth quarter, over 50% of our total knees were Mako knee procedures, a trend that continues to increase and demonstrates the outstanding utilization of the Mako install base. The shift towards cementless knees also continued. And in the fourth quarter, cementless knees made up 47% of our U.S. knee procedures. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, over 25% of our total hip procedures were Mako Hip procedures which similar to knees, continues to increase in utilization. Our recently launched Insignia Hip Stem will also be Mako-capable by the end of the first quarter. We expect to further our leadership position in orthopedic robotic-assisted surgery through the continued adoption of our Mako SmartRobotics platform on a global basis. Shifting to our Trauma and Extremities business. We are now over one year into the integration of Wright Medical which continues to progress well in all regions and across all functions, despite the headwinds from COVID. Including Wright Medical, the combined U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew high single digits in 2021 which exceeded our expectations. The full year growth in the United States was driven by strong growth in core trauma and double-digit growth in the upper extremities business which offset the COVID-related impact on foot and ankle. This strong result reflects excellent execution of the sales integration and the strength of the product portfolio. Finally, our dedicated divisional business development teams continued to identify and execute on meaningful acquisitions. As Kevin mentioned, we recently announced our agreement to acquire Vocera and enter the fast-growing digital care coordination and communications segment. We expect the Vocera acquisition to close by the end of the first quarter. During the fourth quarter, we also finalized the acquisition of Thermedx. Thermedx is an innovative developer and manufacturer of fluid management solutions and will allow our endoscopy business to improve surgical visualization across the women's health segment and advance the standard of care in the urology segment. We believe these and other acquisitions completed during the year will help us continue to drive above-market growth in the future. The overall environment remains uncertain as a result of the continuing COVID pandemic and we expect hospital staffing shortages, supply constraints and significant inflationary pressures caused by raw material shortages to persist throughout 2022. However, we believe that the underlying demand for our products remains strong and coupled with a robust order book for our capital products, gives us confidence in our ability to drive market-leading growth when the impacts of the pandemic subside. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Today's sales comments will be provided based on our new reporting structure. And as with previous quarters this year, all comments are in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 6.2% in the quarter. The fourth quarter included the same number of average selling days as Q4 2019 and Q4 2020. Compared to 2019, the two-year impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.7%. Versus Q4 2020, pricing was 0.8% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 0.5% impact on sales. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 4.7%, reflecting the impact of COVID on elective procedures, hospital staffing shortages and disruptions of general hospital operations. This was offset partially by strong demand for Mako and our MedSurg and Neurotechnology products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 10.6%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe, Canada and emerging markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 7.2%, with U.S. organic growth of 5.2% and international organic growth of 12.9%. 2021 had the same number of selling days as 2019 and one less selling day compared to 2020. Compared to 2019, the two-year price impact had an unfavorable 1.5% impact on sales. Versus full year 2020, pricing was 0.8% unfavorable. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.71 increased to 8.8% from 2019, reflecting sales growth and a lower quarterly effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix, increased adverse COVID-related pressure on sales, gross margin inflationary pressures and higher interest charges resulting from the Wright Medical acquisition. Our full year EPS of $9.09 which represents growth of 10% from full year 2019 reflects the favorable impacts of sales growth, operating expense discipline, Wright Medical, foreign currency and a lower effective tax rate partially offset by increased investments in R&D as well as higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and NeuroTech had constant currency sales growth of 11.8%, with organic sales growth of 11.6% which included 9.3% of U.S. organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.6%, led by strong growth in their Orthopaedics instruments and Surgical Technologies businesses, highlighted by growth in their power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield products. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 11%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including general surgery and fluorescence products and strong double-digit growth of their sports medicine and communications businesses. The Medical division had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.3%, reflecting solid performances in their Sage and bed businesses. During the quarter, we also saw significant growth in orders across the medical portfolio, driven by very strong demand. Assuming normalization of the customer environment and a reduction of certain supply constraints, we expect these orders to contribute to another strong year for Medical in 2022. Our U.S. Neurovascular business posted organic growth of 7.4% reflecting solid growth in their hemorrhagic and aspiration products. The U.S. Neurocranial business posted organic sales growth of 5.7% which included solid growth in our MAC space, ENT navigation and cryotherapy products, somewhat offset by continued COVID impacts. Internationally, MedSurg and NeuroTech had organic sales growth of 18.6%, reflecting double-digit growth in the Endoscopy, Medical, Neurovascular and Neurocranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe Canada, China and in the NeuroTech businesses in emerging markets. Orthopaedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 15.2% and an organic sales decline of 0.8% with an organic decline of 2% in the U.S. This reflects the impact of the slowdown in elective procedures during the quarter as a result of the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID. Our U.S. Knee business grew 0.1% organically. As a reminder, during the fourth quarter of 2019, our U.S. Knee business had very strong growth of approximately 10.5%. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 6.7% on a comparable basis with strong growth in our plating products combined with double-digit growth in our upper extremities business. Spine declined 6.6% organically in the U.S., primarily resulting from COVID disruptions to their business. Other Orthopaedics grew 21.5% organically in the U.S., primarily reflecting continued strong demand for our Mako robotic platform which had growth in the U.S. of 43.5%. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 1.9% organically which reflects the strong momentum of Mako in Japan, Korea and emerging markets, somewhat offset by the impact of volume-based pricing in China, primarily related to our Trauson business. For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business which includes Wright Medical, delivered 4.1% constant currency growth on a comparable basis. The Wright Medical acquisition anniversaried in November 2021 and will be part of our organic sales throughout 2022. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin was 65.8%, was unfavorable approximately 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. Compared to the fourth quarter in 2019, gross margin was adversely impacted by business mix; operational inefficiencies due to COVID, including employee absenteeism; and raw material inflation, primarily related to electronic components, steel and transportation costs. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout 2022 with a more pronounced impact in the first half of 2022. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.4% of sales which represents an 80 basis points increase versus the fourth quarter of 2019 and reflects our continued commitment to innovation funding and the related growth that we'll provide. Our adjusted SG&A was 32.1% of sales which was a 20 basis point improvement as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by the ramping of certain expenses and hiring to support future growth and the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 27.3% of sales which is 100 basis points unfavorable to the fourth quarter of 2019. This performance primarily resulted from adverse business mix, gross margin challenges, investments in R&D and the dilutive impact of acquisitions, primarily Wright Medical. Other income and expense increased as compared to fourth quarter in 2019, primarily resulting from the interest expense increases related to our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.2%. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate is 14.9% which was partially impacted favorably by onetime items during the year. For 2022, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.5 billion. For the year, we paid down $1.2 billion of debt. Turning to cash flow; our full year cash from operations was approximately $3.3 billion. This strong performance reflects the results of net earnings and continued focus on working capital management. For 2022, we anticipate that capital spending will be approximately $650 million. Again, in 2022, we do not plan to do any share buybacks given our anticipated focus on further debt reduction. And now I will provide you 2022 full year guidance. As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that there will be continued volatility caused by ongoing COVID-related impacts, hospital staffing challenges and increasing supply chain disruptions as well as significant inflationary risks. Given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 8% for the full year 2022 when compared to 2021. There are the same number of selling days in 2022 compared to 2021. Consistent with the pricing environment we experienced in previous years, we would expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be modestly unfavorably impacted as compared to 2021 and this is included in our guidance. Despite the top line and operational risks of COVID, we have good momentum in many parts of our business heading into 2022, including the continued demand for our Mako technology, a very robust order book for our capital products, continued execution of our combined T&E business and many, many product innovations. For the full year 2022, we do not expect to deliver our typical operating margin expansion as a result of the ongoing price escalation on supply-constrained raw materials like electronic components and rising inflationary costs on raw materials transportation and labor costs. As a result of the latest COVID wave and the current inflationary environment, we expect gross margin performance to be negatively impacted by 50 to 100 basis points with a more pronounced impact in the first half of the year. As we said during our analyst call in November, we plan to return to our normal delivery of margin expansion once we reach a post-COVID environment. Finally, for 2022, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.60 to $10 for the full year. This wider guidance range represents the ongoing variability in the operating environment. The upper end of our guidance range assumes the latest COVID wave subsides in Q1, with no additional major COVID disruptions during the year. In addition, it assumes that the supply chain stabilizes by the end of the first half of the year. The low end of the guidance range assumes the continued COVID-related volatility persists, including supply chain pressures that could impact revenues as well as costs and includes more transient spot buying and longer-term supply chain pressures. We will continue to evaluate the changing environment and we'll provide updates to our guidance as necessary. And now I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robbie, your line is open.\nRobert Marcus: Thank you. And thanks for taking the question. Maybe we could start just following up on guidance. I think investors really -- I'd love to get a sense of cadence through the year. How are you thinking about maybe first quarter or first half relative to second half both on top and bottom line, so we can calibrate correctly.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure. Yes, Robbie, I think right now -- and obviously, you kind of see it because of the wide range of guidance we've provided, both sort of top and bottom. But our thinking is, is that the real pronounced impact that we'll have on top line and on gross margin will be in the first half of the year. We'll really feel the impacts related to that very pronounced in first quarter and lesser so in second quarter. And then we feel like things will start to stabilize by the time we get to third quarter and fourth quarter. But we do see real cost pressures, especially around our electronic components which go in many, many of our products, especially on the MedSurg side of the business. And the buying of those products is many times in a spot market where it's an auction process and we're paying significantly higher prices than what we normally would pay related to those.\nRobert Marcus: Got it. Maybe I could just tag on to that. As we think about first quarter here, we've heard other companies more muted kind of flattish or low single-digit growth with the cadence improving over the back part of the year. Is that a reasonable assumption? And then I'll jump back in queue.\nPreston Wells: Yes. I mean, Robbie, we're not obviously guiding for the quarter. But certainly, as we think about the fourth quarter and how the fourth quarter ended with regards to the COVID variants continuing into January. So I think you can certainly think about it that way that there are some of those pressures from a top line standpoint that are certainly continuing at the beginning of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Joanne, your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you and good evening. Two questions; the first one has to do with U.S. Mako robotic placements. If I heard that correctly, that's a big number. Should we interpret that as just general demand or maybe demand ahead of expectations for increasing procedures?\nPreston Wells: No. I think, Joanne, if the Mako numbers you're referring to are how we're continuing to utilize Mako as it becomes a bigger and bigger portion of our total knee business, I mean this is just a continuation as we think about what we've talked about over the last few years. So again, we expect this to just continue to grow as we think about the utilization both on knees and what we're now seeing on hips as well and then also as we think about cementless in the knee world. So we would expect that just to continue to go as we continue to place and install Mako's in different areas.\nJoanne Wuensch: All right. And then it sounds also, if I'm hearing correctly, that this may be a year where you just sort of plow through and continue to invest, even if it's a little bit rocky. Is that the right way to think about things?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, Joanne, this is Kevin. That's exactly the right way to think about it. We have terrific product pipelines. We have a lot of new products we're launching this year, including a new power cot, the Insignia Hip Stem, a number of foot and ankle launches, three launches in the upper extremities space. We have the in-space balloon. So a lot of new products but we're also gearing up for 2023, where we're planning to have a next-gen camera, a next-generation power tool, next-generation life pack. And as you know, these new products are really the lifeblood of our top line growth. So we are not going to slow down on the R&D investments. Of course, we'll look at the rest of our SG&A and be cautious just like you've seen us be cautious over the last two years. But yes, we are going to power through. But we do have a lot of tailwinds. We have a very strong order book and capital equipment. We're having a little trouble securing all the components to be able to ship all the products but we have a healthy order book. We have good momentum. And obviously, we need to ride out the COVID challenges. But yes, we are going to continue to invest for the future.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you. Have a great night.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the question. One for Glenn on margins and one on Hips and Knees. So on margins, Glenn, just to clarify the negative 50 to 100 basis points of gross margin impact. Is that the gross impact from inflation hitting the P&L? Or is that the impact you expect the year-over-year change in the gross margin in '22 versus '21? And why are you confident the inflation will abate in the second half of the year and it won't linger? And I have one follow-up.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Larry, honestly, that's the year-over-year impact to gross margins, not the isolated necessarily inflationary impact. That would include impacts from pricing pressures as well. Confidence that it will abate, I don't necessarily think that I have confidence it will abate. I think it will moderate is what will happen. I mean a lot of this pricing pressure is based on commodity pricing which is highly driven by supply and demand. I do believe that supply will catch up. We are securing bulk purchases of demand. So I think that will help us even out our utilization of it as well. And so I do think by the back half of the year, we'll start to see moderation of those costs.\nLawrence Biegelsen: That's helpful. And Kevin, typically, Knees are more deferrable than Hips. This time, your Knee growth was much better than your Hip growth. That's -- I guess that's unusual. I don't know, I'm not looking at all the historicals but usually, we think about Hips being more -- less deferrable. So why do you think Knee growth was so much better than Hip growth this quarter for you guys? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: For us, Knees has been really the engine of growth within our joint replacement business, if you look over the last two, three years. The combination of Mako and cementless is just so powerful that we've had a disproportionate growth in Knees relative to the market. In Hips, we have a gap with that hip stem which really -- the new stem that we -- we're just in early launch right now, the full launch will be at Academy, a bit at the end of the first quarter. That's really going to solve a gap in the direct anterior procedure. So I do expect that our Hip business will pick up. You're right that technically it's a little less deferrable but the mix, it's really the product portfolio that we have now which has favored Knees. It's not new in this quarter. It's been going on for the last couple of years. And we do expect our Knee business to continue to thrive. And we're excited about the new hip stem, especially when it becomes compatible with Mako at the end of the first quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Matt, your line is open.\nMatt Miksic: Hi, good evening. Thanks so much for taking our questions. So I had one for Glenn on sort of the margin trends and thoughts about sort of earnings growth over the -- this year and intermediate and then a follow-up for, maybe, Kevin, on ASCs. So Glenn, this year, just a couple of questions. You've talked about -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks, these issues of inflationary pressure hoping, I guess, by the end of the year that some of this is going to -- you're going to be able to manage through them a little bit better. But taking that in the context of your longer-term outlook that you've given at your Analyst Day, could you talk a little bit about sort of, I guess, reconciling this near-term outlook and expectations for earnings growth given the current environment versus what you had described over longer term which was sort of an open-ended long-term average EPS growth that obviously contemplates a different environment next year and the year after than we're facing at this moment. And then as I mentioned, just one follow-up for Kevin or -- on ASCs, if I could.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Okay. Yes, Matt, I think, first of all, at the Analyst Day, the guidance that we laid out was our long-term financial guidance. That guidance was specifically once we exit this kind of COVID environment which clearly in 2022, we are not in a position that we're exiting the COVID environment. Right now, just based on foundationally what is underlying those long-term financial plans in terms of what we have lined up for growth, how do we think about M&A, how do we think about our product portfolio and new innovation, I see no reason why we would change our thoughts around that long-term growth. Now if you work your way down through the income statement and say, okay, how are you going to finagle your EPS to get to that growth challenge number. I actually think in this year's growth number, if you look at the high end of our EPS, we're not far away from what we're asserting is our long-term challenge. I do think that once COVID abates, we will get right back on our cost improvement initiatives, especially around direct purchasing. I don't see that changing at all. Throughout COVID, we have kept up pace in our CTG initiative still, just in terms of focusing on shared service opportunities, looking at indirect purchasing opportunities. And so all those foundational elements are still in place. And I do have all the confidence to think that once we exit COVID that we'll get right back into that cadence of delivering that.\nMatt Miksic: That's helpful. And then just on ASCs, also kind of a big part of the presentation at your Analyst Meeting and came up again today, I think, in your performance commentary for Q4. Would be great to get your perspective maybe on as we think about Orthopaedics and large joints in particular, moving into that channel over time, as folks have been talking about for a while, if you could give us any sense of what -- if and when you'll be able to give us some sense of your percentage of your businesses there, how the growth there differ, say, from growth in your sort of traditional larger centers. Is there any kind of color over and above what you gave just now on Q4? Would be super helpful.\nPreston Wells: Matt, it's Preston. So as we've talked about in the past, we talked about our Knees, in particular, being about 5% to 10% of our business being in the ASC. And as we've seen that continue to grow, as we came through the fourth quarter, we're seeing numbers that are actually reaching closer to that 10% number. So, we are seeing that shift happen. I mean it certainly is happening when we think about where patients are wanting to get procedures done. Certainly, as we think about our focus from our offense standpoint, as we think about the ASC, we are seeing the shift happen across our product line. So certainly, we expect that to continue to go. We've talked about that there is an opportunity for that to continue to grow over time. Certainly, there are capacity constraints as ASCs are built out that will allow that continue to grow faster. But that's a shift that was already started and we don't see that slowing down anytime soon.\nKevin Lobo: And I'd just like to add that outside of large joints, we also have our sports medicine business. That's within endoscopy. It grew 30% in the fourth quarter. So that's a great sign of the overall success that Stryker is having in ASCs, that really terrific growth in our sports medicine business.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Pito, please go ahead.\nPito Chickering: Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. As hospitals are filling with the labor pressures in 2022, it could impact hospital cash flows. So are you seeing hospitals take a pause with capital purchases until they understand how the cash flows will be impacted by these labor costs? I understand that the order book is quite strong. Just thinking about how you're going to refresh the order book.\nPreston Wells: Yes, Pito. No, we are not seeing that at all. I mean what we've continued to see throughout the pandemic and while some of it early on was aided by some of the CARES funding and things of that nature, we are seeing strong balance sheets and we're seeing the continued need for capital products. Certainly, as we think about the capital products that we supply that are either lending towards revenue generating for the hospital, or towards safety and outcome for the hospital. So we're definitely seeing a continued strength in terms of the capital demand, especially for our products. I mean our order book, as we'd said, is really strong heading into the year and there's a lot of confidence given some of the products that Kevin even outlined earlier that that's going to continue throughout the year.\nPito Chickering: Okay, great. And then a follow-up questions. If gross margins are going to be impacted by 75 basis points at the midpoint, is it fair to think about some 40 basis points or so of SG&A leverage during the year in R&D flat? I just want to get a feeling for G&A versus the gross margins.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure. As you think about operating expenses and I think Kevin emphasized this, we've protected R&D through this entire period. We just -- we know that's the lifeblood. We know we have to spend there. And so we have not backed away from funding those innovation initiatives from a people standpoint or a technology standpoint. And that's important and we won't change there. On the SG&A front, we've been a little more prudent. I think you've seen us be smart about our spending, be smart about, obviously, we're not traveling a lot, so we're not feeling that. I think as 2022 unfolds, though, I mean, a couple of things. Obviously, we'll continue to be prudent about hiring and bringing in costs but we will start to see those costs that relate to growth especially as it relates to interactions with customers, hiring sales forces, expanding territories, those types of costs will expand specifically in selling. Now that being said, we will continue to pressure G&A, corporate type spending and things like that to try to offset some of that. But that's kind of how those operating expenses will look throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Frank Pinal from Jefferies. Frank, please go ahead.\nFrank Pinal: Hi guys, thank you for taking the question. Just two quick ones for me on Mako, clearly, a strong quarter. You're now at 1,500 installs market lead. I'm just wondering at this point, Mako's been on the market for 7 years. And given the level of success and I think you're sort of seeing above 50% Mako procedures on Knees, above 25% on Hips. Where does that go? Does that go to 80% on Knees? Does that go to 50% on Hips over the next 5 years? And has your thinking on that opportunity at all changed U.S./OUS.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, this is really great to see; the growth in robotics. It's obviously creating a new standard of care. It's becoming expected. Residents are expecting this as they enter the workforce in orthopedics. And so we see the growth absolutely continuing. It's going to continue along the path that's been going on. I think we're going to see Hips potentially hit an inflection point with our -- with the launch of our new stem and start to really accelerate. So, we're very excited about the future. We think robotics is here to stay as you've seen this happen in many other industries. And so we do expect that the growth will continue. In the fourth quarter, we had an unusually high level of installs and competitive accounts, higher than normal. And we think that the fact that there are other entrants on the market is actually bringing more trialing of our systems and creating even more interest in Mako than there had been previously. So it's a tailwind for the industry and we're going to continue to ride that tailwind. And then as it relates to international, I would say we're still -- yes, thank you. I'll just continue on international. I would say we're still in the earlier phase of that as you've seen with other robotic technologies. It starts off here and then sort of expands around the world. We're still in early phases in Japan and in China and in Latin America but the growth is really starting to pick up there. The interest level is very high. And so I'm very bullish but it's going to take longer. It's a little slower the pathway there but it's just as exciting in the international markets.\nFrank Pinal: Great. And just a quick follow-up. I'm just wondering if you have any updates on the spine or shoulder opportunity in robotics and if you put any sort of brackets around that with respect to timing or milestones at this point?\nPreston Wells: Frank, it's Preston. So at this point, as we said before, with regards to both of those different platforms that we certainly have active projects that are working on them. They are key priorities for our development teams. But at this point, we still do not have a time line that we are sharing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Mike, please go ahead.\nDavid Saxon: Hi, good afternoon. This is David Saxon on for Mike. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is just on Spine. Just wondering if you have any sense of if you've gained or lost share in the quarter. And then looking at 2022, do you think you can grow off that 2019 base? And then, I'll just ask my second question upfront. On the Foot & Ankle market, I think you've called out some weakness there. Just wondering if that's just a weak market or if you're seeing anything on the competitive front?\nPreston Wells: Yes. So let me address your Spine question first. I think as we've said in general throughout the pandemic, it's just very hard to get a read on how share changes are happening given some of the COVID impacts and how they impact different things regionally also just in terms of where we are in the reporting cycle. It's very early. Certainly, with Spine, just like we saw with Hips and Knees, it was impacted from a COVID perspective throughout the quarter early on as we try to recover from Delta and then with Omicron coming in later on in the back part of the quarter. So not easy to say where everybody is going to shake out from that standpoint. But certainly, outside of COVID, outside of the staffing issues that we talked about as well, we are pleased in general with our product portfolio, including enabling technologies that we have in the Spine area. As we come back from COVID and as COVID abates, we would expect the growth to uptick in that area. And certainly, as we do with all of our businesses, expect to see growth on that business as we talk about year-over-year. With regards to Foot & Ankle. Foot & Ankle, the market is still a very strong market. It's one that we're very happy about to be in. But unlike other products within the trauma or even upper extremities, Foot & Ankle was much more impacted from a COVID perspective during the quarter. And we've seen that throughout the year. But certainly, as COVID abates in that area as well, we would expect growth to really drive there. And Kevin mentioned, we have several product launches that are going to be happening in that space as well that we're very happy about. So we definitely look for growth, certainly, as COVID is starting to abate a bit to really see the growth take off in that area.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Just to put a fine point on the Foot & Ankle. So it's really the forefoot procedures that are a little bit more elective and that's where a number of our launches will happen. The Total Ankle Replacement was actually terrific in 2021, really great growth and we're going to continue to have very strong growth in Total Ankle Replacement. It's really getting the forefoot procedures to come back to the office. And as that grows, we will continue to grow. And a lot of our launches are MIS products, specifically for forefoot.\nDavid Saxon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim Securities. Chris, your line is open.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. One question, high level for you, Kevin and one specific one on Neurovascular. So given how entrenched you guys are in the hospital, I'm curious that you're thinking about the staffing challenges that we're hearing about around the health care complex. You shared some assumptions around when COVID and supply chain issues might ease. When do you think we might put the staffing piece behind us?\nPreston Wells: Yes. So just in terms of staffing, this is Preston. Just similar to some of these other headwinds that we talked about, the staffing challenge is a real one that certainly it seems to be much more pronounced in periods of high COVID infection rates. Obviously, as those nurses are either doing other things or in fact, impacted themselves from a COVID standpoint. So we certainly do expect the staffing challenge to remain throughout the rest of this year. But we are seeing hospitals try to find ways to deal with it, whether it's looking at traveling nurses or adjusting wages or even adjusting how they're scheduling to get through that. So while it will be a bit of a headwind, we certainly think that it's something that we will be able to work through. And as procedures return, we certainly expect to get the procedural volumes back to the levels that we would want them to be.\nChris Pasquale: Okay. So you don't see that as an impediment to a bounce back in activity once COVID recedes?\nPreston Wells: No.\nChris Pasquale: Okay. And then just quickly on Neurovascular. There's a competitor recall in the flow diverter segment during 3Q. Just curious how much you think that benefited you and if you've been able to take advantage of that to get into some new accounts?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, our flow diverting stent business has been really a strength for us and it's not really so much related to competitive activities, just getting surgeons trained on the product. As you know, the Evolve stent is newer in many of the markets. It's a newer launch and we still haven't launched it in all countries around the world but we're pretty excited about the product and it's been growing at a pretty healthy rate. And there was no -- I would say, no change or no inflection point related to competitive activity.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Matthew, the floor is yours.\nMatthew O'Brien: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just bigger picture question for starters is you kind of said at the Analyst Day, you're about an 8% top line grower, you're guiding now 6% to 8%, so 7% in the midpoint, 100 basis points, $170 million roughly. I'm just wondering this year, if that's really all just conservatism around the impact of COVID or if there's just some supply issues that are going to cause you to just have to back order a bunch of products and that's why you're taking it kind of down about 100 basis points versus where I think we had all kind of expected the top line guidance for the year? And then I do have one follow-up.\nPreston Wells: Yes. So Matt, I think as we look at 2022 and as we enter the year, similar to what we've seen in 2021, I mean, there still continues to be a lot of variability with just COVID. And so if we think about how we've entered this year with COVID being pretty high in some places and while this variant seems to happen very fast and it seems to be peaking in some areas which is encouraging, what we can't predict is where the next wave is and what might happen from a next wave standpoint. So there's a lot of variability just as we think about COVID and then we add on top of that some of the challenges and the headwinds from a supply chain perspective. And it's not to say that there's a big bolus of supply chain issues that we have. But just in general, if we think about electronics and components and some of the challenges just with supply across all industries, that's certainly something that's out there in front of us as well. So there's just a lot of variability as we think about this year in terms of some of those top line aspects that is one of the reasons why we have that wider spread and maybe a little bit lower than what some others were expecting. That being said, as Kevin outlined, there are some really, really good tailwinds that we do have as we think about entering this year, whether it be our Mako installation base and how that's going to portray into future sales there. Also the new product launches that he's outlined. Of course, we have the Vocera deal that we're hoping to close this quarter as well. So there's a lot of positive momentum that we have across our businesses that we're going to take into this year and so we're really pleased with that. But just balancing that with some of those headwinds that I outlined as well.\nMatthew O'Brien: Okay. But you are assuming another wave then, Preston, just to be clear on that, in the guidance?\nPreston Wells: Yes. As Glenn outlined in the guidance that he went through, we do have some of that assumed in that spread that we have.\nMatthew O'Brien: Okay. And then as a follow-up, Kevin, the commentary about taking competitive share or placing more Mako accounts into competitive customers really caught my attention. And what I'm wondering is if there was just a bunch of trialing that went on in Q2, Q3, you just had a massive Q4 quarter in terms of system placements and sales. Are those -- is it primarily in accounts that have a competitive robot or are launching one right now where you saw a majority of those incremental system placements here in Q4?\nKevin Lobo: I don't really get into that level of detail. What I'd just say is the mix -- we used to report the mix as roughly 50% to 60% in competitive accounts. It was well north of that in the fourth quarter. Now I don't know if it's just a one quarter issue or whether that will continue. There were a lot of accounts that were kind of waiting for other offerings to appear on the market. And once those offerings appear, then they would have trials. And in most cases, it was -- in some cases, I know it was the first robot. In other cases, it may have been the second or the third robot in those accounts. I don't have exactly that level of information. But it was higher than we've seen in the past. I can't say I was expecting it. It was higher than I expected. But I am expecting Mako to continue to grow and that's not new. It's just the mix was more competitive than we've seen previously. Now, we'll see if that continues going forward. But the order book for Mako as well as for the MedSurg capital is strong at the end of the year; so that tells us that momentum will continue into 2022.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Steven, please go ahead.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. I think I -- just one on the supply disruptions, particularly around electronics; I apologize if I missed this. But is the impact really on Medical solely or does it potentially have an impact on your ability in other areas, particularly to keep up with demand in Mako?\nPreston Wells: So the impact is primarily impacting our Medical business but there are some smaller impacts that we're seeing on some of the other MedSurg-related businesses. As we think about Mako, as we entered into 2022 and the expected demand that we have for Mako, we feel comfortable where we are in terms of supply and any impacts on Mako are minimized at this point.\nSteven Lichtman: Okay. And then you guys mentioned, I think, versus 2019, international performance was better than U.S. on an organic basis. As you look into '22 in your guidance, do you assume constant currency growth for international which will continue to be ahead of the U.S. or is it more balanced? How are you thinking overall about your international business versus U.S. as you look into the theater?\nPreston Wells: Yes. Well, we don't provide guidance at that level. We don't expect the momentum that we've generated throughout this year to slow down as we think about our international business. And quite frankly, as Kevin has pointed out in the past, this is something that we've been building towards as we think about our focus on international markets. And so there's no reason to believe that, that will slow down.\nSteven Lichtman: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Matt, please go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thank you for taking the questions guys. Just had two quick ones. One is on the supply chain assumptions, I didn't detect in your comments that you were saying supply chain specifically was impacting revenue. Is it all a cost impact? Or is there actually some product that you're not able to get out because you can't get componentry and the like?\nPreston Wells: Yes. So I think it's a bit of a mixed bag. So there certainly are inflationary pressures that we're feeling as a result of the supply chain and just constraints on certain materials like electronics. But that is also, in some cases, leading to some delays in terms of getting some products out. So we do have a bit of a mix as we think about supply and certainly, the procurement team, the direct procurement team is working on actively securing as much as possible. But as Glenn mentioned, sometimes what that means is going outside of our contracts into spot buys and that's what's generating some of the larger inflationary impacts as we think about the guidance that we gave. Obviously, our goal is to protect our customer needs as best as possible as we go through this but there certainly is an impact on both the top and the inflationary pieces that Glenn outlined as well.\nMatt Taylor: Okay, that makes sense. That's helpful. And then just one other follow-up. So it's encouraging to see the strong capital trends, especially in Mako. I guess I was wondering if you are seeing any places where capital purchasing has been weak. And I'm thinking especially beds, I think some investors are concerned that maybe beds were pulled forward because of the pandemic. So I would love any comments on that pluses and minuses in capital spending that you're seeing?\nKevin Lobo: Actually, our capital order book is strong across the board. And in particular, beds had a terrific finish at the end of the year in terms of orders, a huge number of orders for our new ProCuity bed. So it's a new launch. It takes some time to go through the trialing process but we're extremely excited about our bed business. I think Glenn highlighted that in his remarks but the orders for our beds are very high, very strong. And we now have to build all the beds and make sure we have all the parts to be able to ship them all but we're very excited about the momentum; so it's broad-based. It's in our emergency care area, it's in Mako, it's in beds, it's in the Instruments division, the Endoscopy division, capital across the board is strong.\nMatt Taylor: Cool. Good to hear. Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Joshua, your line is open.\nJoshua Jennings: Hi, good evening. Thanks so much. Kevin, I was hoping to have two pipeline questions. You made a big winning bet on pairing robotics with Trauson Knee. I was wondering if there -- had any change in strategy on the implant side? And anything on the manufacturing front? Is it still cost-prohibitive for 3D printing of transplant implant? And how do you see the Knee implants evolving from here under Stryker's roof? And then the second question is just, robotics on the pipeline with spine and shoulder, are there any other areas, particularly one of the question on Neurovascular, where you see robotics or a killer app in the neurovascular or any other business segments for Stryker?\nKevin Lobo: Okay, great. Well, thanks. We'd like to sort of wait until we have something proven before we kind of talk about it. We are looking at femurs, in particular, cobalt chrome at different manufacturing processes for those. And once we're ready to talk about that, we'll share that. We have automated the beating that's used for the cementless part of the femur. We are constantly looking at different surface materials. But not ready to announce anything yet. I would say that the actual design of Trauson, we're really delighted with. As you saw, we came out with 3D printing, tibial baseplate, 3D printed patella to enable the cementless solution but not a fundamental change to the design. We came out with one millimeter inserts and we made other changes in, I'll say, modifications to make it easier to have a more personalized knee solution but not a fundamental redesign. So you shouldn't be expecting some kind of fundamental new design. But there will be things that we're working on that we'll be able to share with you on the knee side. Certainly, on the hip side, we have a new implant that we've talked about already earlier on that's fit for purpose for direct interior. We're very excited about that. We have a fabulous 3D-printed hip cup. But we do have instances where many surgeons are using our cup but they're using a competitive stem. And with this stem, we'll be able to convert all of their business. So that's very exciting for us. But on the Knee side, I wouldn't expect anything major new. We are working on things when we're ready, we'll be able to share that. As it relates to future applications, as you know, robotics are challenging. We're -- our main focus is really shoulder and spine right now. There are some skunkworks projects, looking at some other areas. But again, I don't want to start talking about those yet because they need to get more proven before we're ready to talk about it. In the areas of spine and shoulder, it's a matter of time. We are going to have robotic applications. But again, we don't have a time line right now but we have projects that are working on -- teams that are working on it and making very good progress.\nJoshua Jennings: Great, thanks. Good luck, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shagun Singh from RBC. Your line is open.\nShagun Singh: Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a couple of quick ones from me. Firstly, what are you assuming specifically for margin expansion in the first half and the full year? And then on China, VBP, do you expect trauma and spine to be included in this year's announcement? And then just lastly, on ASCs, it's a major theme that we're hearing from hospital companies, including from HCA this morning that ortho is the latest category that's in transition from inpatient to outpatient. And I think Kevin previously had indicated about that you expect about 50% of procedures to transition and I think you gave a time line as well. Can you provide us with an update there?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Okay. I'll -- this is Glenn. I'll take the first one, on margin expansions. We specifically did not really guide on margin expansion just because there's a lot of volatility. I think we were trying to provide you with some good color around some of the pressures we were feeling especially on gross margin. We do expect that to be a little more pronounced in the first half of the year especially as compared to prior year. And that's the extent of the guidance that we'll provide on margin. Then I'll hand it to Preston.\nPreston Wells: So yes, Shagun, just back to your ASC question, as I talked about before, we do expect that transition to continue. In terms of a time line, I mean, I think a lot of it is just going to depend on how capacity is built and how we're able to continue to transition patients and surgeons to that setting. Certainly as we think about the ASC offense that we've created, we are here and actually helping to make that transition happen. So we certainly would expect our large joints to continue to make that shift as well. And I apologize, I forgot your second question that you had in there.\nGlenn Boehnlein: I guess she is not there [ph]. And we can go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Jayson, please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones. First, it's a little granular but in those geographies that have seen COVID cases that have rolled over, have you seen a pickup in volume growth?\nPreston Wells: So I would say that it's spotty. I mean I think just like how we thought about COVID throughout the last 24 months or so, you will, as COVID cases start to decline and as hospitals are able to get capacity up and running, we know they will. And so certainly, as that happens with this wave, we will start to see procedures picking back up in those areas as well.\nKevin Lobo: But it does vary by market. So in Australia, we definitely saw a big pickup as soon as they resume electives, the pickup is pretty swift. I would say the U.K. is similar. But then in other markets, whether it's Japan or whether it's Southern Europe, it's a little bit more gradual, the increase. So there isn't one answer but we do know is these patients are going to need their procedures. The pace of the recovery, honestly, is quite difficult to generalize because it does behave differently by country. We are expecting that there will be a pickup and we look forward to that.\nJayson Bedford: Okay, that's fair. And just secondly, on the Wright integration, you guys have done a great job here in the U.S. Just wondering, on international, how much work is left on the integration? And should we expect to see a pickup in international extremity growth in '22?\nPreston Wells: Yes. We continue to work through the international integration. I would say that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to make progress in that space. And as we do, certainly, we should continue to see a pickup internationally as well.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, it's -- the international market certainly lagged the U.S. We had distributor contracts and arrangements that we had to get out of. And so we always plan for that to be a little later. And so we didn't have any -- the kind of results internationally that we did in the U.S. but that wasn't a surprise to us. And you will see a gradual pickup in the international markets. We're quite excited because, obviously, Stryker has a larger footprint internationally and really a better home for the Wright Medical products and that should be an engine of growth in the years ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Jeff, your line is open.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, but Glenn, totally respect that you haven't guided to the operating margin line. But I think when we connect the dots between your revenue guidance, your gross margin guidance, your EPS guidance. I mean, simple math is kind of getting me -- it could be up -- operating margin could be up a very little bit to down 30, 40 basis points. Just directionally, is my math kind of right there? Or should I rethink some of my math.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Jeff, yes, I think your -- the math is pretty obvious. I think if you take all the pieces. So, I imagine that your model probably will reflect that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Danielle, your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thanks so much. Hey guys, good afternoon. Thank you so much for squeezing me in here. I just have one question and sorry to belabor the whole COVID recovery, etcetera, point. But just curious about how to think about this recovery post surge or post wave versus past recoveries. I'm thinking of post-Q -- sorry, Q2 of last year, even really Q2 of 2020 when things first opened up. You really saw a bolus but it feels like because of the hospital staffing shortages, this might be a little bit more linear in nature. I know it's probably very difficult to get granular here but just curious about what you're hearing, how you guys are thinking about the recovery curve itself?\nPreston Wells: Yes, Danielle, you're right. It is a difficult thing to predict. And certainly, as we go back to 2020, I think you saw that big bolus pickup, if you remember how far down it was at the end of Q2. We certainly have not seen that same level of drop-off with these subsequent waves. So I think linear and gradual is probably the way to think about it, certainly muted a little bit by some of the staffing pieces. But I would say linear and gradual as we continue to come out of this recovery.\nDanielle Antalffy: Okay, that's it for me. Thanks.\nOperator: And our last question today comes from Drew Ranieri from Morgan Stanley. Drew, please proceed with your question.\nDrew Ranieri: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe one for Glenn, just on cash flow for 2022. Can you provide any type of framework for cash flow from operations? I think you mentioned CapEx but just curious what you're seeing and -- or expecting and any type of working capital improvements you're kind of working on in 2022?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. No, great question. I think as we think about cash flow, we've really come a long way, especially from where we were in 2019 and especially a lot of the muscle and discipline that we've built around working capital management. So all of that will roll into this year 2022 and the benefits associated with that. I think there will be some spending that was somewhat muted and deferred in the past, especially around CapEx. And so right now, we're estimating approximately $650 million of CapEx. That being said, we generally target that 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion number. I know we've beaten that over the last couple of years but we've also seen reduced spending in a lot of areas that I think will start to pick up, especially as we exit this and kind of try to get to a more normal operating environment. So I think that's probably what we're targeting. There could be some variability depending on how COVID plays out through the year.\nDrew Ranieri: And Kevin, just one for you. You kind of touched on the Insignia launch and your expectation that it's going to drive more Mako utilization over time. But near term, maybe in 2022 as you're launching this at AAOS, I mean would you expect to get up to 30% utilization for hips on Mako? Or is there kind of a stretch goal that you have in mind for the year?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Actually, for this year, I'm more concerned really with just getting great uptake with the stem, whether it's with Mako or without Mako. We've already done a limited launch. Feedback has been incredibly positive from surgeons in terms of the broaching of the implant, the size options, the experience that they're having is really terrific. So in this first year, the Mako utilization is less important to me than really satisfying the surgeon's need for this product and really getting into DA. And I expect the Mako number will continue to rise. It could hit 30%, absolutely. But more importantly is really having success with the stem both manually as well as with Mako. And the full launch we expect will be in the second quarter. So, we'll really start to see a bigger impact in the second half of the year, but there will be some impact in the first half but much more towards the second half of the year.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: So, thank you all for joining our call and for all your questions. As you can see, we had a very strong finish to 2021. We are working through the challenging environment right now. And you can see that the company is well positioned to fight through it. We are going to continue to invest for the future and make sure that as things improve in the environment that we're poised to capitalize on that and we look forward to sharing our first quarter results with you in April. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Kevin Lobo",
            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter and our annual Mako update. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. As a reminder, as announced during our Analyst Day in November, we have reclassified our reporting segments into two groups: MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Orthopaedics and Spine. This better aligns to how our businesses are managed internally. We have also pulled out Neurovascular on its own line and have the business units of neurosurgical instruments, CMF and ENT now grouped under Neurocranial. As we have done all year, we will comment on our performance versus 2019 which we believe is a better basis for comparison. For the quarter, organic sales growth exceeded 6% versus 2019, driven by double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses but offset by softer sales of our Hips, Knees and Spine as COVID and hospital staffing challenges had a meaningful impact on elective procedures during the quarter. We posted double-digit organic growth in international compared to 2019 as our globalization efforts continue to bear fruit and where COVID impacts were generally less severe than in the U.S. While our more deferrable businesses were challenged, we saw excellent results from our Mako robotic technology, capital products across our metric portfolio and continued double-digit organic growth in Neurovascular which reached approximately $1.2 billion in sales for the year. Despite the unanticipated Omicron variant, we were able to achieve full year sales growth and adjusted EPS within our latest guidance ranges. Our full year organic growth exceeded 7% and reflects strong demand for our Mako and MedSurg capital equipment and strong double-digit sales growth within Neurovascular and Neurocranial. In addition, we are very pleased with the Wright Medical integration, particularly in the U.S. Our full year adjusted EPS grew 10% versus 2019 and we delivered free cash flow conversion of 85%. The EPS growth was a strong result given the inflationary pressures that grew in the quarter and the COVID impact on our implant procedures. We continued to invest in R&D at a healthy rate of 6.6% of sales for the year and our new product pipelines are poised for continued success. Our strong cash flow performance provided us with additional flexibility to execute on M&A opportunities in the quarter, including Thermedx, a small tuck-in within endoscopy and the recently announced agreement to acquire Vocera. Despite the impacts of the pandemic throughout the year, we were able to surpass $15 billion, $16 billion and $17 billion in revenue for the first time. And we remain confident in the outlook for our business as the pandemic recedes. We continue to execute on our key growth strategies, including the expansion of our ASC offense, continued product innovation and category leadership across our businesses. Turning to 2022; the volatility caused by COVID variants remains ongoing and is further impacted by hospital staffing challenges and supply chain disruptions. In spite of this, we expect to continue to deliver above-market sales growth. However, given the pressures on our supply chain within MedSurg, we do not expect to deliver our typical degree of earnings leverage. We continue to be disciplined with our spending. However, we will continue to fuel new products with healthy R&D spending and will maintain our focus on above-market growth while we work through these cost pressures. As noted in the press release, we are guiding to 6% to 8% full year organic sales growth and adjusted EPS of $9.60 to $10 per share. As I conclude my comments, I remain confident in our strategy, talent and culture. I would like to thank our teams for continuing to persevere in these challenging times. I will now turn the call over to Preston. Yes, Joanne, this is Kevin. That's exactly the right way to think about it. We have terrific product pipelines. We have a lot of new products we're launching this year, including a new power cot, the Insignia Hip Stem, a number of foot and ankle launches, three launches in the upper extremities space. We have the in-space balloon. So a lot of new products but we're also gearing up for 2023, where we're planning to have a next-gen camera, a next-generation power tool, next-generation life pack. And as you know, these new products are really the lifeblood of our top line growth. So we are not going to slow down on the R&D investments. Of course, we'll look at the rest of our SG&A and be cautious just like you've seen us be cautious over the last two years. But yes, we are going to power through. But we do have a lot of tailwinds. We have a very strong order book and capital equipment. We're having a little trouble securing all the components to be able to ship all the products but we have a healthy order book. We have good momentum. And obviously, we need to ride out the COVID challenges. But yes, we are going to continue to invest for the future. For us, Knees has been really the engine of growth within our joint replacement business, if you look over the last two, three years. The combination of Mako and cementless is just so powerful that we've had a disproportionate growth in Knees relative to the market. In Hips, we have a gap with that hip stem which really -- the new stem that we -- we're just in early launch right now, the full launch will be at Academy, a bit at the end of the first quarter. That's really going to solve a gap in the direct anterior procedure. So I do expect that our Hip business will pick up. You're right that technically it's a little less deferrable but the mix, it's really the product portfolio that we have now which has favored Knees. It's not new in this quarter. It's been going on for the last couple of years. And we do expect our Knee business to continue to thrive. And we're excited about the new hip stem, especially when it becomes compatible with Mako at the end of the first quarter. And I'd just like to add that outside of large joints, we also have our sports medicine business. That's within endoscopy. It grew 30% in the fourth quarter. So that's a great sign of the overall success that Stryker is having in ASCs, that really terrific growth in our sports medicine business. Yes, this is really great to see; the growth in robotics. It's obviously creating a new standard of care. It's becoming expected. Residents are expecting this as they enter the workforce in orthopedics. And so we see the growth absolutely continuing. It's going to continue along the path that's been going on. I think we're going to see Hips potentially hit an inflection point with our -- with the launch of our new stem and start to really accelerate. So, we're very excited about the future. We think robotics is here to stay as you've seen this happen in many other industries. And so we do expect that the growth will continue. In the fourth quarter, we had an unusually high level of installs and competitive accounts, higher than normal. And we think that the fact that there are other entrants on the market is actually bringing more trialing of our systems and creating even more interest in Mako than there had been previously. So it's a tailwind for the industry and we're going to continue to ride that tailwind. And then as it relates to international, I would say we're still -- yes, thank you. I'll just continue on international. I would say we're still in the earlier phase of that as you've seen with other robotic technologies. It starts off here and then sort of expands around the world. We're still in early phases in Japan and in China and in Latin America but the growth is really starting to pick up there. The interest level is very high. And so I'm very bullish but it's going to take longer. It's a little slower the pathway there but it's just as exciting in the international markets. Yes. Just to put a fine point on the Foot & Ankle. So it's really the forefoot procedures that are a little bit more elective and that's where a number of our launches will happen. The Total Ankle Replacement was actually terrific in 2021, really great growth and we're going to continue to have very strong growth in Total Ankle Replacement. It's really getting the forefoot procedures to come back to the office. And as that grows, we will continue to grow. And a lot of our launches are MIS products, specifically for forefoot. Yes, our flow diverting stent business has been really a strength for us and it's not really so much related to competitive activities, just getting surgeons trained on the product. As you know, the Evolve stent is newer in many of the markets. It's a newer launch and we still haven't launched it in all countries around the world but we're pretty excited about the product and it's been growing at a pretty healthy rate. And there was no -- I would say, no change or no inflection point related to competitive activity. I don't really get into that level of detail. What I'd just say is the mix -- we used to report the mix as roughly 50% to 60% in competitive accounts. It was well north of that in the fourth quarter. Now I don't know if it's just a one quarter issue or whether that will continue. There were a lot of accounts that were kind of waiting for other offerings to appear on the market. And once those offerings appear, then they would have trials. And in most cases, it was -- in some cases, I know it was the first robot. In other cases, it may have been the second or the third robot in those accounts. I don't have exactly that level of information. But it was higher than we've seen in the past. I can't say I was expecting it. It was higher than I expected. But I am expecting Mako to continue to grow and that's not new. It's just the mix was more competitive than we've seen previously. Now, we'll see if that continues going forward. But the order book for Mako as well as for the MedSurg capital is strong at the end of the year; so that tells us that momentum will continue into 2022. Actually, our capital order book is strong across the board. And in particular, beds had a terrific finish at the end of the year in terms of orders, a huge number of orders for our new ProCuity bed. So it's a new launch. It takes some time to go through the trialing process but we're extremely excited about our bed business. I think Glenn highlighted that in his remarks but the orders for our beds are very high, very strong. And we now have to build all the beds and make sure we have all the parts to be able to ship them all but we're very excited about the momentum; so it's broad-based. It's in our emergency care area, it's in Mako, it's in beds, it's in the Instruments division, the Endoscopy division, capital across the board is strong. Okay, great. Well, thanks. We'd like to sort of wait until we have something proven before we kind of talk about it. We are looking at femurs, in particular, cobalt chrome at different manufacturing processes for those. And once we're ready to talk about that, we'll share that. We have automated the beating that's used for the cementless part of the femur. We are constantly looking at different surface materials. But not ready to announce anything yet. I would say that the actual design of Trauson, we're really delighted with. As you saw, we came out with 3D printing, tibial baseplate, 3D printed patella to enable the cementless solution but not a fundamental change to the design. We came out with one millimeter inserts and we made other changes in, I'll say, modifications to make it easier to have a more personalized knee solution but not a fundamental redesign. So you shouldn't be expecting some kind of fundamental new design. But there will be things that we're working on that we'll be able to share with you on the knee side. Certainly, on the hip side, we have a new implant that we've talked about already earlier on that's fit for purpose for direct interior. We're very excited about that. We have a fabulous 3D-printed hip cup. But we do have instances where many surgeons are using our cup but they're using a competitive stem. And with this stem, we'll be able to convert all of their business. So that's very exciting for us. But on the Knee side, I wouldn't expect anything major new. We are working on things when we're ready, we'll be able to share that. As it relates to future applications, as you know, robotics are challenging. We're -- our main focus is really shoulder and spine right now. There are some skunkworks projects, looking at some other areas. But again, I don't want to start talking about those yet because they need to get more proven before we're ready to talk about it. In the areas of spine and shoulder, it's a matter of time. We are going to have robotic applications. But again, we don't have a time line right now but we have projects that are working on -- teams that are working on it and making very good progress. But it does vary by market. So in Australia, we definitely saw a big pickup as soon as they resume electives, the pickup is pretty swift. I would say the U.K. is similar. But then in other markets, whether it's Japan or whether it's Southern Europe, it's a little bit more gradual, the increase. So there isn't one answer but we do know is these patients are going to need their procedures. The pace of the recovery, honestly, is quite difficult to generalize because it does behave differently by country. We are expecting that there will be a pickup and we look forward to that. Yes, it's -- the international market certainly lagged the U.S. We had distributor contracts and arrangements that we had to get out of. And so we always plan for that to be a little later. And so we didn't have any -- the kind of results internationally that we did in the U.S. but that wasn't a surprise to us. And you will see a gradual pickup in the international markets. We're quite excited because, obviously, Stryker has a larger footprint internationally and really a better home for the Wright Medical products and that should be an engine of growth in the years ahead. Yes. Actually, for this year, I'm more concerned really with just getting great uptake with the stem, whether it's with Mako or without Mako. We've already done a limited launch. Feedback has been incredibly positive from surgeons in terms of the broaching of the implant, the size options, the experience that they're having is really terrific. So in this first year, the Mako utilization is less important to me than really satisfying the surgeon's need for this product and really getting into DA. And I expect the Mako number will continue to rise. It could hit 30%, absolutely. But more importantly is really having success with the stem both manually as well as with Mako. And the full launch we expect will be in the second quarter. So, we'll really start to see a bigger impact in the second half of the year, but there will be some impact in the first half but much more towards the second half of the year. So, thank you all for joining our call and for all your questions. As you can see, we had a very strong finish to 2021. We are working through the challenging environment right now. And you can see that the company is well positioned to fight through it. We are going to continue to invest for the future and make sure that as things improve in the environment that we're poised to capitalize on that and we look forward to sharing our first quarter results with you in April. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Today's sales comments will be provided based on our new reporting structure. And as with previous quarters this year, all comments are in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 6.2% in the quarter. The fourth quarter included the same number of average selling days as Q4 2019 and Q4 2020. Compared to 2019, the two-year impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.7%. Versus Q4 2020, pricing was 0.8% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 0.5% impact on sales. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 4.7%, reflecting the impact of COVID on elective procedures, hospital staffing shortages and disruptions of general hospital operations. This was offset partially by strong demand for Mako and our MedSurg and Neurotechnology products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 10.6%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe, Canada and emerging markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 7.2%, with U.S. organic growth of 5.2% and international organic growth of 12.9%. 2021 had the same number of selling days as 2019 and one less selling day compared to 2020. Compared to 2019, the two-year price impact had an unfavorable 1.5% impact on sales. Versus full year 2020, pricing was 0.8% unfavorable. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.71 increased to 8.8% from 2019, reflecting sales growth and a lower quarterly effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix, increased adverse COVID-related pressure on sales, gross margin inflationary pressures and higher interest charges resulting from the Wright Medical acquisition. Our full year EPS of $9.09 which represents growth of 10% from full year 2019 reflects the favorable impacts of sales growth, operating expense discipline, Wright Medical, foreign currency and a lower effective tax rate partially offset by increased investments in R&D as well as higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and NeuroTech had constant currency sales growth of 11.8%, with organic sales growth of 11.6% which included 9.3% of U.S. organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.6%, led by strong growth in their Orthopaedics instruments and Surgical Technologies businesses, highlighted by growth in their power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield products. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 11%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including general surgery and fluorescence products and strong double-digit growth of their sports medicine and communications businesses. The Medical division had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.3%, reflecting solid performances in their Sage and bed businesses. During the quarter, we also saw significant growth in orders across the medical portfolio, driven by very strong demand. Assuming normalization of the customer environment and a reduction of certain supply constraints, we expect these orders to contribute to another strong year for Medical in 2022. Our U.S. Neurovascular business posted organic growth of 7.4% reflecting solid growth in their hemorrhagic and aspiration products. The U.S. Neurocranial business posted organic sales growth of 5.7% which included solid growth in our MAC space, ENT navigation and cryotherapy products, somewhat offset by continued COVID impacts. Internationally, MedSurg and NeuroTech had organic sales growth of 18.6%, reflecting double-digit growth in the Endoscopy, Medical, Neurovascular and Neurocranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe Canada, China and in the NeuroTech businesses in emerging markets. Orthopaedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 15.2% and an organic sales decline of 0.8% with an organic decline of 2% in the U.S. This reflects the impact of the slowdown in elective procedures during the quarter as a result of the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID. Our U.S. Knee business grew 0.1% organically. As a reminder, during the fourth quarter of 2019, our U.S. Knee business had very strong growth of approximately 10.5%. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 6.7% on a comparable basis with strong growth in our plating products combined with double-digit growth in our upper extremities business. Spine declined 6.6% organically in the U.S., primarily resulting from COVID disruptions to their business. Other Orthopaedics grew 21.5% organically in the U.S., primarily reflecting continued strong demand for our Mako robotic platform which had growth in the U.S. of 43.5%. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 1.9% organically which reflects the strong momentum of Mako in Japan, Korea and emerging markets, somewhat offset by the impact of volume-based pricing in China, primarily related to our Trauson business. For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business which includes Wright Medical, delivered 4.1% constant currency growth on a comparable basis. The Wright Medical acquisition anniversaried in November 2021 and will be part of our organic sales throughout 2022. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin was 65.8%, was unfavorable approximately 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. Compared to the fourth quarter in 2019, gross margin was adversely impacted by business mix; operational inefficiencies due to COVID, including employee absenteeism; and raw material inflation, primarily related to electronic components, steel and transportation costs. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout 2022 with a more pronounced impact in the first half of 2022. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.4% of sales which represents an 80 basis points increase versus the fourth quarter of 2019 and reflects our continued commitment to innovation funding and the related growth that we'll provide. Our adjusted SG&A was 32.1% of sales which was a 20 basis point improvement as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by the ramping of certain expenses and hiring to support future growth and the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 27.3% of sales which is 100 basis points unfavorable to the fourth quarter of 2019. This performance primarily resulted from adverse business mix, gross margin challenges, investments in R&D and the dilutive impact of acquisitions, primarily Wright Medical. Other income and expense increased as compared to fourth quarter in 2019, primarily resulting from the interest expense increases related to our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.2%. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate is 14.9% which was partially impacted favorably by onetime items during the year. For 2022, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.5 billion. For the year, we paid down $1.2 billion of debt. Turning to cash flow; our full year cash from operations was approximately $3.3 billion. This strong performance reflects the results of net earnings and continued focus on working capital management. For 2022, we anticipate that capital spending will be approximately $650 million. Again, in 2022, we do not plan to do any share buybacks given our anticipated focus on further debt reduction. And now I will provide you 2022 full year guidance. As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that there will be continued volatility caused by ongoing COVID-related impacts, hospital staffing challenges and increasing supply chain disruptions as well as significant inflationary risks. Given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 8% for the full year 2022 when compared to 2021. There are the same number of selling days in 2022 compared to 2021. Consistent with the pricing environment we experienced in previous years, we would expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be modestly unfavorably impacted as compared to 2021 and this is included in our guidance. Despite the top line and operational risks of COVID, we have good momentum in many parts of our business heading into 2022, including the continued demand for our Mako technology, a very robust order book for our capital products, continued execution of our combined T&E business and many, many product innovations. For the full year 2022, we do not expect to deliver our typical operating margin expansion as a result of the ongoing price escalation on supply-constrained raw materials like electronic components and rising inflationary costs on raw materials transportation and labor costs. As a result of the latest COVID wave and the current inflationary environment, we expect gross margin performance to be negatively impacted by 50 to 100 basis points with a more pronounced impact in the first half of the year. As we said during our analyst call in November, we plan to return to our normal delivery of margin expansion once we reach a post-COVID environment. Finally, for 2022, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.60 to $10 for the full year. This wider guidance range represents the ongoing variability in the operating environment. The upper end of our guidance range assumes the latest COVID wave subsides in Q1, with no additional major COVID disruptions during the year. In addition, it assumes that the supply chain stabilizes by the end of the first half of the year. The low end of the guidance range assumes the continued COVID-related volatility persists, including supply chain pressures that could impact revenues as well as costs and includes more transient spot buying and longer-term supply chain pressures. We will continue to evaluate the changing environment and we'll provide updates to our guidance as necessary. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Sure. Yes, Robbie, I think right now -- and obviously, you kind of see it because of the wide range of guidance we've provided, both sort of top and bottom. But our thinking is, is that the real pronounced impact that we'll have on top line and on gross margin will be in the first half of the year. We'll really feel the impacts related to that very pronounced in first quarter and lesser so in second quarter. And then we feel like things will start to stabilize by the time we get to third quarter and fourth quarter. But we do see real cost pressures, especially around our electronic components which go in many, many of our products, especially on the MedSurg side of the business. And the buying of those products is many times in a spot market where it's an auction process and we're paying significantly higher prices than what we normally would pay related to those. Yes. Larry, honestly, that's the year-over-year impact to gross margins, not the isolated necessarily inflationary impact. That would include impacts from pricing pressures as well. Confidence that it will abate, I don't necessarily think that I have confidence it will abate. I think it will moderate is what will happen. I mean a lot of this pricing pressure is based on commodity pricing which is highly driven by supply and demand. I do believe that supply will catch up. We are securing bulk purchases of demand. So I think that will help us even out our utilization of it as well. And so I do think by the back half of the year, we'll start to see moderation of those costs. Okay. Yes, Matt, I think, first of all, at the Analyst Day, the guidance that we laid out was our long-term financial guidance. That guidance was specifically once we exit this kind of COVID environment which clearly in 2022, we are not in a position that we're exiting the COVID environment. Right now, just based on foundationally what is underlying those long-term financial plans in terms of what we have lined up for growth, how do we think about M&A, how do we think about our product portfolio and new innovation, I see no reason why we would change our thoughts around that long-term growth. Now if you work your way down through the income statement and say, okay, how are you going to finagle your EPS to get to that growth challenge number. I actually think in this year's growth number, if you look at the high end of our EPS, we're not far away from what we're asserting is our long-term challenge. I do think that once COVID abates, we will get right back on our cost improvement initiatives, especially around direct purchasing. I don't see that changing at all. Throughout COVID, we have kept up pace in our CTG initiative still, just in terms of focusing on shared service opportunities, looking at indirect purchasing opportunities. And so all those foundational elements are still in place. And I do have all the confidence to think that once we exit COVID that we'll get right back into that cadence of delivering that. Sure. As you think about operating expenses and I think Kevin emphasized this, we've protected R&D through this entire period. We just -- we know that's the lifeblood. We know we have to spend there. And so we have not backed away from funding those innovation initiatives from a people standpoint or a technology standpoint. And that's important and we won't change there. On the SG&A front, we've been a little more prudent. I think you've seen us be smart about our spending, be smart about, obviously, we're not traveling a lot, so we're not feeling that. I think as 2022 unfolds, though, I mean, a couple of things. Obviously, we'll continue to be prudent about hiring and bringing in costs but we will start to see those costs that relate to growth especially as it relates to interactions with customers, hiring sales forces, expanding territories, those types of costs will expand specifically in selling. Now that being said, we will continue to pressure G&A, corporate type spending and things like that to try to offset some of that. But that's kind of how those operating expenses will look throughout the year. Okay. I'll -- this is Glenn. I'll take the first one, on margin expansions. We specifically did not really guide on margin expansion just because there's a lot of volatility. I think we were trying to provide you with some good color around some of the pressures we were feeling especially on gross margin. We do expect that to be a little more pronounced in the first half of the year especially as compared to prior year. And that's the extent of the guidance that we'll provide on margin. Then I'll hand it to Preston. I guess she is not there [ph]. And we can go to the next question. Yes. Jeff, yes, I think your -- the math is pretty obvious. I think if you take all the pieces. So, I imagine that your model probably will reflect that. Yes. No, great question. I think as we think about cash flow, we've really come a long way, especially from where we were in 2019 and especially a lot of the muscle and discipline that we've built around working capital management. So all of that will roll into this year 2022 and the benefits associated with that. I think there will be some spending that was somewhat muted and deferred in the past, especially around CapEx. And so right now, we're estimating approximately $650 million of CapEx. That being said, we generally target that 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion number. I know we've beaten that over the last couple of years but we've also seen reduced spending in a lot of areas that I think will start to pick up, especially as we exit this and kind of try to get to a more normal operating environment. So I think that's probably what we're targeting. There could be some variability depending on how COVID plays out through the year."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the latest impacts of COVID-19 across certain products during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on Mako and recent acquisitions, including the continued integration of Wright Medical and the performance of our combined Trauma and Extremities business. During the quarter, hospital bed and operating room capacities were challenged because of the Delta variant early in the quarter and most recently by the Omicron variant which started to pressure elective procedural volumes in December. In addition, ongoing nursing staffing shortages disrupted hospital scheduling of procedural volumes. The delay in procedural volumes primarily impacted our implant-related businesses, including hips knees, spine and foot and ankle which can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. However, we know that most of these patients will eventually return to have those procedures completed as the impacts from COVID decline and procedural volumes return to more normal levels. Demand for our capital products was strong in the quarter, including double-digit orders and sales which created a strong order book for capital products. Despite the strong capital demand, there were some headwinds in the quarter that primarily impacted our Medical business, including installation delays caused by hospital staffing challenges and raw material shortages primarily related to electronics that created some supply disruptions. For the full year 2021 versus 2020, our global Mako installed base grew by 27% and we now have an installed base that is approaching 1,500 Mako robots. This continues to grow -- this growth continues to highlight the high demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology. The strong double-digit growth also underscores our ongoing success installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs and competitive accounts, as well as our focus on expanding into international markets. In the fourth quarter, we saw a meaningful increase in the percentage of robots installed into competitive accounts. Turning to U.S. knee procedures. In the fourth quarter, over 50% of our total knees were Mako knee procedures, a trend that continues to increase and demonstrates the outstanding utilization of the Mako install base. The shift towards cementless knees also continued. And in the fourth quarter, cementless knees made up 47% of our U.S. knee procedures. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, over 25% of our total hip procedures were Mako Hip procedures which similar to knees, continues to increase in utilization. Our recently launched Insignia Hip Stem will also be Mako-capable by the end of the first quarter. We expect to further our leadership position in orthopedic robotic-assisted surgery through the continued adoption of our Mako SmartRobotics platform on a global basis. Shifting to our Trauma and Extremities business. We are now over one year into the integration of Wright Medical which continues to progress well in all regions and across all functions, despite the headwinds from COVID. Including Wright Medical, the combined U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew high single digits in 2021 which exceeded our expectations. The full year growth in the United States was driven by strong growth in core trauma and double-digit growth in the upper extremities business which offset the COVID-related impact on foot and ankle. This strong result reflects excellent execution of the sales integration and the strength of the product portfolio. Finally, our dedicated divisional business development teams continued to identify and execute on meaningful acquisitions. As Kevin mentioned, we recently announced our agreement to acquire Vocera and enter the fast-growing digital care coordination and communications segment. We expect the Vocera acquisition to close by the end of the first quarter. During the fourth quarter, we also finalized the acquisition of Thermedx. Thermedx is an innovative developer and manufacturer of fluid management solutions and will allow our endoscopy business to improve surgical visualization across the women's health segment and advance the standard of care in the urology segment. We believe these and other acquisitions completed during the year will help us continue to drive above-market growth in the future. The overall environment remains uncertain as a result of the continuing COVID pandemic and we expect hospital staffing shortages, supply constraints and significant inflationary pressures caused by raw material shortages to persist throughout 2022. However, we believe that the underlying demand for our products remains strong and coupled with a robust order book for our capital products, gives us confidence in our ability to drive market-leading growth when the impacts of the pandemic subside. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Yes. I mean, Robbie, we're not obviously guiding for the quarter. But certainly, as we think about the fourth quarter and how the fourth quarter ended with regards to the COVID variants continuing into January. So I think you can certainly think about it that way that there are some of those pressures from a top line standpoint that are certainly continuing at the beginning of the year. No. I think, Joanne, if the Mako numbers you're referring to are how we're continuing to utilize Mako as it becomes a bigger and bigger portion of our total knee business, I mean this is just a continuation as we think about what we've talked about over the last few years. So again, we expect this to just continue to grow as we think about the utilization both on knees and what we're now seeing on hips as well and then also as we think about cementless in the knee world. So we would expect that just to continue to go as we continue to place and install Mako's in different areas. Matt, it's Preston. So as we've talked about in the past, we talked about our Knees, in particular, being about 5% to 10% of our business being in the ASC. And as we've seen that continue to grow, as we came through the fourth quarter, we're seeing numbers that are actually reaching closer to that 10% number. So, we are seeing that shift happen. I mean it certainly is happening when we think about where patients are wanting to get procedures done. Certainly, as we think about our focus from our offense standpoint, as we think about the ASC, we are seeing the shift happen across our product line. So certainly, we expect that to continue to go. We've talked about that there is an opportunity for that to continue to grow over time. Certainly, there are capacity constraints as ASCs are built out that will allow that continue to grow faster. But that's a shift that was already started and we don't see that slowing down anytime soon. Yes, Pito. No, we are not seeing that at all. I mean what we've continued to see throughout the pandemic and while some of it early on was aided by some of the CARES funding and things of that nature, we are seeing strong balance sheets and we're seeing the continued need for capital products. Certainly, as we think about the capital products that we supply that are either lending towards revenue generating for the hospital, or towards safety and outcome for the hospital. So we're definitely seeing a continued strength in terms of the capital demand, especially for our products. I mean our order book, as we'd said, is really strong heading into the year and there's a lot of confidence given some of the products that Kevin even outlined earlier that that's going to continue throughout the year. Frank, it's Preston. So at this point, as we said before, with regards to both of those different platforms that we certainly have active projects that are working on them. They are key priorities for our development teams. But at this point, we still do not have a time line that we are sharing. Yes. So let me address your Spine question first. I think as we've said in general throughout the pandemic, it's just very hard to get a read on how share changes are happening given some of the COVID impacts and how they impact different things regionally also just in terms of where we are in the reporting cycle. It's very early. Certainly, with Spine, just like we saw with Hips and Knees, it was impacted from a COVID perspective throughout the quarter early on as we try to recover from Delta and then with Omicron coming in later on in the back part of the quarter. So not easy to say where everybody is going to shake out from that standpoint. But certainly, outside of COVID, outside of the staffing issues that we talked about as well, we are pleased in general with our product portfolio, including enabling technologies that we have in the Spine area. As we come back from COVID and as COVID abates, we would expect the growth to uptick in that area. And certainly, as we do with all of our businesses, expect to see growth on that business as we talk about year-over-year. With regards to Foot & Ankle. Foot & Ankle, the market is still a very strong market. It's one that we're very happy about to be in. But unlike other products within the trauma or even upper extremities, Foot & Ankle was much more impacted from a COVID perspective during the quarter. And we've seen that throughout the year. But certainly, as COVID abates in that area as well, we would expect growth to really drive there. And Kevin mentioned, we have several product launches that are going to be happening in that space as well that we're very happy about. So we definitely look for growth, certainly, as COVID is starting to abate a bit to really see the growth take off in that area. Yes. So just in terms of staffing, this is Preston. Just similar to some of these other headwinds that we talked about, the staffing challenge is a real one that certainly it seems to be much more pronounced in periods of high COVID infection rates. Obviously, as those nurses are either doing other things or in fact, impacted themselves from a COVID standpoint. So we certainly do expect the staffing challenge to remain throughout the rest of this year. But we are seeing hospitals try to find ways to deal with it, whether it's looking at traveling nurses or adjusting wages or even adjusting how they're scheduling to get through that. So while it will be a bit of a headwind, we certainly think that it's something that we will be able to work through. And as procedures return, we certainly expect to get the procedural volumes back to the levels that we would want them to be. No. Yes. So Matt, I think as we look at 2022 and as we enter the year, similar to what we've seen in 2021, I mean, there still continues to be a lot of variability with just COVID. And so if we think about how we've entered this year with COVID being pretty high in some places and while this variant seems to happen very fast and it seems to be peaking in some areas which is encouraging, what we can't predict is where the next wave is and what might happen from a next wave standpoint. So there's a lot of variability just as we think about COVID and then we add on top of that some of the challenges and the headwinds from a supply chain perspective. And it's not to say that there's a big bolus of supply chain issues that we have. But just in general, if we think about electronics and components and some of the challenges just with supply across all industries, that's certainly something that's out there in front of us as well. So there's just a lot of variability as we think about this year in terms of some of those top line aspects that is one of the reasons why we have that wider spread and maybe a little bit lower than what some others were expecting. That being said, as Kevin outlined, there are some really, really good tailwinds that we do have as we think about entering this year, whether it be our Mako installation base and how that's going to portray into future sales there. Also the new product launches that he's outlined. Of course, we have the Vocera deal that we're hoping to close this quarter as well. So there's a lot of positive momentum that we have across our businesses that we're going to take into this year and so we're really pleased with that. But just balancing that with some of those headwinds that I outlined as well. Yes. As Glenn outlined in the guidance that he went through, we do have some of that assumed in that spread that we have. So the impact is primarily impacting our Medical business but there are some smaller impacts that we're seeing on some of the other MedSurg-related businesses. As we think about Mako, as we entered into 2022 and the expected demand that we have for Mako, we feel comfortable where we are in terms of supply and any impacts on Mako are minimized at this point. Yes. Well, we don't provide guidance at that level. We don't expect the momentum that we've generated throughout this year to slow down as we think about our international business. And quite frankly, as Kevin has pointed out in the past, this is something that we've been building towards as we think about our focus on international markets. And so there's no reason to believe that, that will slow down. Yes. So I think it's a bit of a mixed bag. So there certainly are inflationary pressures that we're feeling as a result of the supply chain and just constraints on certain materials like electronics. But that is also, in some cases, leading to some delays in terms of getting some products out. So we do have a bit of a mix as we think about supply and certainly, the procurement team, the direct procurement team is working on actively securing as much as possible. But as Glenn mentioned, sometimes what that means is going outside of our contracts into spot buys and that's what's generating some of the larger inflationary impacts as we think about the guidance that we gave. Obviously, our goal is to protect our customer needs as best as possible as we go through this but there certainly is an impact on both the top and the inflationary pieces that Glenn outlined as well. So yes, Shagun, just back to your ASC question, as I talked about before, we do expect that transition to continue. In terms of a time line, I mean, I think a lot of it is just going to depend on how capacity is built and how we're able to continue to transition patients and surgeons to that setting. Certainly as we think about the ASC offense that we've created, we are here and actually helping to make that transition happen. So we certainly would expect our large joints to continue to make that shift as well. And I apologize, I forgot your second question that you had in there. So I would say that it's spotty. I mean I think just like how we thought about COVID throughout the last 24 months or so, you will, as COVID cases start to decline and as hospitals are able to get capacity up and running, we know they will. And so certainly, as that happens with this wave, we will start to see procedures picking back up in those areas as well. Yes. We continue to work through the international integration. I would say that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to make progress in that space. And as we do, certainly, we should continue to see a pickup internationally as well. Yes, Danielle, you're right. It is a difficult thing to predict. And certainly, as we go back to 2020, I think you saw that big bolus pickup, if you remember how far down it was at the end of Q2. We certainly have not seen that same level of drop-off with these subsequent waves. So I think linear and gradual is probably the way to think about it, certainly muted a little bit by some of the staffing pieces. But I would say linear and gradual as we continue to come out of this recovery."

This conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, during the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you. Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 8.4% versus 2019, driven by excellent double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, but this was offset by softer sales of hip, knee and spine due to the resurgence of COVID-19. A slowdown in deferrable procedures primarily impacted the US and worsened through the quarter. While our implant businesses were challenged, we saw strong results for our Mako product technology and capital products across our MedSurg portfolio. In addition, we had strong performances from our more emergent businesses, including our core trauma business and another standout performance by Neurovascular. International organic growth of 12%, again, outpaced growth in the US, representing robust performances and lessening impacts of COVID-19 across most major geographies, including strong results across Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets. Our year-to-date organic growth is 7.6%. And with the continued uncertainty related to COVID recovery as well as health care staffing shortages, we are updating our full year organic sales growth guidance to 7% to 8% compared to 2019. Our capital equipment order book remains strong, and we are well positioned for the eventual procedure recovery. Our adjusted EPS grew 15% versus 2019, and we continued our focus on driving cash flow, leading to a year-to-date cash conversion of 87%. The EPS growth, although solid, was lower than our expectations and is reflected in our updated guidance, which Glenn will elaborate on. Meanwhile, we are pleased with our cash flow performance, which provides us with additional flexibility for future M&A opportunities. While the quarter did not progress as we had anticipated due to the Delta variant, we remain confident in the outlook for our businesses as evidenced by our strong international MedSurg and Neurotechnology performances. We expect these businesses to continue to perform at high levels with the uncertainty most concentrated in deferrable procedures in the United States. We continue to feel bullish about our longer-term prospects as the pandemic recedes with our proven strategy and strong fundamentals. We are excited to share more with you at our upcoming Analyst Day on November 18th. I will now turn the call over to Preston.\nPreston Wells: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment, including how certain products and geographies performed during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the continued integration of Wright Medical, including the performance of our combined trauma and extremities business. During the quarter, significant spikes of the COVID-19 Delta variant drove increased infections and hospitalizations that require higher hospital bed utilization, which ultimately led to the deferral of elective procedures. In addition to increased hospitalization, hospital staffing shortages also pressured procedural volumes throughout the quarter. This primarily impacted our implant-related businesses including hips, knees and spine, which can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. However, the disease states that we treat are degenerative and the patients that defer their procedures will eventually return to have those procedures completed. The impact on elective procedures was more pronounced in the United States than on other geographies outside the United States. Within the United States, there were areas of disruption in most states but disruption was more widespread in the Southeast and Southwest portions of the country, impacting major markets like Florida and Texas throughout the quarter. Other markets around the world, including China, Japan and Australia experienced intermittent lockdowns throughout the quarter, which also drove uneven results across our implant-related businesses in those markets. During the quarter, Europe, which was more impacted by COVID in previous quarters, had impressive organic growth compared to 2019. COVID related hospitalizations in the United States began to trend upwards towards the end of July and then progressively worsened peaking at beginning of September. At the end of the quarter, infection and hospitalization rates were declining in impacted regions and has continued into October. As a result, we are beginning to see some improvements in our more impacted businesses through the first few weeks of October. However, we expect the recovery will be partially muted by discontinued hospital staffing challenges and ongoing COVID related volatility. Our assumption for the fourth quarter is that deferrable procedures will gradually return, starting with a low base in October before returning to more normal levels by the end of the quarter. As a result, we expect that the fourth quarter growth rates for our more deferrable businesses will be similar to the third quarter. Despite the ongoing challenges with elective procedures, we had strong performances in our more emerging businesses like Neurovascular, which grew strong double digits compared to 2019 as a result of continued market expansion and ongoing global demand for our innovative technologies. In addition, demand for our capital equipment remains healthy as evidenced by our continued strong sales performance and robust order book for small and large capital products, including our surgical technologies, emergency care and neurosurgical businesses. The ongoing strength in capital is also reflected in the continued demand for our Mako robotic technology. Our industry-leading Mako robot continues to help surgeons improve patient outcomes by knowing more and cutting less. This trend across capital is expected to continue as hospitals take advantage of flexible financing and prioritize capital products like those within our portfolio that are critical to providing emergency care, driving profitable procedures and ensuring safe working environments for caregivers and patients. Turning to the Wright Medical integration, which continues to progress in all regions and functions. United States commercial integration has moved past the sales force realignment and is now focused on continued business process improvements and system efficiencies. The teams have also developed long term product pipeline strategy. Outside the United States, we continue to work through integration activities, including sales force and indirect channel alignment across all key geographic regions. Overall, we remain pleased with the progress and the pace of integration over the past year. Including Wright Medical, the combined US Trauma and Extremities business has grown 8.1% year-to-date. The year-to-date growth in the United States has been driven by strong double digit growth in both our core trauma and upper extremities businesses, reflecting the execution of the sales integration in the United States. Outside the United States, sales have declined 3.8% year-to-date, driven by timing of distributor conversions in Latin America and Asia Pacific and declines in our legacy Trauson and Trauma business in China as a result of the provincial tendering process. Considering the latest results, ongoing COVID related volatility and the provincial tenders in China, we now expect our combined Trauma and Extremities business to grow mid single digits for the full year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our organic sales growth was 8.4% in the quarter. The third quarter included the same number of average selling days as Q3 2019 and Q3 2020. Compared to 2019, the two year impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 2.2%. Versus Q3 2020, pricing was 0.7% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales. Our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses saw another very strong quarter, continuing the growth momentum of the second quarter with double digit growth in both segments. Our Orthopedics and Spine businesses have been adversely impacted by increases in hospitalization rates starting in early August, especially in the US as a result of the Delta variant. The corresponding impact on elective procedures has significantly slowed the recovery in our Orthopedics and Spine implant businesses. For the quarter, US organic sales increased 7.1%, reflecting the continued strong demand for Mako, instruments, medical and neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 12%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.20 increased 15.2% from 2019, reflecting sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower quarterly effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix and higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition. Our third quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 19.9% and organic sales growth of 2%, including organic growth of 1% in the US. This reflects the impact of the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the Delta variant, which primarily impacted our hip and knee implant businesses. Our knee business grew 0.9% organically in the US, reflecting the previously mentioned impact on elective procedures, offset by continued adoption of our robotic platform for total knee procedures. Our US trauma business grew 8.8%, reflecting solid performances across the portfolio. Other ortho grew 19.8% in the US, primarily reflecting demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 4.1% organically, which reflects the strong performances in Europe and the momentum in Mako internationally, somewhat offset by the increased impact of restrictions imposed on elective procedures due to COVID, especially in Japan. For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business, which includes Writer Medical delivered 3.2% growth on a comparable basis. In the US, comparable growth was 7.4%, which included double digital growth in our upper extremities business. In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 12%, ,which included 12% US organic growth as well. Instruments had US organic sales growth of 15.9%, led by double digit growth in their orthopedic implants and surgical technology businesses, which include power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and skin closure products. Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 10.6%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including video and general surgery products and strong double digit growth of their communications and sports medicine businesses. The Medical division had US organic growth of 12.5%, reflecting double-digit performances in its emergency care and Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 12%, reflecting strong growth in the Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical businesses across Europe and Australia. Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 11.8%. This growth reflects double digit performances in our neurovascular, neurosurgical and interventional spine businesses. Our Neurovascular business had particularly strong growth of approximately 26% and makes up roughly 30% of this segment. Our US Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 11.8%, reflecting strong product growth in Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps and Bone Mill. Our US Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of products, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 24.6%. This performance was driven by strong neurotech demand in China and other emerging markets as well as Europe and Australia. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was favorable approximately 55 basis points from third quarter 2019. Compared to the third quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by acquisitions, which was partially offset by business mix and price. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.7% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our SG&A was 34.1% of sales, which was slightly negative as compared to the third quarter of 2019. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by ramping of certain expenses, hiring to support future growth and the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.4% of sales, which is approximately the same as third quarter 2019. This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum, offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, primarily Wright Medical. Related to other income and expenses compared to the third quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14%, which was impacted by our mix of US, non-US income and favorable discrete items during the quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 14.8%. For the year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. Year-to-date, we have paid down $1.2 billion of debt. In October, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and increased that facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $2.3 billion. This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Based on our performance in the third quarter, the continued volatility experienced as a result of COVID, procedural delays in hospital staffing shortages as well as uncertainty around the pace of recovery in the fourth quarter, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8%. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be in the mid single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year and this is included in our revised guidance range. Based on our performance in the first nine months and including consideration of the aforementioned volatility impacting the recovery of elective procedures and the full year Wright Medical impact, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.08 to $9.15. And now I will open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Maybe to start on guidance. It sounds like October is off to a slower start. Maybe just if you could walk us through the different business lines and how you're seeing them throughout fourth quarter so far, and what gives you confidence that you could start to see a pickup? Do you have -- are orders increasing, are doctors increasing bookings? Just help us understand what gives you confidence for the tick-up?\nPreston Wells: So in terms of Q4, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw October starting to show some improvement as it relates to our implant related businesses. And so we are seeing a bit of a pickup, but I think it's important to note that it's starting from a lower starting point. So while we do expect there to be some recovery happening in those implant businesses throughout the quarter, we do expect it to get back to more normal levels by the end. There are a few headwinds that are out there as well in terms of not only additional COVID hotspots or things like that, but also with staffing being a potential headwind as well. So we're definitely monitoring those as we go. But we are seeing some improvement early in October versus where we ended in Q3. As it relates to the other parts of the business, as both Kevin, Glenn and myself mentioned, our capital business continues to perform very well, and we still have high expectations that those are going to continue into Q4, really and the way we look at that is just continuing to look at the order book as we ended the quarter and how that continues to progress in terms of growth. Same thing as we think about those more emergent businesses, whether it's trauma or neurovascular, again, those businesses are continuing to perform very well, and there's no reason to believe that they're going to slow down we think about Q4. So hopefully, that helps for you.\nRobbie Marcus: And maybe one more just to dive in a little deeper on the Trauma & Extremities. You talked about double digit growth within shoulder, but that was probably the biggest miss of any business versus The Street. So I was hoping you could give a little more detail there, was lower really slow? It doesn't sound like it's anything from the integration. So just hoping to get more color.\nPreston Wells: No, I think it's important to understand that on those parts of the business like extremities, like shoulder, like foot and ankle, they are subject to some of the elective procedure slowdown as well. So while they did see some of that impact, we're still really happy with how they performed. I mean they really are still growing. The integration is going well. And as I mentioned, in terms of the international piece, there's a little bit slower pickup there on some of the international businesses as we go through the transition and integration in those parts of the business.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic.\nMatt Miksic: So I had maybe first thing, I guess, I would say is at this point, I don't think your comments on COVID related pressure and staffing challenges will come as much of a surprise to many folks who were sort of tracking this into the print and looking into Q4. But I did have a couple of questions on some aspects of your business. One, sort of COVID related and sort of related to one of your sort of strategic initiatives around ASCs. If you could talk maybe a little bit about the activity that you're seeing there, what kinds of changes you made to your organization, what kinds of shifts in volumes you've seen and how you think that may affect sort of the intermediate term for those businesses? And I have one follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: We're continuing to see a shift to the ASC. The challenge we have right now is just the pace. So the capacity takes time to build, and every hospital system is in the process of trying to increase their capacity. So it is improving. And certainly, that will be a trend that had started prior to the pandemic and is continuing. We feel very good about our position in the ASC. It's way ahead of our expectations, frankly, going into the pandemic. One measure that we look at is our Sports Medicine business, and that performed in the United States was north of 20% growth in Q3. So we're seeing strength, but the challenge on the hip and knee side of it is just time to build capacity. So it's growing but it's going to just take time before it becomes a really, really meaningful part of our business. But we believe we're extremely well positioned both with Mako and even without Mako, with our portfolio of everything that they need for an ASC.\nMatt Miksic: And then my follow-up is just on maybe trying to look past the pressure that I think many folks are reporting this earnings cycle similar to what you're describing and into sort of next year, and I'm not sort of about to try to provide guidance out of you or anything like that for 2022. But one of the things that we hear often from your businesses and across the board is this sort of demand for capital equipment and if we look at challenges and procedures and staffing issues. And then on the other hand, hospitals, apparently investing fairly heavily in their capital equipment and infrastructure around robotic surgery, et cetera. And I just would love to hear your thoughts on if you see a relationship that’s seen in the past relationship between capital and your procedural businesses and what that sort of tells you about the next 12 to 18 months on the back of this demand?\nPreston Wells: Well, I think the capital strength has really given the liquidity of hospitals. So hospitals, even though they're struggling through the pandemic, their liquidity is very good, partially due to the CARES funding that was put in place. They're in strong position and they are getting ready for the future. As we talked about on the last question about ASCs and construction of ASCs and investments in hospitals, the demand for technology is very strong. Our order book for capital is very strong. And there in fact, in Q3, there was actually even some slight delays of some of the capital. There were some challenges of actually having staff to receive some of the capital equipment and put it in place. But I would say I'm feeling very bullish and that capital cycle should continue speaking in the United States through all of next year. As it relates to the deferrable procedures, hips, knees, spine, those represent for Stryker a little less than 30% of our sales. And those are the ones that are most impacted. They will come back. And frankly, I'm excited about certainly hip and knee where the Mako volume continues to grow. And when those procedures come back, we're in a terrific position to capitalize on those because the Mako procedures we're putting in, roughly half of those are going into competitive accounts. And so when volumes come back, we will be able to really take advantage of that, not just in our own Stryker friendly accounts, but even in competitive accounts.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.\nAnthony Petrone: A couple on just attempting to quantify the backlog specifically in OrthoRecon heading into 2022 as we navigate the current Delta spike and maybe extending that to capital? Are you actually seeing some level of pent-up demand for Mako? And maybe just to sneak a quick one in there. Maybe just some high-level comments on supply chain pressures that we're hearing across obviously, this space and others. Is that a potential headwind to the capital business specifically as we head into 2022?\nPreston Wells: So let me see if I can address those different parts. So in terms of the backlog itself, and so just starting with the implant related backlog. I mean, obviously, the last 18 months has not been normal from a volume perspective. And so while we've had some good quarters and some slower quarters, that backlog has continued to exist. And in some cases, like this quarter, it's continued to build. And so it's hard to say exactly what it is because there's just so much variability that's happening across different regions. So if we look at this past quarter, obviously, the US was more impacted than other areas. But it's safe to say that the backlog still exists. And as we think about what's going to happen with that, we think that over time, as we get back to more normal levels, that backlog will begin to work down. And so you'll see some improvement in terms of growth rates over time that will be sustained. You won't really see a big large outsized growth rate that will happen in any one particular quarter with regards to the backlog. As we think about capital, I mean, there are areas for sure that there's been some pent-up demand and some of the uncertainty has just existed out there in terms of some of the hospital systems. But we're still seeing very strong demand for our products, like we talked about before. The order book remains really, really strong and it continues to grow as well as sales. So we feel very bullish, as Kevin said, with regards to how we think about capital as we go forward into 2022. With regards to the impacts from a raw material or supply chain perspective what I would tell you is there certainly are challenges just like everybody else has with regards to whether it's the tight labor market or shortages in things like electronics or resins. But as of now, we've been able to really effectively meet all of our customer needs. And so what that really has required is that our supply chain has really had to be much more active and its support in its partnership with the various supplier base that we have. And so we've been able to really make sure that we're maintaining our safety stock levels. We're really able to actively purchase critical components where necessary so that we can keep production going. And then also just around the logistics and distribution as well and working actively with those partners, all of that in anticipation of the fact that we think that there's going to continue to be some headwinds in this area. And so as a result, we have seen some increased costs as well in terms of inflation on those items. But to date, our supply chain and procurement teams have really just been able to manage that. And so we haven't seen anything really show up in terms of any major impacts on our financials. And so while we expect that to continue into the rest of '21 and into 2022 as well, we want to make sure that whatever we have in our numbers has already been factored in some of those raw material challenges that we have. And we're going to just continue to monitor the situation as it progresses.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS.\nYoung Lee: This is Young Lee in for Matt. I guess I was wondering if you can share a little bit more color on the strength you're seeing in Mako, both in the US and OUS. How do you think it's positioned relative to the competition now that there's more entrants in the space? And can you also touch upon the Mako shoulder program? What should we expect in terms of the target that you are looking at, and any updates on time lines?\nPreston Wells: So the Mako business momentum continues and it's been strong throughout the pandemic. So in spite of the procedural slowdowns, we're seeing strong demand for our system. We clearly have the leading system on the market with a big head start versus the competition. And frankly, the competition is actually raised the water level of robotics and raised the importance of robotics. So we love our position. And we believe that it's just going to increase the demand for Mako. More and more systems are ordering their second and third and fourth Mako. So we know we have a winning solution for customers. We're very excited, frankly, with our hip software and our new hip application, which is now penetrated in all of our Mako accounts, and we're seeing a nice uptick. Even though the overall volumes are down because of COVID, we are seeing a nice uptick in the hip adoption given the new software, which makes it easier to do the procedure. So we feel like we're in a very good position. And the fact that there's more competitors to the space just validates the importance of orthopedics, and we like our chances. As it relates to the shoulder program, we do have an active program. We're not in a position right now to talk about time lines or dates for that. But as you saw with our results in Q3, our shoulder business is doing very well even before we have a solution with Mako.\nYoung Lee: I guess maybe to follow up, I was wondering if you can talk about the M&A landscape. How actively are you looking at deals? What do you think about current valuations right now?\nPreston Wells: We are always actively looking at deals at Stryker. Even after the Wright Medical deal, as you saw, we've done a couple of smaller deals with Orthosensor and Gauss Surgical. Because of the debt that we've had to pay down, we've been focused more on tuck-ins. But I'm really delighted with the cash flow performance that we've had, both last year as well as the first nine months of this year. So now we can start to look at, let's say, slightly larger tuck-ins while we continue to pay down the debt. Valuations are very high overall, but there's still a lot of targets. And we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to continue to run our M&A and offense and find value-creating acquisitions for sure, for Stryker.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nDrew Stafford: This is Drew on for Matt. I just was wondering if you could talk about Mako in China and Japan. You said kind of bring spot in some areas and a mixed bag in others for a handful of companies that have reported so far. So just wondering how you would characterize that rollout in each of those geographies?\nPreston Wells: So I would just say that in terms of Mako as we think about outside the United States, we're really pleased with how that's progressing, and we're seeing good growth really in all markets outside the US. As we think about Japan, for example, we know that the business continues to progress well and the number of installs in Japan is increasing month-over-month. So we're really happy with how the technology has been received and the feedback that we're getting, and the number of procedures that are being done on Mako and Japan continue to increase as well. As far as China is concerned, it's much earlier days in China from a Mako standpoint, but the momentum is really building there. We're still working through the impacts of the volume based procurement activity. But we do expect Mako to be a key technology and play a key role for us as we think about our rebound business in China going forward.\nDrew Stafford: And then just a quick follow-up here on the Neurovascular side. The performance has been really, really strong in the last couple of quarters. So maybe you can kind of give us a sense for what you think the market growth rate looks like there? And then just a sense of what's driving your portfolio of products to really take share compared to quarters in the past.\nPreston Wells: So in terms of Neurovascular, obviously, it's a very hot market. But also when you look at our results with regards to that market, you're seeing a couple of things happen. You're seeing really impact of the technologies that we've been able to introduce over the past probably 12 to 18 months and taking advantage of really a product super cycle really from our neurovascular team where we're expanding into some different areas and then also, we're seeing the market expand. So if you think about places like China, for example, we're seeing market expansion happen there. So our results are really a result of both of those items.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Maybe one on the big picture and one on the finance side. Starting with the big picture. Kevin, it seems like there's a tale of two cities in device. And some of your peers have assumed Q4 sort of normalizing on the procedure side. Other companies certainly have called out Q4 being in line with 3Q levels and things worsening, or perhaps being similar to September trends. Is this more regional, is this a basinal impact, or is this an ortho versus other parts of the life science? Maybe just put things into perspective on why we're seeing a divergence and what are you assuming for the Q4 recovery?\nKevin Lobo: As Preston mentioned, Q4, we're assuming a similar growth rate as we saw in Q3, so versus 2019 we're expecting similar kind of growth rate. Obviously, sequentially, we'll have an improvement because Q4 is a larger quarter than Q3. But year-over-year, we're expecting a similar growth rate. Related to that question, I would say that it's really ortho and spine related that's the bigger factor. So we have products that are used in general surgery and our Endoscopy division and smoke evacuation, and we're not seeing the same kind of fall off in those areas as we're seeing in hips and spine. So I do believe it's mostly procedure related, which creates the difference that you're describing between us and some of the other med tech companies. There's also regional. Stryker, of course, has a very strong presence in the United States. And so that regional impact -- you even saw that with our own implant businesses that we had a more negative impact in the United States than we did in international. And so that's the secondary factor. But I would say the primary factor for what you're seeing versus other companies is that these procedures, hip, knee and spine are more deferrable than some of the other procedures in some of our other med tech peers.\nVijay Kumar: And one on finance, Glenn, free cash conversion year-to-date, we're running pretty close to 90%. Has something changed here? I know people used to ask on free cash conversion, but just really an execution here despite some choppiness on the pandemic side, the margin execution, free cash execution here seems to be stellar. So I'm curious, has anything changed for you guys on the free cash side?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Vijay, you're right, free cash flow of almost $2.1 billion year-to-date, an 87% conversion ratio, a lot of it has to do with several factors. We've been sort of priming the organization to really start focusing and delivering on cash flow. I think as we entered into COVID, it was a real alarm bell for, hey, let's really start focusing on this so that we can sort of keep active in M&A. We can pay down debt, we can meet a lot of the sort of goals that we wanted to meet. So I think we're feeling a little bit of that. You look at performance on AR, we've started to move a lot of our AR into shared service centers and so we're getting better on process. If you look at AP, we have a large initiative that's being driven by our GQO organization in terms of working with vendors and being smart about what our AP terms can be and should be. And then all of our divisions are very focused on inventory management and just being smarter about what are the safety stock levels that you really need and what don't you need, and how can we make sure that we're having the right inventory at the right time when we need it. And then I think the other thing that we're feeling a little bit is we have been fairly controlled and prudent as we look at allocating dollars to capital expenditures. And as you look at our Wright Medical integration, we've really been focused on that spend as well and are running probably a little ahead of where our goals were on that. So I really do think that it's a muscle that the organization has really learned and has grown over the past two years and it's something that I feel pretty strongly about we'll be able to continue from here on out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJosh Jennings: Just a question on staffing shortages and maybe a little bit granular, but just thinking about the different settings of care and staff shortages in hospitals, I think it's clear, but just wondering about ASCs. Is there a different dynamic in play at ASCs? And if the staffing shortage headwind persist into 2022, do you think we can see even stronger migration trends of both surgeries into the ASPs, particularly in ortho?\nPreston Wells: In terms of staffing shortages, I mean we're seeing it really holistically. I mean, I think it certainly is playing itself out more so in the hospital setting because obviously, there's a lot more fatigue that's been there, there's COVID that still exists in the hospital setting. So I think that it certainly is playing out a bit more in the hospital setting, and we haven't -- we've still seen our procedural volumes in the ASP continue to go and certainly have not been as impacted as those in the hospital. How that continues and how that impacts the shift, I think, is still really anybody's guess. I mean we certainly will continue to expect to see products and procedures shifting to the ASC anyway because that trend that's already started and certainly accelerated over the last 18 months. So I think that's going to continue to happen. The staffing shortage is something that I think we're going to live with for a little bit as well. And so we'll continue to work through those challenges in the next year also.\nJosh Jennings: I want to just have a follow-up on Red. I know you reiterated multiple time on this call, just integration is progressing nicely and you're optimistic about the combined businesses in Trauma & Extremities. But you've had to work through some dis-synergies associated with the integration of the pandemic headwinds at November close is coming up. But as we get into normalized period, should we be thinking about the Trauma business as accretive to corporate wide organic revenue growth as that integration is first year is complete and hopefully, we get into normalized grades in 2022?\nKevin Lobo: I would say that I'm absolutely bullish about the Wright medical integration. It's been fantastic in the United States. As Preston mentioned, we still have work to do outside the United States. The timing is a little bit later with some of the conversions of our distributors. And so we're still working through with OUS. But in the US, very bullish about core trauma, upper extremities and lower. Now lower, of course, has been impacted somewhat by the deferral of procedures because they're more elective, a lot of the foot and ankle procedures. But love the leadership team that we have in place, love the pipeline that we have in place and really believe that the entire business of trauma extremities will be accretive to overall Stryker. As you know, Extremities is probably the fastest growing space within Orthopaedics. And we have a fantastic portfolio, a combined portfolio in both upper and lower extremities. But I think one of the side benefits of the Wright Medical integration has been for us to also have a dedicated business just on trauma. So three dedicated businesses, three terrific leaders of all businesses and great leadership teams. And so we're seeing that, frankly, as you saw with the US number on a combined basis being over 8% is really a terrific performance in spite of a slowdown in the foot and ankle space, the overall business is performing very well. And I do expect in '22 and beyond that it will be accretive to Stryker's overall growth rate. Operator?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Two for me. One, you have an analyst meeting coming up in a few weeks. Could you guys give us a preview of what to expect, are you going to give us long-term financial goals? And I have one follow-up.\nPreston Wells: We're really going to really talk about all the growth drivers that make Stryker special. As we think about emerging from the pandemic and all the different things that are going to help our business continue to grow into the future for sure. The long term financial goals will definitely be part of that.\nLarry Biegelsen: And I know you're not going to talk specific guidance about next year. But Kevin or Glenn, how are you feeling about continuing to deliver top tier revenue growth and the 30 to 50 basis points of leverage that you guys target? How are you feeling about that with the inflation headwinds that we're all paying close attention to?\nPreston Wells: On the first question, as you've seen over the last nine years and fully expect into the future that we will have organic sales growth at the high end of med tech. Clearly, COVID has put a crimp on that in hips, knees and spine. But other than that, you're seeing that in all of the rest of our businesses. And as the recovery happens, you should fully expect that we'll continue to be a top tier grower. As it relates to margins, Glenn, do you want to?\nGlenn Boehnlein: As I look at op margin, first off, I even just look at this quarter and given the impact of COVID, given the dilution from Wright Medical, I mean we're pretty happy that our op margin is pretty much flat with 2019. So that's a good performance. We did not contemplate the impacts we're feeling from COVID in op margin guidance. And so we'll talk about more at the analyst meeting sort of what we think that means. But what I will tell you is we have every intention to drive that goal once we exit the impacts of COVID. So the organization will not back away from that. And even during COVID, we're very mindful of our discipline around spending and how important that is. So we'll expect to see some increases in spending probably in Q4 and those will set us up to grow in 2022. So we really will allow sort of spending around some of those sales force hiring and marketing initiatives to occur. But as far as it relates to 30 to 50 basis points beyond what we feel in COVID, we will not back away from that goal.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is David on for Steve. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about what you're seeing currently in terms of the China tenders and volume based procurement and what are your expectations for the impact of that next year?\nPreston Wells: So I guess, first of all, when we start thinking about our business and we think about China and we think about the products and services that are impacted by the volume based tendering, if we think about JR, trauma and spine, those sales really are that are exposed to the tendering process are less than 1% of the total Stryker revenue. So it's a very small overall impact as we think about for Stryker. But I guess, just focusing on the tender itself, in mid-September, as everybody knows, the bidding was done for the national tender around joint replacements. Our bids were certainly competitive and we secured a position for both hips and knees for our business. Overall, as everybody also knows about 80% price reduction from the end market sale is going to be taking place across the entire industry. And so certainly, that has an impact on us as we think about going forward, but there's a lot of work still left to be done in terms of how that's going to actually be executed. So we're staying vigilant with the teams in China to try to understand how that's going to roll out. It's expected to roll out, I think, in the first quarter of next year. And so it will remain dynamic until we really understand how it's going to execute. In terms of '22, we're not giving guidance at this point in time and it will certainly be factored in as we give guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just one follow-up. What are your latest thoughts on the smart implants? And what's your outlook for this market now having OrthoSensor under your umbrella for several quarters?\nPreston Wells: So with smart implants, I mean, like we've said in the past, we think that there's a role that smart implants are going to play with regards to orthopedics going forward. But there's still a lot of work to be done in terms of understanding how that's going to be integrated from an implant and then understanding how that's going to play out from a monitoring standpoint going forward. So I would say it's still early in the process. We're happy to have OrthoSensor under the Stryker name and certainly the expertise that they bring in the sensor technology. And so looking forward to updating you as we develop more around that product in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: So I just want to ask specifically based on the organic growth guidance of 7% to 8% versus ‘19 and kind of where consensus is landing. Obviously, there's a delta there. And you've already -- it's clear, obviously, around the elective areas in terms of the impact in the fourth quarter and kind of what you're guiding to. I guess I'm just curious, Kevin or Preston, is there anything to call out, particularly within the MedSurg areas from a headwind standpoint that you'd caution us about? Just because the delta versus The Street is somewhat meaningful as we think about our models. And so I just want to make sure that we're not skipping over any impact that you could be -- have us contemplate within that?\nKevin Lobo: Just to reiterate what I said in my opening comments. We expect very high performance for MedSurg and Neurotechnology. So we expect them to perform very similarly. It may not be -- some puts and takes between the businesses a little bit. But overall, you should expect similar growth out of MedSurg and Neurotechnology in Q4, as you saw in Q3. So the delta versus The Street is clearly in the hip, knee and spine area. That's the area that's had the biggest impact from COVID. And what we're calling in our guidance is for a similar quarter in Q4 as Q3. Now obviously, we don't have a lot of visibility. It's an uncertain environment. Hopefully, the recovery will be better than what we're calling, but that's the visibility that we have thus far. And as you saw that this quarter surprised us Q3 and we're being cautious as we give our guidance for Q4.\nRyan Zimmerman: And then just a follow-up. You have a new hip stem coming out. You've got the software now, I think, on the entire fleet of Mako. And so I'd love to understand just kind of your expectation on what [Technical Difficulty] for you, particularly within direct interiors that J&J has been so dominant in for some time?\nKevin Lobo: We're really excited about the new STEM. The procedures are being launched this quarter -- early launch, I'd call it, this quarter. And we're building up towards a full launch of the hip stem at the AAOS meeting, which is towards the end of the first quarter. So it will be a bit of a slow build but we're really excited, and that stem we will marry that stem up with Mako. So that's one of the things we still have to do that. But I would say you'll start to see pretty meaningful impact probably by the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter, you'll start to see meaningful impact. But this is a product gap that we've had for some time. Very excited about the position that we're in. We're building the product right now. Surgeons who have seen the product are very excited about it. So we do believe it's what we've needed frankly, within our hip portfolio. And you'll start to see that again. You won't see a lot -- you won't see anything really in the fourth quarter, and you won't see much in the first quarter, but it will start to have an impact in the second quarter and definitely in the back half of next year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: So thank you all for joining our call. And we hope that you can all join us in person on November 18th for our 2021 Analyst Meeting and product fair with our broader leadership team. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Lobo",
            "content": "Thank you. Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 8.4% versus 2019, driven by excellent double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, but this was offset by softer sales of hip, knee and spine due to the resurgence of COVID-19. A slowdown in deferrable procedures primarily impacted the US and worsened through the quarter. While our implant businesses were challenged, we saw strong results for our Mako product technology and capital products across our MedSurg portfolio. In addition, we had strong performances from our more emergent businesses, including our core trauma business and another standout performance by Neurovascular. International organic growth of 12%, again, outpaced growth in the US, representing robust performances and lessening impacts of COVID-19 across most major geographies, including strong results across Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets. Our year-to-date organic growth is 7.6%. And with the continued uncertainty related to COVID recovery as well as health care staffing shortages, we are updating our full year organic sales growth guidance to 7% to 8% compared to 2019. Our capital equipment order book remains strong, and we are well positioned for the eventual procedure recovery. Our adjusted EPS grew 15% versus 2019, and we continued our focus on driving cash flow, leading to a year-to-date cash conversion of 87%. The EPS growth, although solid, was lower than our expectations and is reflected in our updated guidance, which Glenn will elaborate on. Meanwhile, we are pleased with our cash flow performance, which provides us with additional flexibility for future M&A opportunities. While the quarter did not progress as we had anticipated due to the Delta variant, we remain confident in the outlook for our businesses as evidenced by our strong international MedSurg and Neurotechnology performances. We expect these businesses to continue to perform at high levels with the uncertainty most concentrated in deferrable procedures in the United States. We continue to feel bullish about our longer-term prospects as the pandemic recedes with our proven strategy and strong fundamentals. We are excited to share more with you at our upcoming Analyst Day on November 18th. I will now turn the call over to Preston. We're continuing to see a shift to the ASC. The challenge we have right now is just the pace. So the capacity takes time to build, and every hospital system is in the process of trying to increase their capacity. So it is improving. And certainly, that will be a trend that had started prior to the pandemic and is continuing. We feel very good about our position in the ASC. It's way ahead of our expectations, frankly, going into the pandemic. One measure that we look at is our Sports Medicine business, and that performed in the United States was north of 20% growth in Q3. So we're seeing strength, but the challenge on the hip and knee side of it is just time to build capacity. So it's growing but it's going to just take time before it becomes a really, really meaningful part of our business. But we believe we're extremely well positioned both with Mako and even without Mako, with our portfolio of everything that they need for an ASC. As Preston mentioned, Q4, we're assuming a similar growth rate as we saw in Q3, so versus 2019 we're expecting similar kind of growth rate. Obviously, sequentially, we'll have an improvement because Q4 is a larger quarter than Q3. But year-over-year, we're expecting a similar growth rate. Related to that question, I would say that it's really ortho and spine related that's the bigger factor. So we have products that are used in general surgery and our Endoscopy division and smoke evacuation, and we're not seeing the same kind of fall off in those areas as we're seeing in hips and spine. So I do believe it's mostly procedure related, which creates the difference that you're describing between us and some of the other med tech companies. There's also regional. Stryker, of course, has a very strong presence in the United States. And so that regional impact -- you even saw that with our own implant businesses that we had a more negative impact in the United States than we did in international. And so that's the secondary factor. But I would say the primary factor for what you're seeing versus other companies is that these procedures, hip, knee and spine are more deferrable than some of the other procedures in some of our other med tech peers. I would say that I'm absolutely bullish about the Wright medical integration. It's been fantastic in the United States. As Preston mentioned, we still have work to do outside the United States.

But overall, you should expect similar growth out of MedSurg and Neurotechnology in Q4, as you saw in Q3. So the delta versus The Street is clearly in the hip, knee and spine area. That's the area that's had the biggest impact from COVID. And what we're calling in our guidance is for a similar quarter in Q4 as Q3. Now obviously, we don't have a lot of visibility. It's an uncertain environment. Hopefully, the recovery will be better than what we're calling, but that's the visibility that we have thus far.

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our organic sales growth was 8.4% in the quarter. The third quarter included the same number of average selling days as Q3 2019 and Q3 2020. Compared to 2019, the two year impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 2.2%. Versus Q3 2020, pricing was 0.7% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales. Our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses saw another very strong quarter, continuing the growth momentum of the second quarter with double digit growth in both segments. Our Orthopedics and Spine businesses have been adversely impacted by increases in hospitalization rates starting in early August, especially in the US as a result of the Delta variant. The corresponding impact on elective procedures has significantly slowed the recovery in our Orthopedics and Spine implant businesses. For the quarter, US organic sales increased 7.1%, reflecting the continued strong demand for Mako, instruments, medical and neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 12%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.20 increased 15.2% from 2019, reflecting sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower quarterly effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix and higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition. Our third quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 19.9% and organic sales growth of 2%, including organic growth of 1% in the US. This reflects the impact of the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the Delta variant, which primarily impacted our hip and knee implant businesses. Our knee business grew 0.9% organically in the US, reflecting the previously mentioned impact on elective procedures, offset by continued adoption of our robotic platform for total knee procedures. Our US trauma business grew 8.8%, reflecting solid performances across the portfolio. Other ortho grew 19.8% in the US, primarily reflecting demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 4.1% organically, which reflects the strong performances in Europe and the momentum in Mako internationally, somewhat offset by the increased impact of restrictions imposed on elective procedures due to COVID, especially in Japan. For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business, which includes Writer Medical delivered 3.2% growth on a comparable basis. In the US, comparable growth was 7.4%, which included double digital growth in our upper extremities business. In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 12%, ,which included 12% US organic growth as well. Instruments had US organic sales growth of 15.9%, led by double digit growth in their orthopedic implants and surgical technology businesses, which include power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and skin closure products. Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 10.6%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including video and general surgery products and strong double digit growth of their communications and sports medicine businesses. The Medical division had US organic growth of 12.5%, reflecting double-digit performances in its emergency care and Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 12%, reflecting strong growth in the Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical businesses across Europe and Australia. Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 11.8%. This growth reflects double digit performances in our neurovascular, neurosurgical and interventional spine businesses. Our Neurovascular business had particularly strong growth of approximately 26% and makes up roughly 30% of this segment. Our US Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 11.8%, reflecting strong product growth in Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps and Bone Mill. Our US Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of products, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 24.6%. This performance was driven by strong neurotech demand in China and other emerging markets as well as Europe and Australia. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was favorable approximately 55 basis points from third quarter 2019. Compared to the third quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by acquisitions, which was partially offset by business mix and price. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.7% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our SG&A was 34.1% of sales, which was slightly negative as compared to the third quarter of 2019. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by ramping of certain expenses, hiring to support future growth and the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.4% of sales, which is approximately the same as third quarter 2019. This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum, offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, primarily Wright Medical. Related to other income and expenses compared to the third quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14%, which was impacted by our mix of US, non-US income and favorable discrete items during the quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 14.8%. For the year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. Year-to-date, we have paid down $1.2 billion of debt. In October, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and increased that facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $2.3 billion. This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Based on our performance in the third quarter, the continued volatility experienced as a result of COVID, procedural delays in hospital staffing shortages as well as uncertainty around the pace of recovery in the fourth quarter, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8%. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be in the mid single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year and this is included in our revised guidance range. Based on our performance in the first nine months and including consideration of the aforementioned volatility impacting the recovery of elective procedures and the full year Wright Medical impact, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.08 to $9.15. And now I will open the call for Q&A. Vijay, you're right, free cash flow of almost $2.1 billion year-to-date, an 87% conversion ratio, a lot of it has to do with several factors. We've been sort of priming the organization to really start focusing and delivering on cash flow. I think as we entered into COVID, it was a real alarm bell for, hey, let's really start focusing on this so that we can sort of keep active in M&A. We can pay down debt, we can meet a lot of the sort of goals that we wanted to meet. So I think we're feeling a little bit of that. You look at performance on AR, we've started to move a lot of our AR into shared service centers and so we're getting better on process. If you look at AP, we have a large initiative that's being driven by our GQO organization in terms of working with vendors and being smart about what our AP terms can be and should be. And then all of our divisions are very focused on inventory management and just being smarter about what are the safety stock levels that you really need and what don't you need, and how can we make sure that we're having the right inventory at the right time when we need it. And then I think the other thing that we're feeling a little bit is we have been fairly controlled and prudent as we look at allocating dollars to capital expenditures. And as you look at our Wright Medical integration, we've really been focused on that spend as well and are running probably a little ahead of where our goals were on that. So I really do think that it's a muscle that the organization has really learned and has grown over the past two years and it's something that I feel pretty strongly about we'll be able to continue from here on out. As I look at op margin, first off, I even just look at this quarter and given the impact of COVID, given the dilution from Wright Medical, I mean we're pretty happy that our op margin is pretty much flat with 2019. So that's a good performance. We did not contemplate the impacts we're feeling from COVID in op margin guidance. And so we'll talk about more at the analyst meeting sort of what we think that means. But what I will tell you is we have every intention to drive that goal once we exit the impacts of COVID. So the organization will not back away from that. And even during COVID, we're very mindful of our discipline around spending and how important that is. So we'll expect to see some increases in spending probably in Q4 and those will set us up to grow in 2022. So we really will allow sort of spending around some of those sales force hiring and marketing initiatives to occur. But as far as it relates to 30 to 50 basis points beyond what we feel in COVID, we will not back away from that goal."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment, including how certain products and geographies performed during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the continued integration of Wright Medical, including the performance of our combined trauma and extremities business. During the quarter, significant spikes of the COVID-19 Delta variant drove increased infections and hospitalizations that require higher hospital bed utilization, which ultimately led to the deferral of elective procedures. In addition to increased hospitalization, hospital staffing shortages also pressured procedural volumes throughout the quarter. This primarily impacted our implant-related businesses including hips, knees and spine, which can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. However, the disease states that we treat are degenerative and the patients that defer their procedures will eventually return to have those procedures completed. The impact on elective procedures was more pronounced in the United States than on other geographies outside the United States. Within the United States, there were areas of disruption in most states but disruption was more widespread in the Southeast and Southwest portions of the country, impacting major markets like Florida and Texas throughout the quarter. Other markets around the world, including China, Japan and Australia experienced intermittent lockdowns throughout the quarter, which also drove uneven results across our implant-related businesses in those markets. During the quarter, Europe, which was more impacted by COVID in previous quarters, had impressive organic growth compared to 2019. COVID related hospitalizations in the United States began to trend upwards towards the end of July and then progressively worsened peaking at beginning of September. At the end of the quarter, infection and hospitalization rates were declining in impacted regions and has continued into October. As a result, we are beginning to see some improvements in our more impacted businesses through the first few weeks of October. However, we expect the recovery will be partially muted by discontinued hospital staffing challenges and ongoing COVID related volatility. Our assumption for the fourth quarter is that deferrable procedures will gradually return, starting with a low base in October before returning to more normal levels by the end of the quarter. As a result, we expect that the fourth quarter growth rates for our more deferrable businesses will be similar to the third quarter. Despite the ongoing challenges with elective procedures, we had strong performances in our more emerging businesses like Neurovascular, which grew strong double digits compared to 2019 as a result of continued market expansion and ongoing global demand for our innovative technologies. In addition, demand for our capital equipment remains healthy as evidenced by our continued strong sales performance and robust order book for small and large capital products, including our surgical technologies, emergency care and neurosurgical businesses. The ongoing strength in capital is also reflected in the continued demand for our Mako robotic technology. Our industry-leading Mako robot continues to help surgeons improve patient outcomes by knowing more and cutting less. This trend across capital is expected to continue as hospitals take advantage of flexible financing and prioritize capital products like those within our portfolio that are critical to providing emergency care, driving profitable procedures and ensuring safe working environments for caregivers and patients. Turning to the Wright Medical integration, which continues to progress in all regions and functions. United States commercial integration has moved past the sales force realignment and is now focused on continued business process improvements and system efficiencies. The teams have also developed long term product pipeline strategy. Outside the United States, we continue to work through integration activities, including sales force and indirect channel alignment across all key geographic regions. Overall, we remain pleased with the progress and the pace of integration over the past year. Including Wright Medical, the combined US Trauma and Extremities business has grown 8.1% year-to-date. The year-to-date growth in the United States has been driven by strong double digit growth in both our core trauma and upper extremities businesses, reflecting the execution of the sales integration in the United States. Outside the United States, sales have declined 3.8% year-to-date, driven by timing of distributor conversions in Latin America and Asia Pacific and declines in our legacy Trauson and Trauma business in China as a result of the provincial tendering process. Considering the latest results, ongoing COVID related volatility and the provincial tenders in China, we now expect our combined Trauma and Extremities business to grow mid single digits for the full year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. So in terms of Q4, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw October starting to show some improvement as it relates to our implant related businesses. And so we are seeing a bit of a pickup, but I think it's important to note that it's starting from a lower starting point. So while we do expect there to be some recovery happening in those implant businesses throughout the quarter, we do expect it to get back to more normal levels by the end. There are a few headwinds that are out there as well in terms of not only additional COVID hotspots or things like that, but also with staffing being a potential headwind as well. So we're definitely monitoring those as we go. But we are seeing some improvement early in October versus where we ended in Q3. As it relates to the other parts of the business, as both Kevin, Glenn and myself mentioned, our capital business continues to perform very well, and we still have high expectations that those are going to continue into Q4, really and the way we look at that is just continuing to look at the order book as we ended the quarter and how that continues to progress in terms of growth. Same thing as we think about those more emergent businesses, whether it's trauma or neurovascular, again, those businesses are continuing to perform very well, and there's no reason to believe that they're going to slow down we think about Q4. So hopefully, that helps for you. No, I think it's important to understand that on those parts of the business like extremities, like shoulder, like foot and ankle, they are subject to some of the elective procedure slowdown as well. So while they did see some of that impact, we're still really happy with how they performed. I mean they really are still growing. The integration is going well. And as I mentioned, in terms of the international piece, there's a little bit slower pickup there on some of the international businesses as we go through the transition and integration in those parts of the business. Well, I think the capital strength has really given the liquidity of hospitals. So hospitals, even though they're struggling through the pandemic, their liquidity is very good, partially due to the CARES funding that was put in place. They're in strong position and they are getting ready for the future. As we talked about on the last question about ASCs and construction of ASCs and investments in hospitals, the demand for technology is very strong. Our order book for capital is very strong. And there in fact, in Q3, there was actually even some slight delays of some of the capital. There were some challenges of actually having staff to receive some of the capital equipment and put it in place. But I would say I'm feeling very bullish and that capital cycle should continue speaking in the United States through all of next year. As it relates to the deferrable procedures, hips, knees, spine, those represent for Stryker a little less than 30% of our sales. And those are the ones that are most impacted. They will come back. And frankly, I'm excited about certainly hip and knee where the Mako volume continues to grow. And when those procedures come back, we're in a terrific position to capitalize on those because the Mako procedures we're putting in, roughly half of those are going into competitive accounts. And so when volumes come back, we will be able to really take advantage of that, not just in our own Stryker friendly accounts, but even in competitive accounts. So let me see if I can address those different parts. So in terms of the backlog itself, and so just starting with the implant related backlog. I mean, obviously, the last 18 months has not been normal from a volume perspective. And so while we've had some good quarters and some slower quarters, that backlog has continued to exist. And in some cases, like this quarter, it's continued to build. And so it's hard to say exactly what it is because there's just so much variability that's happening across different regions. So if we look at this past quarter, obviously, the US was more impacted than other areas. But it's safe to say that the backlog still exists. And as we think about what's going to happen with that, we think that over time, as we get back to more normal levels, that backlog will begin to work down. And so you'll see some improvement in terms of growth rates over time that will be sustained. You won't really see a big large outsized growth rate that will happen in any one particular quarter with regards to the backlog. As we think about capital, I mean, there are areas for sure that there's been some pent-up demand and some of the uncertainty has just existed out there in terms of some of the hospital systems. But we're still seeing very strong demand for our products, like we talked about before. The order book remains really, really strong and it continues to grow as well as sales. So we feel very bullish, as Kevin said, with regards to how we think about capital as we go forward into 2022. With regards to the impacts from a raw material or supply chain perspective what I would tell you is there certainly are challenges just like everybody else has with regards to whether it's the tight labor market or shortages in things like electronics or resins. But as of now, we've been able to really effectively meet all of our customer needs. And so what that really has required is that our supply chain has really had to be much more active and its support in its partnership with the various supplier base that we have. And so we've been able to really make sure that we're maintaining our safety stock levels. We're really able to actively purchase critical components where necessary so that we can keep production going. And then also just around the logistics and distribution as well and working actively with those partners, all of that in anticipation of the fact that we think that there's going to continue to be some headwinds in this area. And so as a result, we have seen some increased costs as well in terms of inflation on those items. But to date, our supply chain and procurement teams have really just been able to manage that. And so we haven't seen anything really show up in terms of any major impacts on our financials. And so while we expect that to continue into the rest of '21 and into 2022 as well, we want to make sure that whatever we have in our numbers has already been factored in some of those raw material challenges that we have. And we're going to just continue to monitor the situation as it progresses. So the Mako business momentum continues and it's been strong throughout the pandemic. So in spite of the procedural slowdowns, we're seeing strong demand for our system. We clearly have the leading system on the market with a big head start versus the competition. And frankly, the competition is actually raised the water level of robotics and raised the importance of robotics. So we love our position. And we believe that it's just going to increase the demand for Mako. More and more systems are ordering their second and third and fourth Mako. So we know we have a winning solution for customers. We're very excited, frankly, with our hip software and our new hip application, which is now penetrated in all of our Mako accounts, and we're seeing a nice uptick. Even though the overall volumes are down because of COVID, we are seeing a nice uptick in the hip adoption given the new software, which makes it easier to do the procedure. So we feel like we're in a very good position. And the fact that there's more competitors to the space just validates the importance of orthopedics, and we like our chances. As it relates to the shoulder program, we do have an active program. We're not in a position right now to talk about time lines or dates for that. But as you saw with our results in Q3, our shoulder business is doing very well even before we have a solution with Mako. We are always actively looking at deals at Stryker. Even after the Wright Medical deal, as you saw, we've done a couple of smaller deals with Orthosensor and Gauss Surgical. Because of the debt that we've had to pay down, we've been focused more on tuck-ins. But I'm really delighted with the cash flow performance that we've had, both last year as well as the first nine months of this year. So now we can start to look at, let's say, slightly larger tuck-ins while we continue to pay down the debt. Valuations are very high overall, but there's still a lot of targets. And we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to continue to run our M&A and offense and find value-creating acquisitions for sure, for Stryker. So I would just say that in terms of Mako as we think about outside the United States, we're really pleased with how that's progressing, and we're seeing good growth really in all markets outside the US. As we think about Japan, for example, we know that the business continues to progress well and the number of installs in Japan is increasing month-over-month. So we're really happy with how the technology has been received and the feedback that we're getting, and the number of procedures that are being done on Mako and Japan continue to increase as well. As far as China is concerned, it's much earlier days in China from a Mako standpoint, but the momentum is really building there. We're still working through the impacts of the volume based procurement activity. But we do expect Mako to be a key technology and play a key role for us as we think about our rebound business in China going forward. So in terms of Neurovascular, obviously, it's a very hot market. But also when you look at our results with regards to that market, you're seeing a couple of things happen. You're seeing really impact of the technologies that we've been able to introduce over the past probably 12 to 18 months and taking advantage of really a product super cycle really from our neurovascular team where we're expanding into some different areas and then also, we're seeing the market expand. So if you think about places like China, for example, we're seeing market expansion happen there. So our results are really a result of both of those items. In terms of staffing shortages, I mean we're seeing it really holistically. I mean, I think it certainly is playing itself out more so in the hospital setting because obviously, there's a lot more fatigue that's been there, there's COVID that still exists in the hospital setting. So I think that it certainly is playing out a bit more in the hospital setting, and we haven't -- we've still seen our procedural volumes in the ASP continue to go and certainly have not been as impacted as those in the hospital. How that continues and how that impacts the shift, I think, is still really anybody's guess. I mean we certainly will continue to expect to see products and procedures shifting to the ASC anyway because that trend that's already started and certainly accelerated over the last 18 months. So I think that's going to continue to happen. The staffing shortage is something that I think we're going to live with for a little bit as well. And so we'll continue to work through those challenges in the next year also. We're really going to really talk about all the growth drivers that make Stryker special. As we think about emerging from the pandemic and all the different things that are going to help our business continue to grow into the future for sure. The long term financial goals will definitely be part of that. On the first question, as you've seen over the last nine years and fully expect into the future that we will have organic sales growth at the high end of med tech. Clearly, COVID has put a crimp on that in hips, knees and spine. But other than that, you're seeing that in all of the rest of our businesses. And as the recovery happens, you should fully expect that we'll continue to be a top tier grower. As it relates to margins, Glenn, do you want to? So I guess, first of all, when we start thinking about our business and we think about China and we think about the products and services that are impacted by the volume based tendering, if we think about JR, trauma and spine, those sales really are that are exposed to the tendering process are less than 1% of the total Stryker revenue. So it's a very small overall impact as we think about for Stryker. But I guess, just focusing on the tender itself, in mid-September, as everybody knows, the bidding was done for the national tender around joint replacements. Our bids were certainly competitive and we secured a position for both hips and knees for our business. Overall, as everybody also knows about 80% price reduction from the end market sale is going to be taking place across the entire industry. And so certainly, that has an impact on us as we think about going forward, but there's a lot of work still left to be done in terms of how that's going to actually be executed. So we're staying vigilant with the teams in China to try to understand how that's going to roll out. It's expected to roll out, I think, in the first quarter of next year. And so it will remain dynamic until we really understand how it's going to execute. In terms of '22, we're not giving guidance at this point in time and it will certainly be factored in as we give guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. So with smart implants, I mean, like we've said in the past, we think that there's a role that smart implants are going to play with regards to orthopedics going forward. But there's still a lot of work to be done in terms of understanding how that's going to be integrated from an implant and then understanding how that's going to play out from a monitoring standpoint going forward. So I would say it's still early in the process. We're happy to have OrthoSensor under the Stryker name and certainly the expertise that they bring in the sensor technology. And so looking forward to updating you as we develop more around that product in the future."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical integration. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. Please note that our press release contains our results versus both 2020 and 2019. For this call, our commentary will be based on our performance versus 2019, which we believe provides a more relevant point of comparison. For the quarter we posted organic sales growth of 9.3% reflecting growth versus 2019 for all our major businesses. This strong result was driven by standout performances from neurovascular, Mako, emergency care, sports medicine and our U.S. shoulder and total ankle products. Each of these posted very strong double-digit growth. International organic growth outpaced the U.S. 14.2% despite COVID challenges in some countries. We posted double-digit growth in most regions, including excellent results in South Pacific, China, Canada, South Korea and many countries in Western Europe. We were also pleased to see the continued rebound in elective procedures as both hips and knees saw quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement and both returned to growth. Also now that we have a fuller appreciation of Wright Medical, we are delighted to have it within the Stryker family. With our first half organic growth of 7.1% combined with continued recovery of elective procedures, a strong order book across our capital businesses and new product innovations, we have increased confidence in the full-year outlook. This is reflected in our upward narrowing of organic sales guidance to 9% to 10% compared to 2019. Our sales performance carried through the rest of our results with strong margin performance and adjusted EPS growth and cash flow conversion of over 100% in the quarter. Through the remainder of the year, we do expect a discipline increase in spending to support our future growth expectations. Our bullish sales outlook combined with ongoing execution on margins and continued progress on Wright Medical integration has resulted in a raised full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $9.25 to $9.40 a share. I continue to be impressed with the resiliency of our people and culture, which positions us well for successful 2021 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Preston.\nPreston Wells: Thanks Kevin. My comments today will focus on the second quarter performance of our combined trauma and extremities business, including an update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical.  During the quarter our combined worldwide trauma and extremities business, including Wright Medical had a strong performance growing 7% compared to 2019. The performance in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. trauma and upper extremities businesses. The U.S. businesses were benefited by the recovery from COVID-19 related restrictions, which continues to outpace the rest of the world, as well as the ongoing execution of the U.S. selling integration. The trauma business unit was positively impacted by the reopening of economies and a continued strong performance of key products including T2 Alpha and the minifrac [ph] plating system. Our U.S. upper extremities business which remains number one in shoulder arthroplasty grew strong double-digits in the quarter behind continued strength within reverse arthroplasty portfolio with perform reverse and revision driving the growth. The upper extremities performance in the quarter was enhanced by the continued adoption of our BLUEPRINT planning software with approximately 50% of total shoulder cases completed using BLUEPRINT. As a result of the strong performance of our trauma and extremities business which grew approximately 5% in the first half of the year, we are confident in the combined business to grow at least 6% for the full year when compared to 2019. We are now about nine months into the integration of Wright Medical and we remain very pleased with the progress and efficiency at which the team is moving through the integration. The U.S. integration is pacing ahead of our expectations, and cross selling has begun in a limited capacity. We expect to continue to execute on our cross selling priorities during the second half of the year as we work to fortify the supply chain and the processes to support cross selling activities. Outside the U.S., the teams have successfully executed integration plans in several key markets, including the UK, Germany, France, Japan and China with further countries to follow into 2022. In addition to commercial activities, we are also executing on the integration of other operational areas including the consolidation of distribution and sales offices, harmonization of key operational processes and executing on our manufacturing site strategy. Within R&D, the team also continues to make progress on aligning the long-term portfolio, pipeline strategies, and harmonize design processes. While the team has moved through the integration, they have also remained focused on executing the critical existing projects in the pipeline. This includes the recent launch of the new Tornier Perform Humeral System, which offers clinical solutions for the simplest and most complex arthroplasty procedures and delivers on our mission to make healthcare better for surgeons and the patients they serve. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks Preston. Today I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our organic sales growth was 9.3 in the quarter. The second quarter included the same number of selling days as Q2 2019 and Q2 2020. Compared to 2019, pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.6% versus Q2 2020 pricing was 0.5% unfavorable. Foreign currently had a favorable 1.5% impact on sales. During the quarter we saw a recovery ramp of elective procedures and accelerated sales momentum as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has eased in most geographies. However, the recovery ramp of elective procedures continues to be variable by region and geography and have a more pronounced impact on our orthopedic and spine implant business. For the quarter U.S. organic sales increased by7.5%, reflecting the recovery of our procedural business and continued strong demand for Mako, medical products and neurovascular products. During the quarter we had strong sequential improvement in all our U.S. businesses. International organic sales showed strong growth of 14.2%. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.25 increased 13.6% from 2019 reflecting sales growth and operating margin expansion partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the Wright Medical acquisition and a somewhat higher quarterly effective tax rate. Our second quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopedics had constant currency sales growth of 26% and an organic sales growth of 6.7%, including an organic growth of 8% in the U.S. This reflects a ramp up in elective procedures especially in knees and trauma and extremities. Our knees business grew 7.5% in the U.S. reflecting a strong bounce back as the COVID related restrictions were lifted. Other orthopedics grew 26.5% in the U.S. primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotics platform partially offset by declines in bone cement. Internationally Orthopedics grew 4% organically which reflects sequential improvement as the COVID-19 impacts have started to ease in Europe, strong momentum in Mako internationally and strong performances in Australia. For the quarter, our trauma and extremities business, which includes Wright Medical delivered 7% growth on a comparable basis. In the U.S. comparable growth was 12.5%, which included double-digit growth in our upper extremities and trauma businesses. In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 8.3%, which included 6.4% growth in the U.S. Instruments had a U.S. organic sales growth of 29% primarily related to growth in smoke evacuation, lighted instruments, and skin closure products, partially offset by slower growth in power tools. As a reminder, during the second quarter of 2019 Instruments had a very strong growth of approximately 19%. Endoscopy had US. organic sales growth of 6% reflecting strong performances in our sports medicine, general surgery, and video products. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 13.4% reflecting continued double-digit performance in our emergency care business. Internationally MedSurg had organic sales growth of 15.9%, reflecting strong growth in the endoscopy, instruments and medical businesses across Europe, Canada and Australia. Neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 15.5%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in all four of our neurotech businesses; CMF, neurovascular, neurosurgical and EMC [ph]. This also reflects very strong growth in our neurovascular business of approximately 30%. Our U.S. neurotech business posted an organic growth of 17.3%, highlighted by strong product growth in Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps, Maxface [ph], cryotherapy and nasal implants. Additionally, our U.S. Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of our products including hemorrhagic flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally Neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 28.8%. This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets, as well as Europe and Australia. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66% was favorable approximately 15 basis points from second quarter 2019. Compared to the second quarter in 2019 gross margin was primarily impacted by business mix and acquisitions primarily offset by price. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.6% of sales reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.4% of sales which was slightly better than the second quarter of 2019. This reflects our continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage offset by the impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.9% of sales, which is 5 basis points improvement over the second quarter of 2019. This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum combined with the disciplined ramp up in cost, offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. Based on our positive momentum, we continue to reiterate our up margin guidance for the year of 30 to 50 basis points improvement over 2019, excluding the impact of Wright Medical. Related to other income and expense, as compared to the second quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment earned on deposits and an increase in interest expense resulting from the additional debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 17% and was impacted by our mix of U.S., non-U.S. income and some adverse discrete tax items included in our provision to return adjustments. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 15.2%. For the full year, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5% with some variability in the remaining quarters, including a slightly lower rate in the third quarter and a more normalized rate in the fourth quarter. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. During the quarter we fully repaid the $400 million of term loan debt related to the borrowings incurred for the acquisition of Wright Medical. Year-to-date we have paid down $1.15 billion of debt. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.3 billion. This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. And now I will provide a summary of our revised guidance. Based on our performance and sales ramp in the second quarter, as well as our capital orders pipeline, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 10%. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be at least 6% for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Consistent with the upper range of our previous guidance, net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $0.10 in the full-year and this is included in our revised guidance range. Based on our performance in the first six months and including consideration of our improved full-year Wright Medical performance impact, controlled spend ramp to facilitate growth and continued positive recovery outlook, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.25 to $9 40. And now we will open the call up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRobert Hopkins: Well, thanks and good afternoon, and congrats on such strong performance across the entire business. You could beat down essentially every metric. So I just have two questions and I'll state them upfront in the interest of time. The first question Kevin is for you. I'm just wondering how you've kind of framed your thoughts on the outlook for your hip and knee business in the back half given the rise in COVID cases that we're seeing? That's question number one. And then I would love you to comment also is question number two on the acceleration in Neurovascular, maybe just give a little more color, I mean was that market share you think, was that, was there strength in ischemic and hemorrhagic, just kind of looking for a little more color on the acceleration there? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Sure, thank you Bob. First on the hip and knee, what we're seeing is really a gradual increase we've seen throughout the year of return of elective procedures. These are deferrable procedures that need to be done at some point. And yes, with the Delta variant we are starting to see pockets of disruption, but overall the hospitals are very capable of being able to deal with this. And we're seeing in markets like Latin America and other markets the situation is actually improving. So overall, we know there is going to be some disruption and that is baked into our guidance, but we believe with the momentum that we have across not only our implant business, but as well as our capital businesses and we feel pretty confident enough to raise the bottom end of our full year sales guidance. As it relates to Neurovascular, if you look at that business we had an outstanding first quarter. It was around 27%, so this is 30%, so it's not really a huge acceleration. I would say, we really have a great product cycle going on right now across flow diverting stents, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic coils, our aspiration catheters. So we really have the bases covered and we're having fantastic growth really globally, including terrific performances in Asia Pacific. So I do expect that we will continue to have very strong performance throughout the rest of this year.\nRobert Hopkins: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nRobert Marcus: And I'll also add my congrats on a really impressive quarter here. Maybe two questions from me, one to start off, we saw a nice performance down the MedSurg business and throughout medical. There's a lot of new product launches going on here, so I just would like to get a sense of what the key drivers are? How the ProCuity Bed launch is going and what you're seeing in terms of the capital equipment, health of the market out there?\nPreston Wells: Hey Robbie, it is Preston. Just in terms of capital overall and we continue to see a pretty stable capital environment and if we've seen that really through the first couple of quarters and really evidenced by the continued strong sales in Medical as you'd said and also of course with our Mako technology. As it pertains specifically to Medical, so obviously we have the ProCuity Bed which I'll talk about in just a second, but we also have really strong performances out of our emergency care business. We've seen that in the last couple of quarters as well and so that continues to be very strong and it's just been an uptick there really in the in the U.S. and outside the U.S. With regards to ProCuity itself, the team is very pleased with how that launch has gone and started. We've really gotten a lot of awareness out there. We certainly have a lot of engagement from our customers, and we're starting to see building momentum in orders and sales in the U.S. and then starting to kick off that launch outside the U.S. as well. So we really expect that ProCuity is going to continue to be a driver for Medical really for the remainder of this year and as we go into next.\nRobert Marcus: Great and maybe for Glenn or Kevin, whoever wants to take it, I know you guys don't guide quarterly, but one of the concerns we've heard from investors over the quarter is that we're still in an environment without normal seasonality and concerns around maybe excessive weakness in third quarter from people coming out of lockdowns, vacations with doctors et cetera. So I was wondering how you're thinking about the progression from second to third and third to fourth quarter and if we're already back to normal seasonality or when we might be able to expect that? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks for the question. Robbie, as you know, Q3 tends to be seasonally our softest quarter, but I would assume that this year's seasonality will be very similar to what you've seen in prior years, and the talk about vacation, I've heard some of those comments. I really think that's noise, and then really that could delay maybe a procedure from one month to another month, but likely within the same quarter. So I expect normal seasonality, as you've seen in prior years.\nRobert Marcus: Great, I appreciate it Kevin. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale of Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks for taking the questions. The update on Wright was encouraging. It certainly sounds like the upper extremities piece continues to do very well. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in lower extremities? That was probably the more challenging piece to integrate, curious how that business did versus 2019?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thank you Robbie. So first of all, sorry, Chris, thank you Chris. First of all, I would say that the total ankle business did very well in the second quarter. As you know, the rest of foot and ankle is much more discretionary. The podiatric volumes are coming back, so it was certainly a better quarter in Q2 then Q1, but it is lagging a little bit, just like we're seeing with spine and with hips and knees, it is a bit more elective those foot medical procedures, but I'm very pleased with the stability of our sales force, the leadership that we put in place and as elective procedures comes back we do expect that will continue to grow. It was a market improvement. We're not seeing the kind of disruption we saw early on with K2M through that integration. So I'm very bullish on Wright overall. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, delighted to have this company within our portfolio. I think I have a deeper appreciation, we knew it was a good company when we acquired it and frankly I think it's even better than we thought.\nChris Pasquale: That's helpful. And then the color on Mako continues to sound very bullish, but the other ortho business probably didn't improve sequentially as much as the other piece of the business. Can you help us to resize the bone cement headwinds there and maybe give us a sense for what did Mako capital contributions look like?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, I mean, as you mentioned Mako continues to be very strong and so that was one of the businesses for sure over the last 12 months really we've seen continued strength. So that's why you won't see necessarily that same sequential improvement that we're seeing in some of the other businesses. With regards to bone cement, of course that's an area that has been declining, was certainly impacted by the pandemic and so we'll be a detractor as we think about that overall category. We don't really provide a breakout of those, but just thinking about in terms of Mako continuing to grow and offset by some declines from a bone cement standpoint.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jeffries. Your line is open.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks, I'll also add another great congratulations on another great quarter. The first one from me would be on deferred backlog procedures some of your competitors is recently even as this quarter are sort of putting numbers against that and I am sort of wondering if there's a number internally at Stryker that you could share on specific to the hip and knee business, what amount of deferred backlog is still out there and how long do you think that will be a driver for the business? And the second one I'll put up there as well on Wright, you mentioned Kevin, second half cross synergy selling potential into the second half and would assume that extends into next year, just sort of trying to quantify that is, is that a couple of 100 basis points and is that net of the synergies? Thanks again.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, so first with regards to your question on the deferred backlog, we don't have a specific number. I mean, there's a lot of variables that are going into trying to figure out what that is. What we do know is certainly over the last year that we haven't had the same level of procedures that we would have expected to as a result of the pandemic, and so it's super hard to predict exactly which percentages of patients that are back are from that different backlog or that are new patients. What we do know is that surgeons are continuing to try to work through as many patients as possible, finding different opportunities to add capacity into the scheduling or into their opportunity to perform those procedures. And so we don't expect that we're going to see any sort of outside growth figures that happened in any one particular quarter or month, but that's something that we expect that we're going to be working through this backlog over the next several quarters. So we expect it to be a tailwind for us really over the next several quarters and into 2022 for sure. What you think about is thinking about your other question with regards to Wright Medical, the cross selling component is something that, as I mentioned, is we're pleased with the start of that. It's early in the process. We're expecting that as you mentioned to continue for the rest of this year and into next year. We haven't provided a specific size of that opportunity, but it's baked within the overall guidance that we've provided for the overall combined trauma and extremities business, which as I mentioned we expect to grow at least 6% compared to 2019. That also does include the synergy component as well.\nAnthony Petrone: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks for taking my question. From my side Kevin, maybe on Mako, is there pieces to be made around utilization on robotic systems is having changed, has the environment ground utilization and how these systems are being used post pandemic hasn't changed at all and have you seen an increase in utilization?\nKevin Lobo: Thanks Vijay. No we have not seen really any change in utilization post pandemic. The gating factor really is being able to do the procedures and having the flow of the patients related to overall hospital operations, but so far we haven't seen any change. We are seeing a lot more demand for Mako in the ambulatory surgery centers. As you know, a lot of volume is starting to shift towards surgery centers and for us it's been a real tailwind. Our ASC offense is performing extremely well. And so there are a larger percentage of our Makos that are going into surgery centers, but that's been the only dynamic we've seen change. No real change in their procedure utilization.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful Kevin and maybe one for Glenn. Glenn, on gross margins here, I know you have right share in Kakuro [ph] but even adjusted for mix share, I mean it looks like your gross margins have held up much better versus your peers, who have been calling out shipping cost manufacturing variances, and it's also kind of reflected in this set guidance here margins for back half. We're at the annual operating margins or about 2019 levels which doesn't seem to be the case with your peers. Is there anything that's different about Stryker, how do you guys manage your P&L better, I'm curious of what's driving the margin performance versus your peers?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes I can't necessarily speak to our peers per se, but I will say, your question is maybe music to the ears of our GQO [ph] Group, and they have put a lot of focus in driving improved margins and also driving really good fixed cost leverage, and we will start to see that show up in our gross margins. We're still not guiding on gross margin, so I will say, we'll see that benefit but we will also see the benefit of mix come through which right now Wright Medical is a little bit of that influence that we're seeing on the margins. Offsetting those will be will be price, which typically is going to be the biggest thing. We'll still see that in the minus 1% range for the full year and we fully expect that that pricing impact will be roughly offset by a lot of that positivity that we are seeing and also the mix factor related to Wright Medical.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, I'd just like to add one comment, so as you probably are hearing across not just med tech industry but broadly, there is pressure on raw material input costs, and I'm delighted with the way that our organization has been able to offset those with a lot of other savings initiatives, efficiency initiatives, and purchasing initiatives which has been kind of in the works for the last couple of years, but we've really built tremendous capabilities now. Something I haven't been able to speak about frankly in prior years, but we really have the organization humming right now, and so we are able to offset some of the challenges that others are experiencing, and we're also experiencing with electronics and some certain components and feel really good about our supply chain resiliency.\nVijay Kumar: Yes, that's clearly shown up in the numbers here Kevin versus your peers. Thanks guys, congrats.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMatthew Miksic: Great, thanks so much. So one followup on robots and I just had one question on just those trends and mix that you're seeing and in the U.S. news in particular. On Mako, obviously congrats on all the great results and momentum, up sequentially off a very strong Q1, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit of maybe about the color on any change in mix for placements versus sales or in particular if you are starting to see any sort of cross effects between upper extremities and the robot is these two sides kind of move towards convergence in that new application whenever that comes to 24 months from now? And I have one quick followup.\nPreston Wells: Hey Matt, it is Preston. Just in terms of robots and mix, I mean one of the things that we identified approximately a year ago was that we were starting to see a bit of a trend towards financing. We haven't seen any significant changes in that approach or in that mix for the last year, so no big changes from a mix standpoint as we think about Mako and how we're selling Mako in the market. With regards to convergence, again we're still not seeing anything there. We've talked a lot about our excitement of a potential with Mako and shoulder, but nothing new to report in that area at this point.\nMatthew Miksic: Okay, and then just on the knee business. One of the things, one of your competitors talked about was sort of a heavier mix in primaries versus revisions I guess given that revisions were a bit more of an acute emergent. They are ever more emergent procedures or more of those during the pandemic maybe than primary in some areas, one if you're seeing something like that or any demographic mix shifts just because of what we've been through and the types of patients that we're get needed since nine months ago versus those that are coming through now, any color would be great?\nPreston Wells: Yes man, nothing specific to report in that area. I mean, the one thing that we have seen throughout the pandemic is variability, and so certainly by geography and by area you're getting a lot of variability. So, again, nothing that I would I would specifically point you to in terms of our mix.\nMatthew Miksic: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of Citi. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. I have to two really. We've talked for years about a movement towards the ASC. Are you seeing that accelerate or the same or is there any color that you can put around that?\nKevin Lobo:\n, :\nJoanne Wuensch: But when you say you have a product for that ship it's not just a robot, but I would assume that you're building out a whole ASC suite, is that the right way to think about it?\nKevin Lobo: Yes Joanne, the right way to think about it is, we have virtually everything they need for an orthopedic surgery center from building out the suites with the booms and the lights and the room design, to the operating table, to the beds and stretchers that are required, to the power tools and the flight helmets that they wear, all the implants from foot and ankle procedures, all the way to shoulder, including hips and knees, sports medicine procedures. Just think about our portfolio it absolutely covers the gamut of what they need in those surgery centers. So that really makes life easy for an operator in ASC to be able to contract with one company to cover such a huge portion of the procedures that are being done. So our portfolio really lines up beautifully for that. We also you may have read recently that we have this deal with conformance that we worked on a couple years ago. We have started launched our first few cases of a very, very simplified streamlined offering that provides less sterilization, we call it kind of a knee in a box. The official name of it is Triathlon AS-I with personalized cutting guides for the procedure. And so that was designed specifically for the ASC and that's now launched, but frankly a few years ago we didn't realize that Masko would be popular in the surgery center as proving to be. So we now have both said that we cannot, because some surgery centers won't own have a robot, but yes it involves a huge portion of our portfolio across some of our MedSurg products as well as our implant businesses.\nJoanne Wuensch: That's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question has to do with M&A. In October, you're rounding the two year mark announcement of Wright Medical, does that change your thinking and timing [indiscernible]? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, Joanne, you're right. It is rounding the two-year mark on Wright Medical. However, we're only nine months into sort of the cash flow impact of buying Wright Medical. And so, as we announced at the time of the acquisition, we were going to focus on debt reduction and sort of tuck-in kind of M&A. And so that really is what we've been doing and you've seen it over the last nine months, we've paid down just, a little over $1 billion of debt this year. We'll continue to look for opportunity to do that as we move forward. But we're ahead of the schedule that we thought we'd be on for debt paydown, so that's good. And then honestly, our BD teams are working and looking at smaller tuck-in M&A deals, which we think actually provide the most sort of shorter term growth upside. And so we're excited as they bring us new deals to look at sort of in that kind of size and category.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Two robotic questions from me. First, on Mako, I'd love to hear about the OUS rollout, new geographies how that's going places like Japan, I think you're waiting for China, hopefully I don't have those two backwards and just color on the mix, US, OUS of Mako placements? And I had one follow up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks, Larry. Certainly our OUS business has picked up. As you saw in the pandemic, the U.S. business continued very strong on Mako, but our OUS business did slow down and that's ramping back up again. We are fully operational with both Japan and China on all three applications, same with Brazil, as well as Russia. And so Japan is really starting to accelerate, which we're quite excited about. China has started. We still have, it's a little bit behind Japan. Brazil, we now have our first few sales in Brazil, so that's probably one of the later ones, and Russia as well. So we're in the early stages in those four markets and the demand is very high from surgeons, which is exciting. Brazil was delayed a little bit by COVID, but we are starting to build momentum there as well. So it's very exciting. The surgeons, it's kind of taking us back to when we launched Mako total knee here in the United States. There's high demand for it and you should expect strong performances in the quarters ahead.\nLawrence Biegelsen: That's helpful. And from my related robotic question, Kevin, you guys have started talking more publicly about evaluating, having people at Stryker evaluating surgical robotics. So my question is, how important is it for Stryker to participate in this market at some point? And how do you want investors to think about the kind of investment that it might take to be competitive in that market? Thanks for taking the question.\nKevin Lobo: Okay, thanks Larry. I assume by that question you're talking about general surgery, robotics.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Yes, sorry about that.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, no problem. Just want to make sure that was clear. I would say there's really no need for us to be in general surgery, robotics. As you can see, we're running a very good business at Stryker. It is a big market that has big growth potential, but it's something that like other adjacencies that are attracted to us be it areas I've spoken about in the past, like neuromodulation, or peripheral vascular, this is in an attractive adjacency. A pathway forward is not obvious and not clear at this time, but something we'll continue to look at, but it's not something we have to be in. But if the right opportunity presents itself, and we think we can build a strong business, we'll certainly make a move, but not obvious at this point.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Good afternoon, guys and thanks for taking my questions. The first one that has -- a little bit guidance that you provided, can you give us color on where gross margins and SG&A sort of you exiting the year as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019?\nKevin Lobo: Sure, I won't speak specifically to guidance on gross margin or necessarily SG&A. I guess what I can tell you is that, as we look at gross margin, we probably would plan on more orthopedic business, maybe impacting that gross margin, but that will be dependent on continued ramp in those businesses. On SG&A, we aren't fully ramped in terms of what I would call a normalized spend. And so as we look to continue sort of fueling the growth, as we ramp back up, we'll probably see increases in SG&A over the course of this year.\nPito Chickering: Okay, great. And then we submitted a lot of hospital systems during the quarter. We talked about a pretty significant move of orthopedics from inpatient to outpatient, but not necessarily into the ASC which obviously get a lot of investor attention. As the certain moved into the outpatient department of hospitals, does it impact surgeon selections of the products at all or has it no impact from the move?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, no we're not seeing any impact on implant choice, moving to the hospital outpatient, or even frankly to the surgery center. Thus far, we're seeing surgeons continue to operate with the same implants, regardless of which facility they're operating in.\nPito Chickering: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum of Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nKaila Krum: Great. Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Just for Wright Medical, you're saying you're confident that the combined business will grow at least 6% this year. Can you just speak to any more detail around sort of the recent drivers in this business? Are you guys seeing any benefit from dislocation associated with the recent impact of the spin off? And then, I guess, is there any reason why that 6% couldn't be 8% to 10% growth next year?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks, Kaila. What I'd tell you is we're really excited about the upper extremities business, it was growing very, very fast before, the acquisition that's continuing to really sing, especially in the United States. And we've just launched a new product, which will provide extra fuel to the fire. And then on the lower extremity side, we knew that the foot and ankle was going to be a tougher integration, but it's going well. They're a little bit more elective, those procedures, but the total ankle is doing extremely well. So overall, the product portfolio is performing well. Our sales forces are integrating well. The U.S. integration is ahead of schedule. OUS is going to take a little longer and we knew that these countries take a little longer with the distributor arrangements that we have in place before they fully hit their stride. But if you recall, when we started the year, we said low to mid-single-digit growth on a combined basis, and we sort of moved it up to mid single and now we're kind of thinking it's really going to be six plus percent for this year. And you should assume if this continues, and the elective procedures on the lower extremities ramps up that we should have a very good year next year. And also our core trauma business is actually having a very good year as well. So overall feeling very good about it. We're not going to give guidance for next year, but I think you can tell by our total network feeling very optimistic about the future of our trauma and extremities business.\nKaila Krum: Great, thanks. Thanks, Kevin. And then I guess on the spine market, can you just compare or contrast sort of what you've seen in terms of how the recovery is progressing this category may be compared with some of the other areas of Orthopedics? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, Kaila, just as we think about spine in comparison to other ortho areas, we haven't seen a significant difference in that recovery. I think I've mentioned before, variability really being the key word and so again, it's just been different pockets of disruption and opportunity as well. And so, nothing significant that I would say that we've seen in terms of the recovery for spine, it's been different than what we've seen in our other elective areas.\nKaila Krum: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman of Oppenheimer and company. Your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi guys. Certainly first to talk about your spine business and how you are feeling about the state of that business, so what's your outlook for the underlying growth and what are your latest thoughts and timing on robotics into spine?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, so in terms of underlying growth and we don't break out guidance in terms of as we think about spine, but we do expect that market and that business to continue to accelerate as the recovery happens in the back half of the year. With regards to robotics, I mean, we've talked about this before is of our key areas of focus for robotics and applications that are next. Spine is one of those and so we continue to move down that path with a couple of different options, looking at Mako, but also through our Mobius acquisition and the Cardan Robotics, some opportunities there. We don't have a timeline that we are sharing at this point and so it's something that we'll continue to update you on as we make progress in that area.\nSteven Lichtman: Okay, perfect. And then just secondly here with the worker center in a bulk year, for I think about six months, any update or thoughts on a smart implant coming from that acquisition?\nKevin Lobo: No, nothing new to report at this point. I mean, obviously, it's still fairly new in terms of the acquisition into the organization. We still do believe in smart implants and smart devices and that they will have a role to play in orthopedics. And so as we -- same similar as with robotics, as we get further down that pathway, it's something that we will certainly keep you updated on.\nSteven Lichtman: Got it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Matson of Needham. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. This is David on for Mike. The first one is just on ASC, just given the different dynamic there maybe there's more critical when show plan. Does that ASC market need a separate sales force and strategy or do you think you can leverage the current sales network?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, we have a very custom designed approach to selling to the ASCs. It is not something we have to elaborate on, on this call, but I would say it has required a different approach. And we're really excited about the way our offense is working in the market.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then, I guess on Mako, I think, J&J talked about the [indiscernible] launch in the U.S., so just expectations over the next call it 12 to 18 months? And thanks for taking the questions.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, well, expectations for us, I would say we expect Mako to continue to do very, very well. As you've seen, with other competitive entrants into the market, it only validates that robotics is here to stay in orthopedics and so we'd like our chances. We know we have an outstanding solution that delivers great results, which is why hospitals are buying their second and third and fourth Makos. And so we welcome the comparison. It's early days for them. And we just like the fact that robotics is going to continue to grow within orthopedics.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed of Barclays. Your line is open.\nTravis Steed: Hi, everybody, thanks for the question. I realized that China's a small part of your business, but just curious what you're seeing on the ground there with the China tenders and the volume based procurements there. I think that was supposed to happen at some point here in the next few months and if there was an update on that front?\nKevin Lobo: Hey, Travis, thanks for the question. In terms of the VDP in China, it is something that's ongoing. We don't have any major updates at this point is we're waiting on feedback on the process. I think one thing to note, that you mentioned is certainly China is a smaller part of our business. And then as we focus on the products that are actually, potentially under the tenders, there's an even smaller component of our business. So just something to keep in mind as we think about the overall impact that could be coming from VDP on our business. So we expect to hear back something later in the third quarter. And at that point in time, we'll take a look at it. The one thing that we know is just based on the timing we don't expect it to have any significant impacts on our 2021 numbers. And so we'll continue to monitor and it will be something that we will contemplate as we go into 2022.\nTravis Steed: All right, that's helpful, thank you. And I just wanted to get an update on the sports medicine business specifically. I know you had been growing double digits, just curious if there's any additional color you can add there both in U.S. and OUS?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, so certainly OUS it's a much smaller business. I would say within the U.S. the tailwind of the shift to the ASC and RSC [ph] offenses, in addition to great cadence of new products has really fueled very strong growth. And we had a 20% growth in the first quarter in the U.S. in our sports medicine business.\nTravis Steed: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien of Piper Sandlers. Your line is open.\nMatthew O'Brien: Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Kevin, you mentioned there is at least 6% growth in trauma and extremities, is that the growth of the overall market, because I know the E part of that is growing faster than the T part, is that the overall growth in that overall category combined? And then, as you think about going forward typically that nine to 18-month period is when you start to see the most dislocation from a product and a rep perspective is trauma and extremities different than what we see across traditional orthopedic acquisitions just because there's fewer places for some of these reps to go. So maybe the dislocation that you see could be a little less than we typically see?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, I think the way things are playing out right now the dislocation is less than spine. Certainly, that's been our experience. It's been a pleasant surprise so far, and especially on the foot and ankle side where we had anticipated a bit more dislocation. And frankly, we have terrific products. And we provided really quick stability for our salespeople to know who their boss is, to know what their territory is. And so, we moved with more speed this time, learned some lessons from prior integrations. I would tell you that we think we're growing at least at the market, if not above the market, because you have to remember that at least 6% is for the full year, including a pretty depressed first quarter, right. So the first quarter of this year was not kind of a normal year as it relates to the extremities business at all. So to have that over the full year, at least 6% on a combined basis I think that's probably growing above the market and we'll see as the year progresses. Feeling very good about both our core trauma business and our extremities business.\nMatthew O'Brien: Got it, thanks for that. And then over to Neurovascular, I know you don't want to call off this acceleration during Q2 versus Q1, but that you're doing much better than the overall market by our calculations anyway, so are there specific areas that are accelerating? I don't know if it's ischemic specifically within that category, and that you're really well positioned there. And then just is your ability to bundle this much better than elsewhere? And I guess the real question is, can this business grow upper teens, low 20s for the next couple of years?\nKevin Lobo: Well, it's been growing at that kind of rate for the last few years and this year, you are seeing an acceleration of growth. And what I would attribute it to is we already have fabulous coils, stent retrievers, we're already very, very good. But we've strengthened our portfolio with the flow diverting stent with the surpass of all stent, and with the 0.074, vector catheter, aspiration catheter, so that that for us was a product gap. We didn't have an easy to deploy, empty catheter approach for float diverting stent, and we didn't have a large for aspiration catheter. So we plugged those, let's call them product gaps. And we've had fantastic expansion around the world. And really, the Atlas stent in China, as an adjunctive stent for hemorrhagic is performing exceptionally well and this global business is really, really well run. We have an exceptional leadership team over there that have been executing very well, but I would say the acceleration; let's call it this year's acceleration versus prior years is really driven by this product cycle that really has us covering all of the bases with excellent products that are meeting the needs of our customers.\nMatthew O'Brien: Understood, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nRichard Newitter: Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, you mentioned several times that how impressed you’re with Wright Medical now that you've kind of had it under your operating belt for a few quarters now. I’m just curious, is there other than just, the integration going better than planned, is there anything specifically either in the pipeline or embedded in that comment? It just, really, is surprising you to the upside or making you more excited about the future? You mentioned BLUEPRINT a few times, is something with BLUEPRINT. Just I'm curious if there's something that you're foreshadowing there, or physician general execution comment? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, so it was, we knew they had a good business. And we knew that their culture was similar to Strykers. But there's been some pleasant surprises along the way. Their talent is really excellent. And a lot of times when we buy companies, we buy them for their products. But then we have to infuse a lot of our management. They are a leader for upper extremities. They are a leader for lower extremities, are leading our businesses. Our head of knees came from Wright Medical. And so we've had an infusion of talent that for me has been a positive surprise. I mean, really outstanding leaders, their sales leader for upper extremities is outstanding and so that's been one positive. The second I would say is their key opinion leaders. They absolutely work with fabulous key opinion leaders on both upper and lower extremities. And I would say that they are better key opinion leaders than we had within Stryker. And so those are two really, to me pleasant surprises. And just the pipelines, we thought they were good, they turned out to be a little better than we thought and that really applies across the board. So there are certain things that you know, when you do a public deal, you don't get to do the same amount of due diligence as you do with a private acquisition. And so those instincts, we had instincts that things were going to be good, they are proving to be even better than we first thought.\nRichard Newitter: That's helpful call. Thanks. And then maybe just second question, conformance and the initiative that you have there. I appreciate the ASC help that product can potentially offer the solution there and the benefits there. Just wondering where else the conformance solution could go? And thinking kind of with an eye towards robotics and digital surgery as well, so we'll be thinking about, that being more meaningful going forward in other capacities outside of just ASC adoption. Thanks. \nKevin Lobo: Yes, our primary focus was on the ASC, but there are a lot of hospitals that are concerned about sterilization and sterilization being sort of a constraint. And they'd like the less trays, they'd like less instrumentation they'd like less space taken up in their stockroom. So, I wouldn't say it's limited to the ASC's, but that really is out of the gates, let's say for the first six to nine months, that's our prime focus is going to be on the ASC because of their constraints on sterilization are the most acute, but I would say that there probably will be interest beyond that. But let's see that'll be more of a next year kind of commentary that I'd be able to get.\nRichard Newitter: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Josh Jennings of Cowen. You may proceed.\nJoshua Jennings: I was hoping to just follow up on some of the commentary on the spine business. And can you just review your outlook on the value proposition, the current robots out in the market and maybe help us better understand the enabling technologies under Stryker’s rule had done, don't get a lot of airtime? And how you believe Stryker’s spine franchise can be competitive and in front of the Mako spine launch?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks. Listen, we are big believers in enabling technologies. We obviously have that with Mako. We did the Mobius acquisition and we're very excited about the imaging aspect of that. We do have a gap in spine robotics and we do believe that the first foray, the two competitive systems on the market today are really - are really good guidance systems for the placement of pedicle screws, and but it's providing value to surgeons, and we definitely want to have something like that on the market, which was what Mobius was working on. And then beyond that, we think with Mako, we could get into other procedures and other applications. But robotics is difficult, so it's going to take time for us to develop those applications and we'll keep you posted. But we do, we are big believers in enabling technology and we're going to continue to invest in that space.\nJoshua Jennings: Thanks for that. Maybe one follow up may be for you and Glenn. Just as you're moving towards the anniversary of the Wright acquisition, and hopefully we're all moving towards more normalcy in 2022. We've had an operating margin expansion kind of in the range of 30 to 50 basis points and how should investors be thinking about these cost range programs have been played for the last couple years? And the amount of P&L leverage that Stryker can experience in future? Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, sure. I think first of all, as a baseline if you think about a normal operating margin that was acquired through Wright Medical was, it was significantly less than say Stryker's normal operating margin. So if you think what have we worked on during this integration period, it was really pulling Wright Medical up and trying to look for all the synergies that we had built into our model, so that we could drive better operating margins at Wright Medical. I think fast forwarding into next year and looking at where that might look on a combined basis, I think we'll get back to our normalized, up margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points. But at this point, that's a little ways away, and we're not really necessarily guiding for 2022.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Kyle Rose of Canaccord. Your line is now open.\nKyle Rose: Great, thank you very much for taking the questions. So a lot been asked, but we do have the ALS coming up in a few months here. And I wonder if you could just touch on maybe what some of the focuses that investors will see at the conference. I mean, I think about what's happened over the course of the last 12 months, you have acquired ortho sensor, you did touch on a little bit of the knee in a box and ASP knee opportunity there and then obviously robotics is getting a lot of attention in the ASPs in the outpatient setting. So maybe just that will set us on expectations into the conference?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, listen, we don't have a big reveal at this conference. As you say we'll talk about the conformance product and we can talk about Triathlon AS-I, we have Mako, which is still going to be talked about quite a bit, especially with the new hip application that's starting to gain some steam, but still takes time to get that socialized more broadly. In addition to that, we have recent approval of the in space balloon for large rotator cuff repair within our sports medicine business, which is a very exciting product and a product used by sports medicine surgeons as well as the surgeons that do shoulder arthroplasty that come from Wright Medical. So that's also an exciting product, so as well as to perform Humeral product that Glenn mentioned earlier on with Wright Medical. So a number of new products, but it's really, frankly, an exciting time to get back with our customers at scale, not having that conference last year was certainly a gap and really look forward to engaging with our customers once again. And so that's really what we're going to be showing. It's not something brand new that we're going to be unveiling, but really more of just continuing the momentum that we already have.\nKyle Rose: Great. And then the second question is, I think earlier, you noted that, when physicians do move procedures to the outpatient or the ASP they're typically using their, standard instrumentation sets or the same implant systems that use in the hospital, have you seen any changes in pricing or types of contracting that you're seeing, when your ASC team does go out to engage on driving initiatives there?\nKevin Lobo: No, thus far, we're not seeing really any change in implant pricing. But we, what we are seeing is because of the capital requirement; we are seeing deals that involve multiple businesses of Stryker. We're seeing much more of that than we see in the hospitals. So the deals that we do typically involve four or five different businesses, and Stryker, whereas hospitals tend to buy product category by product category, but no real change on pricing.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor of UBS. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, great. This is actually [indiscernible] for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe just one question, just on smoke evacuation, you mentioned it for several quarters now. It would be great if you can talk a little bit about the drivers for growth in recent quarters and the sustainability of growth going forward. Especially on the other side of COVID? That's a fair question.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, absolutely. So we're very pleased with smoke evacuation and what that business does for us, in terms of our ability to grow. As we look at it, we really look at ourselves as market leaders behind our broad portfolio, and it's one of those businesses that actually sits across a couple of different divisions, both within instruments and also within endo, our endo businesses. In terms of what our expectations are, I mean, we're really going to continue to expand that market continues to expand both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. really driven by legislation, and really the desire around a safer operating room behind smoke free operating rooms.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Baird. You may proceed.\nJeffrey Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I'll be quick. Just one, Kevin, I'd be interested, it's always tough as an early reporter for you guys to know market share shifts and things like that. And the volatile numbers we're getting from everybody, these next couple quarters will be even tougher, just wondering kind of momentum wise that you're seeing with surgeons, in your core ortho business, can you talk to hip, knees, trauma, spine, any of those four areas where you've seen maybe a change at all good or bad in momentum, you think of pooling surgeons in on a competitive front? That'd be helpful. Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, listen, it feels good to be sort of getting back to normal. It isn't totally normal. There are these pockets of disruption. But I would say that surgeons are starting to fill up their schedules, they're taking meetings with us, they're coming to trainings. And so we feel like we're sort of almost getting back to the kind of rhythm we had before, you can see it in our guidance. I mean it is a pretty bullish guide, to say we're going to do 9% to 10%, organic, plus strong performance out of Wright Medical, which was an integration and pretty complex, involving the trauma extremities, as well as our joint replacement business, because those businesses used to be under common sales management, and we've pulled those out. And so to be able to do all that and have this kind of wind at our back is pretty exciting and I would say customers are ready to engage ALS. I think it will be a pretty big conference, and based on what I'm hearing, it will be fairly well attended. And I think those are great opportunities for us to be able to show the power of Stryker and what we can offer to our customers.\nJeffrey Johnson: Anything in those four core areas of orthopedics that where you're seeing kind of a change in your competitive positioning where just over the last three to six months or so, you may be feeling a little bit better or worse about your positioning and bringing in competitive accounts?\nKevin Lobo: I would say more of the same. If you look at that knee number, that's a pretty good knee number and that has been the killer application with Mako and Mako was very, very strong, as you saw through the pandemic. And I think that will continue to be probably the one business that stands out. I mean, obviously upper extremities is going to continue to be a very, very strong performer. But I would say that's the one that probably we're feeling continued bullishness, if you will, but there's not been really I mean any other new dynamics just in the last quarter.\nJeffrey Johnson: Yes, thanks. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in October. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Lobo",
            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical integration. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. Please note that our press release contains our results versus both 2020 and 2019. For this call, our commentary will be based on our performance versus 2019, which we believe provides a more relevant point of comparison. For the quarter we posted organic sales growth of 9.3% reflecting growth versus 2019 for all our major businesses. This strong result was driven by standout performances from neurovascular, Mako, emergency care, sports medicine and our U.S. shoulder and total ankle products. Each of these posted very strong double-digit growth. International organic growth outpaced the U.S. 14.2% despite COVID challenges in some countries. We posted double-digit growth in most regions, including excellent results in South Pacific, China, Canada, South Korea and many countries in Western Europe. We were also pleased to see the continued rebound in elective procedures as both hips and knees saw quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement and both returned to growth. Also now that we have a fuller appreciation of Wright Medical, we are delighted to have it within the Stryker family. With our first half organic growth of 7.1% combined with continued recovery of elective procedures, a strong order book across our capital businesses and new product innovations, we have increased confidence in the full-year outlook. This is reflected in our upward narrowing of organic sales guidance to 9% to 10% compared to 2019. Our sales performance carried through the rest of our results with strong margin performance and adjusted EPS growth and cash flow conversion of over 100% in the quarter. Through the remainder of the year, we do expect a discipline increase in spending to support our future growth expectations. Our bullish sales outlook combined with ongoing execution on margins and continued progress on Wright Medical integration has resulted in a raised full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $9.25 to $9.40 a share. I continue to be impressed with the resiliency of our people and culture, which positions us well for successful 2021 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Preston. Sure, thank you Bob. First on the hip and knee, what we're seeing is really a gradual increase we've seen throughout the year of return of elective procedures. These are deferrable procedures that need to be done at some point. And yes, with the Delta variant we are starting to see pockets of disruption, but overall the hospitals are very capable of being able to deal with this. And we're seeing in markets like Latin America and other markets the situation is actually improving. So overall, we know there is going to be some disruption and that is baked into our guidance, but we believe with the momentum that we have across not only our implant business, but as well as our capital businesses and we feel pretty confident enough to raise the bottom end of our full year sales guidance. As it relates to Neurovascular, if you look at that business we had an outstanding first quarter. It was around 27%, so this is 30%, so it's not really a huge acceleration. I would say, we really have a great product cycle going on right now across flow diverting stents, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic coils, our aspiration catheters. So we really have the bases covered and we're having fantastic growth really globally, including terrific performances in Asia Pacific. So I do expect that we will continue to have very strong performance throughout the rest of this year. Yes, thanks for the question. Robbie, as you know, Q3 tends to be seasonally our softest quarter, but I would assume that this year's seasonality will be very similar to what you've seen in prior years, and the talk about vacation, I've heard some of those comments. I really think that's noise, and then really that could delay maybe a procedure from one month to another month, but likely within the same quarter. So I expect normal seasonality, as you've seen in prior years. Yes, thank you Robbie. So first of all, sorry, Chris, thank you Chris. First of all, I would say that the total ankle business did very well in the second quarter. As you know, the rest of foot and ankle is much more discretionary. The podiatric volumes are coming back, so it was certainly a better quarter in Q2 then Q1, but it is lagging a little bit, just like we're seeing with spine and with hips and knees, it is a bit more elective those foot medical procedures, but I'm very pleased with the stability of our sales force, the leadership that we put in place and as elective procedures comes back we do expect that will continue to grow. It was a market improvement. We're not seeing the kind of disruption we saw early on with K2M through that integration. So I'm very bullish on Wright overall. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, delighted to have this company within our portfolio. I think I have a deeper appreciation, we knew it was a good company when we acquired it and frankly I think it's even better than we thought. Yes, I mean, as you mentioned Mako continues to be very strong and so that was one of the businesses for sure over the last 12 months really we've seen continued strength. So that's why you won't see necessarily that same sequential improvement that we're seeing in some of the other businesses. With regards to bone cement, of course that's an area that has been declining, was certainly impacted by the pandemic and so we'll be a detractor as we think about that overall category. We don't really provide a breakout of those, but just thinking about in terms of Mako continuing to grow and offset by some declines from a bone cement standpoint. Yes, so first with regards to your question on the deferred backlog, we don't have a specific number. I mean, there's a lot of variables that are going into trying to figure out what that is. What we do know is certainly over the last year that we haven't had the same level of procedures that we would have expected to as a result of the pandemic, and so it's super hard to predict exactly which percentages of patients that are back are from that different backlog or that are new patients. What we do know is that surgeons are continuing to try to work through as many patients as possible, finding different opportunities to add capacity into the scheduling or into their opportunity to perform those procedures. And so we don't expect that we're going to see any sort of outside growth figures that happened in any one particular quarter or month, but that's something that we expect that we're going to be working through this backlog over the next several quarters. So we expect it to be a tailwind for us really over the next several quarters and into 2022 for sure. What you think about is thinking about your other question with regards to Wright Medical, the cross selling component is something that, as I mentioned, is we're pleased with the start of that. It's early in the process. We're expecting that as you mentioned to continue for the rest of this year and into next year. We haven't provided a specific size of that opportunity, but it's baked within the overall guidance that we've provided for the overall combined trauma and extremities business, which as I mentioned we expect to grow at least 6% compared to 2019. That also does include the synergy component as well. Thanks Vijay. No we have not seen really any change in utilization post pandemic. The gating factor really is being able to do the procedures and having the flow of the patients related to overall hospital operations, but so far we haven't seen any change. We are seeing a lot more demand for Mako in the ambulatory surgery centers. As you know, a lot of volume is starting to shift towards surgery centers and for us it's been a real tailwind. Our ASC offense is performing extremely well. And so there are a larger percentage of our Makos that are going into surgery centers, but that's been the only dynamic we've seen change. No real change in their procedure utilization. Yes, I'd just like to add one comment, so as you probably are hearing across not just med tech industry but broadly, there is pressure on raw material input costs, and I'm delighted with the way that our organization has been able to offset those with a lot of other savings initiatives, efficiency initiatives, and purchasing initiatives which has been kind of in the works for the last couple of years, but we've really built tremendous capabilities now. Something I haven't been able to speak about frankly in prior years, but we really have the organization humming right now, and so we are able to offset some of the challenges that others are experiencing, and we're also experiencing with electronics and some certain components and feel really good about our supply chain resiliency. Thank you. ,:Joanne Wuensch: But when you say you have a product for that ship it's not just a robot, but I would assume that you're building out a whole ASC suite, is that the right way to think about it? Yes Joanne, the right way to think about it is, we have virtually everything they need for an orthopedic surgery center from building out the suites with the booms and the lights and the room design, to the operating table, to the beds and stretchers that are required, to the power tools and the flight helmets that they wear, all the implants from foot and ankle procedures, all the way to shoulder, including hips and knees, sports medicine procedures. Just think about our portfolio it absolutely covers the gamut of what they need in those surgery centers. So that really makes life easy for an operator in ASC to be able to contract with one company to cover such a huge portion of the procedures that are being done. So our portfolio really lines up beautifully for that. We also you may have read recently that we have this deal with conformance that we worked on a couple years ago. We have started launched our first few cases of a very, very simplified streamlined offering that provides less sterilization, we call it kind of a knee in a box. The official name of it is Triathlon AS-I with personalized cutting guides for the procedure. And so that was designed specifically for the ASC and that's now launched, but frankly a few years ago we didn't realize that Masko would be popular in the surgery center as proving to be. So we now have both said that we cannot, because some surgery centers won't own have a robot, but yes it involves a huge portion of our portfolio across some of our MedSurg products as well as our implant businesses. Yes, Joanne, you're right. It is rounding the two-year mark on Wright Medical. However, we're only nine months into sort of the cash flow impact of buying Wright Medical. And so, as we announced at the time of the acquisition, we were going to focus on debt reduction and sort of tuck-in kind of M&A. And so that really is what we've been doing and you've seen it over the last nine months, we've paid down just, a little over $1 billion of debt this year. We'll continue to look for opportunity to do that as we move forward. But we're ahead of the schedule that we thought we'd be on for debt paydown, so that's good. And then honestly, our BD teams are working and looking at smaller tuck-in M&A deals, which we think actually provide the most sort of shorter term growth upside. And so we're excited as they bring us new deals to look at sort of in that kind of size and category. Yes, thanks, Larry. Certainly our OUS business has picked up. As you saw in the pandemic, the U.S. business continued very strong on Mako, but our OUS business did slow down and that's ramping back up again. We are fully operational with both Japan and China on all three applications, same with Brazil, as well as Russia. And so Japan is really starting to accelerate, which we're quite excited about. China has started. We still have, it's a little bit behind Japan. Brazil, we now have our first few sales in Brazil, so that's probably one of the later ones, and Russia as well. So we're in the early stages in those four markets and the demand is very high from surgeons, which is exciting. Brazil was delayed a little bit by COVID, but we are starting to build momentum there as well. So it's very exciting. The surgeons, it's kind of taking us back to when we launched Mako total knee here in the United States. There's high demand for it and you should expect strong performances in the quarters ahead. Okay, thanks Larry. I assume by that question you're talking about general surgery, robotics. Yes, no problem. Just want to make sure that was clear. I would say there's really no need for us to be in general surgery, robotics. As you can see, we're running a very good business at Stryker. It is a big market that has big growth potential, but it's something that like other adjacencies that are attracted to us be it areas I've spoken about in the past, like neuromodulation, or peripheral vascular, this is in an attractive adjacency. A pathway forward is not obvious and not clear at this time, but something we'll continue to look at, but it's not something we have to be in. But if the right opportunity presents itself, and we think we can build a strong business, we'll certainly make a move, but not obvious at this point. Sure, I won't speak specifically to guidance on gross margin or necessarily SG&A. I guess what I can tell you is that, as we look at gross margin, we probably would plan on more orthopedic business, maybe impacting that gross margin, but that will be dependent on continued ramp in those businesses. On SG&A, we aren't fully ramped in terms of what I would call a normalized spend. And so as we look to continue sort of fueling the growth, as we ramp back up, we'll probably see increases in SG&A over the course of this year. Yes, no we're not seeing any impact on implant choice, moving to the hospital outpatient, or even frankly to the surgery center. Thus far, we're seeing surgeons continue to operate with the same implants, regardless of which facility they're operating in. Yes, thanks, Kaila. What I'd tell you is we're really excited about the upper extremities business, it was growing very, very fast before, the acquisition that's continuing to really sing, especially in the United States. And we've just launched a new product, which will provide extra fuel to the fire. And then on the lower extremity side, we knew that the foot and ankle was going to be a tougher integration, but it's going well. They're a little bit more elective, those procedures, but the total ankle is doing extremely well. So overall, the product portfolio is performing well. Our sales forces are integrating well. The U.S. integration is ahead of schedule. OUS is going to take a little longer and we knew that these countries take a little longer with the distributor arrangements that we have in place before they fully hit their stride. But if you recall, when we started the year, we said low to mid-single-digit growth on a combined basis, and we sort of moved it up to mid single and now we're kind of thinking it's really going to be six plus percent for this year. And you should assume if this continues, and the elective procedures on the lower extremities ramps up that we should have a very good year next year. And also our core trauma business is actually having a very good year as well. So overall feeling very good about it. We're not going to give guidance for next year, but I think you can tell by our total network feeling very optimistic about the future of our trauma and extremities business. Yes, Kaila, just as we think about spine in comparison to other ortho areas, we haven't seen a significant difference in that recovery. I think I've mentioned before, variability really being the key word and so again, it's just been different pockets of disruption and opportunity as well. And so, nothing significant that I would say that we've seen in terms of the recovery for spine, it's been different than what we've seen in our other elective areas. Yes, so in terms of underlying growth and we don't break out guidance in terms of as we think about spine, but we do expect that market and that business to continue to accelerate as the recovery happens in the back half of the year. With regards to robotics, I mean, we've talked about this before is of our key areas of focus for robotics and applications that are next. Spine is one of those and so we continue to move down that path with a couple of different options, looking at Mako, but also through our Mobius acquisition and the Cardan Robotics, some opportunities there. We don't have a timeline that we are sharing at this point and so it's something that we'll continue to update you on as we make progress in that area. No, nothing new to report at this point. I mean, obviously, it's still fairly new in terms of the acquisition into the organization. We still do believe in smart implants and smart devices and that they will have a role to play in orthopedics. And so as we -- same similar as with robotics, as we get further down that pathway, it's something that we will certainly keep you updated on. Yes, we have a very custom designed approach to selling to the ASCs. It is not something we have to elaborate on, on this call, but I would say it has required a different approach. And we're really excited about the way our offense is working in the market. Yes, well, expectations for us, I would say we expect Mako to continue to do very, very well. As you've seen, with other competitive entrants into the market, it only validates that robotics is here to stay in orthopedics and so we'd like our chances. We know we have an outstanding solution that delivers great results, which is why hospitals are buying their second and third and fourth Makos. And so we welcome the comparison. It's early days for them. And we just like the fact that robotics is going to continue to grow within orthopedics. Hey, Travis, thanks for the question. In terms of the VDP in China, it is something that's ongoing. We don't have any major updates at this point is we're waiting on feedback on the process. I think one thing to note, that you mentioned is certainly China is a smaller part of our business. And then as we focus on the products that are actually, potentially under the tenders, there's an even smaller component of our business. So just something to keep in mind as we think about the overall impact that could be coming from VDP on our business. So we expect to hear back something later in the third quarter. And at that point in time, we'll take a look at it. The one thing that we know is just based on the timing we don't expect it to have any significant impacts on our 2021 numbers. And so we'll continue to monitor and it will be something that we will contemplate as we go into 2022. Yes, I think the way things are playing out right now the dislocation is less than spine. Certainly, that's been our experience. It's been a pleasant surprise so far, and especially on the foot and ankle side where we had anticipated a bit more dislocation. And frankly, we have terrific products. And we provided really quick stability for our salespeople to know who their boss is, to know what their territory is. And so, we moved with more speed this time, learned some lessons from prior integrations. I would tell you that we think we're growing at least at the market, if not above the market, because you have to remember that at least 6% is for the full year, including a pretty depressed first quarter, right. So the first quarter of this year was not kind of a normal year as it relates to the extremities business at all. So to have that over the full year, at least 6% on a combined basis I think that's probably growing above the market and we'll see as the year progresses. Feeling very good about both our core trauma business and our extremities business. Well, it's been growing at that kind of rate for the last few years and this year, you are seeing an acceleration of growth. And what I would attribute it to is we already have fabulous coils, stent retrievers, we're already very, very good. But we've strengthened our portfolio with the flow diverting stent with the surpass of all stent, and with the 0.074, vector catheter, aspiration catheter, so that that for us was a product gap. We didn't have an easy to deploy, empty catheter approach for float diverting stent, and we didn't have a large for aspiration catheter. So we plugged those, let's call them product gaps. And we've had fantastic expansion around the world. And really, the Atlas stent in China, as an adjunctive stent for hemorrhagic is performing exceptionally well and this global business is really, really well run. We have an exceptional leadership team over there that have been executing very well, but I would say the acceleration; let's call it this year's acceleration versus prior years is really driven by this product cycle that really has us covering all of the bases with excellent products that are meeting the needs of our customers. Yes, so it was, we knew they had a good business. And we knew that their culture was similar to Strykers. But there's been some pleasant surprises along the way. Their talent is really excellent. And a lot of times when we buy companies, we buy them for their products. But then we have to infuse a lot of our management. They are a leader for upper extremities. They are a leader for lower extremities, are leading our businesses. Our head of knees came from Wright Medical. And so we've had an infusion of talent that for me has been a positive surprise. I mean, really outstanding leaders, their sales leader for upper extremities is outstanding and so that's been one positive. The second I would say is their key opinion leaders. They absolutely work with fabulous key opinion leaders on both upper and lower extremities. And I would say that they are better key opinion leaders than we had within Stryker. And so those are two really, to me pleasant surprises. And just the pipelines, we thought they were good, they turned out to be a little better than we thought and that really applies across the board. So there are certain things that you know, when you do a public deal, you don't get to do the same amount of due diligence as you do with a private acquisition. And so those instincts, we had instincts that things were going to be good, they are proving to be even better than we first thought. Yes, our primary focus was on the ASC, but there are a lot of hospitals that are concerned about sterilization and sterilization being sort of a constraint. And they'd like the less trays, they'd like less instrumentation they'd like less space taken up in their stockroom. So, I wouldn't say it's limited to the ASC's, but that really is out of the gates, let's say for the first six to nine months, that's our prime focus is going to be on the ASC because of their constraints on sterilization are the most acute, but I would say that there probably will be interest beyond that. But let's see that'll be more of a next year kind of commentary that I'd be able to get. Yes, thanks. Listen, we are big believers in enabling technologies. We obviously have that with Mako. We did the Mobius acquisition and we're very excited about the imaging aspect of that. We do have a gap in spine robotics and we do believe that the first foray, the two competitive systems on the market today are really - are really good guidance systems for the placement of pedicle screws, and but it's providing value to surgeons, and we definitely want to have something like that on the market, which was what Mobius was working on. And then beyond that, we think with Mako, we could get into other procedures and other applications. But robotics is difficult, so it's going to take time for us to develop those applications and we'll keep you posted. But we do, we are big believers in enabling technology and we're going to continue to invest in that space. Yes, listen, we don't have a big reveal at this conference. As you say we'll talk about the conformance product and we can talk about Triathlon AS-I, we have Mako, which is still going to be talked about quite a bit, especially with the new hip application that's starting to gain some steam, but still takes time to get that socialized more broadly. In addition to that, we have recent approval of the in space balloon for large rotator cuff repair within our sports medicine business, which is a very exciting product and a product used by sports medicine surgeons as well as the surgeons that do shoulder arthroplasty that come from Wright Medical. So that's also an exciting product, so as well as to perform Humeral product that Glenn mentioned earlier on with Wright Medical. So a number of new products, but it's really, frankly, an exciting time to get back with our customers at scale, not having that conference last year was certainly a gap and really look forward to engaging with our customers once again. And so that's really what we're going to be showing. It's not something brand new that we're going to be unveiling, but really more of just continuing the momentum that we already have. No, thus far, we're not seeing really any change in implant pricing. But we, what we are seeing is because of the capital requirement; we are seeing deals that involve multiple businesses of Stryker. We're seeing much more of that than we see in the hospitals. So the deals that we do typically involve four or five different businesses, and Stryker, whereas hospitals tend to buy product category by product category, but no real change on pricing. Yes, absolutely. So we're very pleased with smoke evacuation and what that business does for us, in terms of our ability to grow. As we look at it, we really look at ourselves as market leaders behind our broad portfolio, and it's one of those businesses that actually sits across a couple of different divisions, both within instruments and also within endo, our endo businesses. In terms of what our expectations are, I mean, we're really going to continue to expand that market continues to expand both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. really driven by legislation, and really the desire around a safer operating room behind smoke free operating rooms. Yes, listen, it feels good to be sort of getting back to normal. It isn't totally normal. There are these pockets of disruption. But I would say that surgeons are starting to fill up their schedules, they're taking meetings with us, they're coming to trainings. And so we feel like we're sort of almost getting back to the kind of rhythm we had before, you can see it in our guidance. I mean it is a pretty bullish guide, to say we're going to do 9% to 10%, organic, plus strong performance out of Wright Medical, which was an integration and pretty complex, involving the trauma extremities, as well as our joint replacement business, because those businesses used to be under common sales management, and we've pulled those out. And so to be able to do all that and have this kind of wind at our back is pretty exciting and I would say customers are ready to engage ALS. I think it will be a pretty big conference, and based on what I'm hearing, it will be fairly well attended. And I think those are great opportunities for us to be able to show the power of Stryker and what we can offer to our customers. I would say more of the same. If you look at that knee number, that's a pretty good knee number and that has been the killer application with Mako and Mako was very, very strong, as you saw through the pandemic. And I think that will continue to be probably the one business that stands out. I mean, obviously upper extremities is going to continue to be a very, very strong performer. But I would say that's the one that probably we're feeling continued bullishness, if you will, but there's not been really I mean any other new dynamics just in the last quarter. Thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in October. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks Preston. Today I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our organic sales growth was 9.3 in the quarter. The second quarter included the same number of selling days as Q2 2019 and Q2 2020. Compared to 2019, pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.6% versus Q2 2020 pricing was 0.5% unfavorable. Foreign currently had a favorable 1.5% impact on sales. During the quarter we saw a recovery ramp of elective procedures and accelerated sales momentum as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has eased in most geographies. However, the recovery ramp of elective procedures continues to be variable by region and geography and have a more pronounced impact on our orthopedic and spine implant business. For the quarter U.S. organic sales increased by7.5%, reflecting the recovery of our procedural business and continued strong demand for Mako, medical products and neurovascular products. During the quarter we had strong sequential improvement in all our U.S. businesses. International organic sales showed strong growth of 14.2%. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.25 increased 13.6% from 2019 reflecting sales growth and operating margin expansion partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the Wright Medical acquisition and a somewhat higher quarterly effective tax rate. Our second quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopedics had constant currency sales growth of 26% and an organic sales growth of 6.7%, including an organic growth of 8% in the U.S. This reflects a ramp up in elective procedures especially in knees and trauma and extremities. Our knees business grew 7.5% in the U.S. reflecting a strong bounce back as the COVID related restrictions were lifted. Other orthopedics grew 26.5% in the U.S. primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotics platform partially offset by declines in bone cement. Internationally Orthopedics grew 4% organically which reflects sequential improvement as the COVID-19 impacts have started to ease in Europe, strong momentum in Mako internationally and strong performances in Australia. For the quarter, our trauma and extremities business, which includes Wright Medical delivered 7% growth on a comparable basis. In the U.S. comparable growth was 12.5%, which included double-digit growth in our upper extremities and trauma businesses. In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 8.3%, which included 6.4% growth in the U.S. Instruments had a U.S. organic sales growth of 29% primarily related to growth in smoke evacuation, lighted instruments, and skin closure products, partially offset by slower growth in power tools. As a reminder, during the second quarter of 2019 Instruments had a very strong growth of approximately 19%. Endoscopy had US. organic sales growth of 6% reflecting strong performances in our sports medicine, general surgery, and video products. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 13.4% reflecting continued double-digit performance in our emergency care business. Internationally MedSurg had organic sales growth of 15.9%, reflecting strong growth in the endoscopy, instruments and medical businesses across Europe, Canada and Australia. Neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 15.5%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in all four of our neurotech businesses; CMF, neurovascular, neurosurgical and EMC [ph]. This also reflects very strong growth in our neurovascular business of approximately 30%. Our U.S. neurotech business posted an organic growth of 17.3%, highlighted by strong product growth in Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps, Maxface [ph], cryotherapy and nasal implants. Additionally, our U.S. Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of our products including hemorrhagic flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally Neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 28.8%. This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets, as well as Europe and Australia. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66% was favorable approximately 15 basis points from second quarter 2019. Compared to the second quarter in 2019 gross margin was primarily impacted by business mix and acquisitions primarily offset by price. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.6% of sales reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.4% of sales which was slightly better than the second quarter of 2019. This reflects our continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage offset by the impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.9% of sales, which is 5 basis points improvement over the second quarter of 2019. This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum combined with the disciplined ramp up in cost, offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. Based on our positive momentum, we continue to reiterate our up margin guidance for the year of 30 to 50 basis points improvement over 2019, excluding the impact of Wright Medical. Related to other income and expense, as compared to the second quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment earned on deposits and an increase in interest expense resulting from the additional debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 17% and was impacted by our mix of U.S., non-U.S. income and some adverse discrete tax items included in our provision to return adjustments. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 15.2%. For the full year, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5% with some variability in the remaining quarters, including a slightly lower rate in the third quarter and a more normalized rate in the fourth quarter. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. During the quarter we fully repaid the $400 million of term loan debt related to the borrowings incurred for the acquisition of Wright Medical. Year-to-date we have paid down $1.15 billion of debt. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.3 billion. This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. And now I will provide a summary of our revised guidance. Based on our performance and sales ramp in the second quarter, as well as our capital orders pipeline, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 10%. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be at least 6% for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Consistent with the upper range of our previous guidance, net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $0.10 in the full-year and this is included in our revised guidance range. Based on our performance in the first six months and including consideration of our improved full-year Wright Medical performance impact, controlled spend ramp to facilitate growth and continued positive recovery outlook, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.25 to $9 40. And now we will open the call up for Q&A. Yes I can't necessarily speak to our peers per se, but I will say, your question is maybe music to the ears of our GQO [ph] Group, and they have put a lot of focus in driving improved margins and also driving really good fixed cost leverage, and we will start to see that show up in our gross margins. We're still not guiding on gross margin, so I will say, we'll see that benefit but we will also see the benefit of mix come through which right now Wright Medical is a little bit of that influence that we're seeing on the margins. Offsetting those will be will be price, which typically is going to be the biggest thing. We'll still see that in the minus 1% range for the full year and we fully expect that that pricing impact will be roughly offset by a lot of that positivity that we are seeing and also the mix factor related to Wright Medical. Yes, so certainly OUS it's a much smaller business. I would say within the U.S. the tailwind of the shift to the ASC and RSC [ph] offenses, in addition to great cadence of new products has really fueled very strong growth. And we had a 20% growth in the first quarter in the U.S. in our sports medicine business. Yes, sure. I think first of all, as a baseline if you think about a normal operating margin that was acquired through Wright Medical was, it was significantly less than say Stryker's normal operating margin. So if you think what have we worked on during this integration period, it was really pulling Wright Medical up and trying to look for all the synergies that we had built into our model, so that we could drive better operating margins at Wright Medical. I think fast forwarding into next year and looking at where that might look on a combined basis, I think we'll get back to our normalized, up margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points. But at this point, that's a little ways away, and we're not really necessarily guiding for 2022."

            "content": "Thanks Kevin. My comments today will focus on the second quarter performance of our combined trauma and extremities business, including an update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical.  During the quarter our combined worldwide trauma and extremities business, including Wright Medical had a strong performance growing 7% compared to 2019. The performance in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. trauma and upper extremities businesses. The U.S. businesses were benefited by the recovery from COVID-19 related restrictions, which continues to outpace the rest of the world, as well as the ongoing execution of the U.S. selling integration. The trauma business unit was positively impacted by the reopening of economies and a continued strong performance of key products including T2 Alpha and the minifrac [ph] plating system. Our U.S. upper extremities business which remains number one in shoulder arthroplasty grew strong double-digits in the quarter behind continued strength within reverse arthroplasty portfolio with perform reverse and revision driving the growth. The upper extremities performance in the quarter was enhanced by the continued adoption of our BLUEPRINT planning software with approximately 50% of total shoulder cases completed using BLUEPRINT. As a result of the strong performance of our trauma and extremities business which grew approximately 5% in the first half of the year, we are confident in the combined business to grow at least 6% for the full year when compared to 2019. We are now about nine months into the integration of Wright Medical and we remain very pleased with the progress and efficiency at which the team is moving through the integration. The U.S. integration is pacing ahead of our expectations, and cross selling has begun in a limited capacity. We expect to continue to execute on our cross selling priorities during the second half of the year as we work to fortify the supply chain and the processes to support cross selling activities. Outside the U.S., the teams have successfully executed integration plans in several key markets, including the UK, Germany, France, Japan and China with further countries to follow into 2022. In addition to commercial activities, we are also executing on the integration of other operational areas including the consolidation of distribution and sales offices, harmonization of key operational processes and executing on our manufacturing site strategy. Within R&D, the team also continues to make progress on aligning the long-term portfolio, pipeline strategies, and harmonize design processes. While the team has moved through the integration, they have also remained focused on executing the critical existing projects in the pipeline. This includes the recent launch of the new Tornier Perform Humeral System, which offers clinical solutions for the simplest and most complex arthroplasty procedures and delivers on our mission to make healthcare better for surgeons and the patients they serve. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Hey Robbie, it is Preston. Just in terms of capital overall and we continue to see a pretty stable capital environment and if we've seen that really through the first couple of quarters and really evidenced by the continued strong sales in Medical as you'd said and also of course with our Mako technology. As it pertains specifically to Medical, so obviously we have the ProCuity Bed which I'll talk about in just a second, but we also have really strong performances out of our emergency care business. We've seen that in the last couple of quarters as well and so that continues to be very strong and it's just been an uptick there really in the in the U.S. and outside the U.S. With regards to ProCuity itself, the team is very pleased with how that launch has gone and started. We've really gotten a lot of awareness out there. We certainly have a lot of engagement from our customers, and we're starting to see building momentum in orders and sales in the U.S. and then starting to kick off that launch outside the U.S. as well. So we really expect that ProCuity is going to continue to be a driver for Medical really for the remainder of this year and as we go into next. Hey Matt, it is Preston. Just in terms of robots and mix, I mean one of the things that we identified approximately a year ago was that we were starting to see a bit of a trend towards financing. We haven't seen any significant changes in that approach or in that mix for the last year, so no big changes from a mix standpoint as we think about Mako and how we're selling Mako in the market. With regards to convergence, again we're still not seeing anything there. We've talked a lot about our excitement of a potential with Mako and shoulder, but nothing new to report in that area at this point. Yes man, nothing specific to report in that area. I mean, the one thing that we have seen throughout the pandemic is variability, and so certainly by geography and by area you're getting a lot of variability. So, again, nothing that I would I would specifically point you to in terms of our mix."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are also discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical integration. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. Despite the ongoing presence of the pandemic, we posted a strong quarter of organic sales growth of 4.7% versus Q1 2019. This was driven by outstanding international results, particularly in Asia Pacific and the benefits of our diversified business model. Across our franchises, Mako, neurotech and medical had excellent performances, each posting strong double-digit growth versus 2019, a trend that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year in these businesses. Mako followed up a very strong Q4 with a banner Q1 performance, including an uptake in international installations. As expected elective procedures were negatively impacted to start the year, which had the largest impact on our hip and knee businesses. However, the trends improved progressively throughout the quarter with the U.S. hip and knee accelerating in March and into April where we are seeing mid single-digit growth as compared to April, 2019. We also saw improved growth in small capital within parts of neurotech and instruments during the quarter. In addition, our order book has picked up across our capital businesses, which is a good sign of pending growth as procedure volumes return to more normal levels. These trends give us confidence in achieving our guidance of 8% to 10% full year organic sales growth compared to 2019, which is equivalent to 12% to 14% organic growth versus 2020 despite one less selling day. While the press release shows our performance versus both 2020 and 2019, we believe that 2019 is a better reference point for comparison. Our momentum has continued regarding cost management and cash flow, and while spending will increase to support future growth, it will be done in a disciplined manner. Glenn will elaborate on our raised EPS guidance shortly. We also published our first annual comprehensive report during the quarter, which captures our environmental, social and governance strategy as well as commitments regarding our carbon footprint, diversity, equity and inclusion and supply chain transparency. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in these areas. Overall, I am pleased with a strong start to the year and the momentum that is continuing to build. And while pandemic flashpoints are still occurring, we are well positioned to deliver growth at the high end of med tech with leveraged adjusted earnings. I will now turn the call over to Preston.\nPreston Wells: Thanks, Kevin. Our comments today will focus on the first quarter performance in our combined trauma and extremities business, an update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical and on our most recent acquisition activity. During the quarter, our combined trauma and extremities business showed good resiliency growing 2.6% including Wright Medical compared to 2019, despite the ongoing impacts of COVID restrictions during the quarter. Our trauma business, which is less elective in nature, benefited from inclement weather in the U.S. and Europe in February. Performance in upper extremities and foot and ankle was driven by the recovery of elective procedures throughout the quarter, along with lower than expected sales dis-synergies through the initial stages of the integration. As a result of the strong performance of our trauma and extremities business in the first quarter, we now expect the combined business to deliver a mid single-digit growth for the full year when compared to 2019. We remain encouraged with the progress and pace that the team has delivered with bringing the businesses together throughout the Wright Medical integration. As we have mentioned previously, we utilized the lengthy period from announced to close, to build and resource the robust integration plan that we are now executing. As we move through the quarter, our teams made progress against many key integration milestones. To date the team has established three distinct business units with specialized commercial, R&D and selling organizations. We believe this dedication and focus will be a core driver of future growth across trauma, upper extremities, and foot and ankle. In addition to establishing dedicated business units, the team made considerable progress with our U.S. sales integration, including the establishment of sales leadership, sales channel and territory alignment and identification of cross-selling priorities. Considerable progress has also been made on aligning the long-term portfolio and pipeline strategies. Our focus on the integration will remain a key priority for the remainder of 2021 as we balanced the complexity of the integration while minimizing sales disruption. Over the next few quarters, we will conclude the U.S. commercial integration, including the initiation of cross-selling. And we will kick off sales integrations across our international markets over the next several months. Finally, our dedicated business development teams continue to identify and execute on tuck-in acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of TMJ Concepts, a medical device company that manufactures a patient-specific temporomandibular joint reconstruction prosthesis system. And our craniomaxillofacial business, personalized medicine plays a critical role in the acquisition of TMJ Concepts supports their business strategy and driving category leadership through innovation and purpose of restoring form, function and hope to patients. These acquisitions continue to demonstrate our focus on our strategy of driving category leadership and market leading growth. With that I'll now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the [Technical Difficulty]. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our organic sales growth was 4.7% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q1 2019, and one less day than 2020. Compared to 2019 pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4% versus Q1 2020 pricing was 0.9% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.3% impact on sales. During the quarter, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related surgical procedure cancellation, primarily in the U.S. and Europe negatively impacted our sales. However, towards the end of the quarter, we did see improvements in sales momentum, primarily in the U.S. and our Asia-Pacific businesses. Also as noted in the fourth quarter, demand for certain capital products continued as we saw strong results in our Mako and emergency care products. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 1%, reflecting the continuing slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, medical products and neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 15% impacted by positive sales momentum in China, Japan, Australia and Canada. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.93 increased 2.7% from 2019 reflecting sales growth partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition, as well as an overall disciplined ramp-up in operating costs. Our first quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.03. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopedics at constant currency sales growth of 17.2% and organic sales decline of 0.7%, including an organic decline of 1.7% in the U.S. this reflects a slowdown in elected procedures related to COVID-19. Other ortho grew 49% in the U.S. primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. As noted previously, in March we began to see good sales momentum in our U.S. orthopedic businesses with all segments delivering positive organic growth as compared to till March 2019. Internationally orthopedics grew 1.5% organically, which reflects the COVID-19 related procedural slowdown and Gibson knees, especially in Europe offset by strong performances in Australia and Japan. For the quarter, our trauma and extremities business, which includes Wright Medical, delivered 2.6% growth on a comparable basis. This includes strong performances in U.S. shoulder and U.S. trauma. In the U.S. comparable growth was 4.4%. In the quarter MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 5.3%, which included 1.6% growth in the U.S. Instruments at U.S. organic sales declined of 3% primarily impacted by continued procedural slowdown that impacted its power tool business partially offset by gains in its waste management, smoke evacuation products and services business. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2019 instruments had a very strong growth of approximately 18%. Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 5.7%, reflecting a slowdown in some of the capital businesses, which was partially offset by gains in our general surgery, video and sports medicine businesses. The latter of which grew over 11% in the quarter. The medical division at U.S. organic sales growth at 13.6% reflecting double-digit performance and its emergency care and Sage businesses. Internationally MedSurg had an organic sales growth of 19.9% reflecting strong growth across Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan and medical endoscopy and instruments. Neurotechnology and spine had constant currency and organic growth of 12.8%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in our interventional spine, neurosurgical and ENT businesses and 27% growth in our neurovascular business. Our U.S. neurotech business posted an organic growth of 12% reflecting strong product growth in our neuro power drill, Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps, bioresorbable and nasal implants. Additionally, within our U.S. neurovascular business, we had significant growth in all product categories including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 31.7%. This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets. Now I will focus on operating highlights for the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.4% was unfavorable approximately 40 basis points from our first quarter 2019. Compared to the first quarter in 2019 gross margin was primarily impacted by price, acquisitions and business mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our adjusted SG&A was 35.2% of sales, which was unfavorable to the first quarter of 2019 by 70 basis points. In summary, for the quarter our adjusted operating margin was 23.5% of sale, which is 160 basis points decline over the first quarter of 2019. This reflects the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition combined with a disciplined ramp-up in cost to fuel future growth, as well as the two year compounding of certain costs given the comparison to 2019. We also reiterate our operating margin expansion guidance of 30 basis points to 50 basis points improvement over 2019 operating margin, excluding the impact of Wright Medical. Related to other income and expenses compared to the first quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13%, given our mix of income. Given our current circumstances and the outlook for the full year, we would expect to be at the lower end of our range for the full year guidance effective tax rate of 15.5% to 16.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.1 billion. During the quarter, we repaid $715 million of maturing debt. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $450 million. This performance reflects the results of earnings continued good management of working capital and approximately $170 million of one-time expenditures related to the Wright Medical integration. Based on our first quarter performance and the current operating environment, we continue to expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%. We believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography, and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be in the mid-single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year, and this has included in our revised guidance range. Based on our first quarter performance and including consideration of our improved full year Wright Medical sales impact, discipline's cost management and continued positive recovery outlook. We now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.05 to $9.30. And now I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Congrats on a good quarter and thanks for taking the question. So maybe first start on the outlook, Kevin, you mentioned in the release in the script that March was much better than the rest of the quarter overall with most items in ortho growing in just rowing in March. I was hoping you might give some early color or good way to had a frame second quarter here. Coming out of the fourth quarter call the street had a wide range, it didn't really update through the quarters trends developed. So I was hoping maybe you could start off with giving some thoughts on where second quarter might shake out given the trends you're seeing here exiting first quarter? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Hi, Robbie, first thing I would say is, if we're not going to be providing quarterly guidance, but I can give you an indication of what's happening. We did indicate in my prepared remarks that U.S. knees is currently growing in the mid-single digits, and that obviously was the business areas that were most impacted by the pandemic. So that recovery is pretty notable. If you look back in January and February, where we were declining and we at the end – by the end of March, we started to pull ahead into positive territory and you can see that that's on the upswing. Difficult to predict with the flash points around the pandemic, but you can see we feel very good about confirming the full year organic sales growth. So whether that occurs in April, May, June, July parsing it by month is obviously very difficult. The other thing that makes us very confident on the full year outlook is the order book for capital equipment, both large capital and small capital, which is both picking up. So overall we're feeling bullish, obviously growth has to accelerate to get to 8% to 10% organic when you start at 4.7% in the first quarter, but the exact pasting between Q2, Q3 and Q4 so little uncertain.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. That's really helpful. And maybe Glenn, it seems like a lot of the $0.10 dilution for Wright might've came in first quarter and earlier in the year. One is that true and second, any thoughts on just as we straighten our models out here, I realize you're not giving guidance but just had to think about the progression of EPS as we incorporate, Wright Medical here and some of the comments on expense management you've made earlier in the call? Appreciate it.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Robbie, if you just – if you just think about the activities that are going on related to the integration of Wright Medical, naturally we would be working on cost synergies early in the year and incurring a lot of the costs that we need to incur relative to integrating Wright Medical, as well as aligning our sales forces and all the things that Preston mentioned. A lot of that did flow through in Q1, and I think that impact was certainly reflected in our EPS. I think moving forward as we think about it, we are optimistic about where we stand relative to sales, the synergies and how that'll play out for the remainder of the year. And so a lot – some of that positivity is certainly reflected in our EPS guidance and we fully expect that that benefit will also contribute to sort of raising the guidance like we did. And then as it relates to the cost management and how that'll play out in a year, we are encouraging divisions to ramp up some of their sending's to make sure that we are properly positioned for growth that would also include spending in innovation. And so we are making sure that we are not doing anything to hold back product development and other innovation spending that frankly will be needed to really fuel growth even towards the end of this year or even next year. So I think we'll see growth in that spending. And then, we did learn a lot from the experience that we went through and how we work. And so there are some benefits and savings that we fully expect to realize in the full year, as it relates to primarily SG&A costs. And so it's kind of a balance of those things that really get us to a lot of the confidence we had in raising our guide.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. One, Glenn, back on the guidance questions here. Is the assumption to your back half perhaps we're looking to double-digit organic growth versus 2019? Is that a reasonable assumption, just given how we're seeing procedures come back, maybe your commentary on mid-single growth in April, it seems like back half will be double-digit, is that a reasonable assumption?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, I think, Vijay, you could probably do the math as easily as I can, in terms of what it will take in the back half of the year to really get to the 8% to 10%. But yes, we do see accelerating growth and we'll see accelerating growth throughout Q2, in fact, underlying some of these assumptions is that Q2 has sort of a return to normalcy by the time we get to the end, and then we'll continue to see great growth in Q3 and Q4.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful. Kevin, one, for you on that capital trends in the quarter. I think I heard you say strong capital trends, looking at the other line item within ortho; I mean that was 45%, 50%, that's a big number. Is that – was there any catch-up from last year or what's driving any sense on how Mako placements are trending? Is there an acceleration in the end market? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. As you saw we had a terrific fourth quarter with Mako and that continued into the first quarter. So it was an absolute banner first quarter for Mako, and what we saw really was an acceleration in the international markets. The U.S. continued its tremendous positive momentum, but we saw real pickup. As you know, we proceed total new approval in some new markets at towards the end of last year. And we started to see those Mako installations happening in the first quarter. So it was really Mako around the world that was booming in the first quarter and that gives us a lot of optimism, because that's an early indicator of future implants growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nPito Chickering: Good morning, guys for taking my questions. Neurovascular was very strong this quarter. Can you give us some more color on what you think your end markets grew versus market share gains? Can you give any color on some key products like the Atlas Stents or the Surpass flow diverter? And also it's been growing very, very well in China. Just curious, what's driving that growth and how sustainable do you think that is?\nPreston Wells: Hey, Pito its Preston. Just wanted to follow-up with on your neurovascular question. I mean, I'd say overall we're really pleased with the double-digit growth and I think certainly, we've seen in the past that that market has been accelerating. But I do think with some of those launches that you mentioned, we are seeing shared gains in that space as well. So those launches that we had throughout 2020, we're really starting to capitalize as we've gotten into 2021. And so seeing good growth across a variety of those items, including flow to varying stands and our aspiration products. As it relates to China, it again same thing as we brought in technologies to those markets and been able to grow there, similar to how we've done in our other markets with neurovascular. And so we really are looking forward to a strong year in total as we think about that neurovascular business.\nKevin Lobo: Just to compare, kind of just add one comment. I just think we have an really incredible leadership team of neurovascular. This is not just a one-quarter wonder. I mean, they've been putting up tremendous numbers quarter-after-quarter and as Preston said, the product cycle is really hitting beautifully across all of our categories. So this will be a very strong year.\nPito Chickering: Excellent. And as a quick follow-up question that you referenced strength at the end of the quarter for U.S. and Asia is obviously uneasy comps. Can you give us any color of what you saw in the end markets in Europe, in other key markets in March? Thanks so much.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So just in terms of some of those other markets, I mean, I think as we know, Europe was a little bit behind in terms of some of the recovery. I mean, we saw some areas like the UK that might've been a little bit out in front. But certainly as we saw the continued impact on procedural volumes from the fourth quarter, we saw similar impacts in Europe really throughout the quarter. But similar to how we saw the U.S. and some of those other areas, we did see improvements as we ended the quarter. And so again, as Glenn mentioned, our expectation as we go into second quarter is that we're getting back to more normalized levels. Of course, there's some other markets that are out there, like in Latin America and certainly with India that will remain a little bit impacted by the coronavirus restrictions, et cetera. But as far as Europe and in U.S. and especially in Asia-Pacific, as we talk about there, we do expect those markets to get back to more normal levels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. You may proceed\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just two big picture questions for me; one, on ASC's, Kevin, J&J said that about 15% to 20% of hip and knee procedures now being done in ASC's. What are your thoughts on this trend? How are you positioned Stryker to tap into this shift. And I guess everybody's concerned is applications for implant pricing? And I had one follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Larry, I would say that 15% to 20% might be a little high, but there's no doubt that the trend is increasing and increasing pretty rapidly. We are delighted with the ASC offense that we put together really over the last two years. We have a unique way that we go to the market for ASC, a new sales organization that we created, and we really bring the best of Stryker because we have everything they need in the ASC. We have guns, we have lights, we have power tools, we have Neptune waste management, we have operating tables, we have hips and knees and sports medicine, and foot and ankle and shoulder [Technical Difficulty] compared to kind of historical norms. And so I think if you take all of those into account in context of that, 8% to 10%, you can get a sense of where we think hips and knees are going to be.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. You may proceed.\nMatt Miksic: Hi, thanks so much for taking the questions. I'm just wondering on the guidance and a follow-up on some of the pipeline and some of the investments you're making. So just to talk a little bit about the EPS raise a bit more, I'm curious if it's – it sounds like part of that is confidence in and returning to growth on the top line. I'm just wondering if that's the case; why not take up the top line guide slightly? As I mentioned I've one follow-up.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Well, first of all we're just through the first quarter. And so the – there's lots of twists and turns here in the next three quarters. I would say that the fundamental thing on the guidance, a couple thing is that it boils down to a lot of the optimism that we're seeing around many of our current businesses. We're definitely not unhappy at all with our Q1 earnings performance or Q1 top line performance. And so I do think that as we accelerated through the quarter and what we're seeing in April, we feel pretty good about our prospects for the remainder of the year. Kevin referenced our order books, which are certainly a good indicator of where future sales could land. So we just feel like there's very solid momentum on that across many, many of our businesses. We also have strong underpin of discipline costs, which is going to help EPS. And I just think that all of that combined with also the progress that we're making on, Wright Medical just gives us the confidence that we felt like we should raise our guidance, which is why we didn't.\nMatt Miksic: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. Then just, you mentioned also in the operating margin sort of puts and takes that you had sort of continued your discipline investment. And I think you said innovation and growth programs, which I think many investors appreciate. You wondering if you could maybe put a finer point on that in terms of basis points, and then also maybe more importantly talk a little bit about what the first or second most important or near-term project or program is in that stack of innovation that we might see say later in the year or for next year?\nKevin Lobo: Hey, Matt, I think if you look at it in terms of investment, as we think about the quarter in particular, and even as we go forward, I think you can probably just look at the rate of the percent of sales in terms of the investment that we've made in R&D this quarter compared to previous quarters. And you'll see that it's a bit elevated over our historical norms, which is, I think what Glenn's referencing in terms of additional investments and making sure that we're being disciplined about how we spend against innovation and in our R&D platforms. As it relates to future projects, I mean, the part of the beauty of our model is that the decentralized nature of it allows each of our business units really to focus in on those projects that are important to them as they track for growth as we go forward. And so really that, that innovation and that investment is being made across all of our businesses. And as we have items that make sense to talk about in this type of forum, we'll certainly do so in terms of new launches and key product innovations that be coming to market in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi Bank. You may proceed.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you for taking the question and good afternoon. Two questions [indiscernible] front. What are your debt goals or debt pay down goals? I'm not sure how you're measuring it, whether it is sort of the debt to EBITDA metric over a certain period of time or net debt that you're aiming towards. And then Wright Medical [indiscernible] correctly, that's integrating somewhat faster than expected. And I'd be curious what you see as sort of surprise in that integration? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Hi, Joanne. In terms of debt pay down goals and we've been pretty clear with the rating agencies on this as well. We really look at debt to EBITDA as well as the ratio that we focus on and really bring it back down to kind of what are our historical levels 2.5 times roughly. If you think about the next couple of years, it means a pay down of $2 billion, $2 billion plus in terms of what we'll do. We – if you think about what we paid-off in the fourth quarter and what we paid-off this quarter, we're about a billion towards that goal. We probably have an opportunity to pay down a little more debt this year that we'll take advantage of too. And so that's where we think we'll land. Once we do that, we think we'll be in a solid territory to sort of accelerate our programs around looking at sort of larger opportunities. But the organization is very focused on cash flow in reaching those debt pay down goals.\nGlenn Boehnlein: And maybe I'll take the question on, on Wright Medical. I would say we're off to a very good start. So far so very good with the Wright Medical integration its proceeding much more quickly than K2M which was our first overlap deal. And I would say I'm delighted with the products, the people and the pipeline that we've acquired with Wright Medical. And really, if I think back to all the deals we've done in recent history, maybe Nolvadex is the only other deal I would say that's kind of in the same ballpark as this one in terms of the speed of integration, the speed of decision making. We have mixed management teams that are leading a lot of the Wright Medical leadership has come over. So key leadership roles and the momentum is terrific, and we had baked in a certain level of this synergies. And even on the cost side, I think we're making progress a little bit more quickly than we had expected. So overall delighted with very arbitrary medical and the future is very bright.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman from BTIG. You may proceed.\nRyan Zimmerman: Great. Thank you for taking the question. So want to ask first about the U.S. spine market and you flap now the K2M acquisition and so common in kind of your assessment of your spine franchise and your expectations for getting back to market growth in that business? And then my second question is just around you call up the Sage business and it seems like it was very strong this quarter in medical. And so is there – is there some dynamic of kind of pantry reloading on the expectation that procedures could be picking up sooner? Just how to think about that cadence within that business going forward? Thank you.\nPreston Wells: Hey, Ryan, it's Preston. I'll take both of those questions. So from a spine perspective, I think overall, we're very encouraged by the performance that we've seen in our spine business over the last several quarters. Certainly it's being enhanced by enabling technologies, certainly our recent acquisition of Mobius being a part of that. And I think the other thing I would just point out to you as we think about spine in relation to some of the other implant businesses; we certainly didn't see the same level of impact as a result of the COVID restrictions, particularly across this last quarter. Like we saw on some of the other implant businesses, which is something to keep in mind when you think about the performance, but overall, like I said, we're encouraged by the performance and we're – with high expectations in terms of our spine business getting back to market levels and continuing to perform that way. As it relates to this Sage, I think you hit it, I mean, really it's a product that certainly was impacted by the procedural slowdowns. And so as hospitals ramp back-up and get ready for that, the procedures to pick back-up, there's an element of Sage that we'll pick back-up in terms of stocking to get ready. But at the same time, I think it also began to see the flow through that's happening from a stage perspective, as well as, as more and more procedures are done in that catch-up of the recovery process.\nRyan Zimmerman: Got it. Thanks for taking questions.\nKevin Lobo: Its Kevin, I'd just like to add one comment. I think our medical business sometimes gets a little underestimated and the reason is you have three different components of it. You have the acute care, the bed instructors and we have a brand new bed per acuity that was launched towards the end of last year, that'll have four models, two of those models will be launched a little later this year. That'll drive very strong growth for that business and then you have the emergency care, which is the defibrillators and the district ambulance costs, and then you have the Sage of business. And so you have three different businesses that frankly had – last year you had a little bit more contribution from acute care and emergency care and not so much from Sage. This year you're going to have a lot more Sage, emergency care is going well and acute care should pick-up as we get into the latter course of this year. So overall it really is a much more stable high-growth business than it was a decade ago, based on the acquisitions of both Physio-Control and...\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you for taking the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. You may proceed.\nChris Pasquale: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Glenn, one quick one for you, and then one on the business unit. Just wanted to confirm with the guidance, how much of the change in EPS guidance was related to change in expectations for currency versus operational performance? It wasn't clear to me what the components were there?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Chris, we basically incurred some positivity at $0.03 in Q1, and we think the full year will have an impact of $0.05 to $0.10 just there's still some variability out there. So that's where we got it in.\nChris Pasquale: I guess, relative to the original guidance. Was there a delta there, or is that the same as you were expecting with the original EPS range?\nGlenn Boehnlein: There's a really it's wordsmithing, I mean the original guidance we taught it would be $0.01, affirm $0.10 and now we're sort of more thinking that we might see a range of $0.05 to $0.10.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jeffries. You may proceed.\nAnthony Petrone: Hi, thank you. Just a couple of questions, one on robotics, one on Wright Medical. On robotics, just trying to get a sense of sort of the competitive landscape, we're hearing quite a bit about the J&J develops robot launch here pending, and so just wondering if there was any sort of impact in the 1Q numbers, perhaps a bigger selling effort ahead of a competitive launch. And then secondly, on Wright, when we think about sort of settling at mid-single digit growth pre-acquisition that was a high single-digit grower. I'm just wondering if we can sort of break that out between the synergy and pandemic. And so what is the timing to get back to that high single digit growth rate? Thanks a lot.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So with regards to your question on robotics, I mean, from our perspective, really nothing's changed in our focus and what you saw in the first quarter really is just a continuation of the effort that we had since we launched Mako and so we're really seeing that the uptick as a result of just selling in our technology. And overall, we really remain bullish about Mako and what it brings. Other competitive systems like VELYS or ROSA haven't slowed us down at all. And if anything, what they've done is they've increased the validation that robotics are going to stay and really demand for Mako and our technology continues to be super strong as we saw by the results we posted. And then also, we believe we have the best solution. And so from a head-to-head comparison it's something that we look forward to with the technologies that are on the market today. As you think about Wright Medical and again the high single digits, I mean, it's all inclusive in there. Obviously, we're coming off of a pandemic or still kind of coming out of the end of the pandemic, so there is certainly some impact there. There are dis-synergies that are associated with the deal itself. And then there is also just the integration happening in terms of the Wright business and our own business through cross-selling and things like that. So, it's not something that we've parsed out in terms of the different components of it. I think what we can expect to see is that as we work through the integration we'll get out of total trauma and extremities business back up to performing above market growth.\nAnthony Petrone: Yes, thanks a lot.\nKevin Lobo: The key thing to remember at the middle – mid single digit growth that includes our existing trauma business. So that wasn't just for the Wright Medical portion right. That's the combined trauma and extremities. And so Wright Medical will be a faster growing component of the combined trauma and extremities business, but obviously wasn't in the first quarter just because of the pandemic.\nAnthony Petrone: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. You may proceed.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi, guys. First question I know you haven't been providing Mako numbers in recent quarters. I was wondering if you could give us your perspective on where U.S. market penetration is today. Any color you can provide and where you think we're at penetration wise from a procedure placement perspective – from a market perspective would be really helpful.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I mean, obviously, we're not providing specifics on the quarter, but I think if you go back and look at what we said in the fourth quarter that will give you some sense of where we are in total installation base both from a U.S. or a global perspective, and you can make some assumptions about what that might mean U.S. versus international. But if you think about what that total placement is, and you think about the fact that there is the potential for 4,500 or so hospitals that could carry a Mako that just gives you a sense of where we are penetration wise. But even then I would tell you that that many of these hospitals are able to take more than just one. So I think the bottom line with all of that is it's still early days in terms of penetration. So there is a lot of opportunity out there in terms of robotics and taking Mako and taking more than one Mako as we look forward.\nSteven Lichtman: Got it, great. And then Glenn, you mentioned relative to Wright, obviously integration going better and you're up – the top line is part of the operating margin confidence also some pull forward of the expense synergies that you were expecting? Or is that still yet to come as well?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, I think, it's a fair assessment. We're executing very well on the cost synergies that were planned in our modeling. And so, we are going to see a little bit of that favorability that's flowing through the revised guidance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, you called out a strong China results in the quarter. Could you just maybe talk a little bit in more detail about what you're seeing now over the next 12 months? And what your expectations are moving through 2021? And just sticking with APAC for a second, kind of what's your enthusiasm for Mako in China and Japan? Is 2021 an inflection year for these countries? Or should we see more gradual adoption in the near-term?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So, first of all, China had a terrific first quarter as you know that the pandemic is not really affecting day to day life in China. And they had a very – obviously in 2019 – even going back to 2019, we had terrific growth, but obviously last year was very badly affected in the first quarter if you compare to 2020. So China as a whole, we're very small in China relative to other companies, but we grew incredibly fast in very, very high double-digit growth in Q1. The outlook for China for us is still very positive given our lower relative market shares. It will be a very good Mako market with just getting started in China. I would say Japan – certainly Australia is farther ahead of where we are in China. So it's early days, but very promising, very encouraging. The one negative for China, of course, is this trend towards volume-based procurement, which you've seen in the cardiac stents. And we know that that's going to come down the pipe in effect a couple of our businesses hasn't yet but starting to and there'll be noise around that. But overall China for us still remains a high priority markets and will be a growth market for us just given our relative position, but even as it relates to Mako that'll be carved out of the tendering related to volume-based procurement. So we still have that significant runway for robotics both in Japan and China. Those are going to be both big markets and then we're very excited about our progress in both of those.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you and just a question for Glenn. Glenn, you mentioned momentum continues for cash flow. Could you just give us some more color on your efforts to drive cash flow kind of as discretionary expenses come back? Just how is Stryker focused on cash flow generation today maybe versus 12, 24 months ago? Thank you.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, I think one of the things that we got the whole organization garnered around over the course of 2020 was just the importance of cash flow and good management of that cash flow just so we can operate the company at reduced revenue level levels, but then also just so we could reallocate that cash flow to areas that provide better returns in terms of M&A and things like that. So I do think organizationally we are well positioned relative to manage cash flow. We have efforts ongoing in terms of moving a lot more of our collections to standardized shared service centers. We have efforts in inventory management and working very closely with the businesses, so that we can forecast inventory needs better. We also look at distribution strategies that sort of are more efficient in terms of how much inventory we have to have on hand to serve customers. And then lastly, we are also working with our vendors in terms of accounts payable and how do we have more favorable terms in terms of payment terms on accounts payable. And so all of that is just really tightening up our working capital, certainly will benefit us this year as we look at improving the results of cash flow.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. You may proceed.\nMatt Taylor: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So I wanted to ask about your guidance. Last quarter you were asked about what the swing factor was between the high and the low end. And you said that basically the big one was how quickly things come back in Q2. If they came back better on the front end, you could be near the high end and on the back end near the low end, if that makes sense. So is that still how you're thinking about it? And based on the trends that you're seeing is that leaning you towards the high or the low end of guidance for the year?\nKevin Lobo: Thanks, Matt. So as we think about it again, we provided the range because of the variability that exists. And certainly, as we think about where we're headed, we're happy with what happened in the first quarter. And as we – with the momentum that we're taking into the second quarter, and certainly if we continue to have great momentum, obviously it means a good thing for us as we think about our overall sales. But we put the guidance range out there for exactly that reason, because there's still a lot of variability that's happening across the different marketplaces. So I think that's how I would think about it. And certainly as we come in to our second quarter results, we'll have another update that we'll be able to talk about that.\nMatt Taylor: Okay. And then you mentioned a couple of times you've got a strong order book, which is a good sign. I was hoping you could characterize that for us a little bit better in terms of maybe the percentage of your sales that its impact directly or indirectly, could you talk about it as an indicator for the implants and just kind of the timing of that? When does that start to land and how long does it last that help us think about how that impacts the forecast?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah, so, I think when we talk about our order book, generally, it's in reference because we think about our capital businesses, because those items are being placed in some cases well in advance as you think about our larger capital items or even the smaller capital items, the orders that are coming in there. So it's just the leading indicator as we look at those businesses. And so really when we talk about capital, we've talked about capital before as being about 15% or so being our small capital and about 9% or 10% being our large capital items as we think about as a percent of our total business. So I think if you think about those items, those are the ones that we're talking about when we reference our order book, it generally is impacting us 25 or so percent of our business. And again, it's just the leading indicator as we think about return – a return to procedures and also just the strength of our customers in terms of their financial positions as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Matson from Needham and Company. You may proceed.\nMike Matson: Hi. I wanted to ask one on M&A. After you did the Wright acquisition, I really haven't seen as many deals and there was a pandemic last year, so it's probably not too surprising given everything that was going on, but how do you kind of balance the need to digest the Wright deal, integrate the – that company with Stryker versus the funnel for M&A, and just put the valuations on some of these companies out there now?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, no, a good question. As we talked about when we did the Wright deal, obviously it was the largest deal in our history. And so one of the things we talked about as well, we've go through the integration of Wright that we would continue to focus on M&A, but the focus that we'll have on M&A will be more of a tuck-in variety. So as we look at placing either smaller products or more technologies into our existing businesses. And so we go back to the end of the year. We had the OrthoSensor acquisition, and then we just talked about today, the TMJ Concepts acquisition. So you'll continue to see those types of acquisitions in the near-term as we continue to go through the integration of Wright and the debt pay down that we've talked about as well. So I think that's how I would think about acquisitions for us as we think about going forward. I mean one key point is that we're always looking. We have dedicated business development teams as part of our commercial business units, and they're always out there evaluating the landscape and looking at targets, so that whenever the opportunity presents itself, we're able to take advantage of it.\nMike Matson: Okay, thanks. And then just want to ask one on spine. So you get good growth there on the spine business. And I suspect you're probably outperforming the market, but do you have any sense for the degree to which that that market was affected by the procedural slow down in the first quarter, early part of the first quarter as opposed to the hip and knee market?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So as we think about spine, the only thing that we can look at is what's happened over the last several quarters. And I think what we see with spine, even as we look at our own business, is that it's not as impacted. I mean, it certainly is impacted as there's elective component of it, but it's generally more emergent as we think about spine versus another the hip and knee business, for example. And so, we haven't seen the same level of slowdown as we think about where that lands in regards to the total market. I think as we come through the pandemic, it's just something we're going to have to continue to evaluate and once we get into a more normalized side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter from SVB Leerink. You may proceed.\nRichard Newitter: Just for Kevin, you mentioned mid single-digit trajectory relative to 2019 for hips and knees. Those are different businesses with different deferral characteristics throughout COVID and they also have different comps in the 2019 period. So I was just curious, should we be thinking of knees as being substantially higher than that mid single digits and maybe hips dragged that down to an average of mid single digits. I'm just trying to get a sense of difference between the two categories, especially given where the backlog is coming?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, so, so first of all, I don't want to get too carried away with one month of comp, right. It's a very positive sign. Both are in the mid single digit range. And I'm not going to sort of say, which is higher than the other one. They're both are doing mid single-digit growth versus April of last year. But again, you're talking about 25 days of selling days roughly between two years apart. And so, it's definitely a change from the trajectory we saw in the first three months of the year and a positive change, but I don't want to get too excited about that. It's just an indication, a data point for you that tells you things are improving, volumes are coming back, but it's not really providing you guidance with which hips and knees, which one is going to be performing better than the other one. They're both coming back and that's a good sign overall.\nRichard Newitter: Okay. Thanks and then just a follow-up. You've mentioned some dynamics in spine relative to the recovery January to March. Could you talk a little bit about some of your other elective in nature procedure areas like sports medicine, maybe EMT and just talk a little bit about what the recovery is looking like there and prospects for back half thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. Those are actually recovering very well, right. Sports medicine, I think, we have mentioned in our prepared remarks grew double-digits in the first quarter. It actually grew double-digits in the fourth quarter last year. So we're delighted that those procedures are done in surgery centers where you frankly, haven't seen the same degree of slow down as we have in the inpatient hospital. EMT was the most negatively impacted when the pandemic started because they are [indiscernible] procedures. We're seeing that have a nice rebound. And so both of those areas are going to be strong performers and strong contributors to grow in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of from Kaila Krum from Truist Securities. You may proceed.\nKaila Krum: Great. Hi, thanks for taking our questions. So can you just speak a little bit in a little bit more detail about the TMJ Concepts acquisition you mentioned on the call, just the rationale, how important or significant that could be just any additional detail there would be helpful?\nKevin Lobo: Sure. So as we think about that acquisition, and again it fits the overall strategy that we have in terms of finding products and technologies that are out there and really fitting them into our sales forces hands to help them really go out and serve the surgeons and the customers and patients that they serve. So with TMJ Concepts really it's adding that TMJ prosthesis product to the bag that's allowing us to go in and really service customers and patients that are actually in that position of needing that replacement.\nGlenn Boehnlein: But I would say overall, it's a very small deal. So this is not something that's going to really hit your radar screen for the overall size of Stryker. It's very meaningful to our CMF business, very meaningful to the oral maxillofacial surgeon, but not a big mover of the needle for overall Stryker. And so, you'll see that as we report our results. We'll report that in the acquisition column, you'll be able to see that, but it's a very small nothing that's going to be really meaningful to the overall strength.\nKaila Krum: Got it. Okay, helpful. And then just high level, Kevin, I'd love to just hear what you're hearing from your hospital customers in recent months. I mean, you mentioned you're seeing more of a shift to ASCs. Are there any other sort of interesting trends in the market you're hearing about that have surprised you either to the positive or negative and recent dialogue with your customers? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Nothing, I wouldn't say surprising Kaila, but I would say is that the shift to the ASC, every hospital you speak to has programs underway. And so, that was already happening prior to the pandemic. It is definitely accelerating. That's probably the most notable thing I would say. The other thing is that they're actually in pretty good financial position. So unlike prior crises that we've gone through, whether it was the financial meltdown or other issues, the hospital liquidity is actually very good. And so, there was a pause for a little while on some of the capital, certainly the smaller capital, but as procedures are coming back, we're seeing that through our order book that hospitals are in actually very good financial position and better than frankly I would have expected when the pandemic first hit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line is Jeff Johnson from Baird. You may proceed.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Two just clarifying questions if I could. Preston, you were talking about the spine market and good to hear that it's a little more emergent and maybe not as pressured as much in 1Q as the hip and knee market, but I'm assuming the pass-through payments on SpineJack helped a decent amount with 1Q. So when I look at you're down 2% U.S. spine versus the down 7%, 8% U.S. hip and knee. Is that about the right way to think about a six point differential in core spine versus hip and knee market growth at this point? Or would that differential be less than that if we kind of exclude some of those benefits, I'm assuming you got on the interventional side?\nPreston Wells: Yes. I mean, I think, it's again being that we're right in the middle of the pandemic, there's a lot of regional variability with this. I mean, I think any – to take any number in absolute is probably not the right bet, but I think certainly there is that gap there that –driven by that less emergent impact if you think about hips and knees versus spine. So, I mean, I think if you take some gap in that small single digit range, that's probably about right.\nJeff Johnson: All right, fair enough. And Kevin, I thought it’s interesting your comments on the ASCs and the five business units typically be involved in a contract. I think historically, and correct me if I'm wrong, but historically you said there is not a lot of bundling that goes out at the hospital level, cross business units, things like that at this point, obviously in the ASCs that seems to be happening more. Does that mean your incremental share gains at ASC should be even greater than what we've seen historically on the hospital side for you guys? It just seems like you're so well positioned there given the diversification of the business model.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, it's a great point. There is a very different buying that occurs at the ASC than it does in the hospital. The hospitals have very elaborate procurement divisions and departments and they buy by service line and it's very decentralized. The ASC is a very simple sort of customer that you have to interact with. They're not as many people. They can't perceive 22 Stryker sales people. They don't want to, and that's not the way they want to do business. So we have a different offense for the ASC. And fortunately we have a portfolio for the orthopedic ASC, which includes sports that is just perfect for what they're looking for. And so, yes, we've adapted our offense. We have the portfolio, but it is a very different buying pattern. The hospital isn't as interested frankly and looking across our different divisions and hasn't historically been as interested, but the ASC customers certainly is. And the good news is we've adapted our offense. If we had continued with our – the same way we used to sell, we wouldn't be having the success that we're having now. And really I'm optimistic about this continuing in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien from Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nKorinne Wolfmeyer: Hi, this is Korinne on for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one quick one for us. Can you talk a little bit about how Mako hip is going and how you expect it to perform for the remainder of the year?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. So the Mako hip application if you remember, we launched it last year, but we really couldn't get it out to all of our customers because of pandemic. We've got roughly 50%, maybe a little bit more than 50% of the accounts have the new software, so it's not as simple as just sort of doing an upload over the web of the software. We actually have to go to the account, put the software on and do it in servicing with our customers because there is new information they have to learn. So there's actually a training regimen that goes with it. So, right now, we're excited about the procedure growth in hip is increasing as more and more accounts have the software installed and are in serviced by our Stryker team. This will continue through the second quarter, probably through a good part of the third quarter before all of the accounts have the new hip software, but the feedback from the surgeon customer is terrific. There's – it takes less time to register, so that speeds up the overall procedure time. And there is some very valuable information such as pelvic tilt, but surgeons find that very beneficial to make sure they're managing like length discrepancies. And so, the feedback again very positive, but we're still in the throes of this implementation and it does take time because it requires that that high touch in servicing and due to the pandemic we haven't been able to move as quickly as we would like in all of our accounts and all of our regions.\nKorinne Wolfmeyer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.\nJosh Jennings: Kevin, just two questions on the knee business. First just, you've had unprecedented success with your strategy of pairing robotics with the triathlon implant. Do you see any knee now that – the other three of the big four have introduced robotic platforms to pivot from that strategy and how do you see implants evolving from here, the implants the robotics era? And then the second question is just – sorry, the ASC question, but for knees, are you overrepresented in the ASCs? That's our assumption just wanted to sanity check that do you have a higher share at ASCs than the rest of the U.S.? And you just received approval for patient specific instrumentation for the triathlon. And can you help us to understand how that improves your competitive positioning, particularly in ASCs? Thanks for taking the questions.\nKevin Lobo: Okay, great. There are a few questions in there, so I'll try to cover them all. So, first of all, the ASC is an area that we welcome. We're having success with Mako, frankly, in the ASC, more success than I would have imagined, honestly, two years ago when we initially signed the deal with Conformis, that deal was designed to really have a very simple solution for the ASC customer that is not using Mako. And there will be ASCs, the deals – some of the deals we've won don't involve a Mako where they will use manual procedures. That's where this solution will be terrific because it requires much less sterilization and is really custom designed for the ASC. So, we're excited to get that FDA approval and we look forward to being able to offer that to our ASC customers. I think you asked about market share. I don't know, Preston, do you have a feel for whether we're over-indexed in ASCs? I think it's fairly representative at this point.\nPreston Wells: Yes, I think it's fairly representative at this point. I mean, obviously, it's a growing segment, but I think that are representative right now.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, and it's still early, but we like our chances of being able to do very well. And as it relates to the implants, I would tell you in the short-term no real need to change anything. We're going to continue to have high – high adoption of robotics. We have cementless that continues to grow as we talked about in the fourth quarter, over 40% of our knees are cementless, but that still has a long runway to go. Longer-term I do think of different types of implants that are more bone sparing that don't use [indiscernible], but those will require IDE trials. But it's that I think something that is able to keep the ACL in place, it is something – is an area that we're exploring more from a science standpoint. So nothing that'd be launched imminently, but I do think that will be the future is new kinds of implants that are thinner, that are occurred that only a robot will be able to – to be able to implement into a patient. So that's kind of the longer-term future, but in the near-term, let's say call it the next two, three years, I think we're very pleased with the portfolio we have and a long runway for continued growth.\nJosh Jennings: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: So, thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q2 results with you in July. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Lobo",
            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical integration. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. Despite the ongoing presence of the pandemic, we posted a strong quarter of organic sales growth of 4.7% versus Q1 2019. This was driven by outstanding international results, particularly in Asia Pacific and the benefits of our diversified business model. Across our franchises, Mako, neurotech and medical had excellent performances, each posting strong double-digit growth versus 2019, a trend that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year in these businesses. Mako followed up a very strong Q4 with a banner Q1 performance, including an uptake in international installations. As expected elective procedures were negatively impacted to start the year, which had the largest impact on our hip and knee businesses. However, the trends improved progressively throughout the quarter with the U.S. hip and knee accelerating in March and into April where we are seeing mid single-digit growth as compared to April, 2019. We also saw improved growth in small capital within parts of neurotech and instruments during the quarter. In addition, our order book has picked up across our capital businesses, which is a good sign of pending growth as procedure volumes return to more normal levels. These trends give us confidence in achieving our guidance of 8% to 10% full year organic sales growth compared to 2019, which is equivalent to 12% to 14% organic growth versus 2020 despite one less selling day. While the press release shows our performance versus both 2020 and 2019, we believe that 2019 is a better reference point for comparison. Our momentum has continued regarding cost management and cash flow, and while spending will increase to support future growth, it will be done in a disciplined manner. Glenn will elaborate on our raised EPS guidance shortly. We also published our first annual comprehensive report during the quarter, which captures our environmental, social and governance strategy as well as commitments regarding our carbon footprint, diversity, equity and inclusion and supply chain transparency. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in these areas. Overall, I am pleased with a strong start to the year and the momentum that is continuing to build. And while pandemic flashpoints are still occurring, we are well positioned to deliver growth at the high end of med tech with leveraged adjusted earnings. I will now turn the call over to Preston. Hi, Robbie, first thing I would say is, if we're not going to be providing quarterly guidance, but I can give you an indication of what's happening. We did indicate in my prepared remarks that U.S. knees is currently growing in the mid-single digits, and that obviously was the business areas that were most impacted by the pandemic. So that recovery is pretty notable. If you look back in January and February, where we were declining and we at the end – by the end of March, we started to pull ahead into positive territory and you can see that that's on the upswing. Difficult to predict with the flash points around the pandemic, but you can see we feel very good about confirming the full year organic sales growth. So whether that occurs in April, May, June, July parsing it by month is obviously very difficult. The other thing that makes us very confident on the full year outlook is the order book for capital equipment, both large capital and small capital, which is both picking up. So overall we're feeling bullish, obviously growth has to accelerate to get to 8% to 10% organic when you start at 4.7% in the first quarter, but the exact pasting between Q2, Q3 and Q4 so little uncertain. Yes. As you saw we had a terrific fourth quarter with Mako and that continued into the first quarter. So it was an absolute banner first quarter for Mako, and what we saw really was an acceleration in the international markets. The U.S. continued its tremendous positive momentum, but we saw real pickup. As you know, we proceed total new approval in some new markets at towards the end of last year. And we started to see those Mako installations happening in the first quarter. So it was really Mako around the world that was booming in the first quarter and that gives us a lot of optimism, because that's an early indicator of future implants growth. Just to compare, kind of just add one comment. I just think we have an really incredible leadership team of neurovascular. This is not just a one-quarter wonder. I mean, they've been putting up tremendous numbers quarter-after-quarter and as Preston said, the product cycle is really hitting beautifully across all of our categories. So this will be a very strong year. Yes. So just in terms of some of those other markets, I mean, I think as we know, Europe was a little bit behind in terms of some of the recovery. I mean, we saw some areas like the UK that might've been a little bit out in front. But certainly as we saw the continued impact on procedural volumes from the fourth quarter, we saw similar impacts in Europe really throughout the quarter. But similar to how we saw the U.S. and some of those other areas, we did see improvements as we ended the quarter. And so again, as Glenn mentioned, our expectation as we go into second quarter is that we're getting back to more normalized levels. Of course, there's some other markets that are out there, like in Latin America and certainly with India that will remain a little bit impacted by the coronavirus restrictions, et cetera. But as far as Europe and in U.S. and especially in Asia-Pacific, as we talk about there, we do expect those markets to get back to more normal levels. Larry, I would say that 15% to 20% might be a little high, but there's no doubt that the trend is increasing and increasing pretty rapidly. We are delighted with the ASC offense that we put together really over the last two years. We have a unique way that we go to the market for ASC, a new sales organization that we created, and we really bring the best of Stryker because we have everything they need in the ASC. We have guns, we have lights, we have power tools, we have Neptune waste management, we have operating tables, we have hips and knees and sports medicine, and foot and ankle and shoulder [Technical Difficulty] compared to kind of historical norms. And so I think if you take all of those into account in context of that, 8% to 10%, you can get a sense of where we think hips and knees are going to be. Hey, Matt, I think if you look at it in terms of investment, as we think about the quarter in particular, and even as we go forward, I think you can probably just look at the rate of the percent of sales in terms of the investment that we've made in R&D this quarter compared to previous quarters. And you'll see that it's a bit elevated over our historical norms, which is, I think what Glenn's referencing in terms of additional investments and making sure that we're being disciplined about how we spend against innovation and in our R&D platforms. As it relates to future projects, I mean, the part of the beauty of our model is that the decentralized nature of it allows each of our business units really to focus in on those projects that are important to them as they track for growth as we go forward. And so really that, that innovation and that investment is being made across all of our businesses. And as we have items that make sense to talk about in this type of forum, we'll certainly do so in terms of new launches and key product innovations that be coming to market in the future. Hi, Joanne. In terms of debt pay down goals and we've been pretty clear with the rating agencies on this as well. We really look at debt to EBITDA as well as the ratio that we focus on and really bring it back down to kind of what are our historical levels 2.5 times roughly. If you think about the next couple of years, it means a pay down of $2 billion, $2 billion plus in terms of what we'll do. We – if you think about what we paid-off in the fourth quarter and what we paid-off this quarter, we're about a billion towards that goal. We probably have an opportunity to pay down a little more debt this year that we'll take advantage of too. And so that's where we think we'll land. Once we do that, we think we'll be in a solid territory to sort of accelerate our programs around looking at sort of larger opportunities. But the organization is very focused on cash flow in reaching those debt pay down goals. Its Kevin, I'd just like to add one comment. I think our medical business sometimes gets a little underestimated and the reason is you have three different components of it. You have the acute care, the bed instructors and we have a brand new bed per acuity that was launched towards the end of last year, that'll have four models, two of those models will be launched a little later this year. That'll drive very strong growth for that business and then you have the emergency care, which is the defibrillators and the district ambulance costs, and then you have the Sage of business. And so you have three different businesses that frankly had – last year you had a little bit more contribution from acute care and emergency care and not so much from Sage. This year you're going to have a lot more Sage, emergency care is going well and acute care should pick-up as we get into the latter course of this year. So overall it really is a much more stable high-growth business than it was a decade ago, based on the acquisitions of both Physio-Control and... Yes. So with regards to your question on robotics, I mean, from our perspective, really nothing's changed in our focus and what you saw in the first quarter really is just a continuation of the effort that we had since we launched Mako and so we're really seeing that the uptick as a result of just selling in our technology. And overall, we really remain bullish about Mako and what it brings. Other competitive systems like VELYS or ROSA haven't slowed us down at all. And if anything, what they've done is they've increased the validation that robotics are going to stay and really demand for Mako and our technology continues to be super strong as we saw by the results we posted. And then also, we believe we have the best solution. And so from a head-to-head comparison it's something that we look forward to with the technologies that are on the market today. As you think about Wright Medical and again the high single digits, I mean, it's all inclusive in there. Obviously, we're coming off of a pandemic or still kind of coming out of the end of the pandemic, so there is certainly some impact there. There are dis-synergies that are associated with the deal itself. And then there is also just the integration happening in terms of the Wright business and our own business through cross-selling and things like that. So, it's not something that we've parsed out in terms of the different components of it. I think what we can expect to see is that as we work through the integration we'll get out of total trauma and extremities business back up to performing above market growth. The key thing to remember at the middle – mid single digit growth that includes our existing trauma business. So that wasn't just for the Wright Medical portion right. That's the combined trauma and extremities. And so Wright Medical will be a faster growing component of the combined trauma and extremities business, but obviously wasn't in the first quarter just because of the pandemic. Yes. I mean, obviously, we're not providing specifics on the quarter, but I think if you go back and look at what we said in the fourth quarter that will give you some sense of where we are in total installation base both from a U.S. or a global perspective, and you can make some assumptions about what that might mean U.S. versus international. But if you think about what that total placement is, and you think about the fact that there is the potential for 4,500 or so hospitals that could carry a Mako that just gives you a sense of where we are penetration wise. But even then I would tell you that that many of these hospitals are able to take more than just one. So I think the bottom line with all of that is it's still early days in terms of penetration. So there is a lot of opportunity out there in terms of robotics and taking Mako and taking more than one Mako as we look forward. Yes. So, first of all, China had a terrific first quarter as you know that the pandemic is not really affecting day to day life in China. And they had a very – obviously in 2019 – even going back to 2019, we had terrific growth, but obviously last year was very badly affected in the first quarter if you compare to 2020. So China as a whole, we're very small in China relative to other companies, but we grew incredibly fast in very, very high double-digit growth in Q1. The outlook for China for us is still very positive given our lower relative market shares. It will be a very good Mako market with just getting started in China. I would say Japan – certainly Australia is farther ahead of where we are in China. So it's early days, but very promising, very encouraging. The one negative for China, of course, is this trend towards volume-based procurement, which you've seen in the cardiac stents. And we know that that's going to come down the pipe in effect a couple of our businesses hasn't yet but starting to and there'll be noise around that. But overall China for us still remains a high priority markets and will be a growth market for us just given our relative position, but even as it relates to Mako that'll be carved out of the tendering related to volume-based procurement. So we still have that significant runway for robotics both in Japan and China. Those are going to be both big markets and then we're very excited about our progress in both of those. Thanks, Matt. So as we think about it again, we provided the range because of the variability that exists. And certainly, as we think about where we're headed, we're happy with what happened in the first quarter. And as we – with the momentum that we're taking into the second quarter, and certainly if we continue to have great momentum, obviously it means a good thing for us as we think about our overall sales. But we put the guidance range out there for exactly that reason, because there's still a lot of variability that's happening across the different marketplaces. So I think that's how I would think about it. And certainly as we come in to our second quarter results, we'll have another update that we'll be able to talk about that. Yeah, so, I think when we talk about our order book, generally, it's in reference because we think about our capital businesses, because those items are being placed in some cases well in advance as you think about our larger capital items or even the smaller capital items, the orders that are coming in there. So it's just the leading indicator as we look at those businesses. And so really when we talk about capital, we've talked about capital before as being about 15% or so being our small capital and about 9% or 10% being our large capital items as we think about as a percent of our total business. So I think if you think about those items, those are the ones that we're talking about when we reference our order book, it generally is impacting us 25 or so percent of our business. And again, it's just the leading indicator as we think about return – a return to procedures and also just the strength of our customers in terms of their financial positions as well. Yes, no, a good question. As we talked about when we did the Wright deal, obviously it was the largest deal in our history. And so one of the things we talked about as well, we've go through the integration of Wright that we would continue to focus on M&A, but the focus that we'll have on M&A will be more of a tuck-in variety. So as we look at placing either smaller products or more technologies into our existing businesses. And so we go back to the end of the year. We had the OrthoSensor acquisition, and then we just talked about today, the TMJ Concepts acquisition. So you'll continue to see those types of acquisitions in the near-term as we continue to go through the integration of Wright and the debt pay down that we've talked about as well. So I think that's how I would think about acquisitions for us as we think about going forward. I mean one key point is that we're always looking. We have dedicated business development teams as part of our commercial business units, and they're always out there evaluating the landscape and looking at targets, so that whenever the opportunity presents itself, we're able to take advantage of it. Yes. So as we think about spine, the only thing that we can look at is what's happened over the last several quarters. And I think what we see with spine, even as we look at our own business, is that it's not as impacted. I mean, it certainly is impacted as there's elective component of it, but it's generally more emergent as we think about spine versus another the hip and knee business, for example. And so, we haven't seen the same level of slowdown as we think about where that lands in regards to the total market. I think as we come through the pandemic, it's just something we're going to have to continue to evaluate and once we get into a more normalized side. Yes, so, so first of all, I don't want to get too carried away with one month of comp, right. It's a very positive sign. Both are in the mid single digit range. And I'm not going to sort of say, which is higher than the other one. They're both are doing mid single-digit growth versus April of last year. But again, you're talking about 25 days of selling days roughly between two years apart. And so, it's definitely a change from the trajectory we saw in the first three months of the year and a positive change, but I don't want to get too excited about that. It's just an indication, a data point for you that tells you things are improving, volumes are coming back, but it's not really providing you guidance with which hips and knees, which one is going to be performing better than the other one. They're both coming back and that's a good sign overall. Yes, sure. Those are actually recovering very well, right. Sports medicine, I think, we have mentioned in our prepared remarks grew double-digits in the first quarter. It actually grew double-digits in the fourth quarter last year. So we're delighted that those procedures are done in surgery centers where you frankly, haven't seen the same degree of slow down as we have in the inpatient hospital. EMT was the most negatively impacted when the pandemic started because they are [indiscernible] procedures. We're seeing that have a nice rebound. And so both of those areas are going to be strong performers and strong contributors to grow in 2021. Sure. So as we think about that acquisition, and again it fits the overall strategy that we have in terms of finding products and technologies that are out there and really fitting them into our sales forces hands to help them really go out and serve the surgeons and the customers and patients that they serve. So with TMJ Concepts really it's adding that TMJ prosthesis product to the bag that's allowing us to go in and really service customers and patients that are actually in that position of needing that replacement. Nothing, I wouldn't say surprising Kaila, but I would say is that the shift to the ASC, every hospital you speak to has programs underway. And so, that was already happening prior to the pandemic. It is definitely accelerating. That's probably the most notable thing I would say. The other thing is that they're actually in pretty good financial position. So unlike prior crises that we've gone through, whether it was the financial meltdown or other issues, the hospital liquidity is actually very good. And so, there was a pause for a little while on some of the capital, certainly the smaller capital, but as procedures are coming back, we're seeing that through our order book that hospitals are in actually very good financial position and better than frankly I would have expected when the pandemic first hit. Yes, it's a great point. There is a very different buying that occurs at the ASC than it does in the hospital. The hospitals have very elaborate procurement divisions and departments and they buy by service line and it's very decentralized. The ASC is a very simple sort of customer that you have to interact with. They're not as many people. They can't perceive 22 Stryker sales people. They don't want to, and that's not the way they want to do business. So we have a different offense for the ASC. And fortunately we have a portfolio for the orthopedic ASC, which includes sports that is just perfect for what they're looking for. And so, yes, we've adapted our offense. We have the portfolio, but it is a very different buying pattern. The hospital isn't as interested frankly and looking across our different divisions and hasn't historically been as interested, but the ASC customers certainly is. And the good news is we've adapted our offense. If we had continued with our – the same way we used to sell, we wouldn't be having the success that we're having now. And really I'm optimistic about this continuing in the future. Yes, sure. So the Mako hip application if you remember, we launched it last year, but we really couldn't get it out to all of our customers because of pandemic. We've got roughly 50%, maybe a little bit more than 50% of the accounts have the new software, so it's not as simple as just sort of doing an upload over the web of the software. We actually have to go to the account, put the software on and do it in servicing with our customers because there is new information they have to learn. So there's actually a training regimen that goes with it. So, right now, we're excited about the procedure growth in hip is increasing as more and more accounts have the software installed and are in serviced by our Stryker team. This will continue through the second quarter, probably through a good part of the third quarter before all of the accounts have the new hip software, but the feedback from the surgeon customer is terrific. There's – it takes less time to register, so that speeds up the overall procedure time. And there is some very valuable information such as pelvic tilt, but surgeons find that very beneficial to make sure they're managing like length discrepancies. And so, the feedback again very positive, but we're still in the throes of this implementation and it does take time because it requires that that high touch in servicing and due to the pandemic we haven't been able to move as quickly as we would like in all of our accounts and all of our regions. Okay, great. There are a few questions in there, so I'll try to cover them all. So, first of all, the ASC is an area that we welcome. We're having success with Mako, frankly, in the ASC, more success than I would have imagined, honestly, two years ago when we initially signed the deal with Conformis, that deal was designed to really have a very simple solution for the ASC customer that is not using Mako. And there will be ASCs, the deals – some of the deals we've won don't involve a Mako where they will use manual procedures. That's where this solution will be terrific because it requires much less sterilization and is really custom designed for the ASC. So, we're excited to get that FDA approval and we look forward to being able to offer that to our ASC customers. I think you asked about market share. I don't know, Preston, do you have a feel for whether we're over-indexed in ASCs? I think it's fairly representative at this point. Yes, and it's still early, but we like our chances of being able to do very well. And as it relates to the implants, I would tell you in the short-term no real need to change anything. We're going to continue to have high – high adoption of robotics. We have cementless that continues to grow as we talked about in the fourth quarter, over 40% of our knees are cementless, but that still has a long runway to go. Longer-term I do think of different types of implants that are more bone sparing that don't use [indiscernible], but those will require IDE trials. But it's that I think something that is able to keep the ACL in place, it is something – is an area that we're exploring more from a science standpoint. So nothing that'd be launched imminently, but I do think that will be the future is new kinds of implants that are thinner, that are occurred that only a robot will be able to – to be able to implement into a patient. So that's kind of the longer-term future, but in the near-term, let's say call it the next two, three years, I think we're very pleased with the portfolio we have and a long runway for continued growth. So, thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q2 results with you in July. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the [Technical Difficulty]. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our organic sales growth was 4.7% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q1 2019, and one less day than 2020. Compared to 2019 pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4% versus Q1 2020 pricing was 0.9% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.3% impact on sales. During the quarter, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related surgical procedure cancellation, primarily in the U.S. and Europe negatively impacted our sales. However, towards the end of the quarter, we did see improvements in sales momentum, primarily in the U.S. and our Asia-Pacific businesses. Also as noted in the fourth quarter, demand for certain capital products continued as we saw strong results in our Mako and emergency care products. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 1%, reflecting the continuing slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, medical products and neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 15% impacted by positive sales momentum in China, Japan, Australia and Canada. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.93 increased 2.7% from 2019 reflecting sales growth partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition, as well as an overall disciplined ramp-up in operating costs. Our first quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.03. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopedics at constant currency sales growth of 17.2% and organic sales decline of 0.7%, including an organic decline of 1.7% in the U.S. this reflects a slowdown in elected procedures related to COVID-19. Other ortho grew 49% in the U.S. primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. As noted previously, in March we began to see good sales momentum in our U.S. orthopedic businesses with all segments delivering positive organic growth as compared to till March 2019. Internationally orthopedics grew 1.5% organically, which reflects the COVID-19 related procedural slowdown and Gibson knees, especially in Europe offset by strong performances in Australia and Japan. For the quarter, our trauma and extremities business, which includes Wright Medical, delivered 2.6% growth on a comparable basis. This includes strong performances in U.S. shoulder and U.S. trauma. In the U.S. comparable growth was 4.4%. In the quarter MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 5.3%, which included 1.6% growth in the U.S. Instruments at U.S. organic sales declined of 3% primarily impacted by continued procedural slowdown that impacted its power tool business partially offset by gains in its waste management, smoke evacuation products and services business. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2019 instruments had a very strong growth of approximately 18%. Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 5.7%, reflecting a slowdown in some of the capital businesses, which was partially offset by gains in our general surgery, video and sports medicine businesses. The latter of which grew over 11% in the quarter. The medical division at U.S. organic sales growth at 13.6% reflecting double-digit performance and its emergency care and Sage businesses. Internationally MedSurg had an organic sales growth of 19.9% reflecting strong growth across Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan and medical endoscopy and instruments. Neurotechnology and spine had constant currency and organic growth of 12.8%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in our interventional spine, neurosurgical and ENT businesses and 27% growth in our neurovascular business. Our U.S. neurotech business posted an organic growth of 12% reflecting strong product growth in our neuro power drill, Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps, bioresorbable and nasal implants. Additionally, within our U.S. neurovascular business, we had significant growth in all product categories including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 31.7%. This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets. Now I will focus on operating highlights for the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.4% was unfavorable approximately 40 basis points from our first quarter 2019. Compared to the first quarter in 2019 gross margin was primarily impacted by price, acquisitions and business mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our adjusted SG&A was 35.2% of sales, which was unfavorable to the first quarter of 2019 by 70 basis points. In summary, for the quarter our adjusted operating margin was 23.5% of sale, which is 160 basis points decline over the first quarter of 2019. This reflects the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition combined with a disciplined ramp-up in cost to fuel future growth, as well as the two year compounding of certain costs given the comparison to 2019. We also reiterate our operating margin expansion guidance of 30 basis points to 50 basis points improvement over 2019 operating margin, excluding the impact of Wright Medical. Related to other income and expenses compared to the first quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13%, given our mix of income. Given our current circumstances and the outlook for the full year, we would expect to be at the lower end of our range for the full year guidance effective tax rate of 15.5% to 16.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.1 billion. During the quarter, we repaid $715 million of maturing debt. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $450 million. This performance reflects the results of earnings continued good management of working capital and approximately $170 million of one-time expenditures related to the Wright Medical integration. Based on our first quarter performance and the current operating environment, we continue to expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%. We believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography, and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be in the mid-single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year, and this has included in our revised guidance range. Based on our first quarter performance and including consideration of our improved full year Wright Medical sales impact, discipline's cost management and continued positive recovery outlook. We now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.05 to $9.30. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Yes. Robbie, if you just – if you just think about the activities that are going on related to the integration of Wright Medical, naturally we would be working on cost synergies early in the year and incurring a lot of the costs that we need to incur relative to integrating Wright Medical, as well as aligning our sales forces and all the things that Preston mentioned. A lot of that did flow through in Q1, and I think that impact was certainly reflected in our EPS. I think moving forward as we think about it, we are optimistic about where we stand relative to sales, the synergies and how that'll play out for the remainder of the year. And so a lot – some of that positivity is certainly reflected in our EPS guidance and we fully expect that that benefit will also contribute to sort of raising the guidance like we did. And then as it relates to the cost management and how that'll play out in a year, we are encouraging divisions to ramp up some of their sending's to make sure that we are properly positioned for growth that would also include spending in innovation. And so we are making sure that we are not doing anything to hold back product development and other innovation spending that frankly will be needed to really fuel growth even towards the end of this year or even next year. So I think we'll see growth in that spending. And then, we did learn a lot from the experience that we went through and how we work. And so there are some benefits and savings that we fully expect to realize in the full year, as it relates to primarily SG&A costs. And so it's kind of a balance of those things that really get us to a lot of the confidence we had in raising our guide. Yes, I think, Vijay, you could probably do the math as easily as I can, in terms of what it will take in the back half of the year to really get to the 8% to 10%. But yes, we do see accelerating growth and we'll see accelerating growth throughout Q2, in fact, underlying some of these assumptions is that Q2 has sort of a return to normalcy by the time we get to the end, and then we'll continue to see great growth in Q3 and Q4. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Well, first of all we're just through the first quarter. And so the – there's lots of twists and turns here in the next three quarters. I would say that the fundamental thing on the guidance, a couple thing is that it boils down to a lot of the optimism that we're seeing around many of our current businesses. We're definitely not unhappy at all with our Q1 earnings performance or Q1 top line performance. And so I do think that as we accelerated through the quarter and what we're seeing in April, we feel pretty good about our prospects for the remainder of the year. Kevin referenced our order books, which are certainly a good indicator of where future sales could land. So we just feel like there's very solid momentum on that across many, many of our businesses. We also have strong underpin of discipline costs, which is going to help EPS. And I just think that all of that combined with also the progress that we're making on, Wright Medical just gives us the confidence that we felt like we should raise our guidance, which is why we didn't. And maybe I'll take the question on, on Wright Medical. I would say we're off to a very good start. So far so very good with the Wright Medical integration its proceeding much more quickly than K2M which was our first overlap deal. And I would say I'm delighted with the products, the people and the pipeline that we've acquired with Wright Medical. And really, if I think back to all the deals we've done in recent history, maybe Nolvadex is the only other deal I would say that's kind of in the same ballpark as this one in terms of the speed of integration, the speed of decision making. We have mixed management teams that are leading a lot of the Wright Medical leadership has come over. So key leadership roles and the momentum is terrific, and we had baked in a certain level of this synergies. And even on the cost side, I think we're making progress a little bit more quickly than we had expected. So overall delighted with very arbitrary medical and the future is very bright. Yes. Chris, we basically incurred some positivity at $0.03 in Q1, and we think the full year will have an impact of $0.05 to $0.10 just there's still some variability out there. So that's where we got it in. There's a really it's wordsmithing, I mean the original guidance we taught it would be $0.01, affirm $0.10 and now we're sort of more thinking that we might see a range of $0.05 to $0.10. Yes, I think, it's a fair assessment. We're executing very well on the cost synergies that were planned in our modeling. And so, we are going to see a little bit of that favorability that's flowing through the revised guidance. Yes, I think one of the things that we got the whole organization garnered around over the course of 2020 was just the importance of cash flow and good management of that cash flow just so we can operate the company at reduced revenue level levels, but then also just so we could reallocate that cash flow to areas that provide better returns in terms of M&A and things like that. So I do think organizationally we are well positioned relative to manage cash flow. We have efforts ongoing in terms of moving a lot more of our collections to standardized shared service centers. We have efforts in inventory management and working very closely with the businesses, so that we can forecast inventory needs better. We also look at distribution strategies that sort of are more efficient in terms of how much inventory we have to have on hand to serve customers. And then lastly, we are also working with our vendors in terms of accounts payable and how do we have more favorable terms in terms of payment terms on accounts payable. And so all of that is just really tightening up our working capital, certainly will benefit us this year as we look at improving the results of cash flow. But I would say overall, it's a very small deal. So this is not something that's going to really hit your radar screen for the overall size of Stryker. It's very meaningful to our CMF business, very meaningful to the oral maxillofacial surgeon, but not a big mover of the needle for overall Stryker. And so, you'll see that as we report our results. We'll report that in the acquisition column, you'll be able to see that, but it's a very small nothing that's going to be really meaningful to the overall strength."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Our comments today will focus on the first quarter performance in our combined trauma and extremities business, an update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical and on our most recent acquisition activity. During the quarter, our combined trauma and extremities business showed good resiliency growing 2.6% including Wright Medical compared to 2019, despite the ongoing impacts of COVID restrictions during the quarter. Our trauma business, which is less elective in nature, benefited from inclement weather in the U.S. and Europe in February. Performance in upper extremities and foot and ankle was driven by the recovery of elective procedures throughout the quarter, along with lower than expected sales dis-synergies through the initial stages of the integration. As a result of the strong performance of our trauma and extremities business in the first quarter, we now expect the combined business to deliver a mid single-digit growth for the full year when compared to 2019. We remain encouraged with the progress and pace that the team has delivered with bringing the businesses together throughout the Wright Medical integration. As we have mentioned previously, we utilized the lengthy period from announced to close, to build and resource the robust integration plan that we are now executing. As we move through the quarter, our teams made progress against many key integration milestones. To date the team has established three distinct business units with specialized commercial, R&D and selling organizations. We believe this dedication and focus will be a core driver of future growth across trauma, upper extremities, and foot and ankle. In addition to establishing dedicated business units, the team made considerable progress with our U.S. sales integration, including the establishment of sales leadership, sales channel and territory alignment and identification of cross-selling priorities. Considerable progress has also been made on aligning the long-term portfolio and pipeline strategies. Our focus on the integration will remain a key priority for the remainder of 2021 as we balanced the complexity of the integration while minimizing sales disruption. Over the next few quarters, we will conclude the U.S. commercial integration, including the initiation of cross-selling. And we will kick off sales integrations across our international markets over the next several months. Finally, our dedicated business development teams continue to identify and execute on tuck-in acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of TMJ Concepts, a medical device company that manufactures a patient-specific temporomandibular joint reconstruction prosthesis system. And our craniomaxillofacial business, personalized medicine plays a critical role in the acquisition of TMJ Concepts supports their business strategy and driving category leadership through innovation and purpose of restoring form, function and hope to patients. These acquisitions continue to demonstrate our focus on our strategy of driving category leadership and market leading growth. With that I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Hey, Pito its Preston. Just wanted to follow-up with on your neurovascular question. I mean, I'd say overall we're really pleased with the double-digit growth and I think certainly, we've seen in the past that that market has been accelerating. But I do think with some of those launches that you mentioned, we are seeing shared gains in that space as well. So those launches that we had throughout 2020, we're really starting to capitalize as we've gotten into 2021. And so seeing good growth across a variety of those items, including flow to varying stands and our aspiration products. As it relates to China, it again same thing as we brought in technologies to those markets and been able to grow there, similar to how we've done in our other markets with neurovascular. And so we really are looking forward to a strong year in total as we think about that neurovascular business. Hey, Ryan, it's Preston. I'll take both of those questions. So from a spine perspective, I think overall, we're very encouraged by the performance that we've seen in our spine business over the last several quarters. Certainly it's being enhanced by enabling technologies, certainly our recent acquisition of Mobius being a part of that. And I think the other thing I would just point out to you as we think about spine in relation to some of the other implant businesses; we certainly didn't see the same level of impact as a result of the COVID restrictions, particularly across this last quarter. Like we saw on some of the other implant businesses, which is something to keep in mind when you think about the performance, but overall, like I said, we're encouraged by the performance and we're – with high expectations in terms of our spine business getting back to market levels and continuing to perform that way. As it relates to this Sage, I think you hit it, I mean, really it's a product that certainly was impacted by the procedural slowdowns. And so as hospitals ramp back-up and get ready for that, the procedures to pick back-up, there's an element of Sage that we'll pick back-up in terms of stocking to get ready. But at the same time, I think it also began to see the flow through that's happening from a stage perspective, as well as, as more and more procedures are done in that catch-up of the recovery process. Yes. I mean, I think, it's again being that we're right in the middle of the pandemic, there's a lot of regional variability with this. I mean, I think any – to take any number in absolute is probably not the right bet, but I think certainly there is that gap there that –driven by that less emergent impact if you think about hips and knees versus spine. So, I mean, I think if you take some gap in that small single digit range, that's probably about right. Yes, I think it's fairly representative at this point. I mean, obviously, it's a growing segment, but I think that are representative right now."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company’s most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today’s press release that is an exhibit to Stryker’s current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker’s fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker’s CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today’s call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter, Mako performance insights and updates on Vocera and Wright Medical. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results and 2023 guidance before we open the call to Q&A. I will begin with the macroeconomic environment. 2022 was a year where we, alongside many companies, faced unprecedented supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures. We faced these challenges and delivered for over 130 million patients and for our customers all over the world. We also remain focused on the future, as we progress our pipeline of innovation, enabling a super cycle of new product launches across our portfolio in 2023 and 2024. I want to thank our 50,000 employees for their unrelenting determination and agility. In the fourth quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 13.2%, which brought our full year organic sales growth to 9.7%. During my 10-plus years in this role, these were record quarterly and annual growth rates. The growth was balanced across our businesses and regions in implants, disposables and capital equipment, and was highlighted by our Medical division, which had Q4 organic sales growth of over 25%. Additionally, for the fifth consecutive year, our international organic growth rate exceeded our U.S. growth rate, demonstrating the progress we are making on globalization. This was highlighted by Europe, Canada, Australia and emerging markets, which all posted double-digit growth in the quarter. International growth remains a significant opportunity in the years ahead that should continue to complement our strong U.S. business. Next, we delivered quarterly and full year adjusted EPS of $3 and $9.34, respectively, exceeding our latest guidance range. This was driven by our strong sales performance, which offset inflationary pressures and negative foreign currency. Also, we are progressing with our actions to address higher costs, which include both pricing and targeted restructuring plans. We have begun to see the impact of these initiatives and expect an improving trend over the course of 2023. We also expect the positive trends in procedural recovery to continue alongside strong demand for capital products. And while component availability will continue to be variable in 2023, we do expect that it will gradually improve throughout the year, lessening the need for spot buys. We will remain disciplined with our spend and we will continue to invest in innovation, including potential tuck-in M&A. We remain confident in the outlook of our business and expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech, which is reflected in our full year 2023 guidance of organic sales growth of 7% to 8.5%. This growth combined with the continued challenging macro emit environment, our pricing and cost actions will translate to an adjusted EPS of $9.85 per share to $10.15 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Beach: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, as well as Mako, Vocera and Wright Medical. Procedural volumes continue to recover throughout the fourth quarter in most countries. Parts of Asia-Pacific, however, have continued to be more volatile due to ongoing COVID-related impacts. While volumes are recovering, hospital staffing pressures have continued in pockets around the globe and patient backlog remains. As mentioned on the Q3 call, these challenges will likely resolve gradually and we continue to expect this will be a moderate tailwind as we move through 2023. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained very healthy in the quarter, as seen from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Endoscopy and Instruments divisions. Even considering our finish, we exited the year with a very strong order book. Next, specific to Mako, we had a record quarter of installations in both the U.S. and internationally. We continue to be agnostic to the form these deals take and will continue to offer flexible options for our customers to acquire capital equipment. The great progress of our Mako offense has resulted in strong growth of our installed base alongside continued increases in utilization. In the U.S., we saw approximately 55% of knees and almost 30% of hips performed using Mako in the quarter. Also, in December, we surpassed our 1 million cementless knee procedure with cementless knees continuing to index higher in make accounts. So in addition to being the leader in robotic-assisted surgery, we are also well ahead on cementless knee adoption. Finally, we are making good progress with the development of our Mako spine and shoulder applications, and expect to have the initial launch of spine in the back half of 2024 and the initial shoulder launch at the end of 2024. Now to our key acquisition and integration activities, our Vocera integration continues to progress well, and as a reminder, we will anniversary in February of this year. Q4 results were consistent with our commentary on the last earnings call, as is the expected sales ramp beginning in Q2 of this year. Turning the page to Wright Medical, we have now passed the two-year mark of the integration of Wright Medical. This has been our largest acquisition to-date. Now complete, we have exceeded expectations on both our sales and synergy assumptions, as the cultural fit was strong and we implemented our integration playbook very effectively. Additionally, it was a catalyst that drove the creation of three separate business units, allowing us to serve unique customers across core trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle. All three businesses exited the year with terrific momentum and strong R&D pipelines. Overall, this acquisition has proven to be a great success and we are excited about what the future holds. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today’s press release. Our organic sales growth was 13.2% in the quarter. The fourth quarter’s average selling days were in line with 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable by 0.6%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg businesses, which all contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 3.8% unfavorable impact on sales, the supply chain disruption somewhat lessened during the quarter and our capital order book continues to be very robust as demand from our customers remains strong. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 11.2%. International organic sales growth was 18.3%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 9.7% with U.S. organic sales growth of 8.9% and international organic growth of 11.7%. The impact from pricing in the year was unfavorable by 0.9% and 2022 had the same number of selling days as 2021. Our adjusted EPS of $3 in the quarter was up 10.7% from 2021, driven by higher sales and strict cost discipline, partially offset by inflationary pressures and the impact of foreign currency exchange translation, which was unfavorable $0.16. Our full year adjusted EPS was $9.34, which represents growth of 2.8% from full year 2021, reflecting the favorable impact of sales growth, lower net interest costs and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by inflationary pressures and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.31. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 19.3%, with organic sales growth of 16.9%, which included 14.9% of U.S. organic growth and 22.5% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.7%, led by double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, Steri-Shield, waste management and smoke evacuation. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.7%, highlighted by strong growth in sports medicine, communications, video, general surgery and ProCare. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 22.9%, driven by our emergency care and acute businesses. The growth was fueled by double-digit growth across our emergency care and Prime Structure businesses, and also benefited from improvement in product supply throughout the quarter. Our U.S. Neurovascular business had organic sales growth of 1.5%, driven by continued market softness and competitive pressures. The U.S. Neurocranial business had impressive organic growth of 19.7%, which included double-digit growth in our Sonopet iQ, Signature High Speed Drills, silver glide bipolar forceps and Max space Neuro product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 22.5%, reflecting double-digit growth in all businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia and emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 8.3% with organic sales growth of 8.4%, which included organic growth of 6.2% in the U.S. and 13.6% internationally. Our U.S. hip business grew 11.3% organically, reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by the recent launch of our Insignia Hip Stem, the ongoing success of the Mako THA 4.1 software upgrade and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. knee business grew 7.8% organically against a very strong Q4 2022 comparable of over 14%. This reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 11.9% organically with strong performances across all three businesses, led by double-digit growth in upper extremities and foot and ankle, and strong performances in plating and nailing. Our U.S. Spine business grew 0.5%, led by performance in our enabling technology business, including the recently launched Q Guidance navigation system. U.S. Other Ortho declined organically by 18.7%, primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 13.6% organically, which reflects strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and India. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 62.7% was unfavorable, approximately 310 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021 and in line with Q3 2022, reflecting the impact of the purchases of electronic components at premium prices and other inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs, and unfavorable business mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.5% of sales, which represents a 90-basis-point decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021. Full year adjusted R&D spending was 6.7% of sales, which was slightly higher than our 2021 adjusted R&D spending of 6.6% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 30.6% of sales, which was 150 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects the impact of increased focus on discretionary cost control and headcount discipline. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 26.6% of sales, which was approximately 70 basis points unfavorable to the fourth quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned inflationary pressures, primarily on gross margin and the negative impact, resulting from foreign currency exchange translation, somewhat offset by cost discipline. Other income and expense of $53 million for the quarter decreased from 2021, primarily due to net favorable interest income. For 2023, we expect a quarterly run rate of $65 million for other income and expense. Our fourth quarter and full year had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.8% and 14%, respectively, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $1.9 billion of cash and marketable securities, and total debt of $13 billion. Approximately $150 million of term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, which brings our year-to-date payments to $650 million. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations is $2.6 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings, partially offset by lower accounts receivable collections due to higher sales at the end of the year, the impact of higher costs for certain electronic components and pre-buying of certain other critical raw material inventory during the year. For 2023, we anticipate that capital spending will be approximately $600 million. Again, in 2023, we do not plan to do any share buybacks and we will continue to focus on further debt reduction. And now I will provide 2023 full year sales and earnings guidance. As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that there will continue to be macroeconomic volatility, including supply chain constraints, recession and inflationary risks and currency fluctuations. Despite this environment, we have positive momentum in many parts of our business heading into 2023, including continued procedural recovery, many new product introductions and a very robust order book for our capital products. Given the above, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8.5% for the full year 2023 when compared to 2022. There are the same number of selling days in 2023 compared to 2022, with one extra day in Q1 and one less day in Q3. Based on the steady progress of our pricing actions, we would expect the full year impact of price to be between zero percent and minus 0.5%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be modestly unfavorably impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year. This is included in our guidance. While we are not specifically guiding the quarters, keep in mind that as you compare the first quarter to the prior year quarter, Q1 2022 did not have the inflationary pressures that we are now experiencing. So despite a strong growth outlook, we do not expect Q1 EPS to be much better than Q1 2022. Finally, for the full year 2023, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.85 to $10.15, representing a return to op margin expansion. This guidance range assumes a gradual improvement of the global operating environment, including a progressive easing of supply chain disruptions throughout the year. And now, I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really nice quarter. I wanted to start out on the MedSurg side of the business, where you had really, really strong performance in the fourth quarter. You talked about a healthy order book, but I was hoping you could give a little more visibility into exactly what you saw, was there a bolus of demand there, was this all underlying or catch-up demand and then you talked about a healthy order book, but just what you are seeing in terms of your hospital clients around the world and their desire to continue to buy capital here?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. As you can tell, Robbie, it was a terrific quarter for all of Instruments, Endoscopy and Medical. Medical in particular, had a giant growth in the quarter, really digging out of some of the backlog that they had of orders. If you look at the backlog entering 2023, it’s actually higher than what we had at the end of 2022. So it was a little bit of catch-up from prior quarters, but as we think about next year, right, the outlook for all divisions is strong again next year. We also have a lot of new products coming in those three divisions. So strong order book, strong demand for our product, strong cans of new pipeline, terrific leadership teams. This really -- these three divisions have been, if you go back even from 2016, there -- every year they are either high single-digit or low double-digit growers and that was no different in 2022.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. And maybe a follow-up for Glenn, you talked about second half, probably, better than first half. I have been on this call a bit before this call and you talked about first quarter EPS not being much better year-over-year. Any other color you could give us both on the topline as we think about 2023, just given there are some highly variable growth rates on the topline, as well as margin things to think about down the P&L? Thanks.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. Yeah. First of all, just picking up where Kevin left off, if you think about the topline, entering the year with such a strong order book, it’s really going to kind of bode well for growth of our big capital businesses. The other thing we are really seeing is this procedural expansion and so we feel really good about our momentum, especially in hips and knees and trauma and extremities. So we are going to continue to see those grow as well. That plays into the mix of what we see when we get down to gross margin. We do think the first half of the year we will be working our way through some of that higher dollar inventory that was built up at the end of last year. We are seeing some bright spots in supply chain. We are seeing an environment where we think there will be less spot buys and so all of that will go into in terms of us progressively improving both our gross margin and our op margin. I think the other thing to keep in mind, too, is that, our pricing initiatives and actions really took hold in Q4 and we felt that especially on the MedSurg side. We will benefit from those actions for the full year in 2023. We will also see that’s not included in price. All the new products that Kevin talked about that we will launch, those come out at premium prices. So that will also benefit and help us with our op margin improvement. And then the last thing is, we still have some targeted restructurings that will take place in 2023, especially in the first half of 2023. So we will also begin to feel the benefit of those in the second half. So I think Q1 is a little pressured year-over-year just because the inflation wasn’t sitting in last year’s op margin and it is sitting in 2023 op margin. But I think as the year progresses, we will continue to improve on that op margin, and obviously, that will drive to the EPS growth that we guided to.\nRobbie Marcus: Really helpful. Congrats again. Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nMatthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Kevin, at the Analyst Day, when was it, this was a couple of years ago, you really exercised international. The performance in the quarter was phenomenal and it’s been really strong. I am just wondering the durability of that and should we think about international being not quite half of the growth on the topline this year, but something around that level. Is that how important international should be for you guys in 2023 and even beyond? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Rather than thinking about what percentage of the growth is, is just how durable is it? Five years in a row now, organic sales growth has exceeded the U.S. organic sales growth, and of course, China has really didn’t contribute anything in 2022. So Europe was double-digit grower. It’s a growth engine for Stryker. I have talked about Europe for the last six years or seven years and we are hitting our stride in Europe. But even other emerging markets, whether it’s Latin America, whether it’s the Middle East, Eastern Europe, parts of East Asia, we have really started to hit our stride. It feels exciting. We have great leadership teams. We are getting great penetration now with Mako and fluorescence imaging, some of those power brands are now really starting to show up effectively. So the way I’d like to think about it is that emerging markets should grow roughly double the growth rate of Stryker’s growth rate, and overall, we should continue to grow above the Stryker growth rate in these international markets. And as over time, if we don’t continue to have large acquisitions in the U.S. then that will become a bigger and bigger percentage of our business. But being acquisitive it’s still pretty small, if you think about 72% roughly of our sales are in the United States. But it’s starting to have a material impact and you saw really an outstanding quarter in Q4.\nMatthew O'Brien: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. You may proceed.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a really strong finish year. Kevin, maybe the first one on the performance here in the fourth quarter, at least organic, that’s quite outstanding. Sequentially, it looks like your growth accelerated by 350 basis points. Is this -- can you put some -- put those numbers in context for us? Is this share gains or is this your supply chain situation improving? And I am assuming there was some headwind from China, maybe if you could quantify it and just help us understand what went into that pretty stellar 13% number in the fourth quarter?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Look, I think, the outsized growth is in the Medical division, right? So Medical division isn’t going to typically grow 26% organic, right? That’s outsized and that’s really, let’s call it, making up for supply. So they had huge orders and we were able to get healthy in some of the product lines and we were able to get a lot of shipments out the door. That kind of variability could happen from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at a full year kind of organic growth rate, Instruments 10%, Endoscopy 15%, Medical 11%, kind of on a rolling four-quarter basis. Those are really outstanding results. So it’s not a one quarter wonder. I would kind of look at the overall year having organic growth of 9.7%. That’s the highest I have had in my tenure. And we have new products, I would say, they are as good a set of pipeline as I have had since I have been in this role. So that bodes well for next year. We are starting with the highest organic growth guide that we have ever started with and assuming launches go well and everything, this should be another very, very strong year. I think you will see a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter primarily with Medical, because they do have the largest backlog of all the divisions in the company and a more consistent performance with the implants side of the house.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And maybe off of those comments, Kevin, and maybe perhaps for Glenn as well, that 7% to 8.5% guide for fiscal 2023, is that a front-loaded guidance? Just when I look at the comps here for 2022, is that so 8.5% front-loaded? And what is it assuming for supply chain, are you assuming supply chain to improve just given off of Q4 levels? And the order that you mentioned, Kevin, did that backlog grow versus third quarter or are we starting to work down on the backlog?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Hi, Vijay. I will take some of these. If I miss a part, you can correct me. First of all, the growth is not front-end loaded. It’s pretty steady throughout each of the quarters and you will see that there is going to be solid growth just given sort of the momentum that we are feeling from fourth quarter. In terms of the order book, we exited 2022 with an increase in the order book year-over-year. So we are actually feeling very bullish about capital sales, about our customer’s willingness to buy capital. So we don’t -- we feel like that’s a great tailwind for the whole year and did I miss the third part?\nKevin Lobo: No. I think you probably…\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. Okay.\nVijay Kumar: Sorry, on the supply chain situation.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. As I mentioned, we assume that we will see gradual improvement in the supply chain. We saw some of that in Q4. We actually feel pretty good about our access to supply, we are seeing a reduced volume of spot buys, which are those really high cost items and we are also beginning to work with our original set of vendors and also going up the food chain and actually working with chip suppliers so that we feel like we have a good handle on what’s going to happen with supply chain, but it should become better quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter with good improvement and visible improvement in the back half of the year.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shagun Singh with RBC. You may proceed.\nShagun Singh: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I was just wondering what you have assumed for margin expansion in 2023 relative to your at least 30 basis points of outlook that you previously shared. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the VCON [ph] business in hips and knees. In knees, your major competitor does have a new cementless launch. Do you see that as a price mix benefit for them or something that could drive competitive account conversion, and then on hips, it came out stronger than what we were expecting. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the drivers and if we could see meaningful share gains on the hip side, similar to what we have seen in knees? Thank you for taking the questions.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. Yeah. Great question. I will start out and just touch on the margin expansion. We typically do not guide on op margins. So we are not going to pinpoint an expansion number. I think backing up from EPS and looking at tax and OI&E and where we are with sales that, you will see that the math doesn’t work unless we expand op margin. So I think what you will see is a progressive improvement each quarter in that expansion, especially as the comparable includes inflation from the prior year, so that’s what our plan is.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. And related to joints, obviously, we are delighted with the year that we have had in both hips and knees. Having global double-digit growth in both hips and knees is terrific. The hip strength clearly driven by the launch of the Insignia Hip Stem, and as a reminder, we are only about a little less than halfway through that launch. So we still have a lot of sets to get out. It will take us all of this year and maybe into a little bit of the first quarter of 2024 to be fully launched with Insignia. So we are still kind of in the gaining momentum mode with Insignia and that’s coupled with the 4.1 Mako hip software. So we can -- we expect hips to continue to be very strong. As it relates to knees, clearly, that’s been an outperformer for us for the past six years, seven years since we launched the Mako Total Knee application. And with cementless, where we continue to gain, I am not at all worried about competitive entrants on cementless. People aren’t going to move away from our cementless for a competitive product when we have tremendous proven, Jason mentioned, 1 million procedures already done and competitors just starting to launch theirs. They are going to be awfully very cautious before they move to another product on something like that and that synergy with cementless and Mako is really significant. Last thing I’d say is, we are launching new software, just like we did with hip with the 4.1, we call it, TKA 2.0 Mako software. We have just -- we are in the middle of a limited launch. It’s going exceptionally well. We expect the full launch sometime by around Q3 of that new software upgrade, which creates better user experience, better for training residents and teaching hospitals, so very, very good feedback on that. So we do expect to continue to outperform in both knees and hips again in 2023.\nShagun Singh: Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. You may proceed.\nRyan Zimmerman: Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Not to take away, this is a really good quarter, Kevin, but I do want to ask about two segments that are maybe a little softer than expectations. Neurovascular and Spine, both come on the back of what I think what we would consider easier comps and you can probably challenge me on that. But what are you contemplating in terms of your guidance for growth in those areas for 2023, and just commentary on both the Neurovascular and the Spine segment this quarter and kind of what impacted results?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. No. Certainly, on the Neurovascular comps, I -- we did have pretty good performance a year ago in Neurovascular. I think that the challenge is kind of looking at versus the prior year Neurovascular and then going back versus 2019. So, but certainly, we have had our challenges with Neurovascular in the U.S. We have had continued good growth outside the United States and I think I have mentioned on prior calls that the ischemic market segment has certainly gotten softer. There are a lot more competitors that are kind of distracting and taking up time. We still think it’s a great market. There’s still a lot of patients that are -- that have not been treated. We are only treating a small percentage of people that have these large vessel occlusions in the brain. So we do think it’s a good long-term market. We are launching a new coil called Tetra Coil here in the United States, which is exciting. And we will continue to invest. We have a deal that’s pending. Obviously, regulatory clearances before it closes on a one and done for the hemorrhagic segment. We are very excited about that. acquisition. That will give us another shot in the arm. So, yes, we have had our challenges in the U.S. this year. We continue to grow very well outside the United States. It’s still a market we are very committed to. That’s kind of on the Neurovascular side. On the Spine side, look, the launch of Mako Spine is going to be critical. The Q Guidance launch is going very well and that was important for us. We had a gap, obviously, with enabling technologies, which is really important in the Spine segment. So I do believe this is, 2023 will be a year where we will continue to grow kind of around the market growth rate and then really get ready for the Mako launch to be able to start to grow above market. So, yes, they are not as glowing, the divisions, right now as some of our other divisions. But they are certainly competing well in the marketplace, growing roughly in line with the market, maybe a little bit below, but still highly profitable, highly important businesses to the long-term future of Stryker.\nRyan Zimmerman: Very helpful. And then if I could just ask a follow-up. I mean this was the first time you really, I think, put those time lines out on spine and shoulder. We have kind of danced around these topics for some time. What is it now that’s a comfort to put those out there and ensure that those will be on time with the time lines you outlined?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. As a company, we tend to be pretty conservative on getting time lines and robots are hard, right? Ask any of the companies who are trying to launch robots, whether they are in heart tissue robotics or soft robotics. Robots are difficult. What gives us confidence is our prototypes are built. We have tested it with surgeons. We have gotten feedback. We have had some meetings in one case with the agency to get an idea on the regulatory pathway. So we have enough in the pipeline right now. There’s always a little bit of uncertainty around approvals and full launch. And notice the term I used was initial launch, right? So we do expect to get approved and to start doing cases. But then as you do those initial cases, you might have to refine some of the training and things, so it might be a little bit slow out of the gate, we will see. The beauty of our approach is it’s the same robot that’s being used for hips and knees that’s going to be used and we have, as you know, thousands of them now out there. So that is exciting that we will be able to just do a software upgrade and have a different attachment and be able to use the same robot and I think a lot of hospitals will be excited about that if the robots not being used on one day of the week and they can have that being used for spine initially and then as the demand increases, then they can have a dedicated robot for spine. So we really believe that will be different than when we started where each robot had to sort of justify it on its own. Having one sort of robot with all these different applications will be powerful over time. But we feel confident just based on we spent a lot of money, and we spent a lot of time on this. The shoulder one took a little longer. As you recall, we were -- we thought that was initially going to be before spine, but we decided to move away from our implants to the Tornier implants and to use the BLUEPRINT planning software. So that caused a slight delay. But the teams are really working well and we are -- the feedback we are getting from surgeons that are seeing it is extremely positive.\nRyan Zimmerman: Great. Looking forward to it. Thank you for taking my questions.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. We are too.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Vik Chopra with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nVik Chopra: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Vik on for Larry Biegelsen. Kevin, you talked about a super cycle of new products. Just remind us sort of what they are and how we should think about their impact in 2023. And my second question is, maybe just a comment on your trend in China, sort of what are you seeing there and maybe just the impact on Neurovascular, any color you could provide would be helpful? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. There’s a few questions in there. So I will do the super cycle and then I will pass it to Jason for China. On the super cycle, so System 9, our new power tool and Instruments launched just at the end of last year. So we are going to see the first real year of impact here in 2023, initial feedback, extremely positive. We know how to do these. As you know, we have -- from System 6 to 7 to 8 to now 9. So that’s one of the flagship product. We have the 78 camera in Endoscopy that will be initially launched in Q2. We will probably see more of a pickup in Q3, Q4, but a fabulous new camera, which, as you know, we have done in the past, whether it’s 14, 15, 88, 68. So these are things we know how to do and these are fabulous products. We have Neptune S, which is a small footprint Neptune product designed really for GI that is terrific new market for us. So we -- today Neptune’s are not really being used in GI. It’s designed special purpose for that to catch the polyps. Nurses are going to absolutely love this. We actually believe it could increase the procedures that they can do in a day, which, of course, the GI teams are going to love. So that’s also another really powerful product that we are excited about. Towards the end of the year and won’t have a big impact in 2023, but certainly much more in 2024 is going to be a new defibrillator. It will be in 2023 outside the United States and then early in 2024 inside the United States, which is the big pre-hospital expensive, complex life pack defibrillator. So that -- those are three big flagship products that’s very rare to have them all within kind of an 18-month period. That’s a super cycle. But beyond that, obviously, Insignia product is going to continue to launch. We have the CD Next product, which allows for depth perception as you are drilling. We have Signature 2 in the -- which is launched just this year, which is going to have a full effect next year in neurocranial, which is for neuro power drills. And I could list another whole bunch of foot and ankle products. We have got products in the shoulder space. So it -- there’s a full, full list of products. But those big ones I mentioned are that’s what I call it a super cycle is, you normally have one of those every two years or three years, not all in a short compressed timeframe. You have got the ProCuity bed that’s continuing to get rave reviews and that’s kind of still in the early phases of its launch. So, as healthy as I have had in my time here at Stryker in terms of new product cadence. On China?\nJason Beach: Yeah. Vic, as it relates to China, as you all know, right, China, as it relates to total Stryker less than 2% of our sales. So even as you consider some of the lockdowns and things in 2022, immaterial to our results in terms of Q4. Then as you think about 2023, early days as it relates to Neurovascular VBP. We are certainly keeping an eye on that and as we think about Q1 and the full year of 2023, when we get to the next earnings call, if there’s anything material to disclose, we will certainly do it at that time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. You may proceed.\nMatt Miksic: Yeah. I just wanted to maybe get a sense and I know we could spend a lot of time talking about the many things that are going well and could go really well this year. But just a follow-up on Spine, the investment in the robot is significant, the portability of that hardware and upgrading the app, as you described, Kevin, is great. Between now and then, whether it’s Q Guidance or whether it’s implant launches or system launches or investments that you are making, can you talk about maybe anything that you would see as kind of gradually driving up momentum in that business as you head into -- as you get into that introduction of the robot next year?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Yeah. Sure, Matt. So, certainly, we can’t just wait only for Mako and I’d tell you that Q Guidance has actually exceeded our expectations. Customer feedback has been excellent on that and the sales of those systems have been terrific. We also have a bunch of distribution deals that we have entered into for expandables, for different products, so two or three of those. We have the Monterey new product as well with Tritanium, which is pretty exciting. So it’s -- we do have a, what we will call it a cadence of new products planned that will be either developed by Stryker or through distribution to help fill product gaps. I am pretty excited we have our sports medicine leader, Andy Hamel, who’s the Head of R&D, has moved over to Spine. And if you look at the last decade, our sports business was the fastest launcher of products across all of Stryker and I think he will give that team a big shot in the arm. He moved over kind of midway through last year and excited to have him as part of the team. As you know, we have made other changes within our management team and I am pretty bullish on their prospects for the future. So we won’t sit on our hands and just wait. And already, some of those products, even the Life Spine distribution deal, those kind of products are really helping that, I was at the Spine Sales Kickoff meeting for the year. The momentum is really strong. The teams are feeling good about the future and knowing that Makos coming, of course, helps a lot. But, yeah, it’s going to be -- it’s a tough market, as you know, and it has been a tough market for a long time. But I feel like the combination of this distribution filled we will call gap-filling products, as well as some new products that we have planned, should put us in a pretty good position even prior to the launch.\nMatt Miksic: That’s excellent. Thanks so much.\nKevin Lobo: No problem.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nPito Chickering: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Can you guys hear me?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. We can.\nGlenn Boehnlein: We can.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you, Pito.\nPito Chickering: All right. Great. So pre-COVID, the first quarter is about 23% of the annualized EPS. So with the commentary on no EPS growth for first quarter 2023, it looks like you guided about 20% of annual EPS. I understand the hard inflationary comps in 1Q, but why should 1Q be underweight the annual EPS number versus recovered years or should we take this as just back half margin expansion for 2023? \nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. I think you are astute in your numbers. Definitely, it will be back half margin expansion for 2023. So you are right, we will see relative flat EPS in the first quarter, and then obviously, meaningful expansion starting in Q2, but really accelerating in Q3 and Q4 to drive to the EPS that we guided.\nPito Chickering: Okay. And then just a quick one here on capital outlook, your commentary is very bullish. Can you just quantify us what the new orders in fourth quarter of 2022 were and how it compared to the fourth quarter 2021? Thanks so much.\nJason Beach: Hey, Pito. It’s Jason. We won’t quantify in terms of what we have from an order book perspective. But I would just point back to, I think, what Glenn said earlier around and maybe it was Kevin. But the order book, as we exited 2022 is even larger than when we exited 2021. So we continue to be quite bullish on the capital side as we enter the New Year.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. And that’s not a new commentary. So the last four months, I think, our commentary has been very consistent on capital. Our hospitals having challenges with their P&L and in some cases, sure, it’s not yet -- we are not seeing it in orders. We are not seeing any cancellation of orders. Are some projects being delayed here and there? Sure. But it really is not having any kind of material impact on our outlook for capital. Again, a lot of our capital is revenue-producing type of capital. So you wouldn’t expect any kind of slowdown. But even the large capital area, if I look at our communications business within Endoscopy, had a fantastic year, helped drive some of the Endoscopy growth and they have a terrific order book going into next year and that’s large capital that sometimes in prior recessionary cycles have been deferred. So we just aren’t seeing it yet. So that gives us optimism to kind of lean in on the growth for at least for 2023.\nPito Chickering: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman: Okay. Great. Just on growth in the quarter, one of the factors you pointed to, Kevin, was procedural volume recovery. One of the factors discussed, obviously, throughout 2022 on in terms of capturing those procedures was hospital staffing. Are you starting to see an easing of that factor, any color you are seeing in terms of that here in the U.S. would be helpful?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Look, there are flashpoints where you do see staffing as a challenge, but the hospital systems are getting better at dealing with it. And we saw through from September through to the end of the year, kind of a nice building of procedure and a steady kind of high volume. The demand is clearly there. There’s no question that there’s some pent-up demand and surgeons are booked out for a good three months, four months in general. And so we are seeing, I would call it, a nice, steady kind of improving trend and I think we will see a moderate tailwind throughout the rest of this year. These flashpoints tend to be very short and even in some of the -- if you look in Europe and some of the areas that had strikes and real causes for worry, they have kind of come and gone pretty quickly. And so we are feeling good about the outlook on a procedure standpoint and expect this to be a tailwind throughout the year.\nSteven Lichtman: Got it. Great. And then, Glenn, just real quickly, I know you don’t want to provide specific margin guidance. But relative to inflation, did you call out or could you talk about what the impact was to gross margin in 2022 from inflationary headwinds and generally either directionally or specifically what you are looking for in 2023 on that front?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. I think as you think about inflation, obviously, we felt the impact of the inflation numbers in the -- that were in Q3, especially that were very large. A moderation of that, I would say, occurred in Q4. But keep in mind, to the extent that we purchased raw materials or made inventory, those inflated raw material prices, that’s capitalized in our inventory. The other place that we will feel inflation and that it carries over to in this year is really going to be labor costs that went up that are baked in now solidly for the year. We are still experiencing a pretty high inflation in our freight and transportation costs. Energy costs, especially in Europe, now have inflation baked into them, we will feel it there. I think what we are thinking, though, is we are not -- as we look at 2023, that we are not thinking that inflation will continue to be at the levels that it was showing in 2022. So we are feeling that, that will moderate and that’s what’s included in our guidance.\nSteven Lichtman: Sure. Understood. Thanks, guys.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nDrew Ranieri: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, just for you to start. You have -- we have talked about the capital order book being stronger year-over-year. But can you maybe talk a little bit more specifically of what you are seeing in the hospital versus in the ASC setting? Any noticeable trends in -- even in procedures in the ASC as you are entering 2023? And then I have a follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. So, clearly, this trend towards procedures being shifted to the ASC is continuing. It really accelerated during the pandemic, but there’s no signs of that slowing down. Even if I look at our Mako installations, I would say, this year, it’s a record number in the ASC setting. So as procedures move to the ASC, they certainly want to use great technology and I don’t think that’s going to slow down. We are going to -- every hospital system you talk to has construction plans around ASCs and so I think that’s just an undeniable future trend. Obviously, that takes -- it will take time to build out more and more capacity, but we saw that increase in Q4 versus Q3, which increased versus Q2. So it’s just a steady gradual trend and I am talking mostly about hip and knee replacements, but we are also seeing even some spine procedures being done in the surgery centers to shoulders. And I just don’t think there’s any slowdown, it’s just going to continue over the next few years.\nDrew Ranieri: Got it. And then just for Glenn, you talked about the margin expansion for 2023. Could you maybe just highlight kind of what you are expecting for free cash flow generation, 2022 is obviously a tough year? It sounds like inventory will get better in the back half, but just any broad-based thoughts on free cash flow for 2023? Thank you.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. I think as you think about the biggest contributor to cash flow, honestly, it’s earnings. So as we see progressive improvement in earnings throughout the year, I think, we will see that carry over into cash flow. There are some things that were maybe one-offs that we felt that we hope will get better in 2023. That bolus of AR that we had at the end of the year in 2022, obviously, we will collect that and kind of get back to a regular cadence of DSO. And then, finally, as inventory costs moderate and we feel more confident about supply, we will draw down on some of the safety stocks that we had pre-buy. We will also see just lower cost of inventory in raw materials and that should carry over to cash flow, too. And then the other area that I would highlight that maybe doesn’t get a lot of attention is, we continue to work on our AP and AP days, and we have made incredible improvements over the past two years to three years in terms of working with vendors and pushing AP out to beyond 70 days and we will continue to work on that as well. So I think all of that bodes well for cash flow improvement. But generally, I think, what you will see is as you see progressive improvement in earnings. You will also see cash flow fall out.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Matson with Needham & Company. You may proceed.\nMichael Matson: Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in. I guess I want to ask one on M&A. So I think you called out that you would be looking to do some more tuck-ins. What are you seeing out there with regard to the valuation expectations from potential targets? It seems like there was -- in the past year, there’s been sort of a disconnect between what the buyers are willing to pay and what the sellers want. I mean is that starting to get more realistic now and just maybe you can just comment generally what you are seeing there in terms of deal flow?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. But there’s, obviously, the stock market reaction over the last year on companies that weren’t making profits was pretty harsh. And it takes time for that, let’s call it, a new reality to set in with people that want to sell. But as a company that is acquisitive and has been acquisitive over time. This could bode well for us over the next couple of years if valuations kind of stay at this level. Obviously, the tuck-ins that -- a lot of the tuck-ins we do tend to be private companies, not necessarily publicly traded companies. But we have an active list of companies that we look at. We are focused also on paying down debt, given that we took on a lot of debt for Wright Medical and Vocera, so that’s kind of job one. Let’s continue to keep paying down that term loan. We still have about $850 million left on the term loan. We want to pay that down. But if we see good opportunities and there of the tuck-in nature, we aren’t going to wait, we will make sure we do that. We can do two things at the same time and continue to pay down debt, but also do some small tuck-ins. And so the divisions are actively pursuing those and we will be ready to strike if the prices are right. But I think this pricing environment is going to be positive. Now profits do matter and there was sort of a period of time where a lot of companies run away from us, to be honest, just on valuation, given that they were growing fast and the valuations were just out of sight. And we just won’t pay just whatever for something, even if we like the technology, we have to make sure it’s going to meet financial returns. So thanks for the question. We will continue to look and sort of thread the needle between paying down the debt and then being opportunistic where we can.\nMichael Matson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our following question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. You may proceed.\nJoanne Wuensch: There is a moment when you were rattling off, rattling maybe the wrong word, all the different growth in MedSurg and Neurotechnoology. And I could not get my head around some of these numbers and I am just sort of curious and maybe this has been addressed. How did this happen? Was this some level of pent-up demand in the capital equipment cycle, was it just the end of the year people have money in their budgets may want let go. Help me understand what this is and do you expect there to be more of a depleted effort in the beginning of this year?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Look, Joanne, one of the great news about this quarter. First of all, it felt like a pre-pandemic record quarter is the way I describe it, where our sales teams were kind of firing the way they normally do at Stryker. You have seen in the past and you have been covering us for some time. Having a big fourth quarter is not new for Stryker. We have had big fourth quarters many, many, many times. Our teams know how to finish. They chase their numbers. Our hospitals also kind of want to use up some of their budgets if they are on -- depending on their calendar cycle that they are on. And so that’s not new. What’s really exciting is that we were able to dig out of some of the backlog, specifically in medical, but not deplete. These are not pull-forward sales. We still have strong orders. We still have a growth momentum that’s going to continue next year and that’s why you saw such a, I would say, positive guide on organic sales growth. We are not calling for a soft Q1, and I think, Glenn even in the Q&A mentioned that we are not calling for a soft topline in Q1. Our implant businesses are continuing to hum. And these businesses are just their special businesses. We have these dedicated business units. We have split them many times. If I look at within Instruments, Instruments had 10% organic growth in 2022 and that’s because we decided to split orthopedic instruments and circular technologies a few years ago and they are both growing extremely well. They both have new products, right? We have a new Neptune and we have a new power tool. In the old days, it was the same rep trying to sell both of those. Now we have different reps selling them. So our ability to scale those launches is so much better with specialization and dedication. That’s kind of our formula, our growth formula and that’s just -- it’s absolutely happening in our company. So our leadership teams are terrific. Our dedicated e-business units are firing and the products are flowing. So I expect more of the same. But if you look back, even going back to 2016 as I mentioned before, and if you look at the kind of organic growth, it’s of these three divisions, Instruments and Ortho and Medical, not to mention Neurocranial, which has been an absolute home run, right? And that’s really run by instruments, but we report it separately. They are growing every year, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%. That’s not unusual. And now that they have -- when you have new product launches that tends to be on the higher side of it. So, yeah, it’s a good point to be a Stryker right now, especially in those businesses.\nJoanne Wuensch: If I may, you do discuss new product cycle a couple of times. You have got a new power tool. You have got a new Neptune. What else would you like to highlight?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. I mentioned before the camera, so in Endoscopy, a new camera. That’s big sort of blockbuster flagship product. Sports Medicine has a number of new shoulder products that they are launching. Those are -- but that sort of helps fill out the bag. At the end of the year, we have the new defibrillator within our Emergency Care business. They launched a new -- I didn’t even mention they launched a new power chair at the beginning of this year. So if you want to go up in these apartment buildings, we now have a powered chair, which is fabulous. It’s called Expedition. I didn’t even mention that one. I mean it’s just -- there’s no end. I mean we have invested pretty heavily in R&D over the past four years, five years, six years, seven years and spending close to 7% of sales and the new products are flowing. So those are -- I mentioned a couple of other ones before, Joanne, but that hopefully is a good look for you.\nJoanne Wuensch: It is. Thank you so much.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Anderson with Cowen. Please proceed.\nEric Anderson: Hi. This is Eric on for Josh. Can you guys hear me?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. We can.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah.\nEric Anderson: Excellent. Maybe thinking about cementless knees. I think about half of your knees are now going in cementless, correct me if I am wrong there. Where do you think that rate could be exiting 2023 and then maybe thinking longer term, what portion of your needs do you think will ultimately be cementless?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. It’s a great question. So we -- we have now -- we exited the year over 50% in the U.S. on our knees being cementless. The rate does vary in other countries of the world, but it’s been a steady climb, frankly. They are going to be more conservative on cementless than hips just because it’s weight-bearing versus hips. And do I think it will get to close to 100 like hips? Probably not, just because of bone quality, because it’s weight-bearing. But we have not seen a slowdown. It’s been just this kind of steady march. If you recall a few years ago, it was kind of 30%, then it moved up to 40%, now it’s north of 50% now and I think you will just continue to see that kind of steady climb. Where we will end, I don’t know. It’s hard to predict, but probably somewhere in the 70%s is kind of what I would -- I think it will. So there’s still room to run on cementless, and obviously, we have a proven system that’s delivering terrific long-term results, given that we have done 1 million of them already.\nEric Anderson: Understood. Thanks for that. And apologies if I missed it, but are there any selling day impacts in 2023 that we need to consider?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. There’s one extra selling day, one less selling day in Q3. But for the full year, it’s the same number of days.\nEric Anderson: Okay. Understood. Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Eric Fleming with Raymond James. You may proceed.\nEric Fleming: Hey, guys. Eric on for Jayson from Raymond James. A quick question on your pricing outlook, are there any segments that have a particular impact or is it across all? Thank you.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. The -- obviously, the segment that has the biggest impact is really our MedSurg businesses. We saw Q4 pretty much all positive pricing impacts across MedSurg and so we expect that to continue into 2023. I mean that being said, on the Ortho side, there’s a lot of work around contracts and structures and rebates, and so we are seeing good momentum there as well on pricing. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that, pricing is legacy product over legacy product and so to the extent that we have these product launches, like Kevin was talking about, we generally will launch with premium pricing over the legacy product, but it won’t be included in that pricing statistic. It really gets included in volume. So net-net, I think, you will see probably more favorable pricing coming out of the MedSurg businesses, but we are making great progress on the Ortho side, too.\nOperator: Thank you so much. There are no further questions. I will now pass it back over to Kevin Lobo for concluding remarks.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Great. So, first of all, I want to thank all of you for your patience working through our technical challenges. As you can see, we had a terrific finish to last year, a really good start this year and had a chance to be out with our sales teams across Stryker and I could tell you the momentum is palpable. It feels like it’s going to be a strong year. We, obviously, have -- are going to continue to have some challenges around spotting this in the supply chain, but it certainly feels like the worst is behind us as we experienced last year. So I want to thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our first quarter results with you in April. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Lobo",
            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter, Mako performance insights and updates on Vocera and Wright Medical. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results and 2023 guidance before we open the call to Q&A. I will begin with the macroeconomic environment. 2022 was a year where we, alongside many companies, faced unprecedented supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures. We faced these challenges and delivered for over 130 million patients and for our customers all over the world. We also remain focused on the future, as we progress our pipeline of innovation, enabling a super cycle of new product launches across our portfolio in 2023 and 2024. I want to thank our 50,000 employees for their unrelenting determination and agility. In the fourth quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 13.2%, which brought our full year organic sales growth to 9.7%. During my 10-plus years in this role, these were record quarterly and annual growth rates. The growth was balanced across our businesses and regions in implants, disposables and capital equipment, and was highlighted by our Medical division, which had Q4 organic sales growth of over 25%. Additionally, for the fifth consecutive year, our international organic growth rate exceeded our U.S. growth rate, demonstrating the progress we are making on globalization. This was highlighted by Europe, Canada, Australia and emerging markets, which all posted double-digit growth in the quarter. International growth remains a significant opportunity in the years ahead that should continue to complement our strong U.S. business. Next, we delivered quarterly and full year adjusted EPS of $3 and $9.34, respectively, exceeding our latest guidance range. This was driven by our strong sales performance, which offset inflationary pressures and negative foreign currency. Also, we are progressing with our actions to address higher costs, which include both pricing and targeted restructuring plans. We have begun to see the impact of these initiatives and expect an improving trend over the course of 2023. We also expect the positive trends in procedural recovery to continue alongside strong demand for capital products. And while component availability will continue to be variable in 2023, we do expect that it will gradually improve throughout the year, lessening the need for spot buys. We will remain disciplined with our spend and we will continue to invest in innovation, including potential tuck-in M&A. We remain confident in the outlook of our business and expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech, which is reflected in our full year 2023 guidance of organic sales growth of 7% to 8.5%. This growth combined with the continued challenging macro emit environment, our pricing and cost actions will translate to an adjusted EPS of $9.85 per share to $10.15 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Yeah. As you can tell, Robbie, it was a terrific quarter for all of Instruments, Endoscopy and Medical. Medical in particular, had a giant growth in the quarter, really digging out of some of the backlog that they had of orders. If you look at the backlog entering 2023, it's actually higher than what we had at the end of 2022. So it was a little bit of catch-up from prior quarters, but as we think about next year, right, the outlook for all divisions is strong again next year. We also have a lot of new products coming in those three divisions. So strong order book, strong demand for our product, strong cans of new pipeline, terrific leadership teams. This really -- these three divisions have been, if you go back even from 2016, there -- every year they are either high single-digit or low double-digit growers and that was no different in 2022. Thank you. Yeah. Rather than thinking about what percentage of the growth is, is just how durable is it? Five years in a row now, organic sales growth has exceeded the U.S. organic sales growth, and of course, China has really didn't contribute anything in 2022. So Europe was double-digit grower. It's a growth engine for Stryker. I have talked about Europe for the last six years or seven years and we are hitting our stride in Europe. But even other emerging markets, whether it's Latin America, whether it's the Middle East, Eastern Europe, parts of East Asia, we have really started to hit our stride. It feels exciting. We have great leadership teams. We are getting great penetration now with Mako and fluorescence imaging, some of those power brands are now really starting to show up effectively. So the way I'd like to think about it is that emerging markets should grow roughly double the growth rate of Stryker's growth rate, and overall, we should continue to grow above the Stryker growth rate in these international markets. And as over time, if we don't continue to have large acquisitions in the U.S. then that will become a bigger and bigger percentage of our business. But being acquisitive it's still pretty small, if you think about 72% roughly of our sales are in the United States. But it's starting to have a material impact and you saw really an outstanding quarter in Q4. Yeah. Look, I think, the outsized growth is in the Medical division, right? So Medical division isn't going to typically grow 26% organic, right? That's outsized and that's really, let's call it, making up for supply. So they had huge orders and we were able to get healthy in some of the product lines and we were able to get a lot of shipments out the door. That kind of variability could happen from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at a full year kind of organic growth rate, Instruments 10%, Endoscopy 15%, Medical 11%, kind of on a rolling four-quarter basis. Those are really outstanding results. So it's not a one quarter wonder. I would kind of look at the overall year having organic growth of 9.7%. That's the highest I have had in my tenure. And we have new products, I would say, they are as good a set of pipeline as I have had since I have been in this role. So that bodes well for next year. We are starting with the highest organic growth guide that we have ever started with and assuming launches go well and everything, this should be another very, very strong year. I think you will see a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter primarily with Medical, because they do have the largest backlog of all the divisions in the company and a more consistent performance with the implants side of the house. No. I think you probably... Thank you. Yeah. And related to joints, obviously, we are delighted with the year that we have had in both hips and knees. Having global double-digit growth in both hips and knees is terrific. The hip strength clearly driven by the launch of the Insignia Hip Stem, and as a reminder, we are only about a little less than halfway through that launch. So we still have a lot of sets to get out. It will take us all of this year and maybe into a little bit of the first quarter of 2024 to be fully launched with Insignia. So we are still kind of in the gaining momentum mode with Insignia and that's coupled with the 4.1 Mako hip software. So we can -- we expect hips to continue to be very strong. As it relates to knees, clearly, that's been an outperformer for us for the past six years, seven years since we launched the Mako Total Knee application. And with cementless, where we continue to gain, I am not at all worried about competitive entrants on cementless. People aren't going to move away from our cementless for a competitive product when we have tremendous proven, Jason mentioned, 1 million procedures already done and competitors just starting to launch theirs. They are going to be awfully very cautious before they move to another product on something like that and that synergy with cementless and Mako is really significant. Last thing I'd say is, we are launching new software, just like we did with hip with the 4.1, we call it, TKA 2.0 Mako software. We have just -- we are in the middle of a limited launch. It's going exceptionally well. We expect the full launch sometime by around Q3 of that new software upgrade, which creates better user experience, better for training residents and teaching hospitals, so very, very good feedback on that. So we do expect to continue to outperform in both knees and hips again in 2023. Yeah. No. Certainly, on the Neurovascular comps, I -- we did have pretty good performance a year ago in Neurovascular. I think that the challenge is kind of looking at versus the prior year Neurovascular and then going back versus 2019. So, but certainly, we have had our challenges with Neurovascular in the U.S. We have had continued good growth outside the United States and I think I have mentioned on prior calls that the ischemic market segment has certainly gotten softer. There are a lot more competitors that are kind of distracting and taking up time. We still think it's a great market. There's still a lot of patients that are -- that have not been treated. We are only treating a small percentage of people that have these large vessel occlusions in the brain. So we do think it's a good long-term market. We are launching a new coil called Tetra Coil here in the United States, which is exciting. And we will continue to invest. We have a deal that's pending. Obviously, regulatory clearances before it closes on a one and done for the hemorrhagic segment. We are very excited about that. acquisition. That will give us another shot in the arm. So, yes, we have had our challenges in the U.S. this year. We continue to grow very well outside the United States. It's still a market we are very committed to. That's kind of on the Neurovascular side. On the Spine side, look, the launch of Mako Spine is going to be critical. The Q Guidance launch is going very well and that was important for us. We had a gap, obviously, with enabling technologies, which is really important in the Spine segment. So I do believe this is, 2023 will be a year where we will continue to grow kind of around the market growth rate and then really get ready for the Mako launch to be able to start to grow above market. So, yes, they are not as glowing, the divisions, right now as some of our other divisions. But they are certainly competing well in the marketplace, growing roughly in line with the market, maybe a little bit below, but still highly profitable, highly important businesses to the long-term future of Stryker. Yeah. As a company, we tend to be pretty conservative on getting time lines and robots are hard, right? Ask any of the companies who are trying to launch robots, whether they are in heart tissue robotics or soft robotics. Robots are difficult. What gives us confidence is our prototypes are built. We have tested it with surgeons. We have gotten feedback. We have had some meetings in one case with the agency to get an idea on the regulatory pathway. So we have enough in the pipeline right now. There's always a little bit of uncertainty around approvals and full launch. And notice the term I used was initial launch, right? So we do expect to get approved and to start doing cases. But then as you do those initial cases, you might have to refine some of the training and things, so it might be a little bit slow out of the gate, we will see. The beauty of our approach is it's the same robot that's being used for hips and knees that's going to be used and we have, as you know, thousands of them now out there. So that is exciting that we will be able to just do a software upgrade and have a different attachment and be able to use the same robot and I think a lot of hospitals will be excited about that if the robots not being used on one day of the week and they can have that being used for spine initially and then as the demand increases, then they can have a dedicated robot for spine. So we really believe that will be different than when we started where each robot had to sort of justify it on its own. Having one sort of robot with all these different applications will be powerful over time. But we feel confident just based on we spent a lot of money, and we spent a lot of time on this. The shoulder one took a little longer. As you recall, we were -- we thought that was initially going to be before spine, but we decided to move away from our implants to the Tornier implants and to use the BLUEPRINT planning software. So that caused a slight delay. But the teams are really working well and we are -- the feedback we are getting from surgeons that are seeing it is extremely positive. Yeah. We are too. Okay. There's a few questions in there. So I will do the super cycle and then I will pass it to Jason for China. On the super cycle, so System 9, our new power tool and Instruments launched just at the end of last year. So we are going to see the first real year of impact here in 2023, initial feedback, extremely positive. We know how to do these. As you know, we have -- from System 6 to 7 to 8 to now 9. So that's one of the flagship product. We have the 78 camera in Endoscopy that will be initially launched in Q2. We will probably see more of a pickup in Q3, Q4, but a fabulous new camera, which, as you know, we have done in the past, whether it's 14, 15, 88, 68. So these are things we know how to do and these are fabulous products. We have Neptune S, which is a small footprint Neptune product designed really for GI that is terrific new market for us. So we -- today Neptune's are not really being used in GI. It's designed special purpose for that to catch the polyps. Nurses are going to absolutely love this. We actually believe it could increase the procedures that they can do in a day, which, of course, the GI teams are going to love. So that's also another really powerful product that we are excited about. Towards the end of the year and won't have a big impact in 2023, but certainly much more in 2024 is going to be a new defibrillator. It will be in 2023 outside the United States and then early in 2024 inside the United States, which is the big pre-hospital expensive, complex life pack defibrillator. So that -- those are three big flagship products that's very rare to have them all within kind of an 18-month period. That's a super cycle. But beyond that, obviously, Insignia product is going to continue to launch. We have the CD Next product, which allows for depth perception as you are drilling. We have Signature 2 in the -- which is launched just this year, which is going to have a full effect next year in neurocranial, which is for neuro power drills. And I could list another whole bunch of foot and ankle products. We have got products in the shoulder space. So it -- there's a full, full list of products. But those big ones I mentioned are that's what I call it a super cycle is, you normally have one of those every two years or three years, not all in a short compressed timeframe. You have got the ProCuity bed that's continuing to get rave reviews and that's kind of still in the early phases of its launch. So, as healthy as I have had in my time here at Stryker in terms of new product cadence. On China? Yeah. Yeah. Sure, Matt. So, certainly, we can't just wait only for Mako and I'd tell you that Q Guidance has actually exceeded our expectations. Customer feedback has been excellent on that and the sales of those systems have been terrific. We also have a bunch of distribution deals that we have entered into for expandables, for different products, so two or three of those. We have the Monterey new product as well with Tritanium, which is pretty exciting. So it's -- we do have a, what we will call it a cadence of new products planned that will be either developed by Stryker or through distribution to help fill product gaps. I am pretty excited we have our sports medicine leader, Andy Hamel, who's the Head of R&D, has moved over to Spine. And if you look at the last decade, our sports business was the fastest launcher of products across all of Stryker and I think he will give that team a big shot in the arm. He moved over kind of midway through last year and excited to have him as part of the team. As you know, we have made other changes within our management team and I am pretty bullish on their prospects for the future. So we won't sit on our hands and just wait. And already, some of those products, even the Life Spine distribution deal, those kind of products are really helping that, I was at the Spine Sales Kickoff meeting for the year. The momentum is really strong. The teams are feeling good about the future and knowing that Makos coming, of course, helps a lot. But, yeah, it's going to be -- it's a tough market, as you know, and it has been a tough market for a long time. But I feel like the combination of this distribution filled we will call gap-filling products, as well as some new products that we have planned, should put us in a pretty good position even prior to the launch. No problem. Yes. We can. Thank you, Pito. Yeah. Look, there are flashpoints where you do see staffing as a challenge, but the hospital systems are getting better at dealing with it. And we saw through from September through to the end of the year, kind of a nice building of procedure and a steady kind of high volume. The demand is clearly there. There's no question that there's some pent-up demand and surgeons are booked out for a good three months, four months in general. And so we are seeing, I would call it, a nice, steady kind of improving trend and I think we will see a moderate tailwind throughout the rest of this year. These flashpoints tend to be very short and even in some of the -- if you look in Europe and some of the areas that had strikes and real causes for worry, they have kind of come and gone pretty quickly. And so we are feeling good about the outlook on a procedure standpoint and expect this to be a tailwind throughout the year. Thank you. Yeah. So, clearly, this trend towards procedures being shifted to the ASC is continuing. It really accelerated during the pandemic, but there's no signs of that slowing down. Even if I look at our Mako installations, I would say, this year, it's a record number in the ASC setting. So as procedures move to the ASC, they certainly want to use great technology and I don't think that's going to slow down. We are going to -- every hospital system you talk to has construction plans around ASCs and so I think that's just an undeniable future trend. Obviously, that takes -- it will take time to build out more and more capacity, but we saw that increase in Q4 versus Q3, which increased versus Q2. So it's just a steady gradual trend and I am talking mostly about hip and knee replacements, but we are also seeing even some spine procedures being done in the surgery centers to shoulders. And I just don't think there's any slowdown, it's just going to continue over the next few years. Yeah. But there's, obviously, the stock market reaction over the last year on companies that weren't making profits was pretty harsh. And it takes time for that, let's call it, a new reality to set in with people that want to sell. But as a company that is acquisitive and has been acquisitive over time. This could bode well for us over the next couple of years if valuations kind of stay at this level. Obviously, the tuck-ins that -- a lot of the tuck-ins we do tend to be private companies, not necessarily publicly traded companies. But we have an active list of companies that we look at. We are focused also on paying down debt, given that we took on a lot of debt for Wright Medical and Vocera, so that's kind of job one. Let's continue to keep paying down that term loan. We still have about $850 million left on the term loan. We want to pay that down. But if we see good opportunities and there of the tuck-in nature, we aren't going to wait, we will make sure we do that. We can do two things at the same time and continue to pay down debt, but also do some small tuck-ins. And so the divisions are actively pursuing those and we will be ready to strike if the prices are right. But I think this pricing environment is going to be positive. Now profits do matter and there was sort of a period of time where a lot of companies run away from us, to be honest, just on valuation, given that they were growing fast and the valuations were just out of sight. And we just won't pay just whatever for something, even if we like the technology, we have to make sure it's going to meet financial returns. So thanks for the question. We will continue to look and sort of thread the needle between paying down the debt and then being opportunistic where we can. Yeah. Look, Joanne, one of the great news about this quarter. First of all, it felt like a pre-pandemic record quarter is the way I describe it, where our sales teams were kind of firing the way they normally do at Stryker. You have seen in the past and you have been covering us for some time. Having a big fourth quarter is not new for Stryker. We have had big fourth quarters many, many, many times. Our teams know how to finish. They chase their numbers. Our hospitals also kind of want to use up some of their budgets if they are on -- depending on their calendar cycle that they are on. And so that's not new. What's really exciting is that we were able to dig out of some of the backlog, specifically in medical, but not deplete. These are not pull-forward sales. We still have strong orders. We still have a growth momentum that's going to continue next year and that's why you saw such a, I would say, positive guide on organic sales growth. We are not calling for a soft Q1, and I think, Glenn even in the Q&A mentioned that we are not calling for a soft topline in Q1. Our implant businesses are continuing to hum. And these businesses are just their special businesses. We have these dedicated business units. We have split them many times. If I look at within Instruments, Instruments had 10% organic growth in 2022 and that's because we decided to split orthopedic instruments and circular technologies a few years ago and they are both growing extremely well. They both have new products, right? We have a new Neptune and we have a new power tool. In the old days, it was the same rep trying to sell both of those. Now we have different reps selling them. So our ability to scale those launches is so much better with specialization and dedication. That's kind of our formula, our growth formula and that's just -- it's absolutely happening in our company. So our leadership teams are terrific. Our dedicated e-business units are firing and the products are flowing. So I expect more of the same. But if you look back, even going back to 2016 as I mentioned before, and if you look at the kind of organic growth, it's of these three divisions, Instruments and Ortho and Medical, not to mention Neurocranial, which has been an absolute home run, right? And that's really run by instruments, but we report it separately. They are growing every year, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%. That's not unusual. And now that they have -- when you have new product launches that tends to be on the higher side of it. So, yeah, it's a good point to be a Stryker right now, especially in those businesses. Yeah. I mentioned before the camera, so in Endoscopy, a new camera. That's big sort of blockbuster flagship product. Sports Medicine has a number of new shoulder products that they are launching. Those are -- but that sort of helps fill out the bag. At the end of the year, we have the new defibrillator within our Emergency Care business. They launched a new -- I didn't even mention they launched a new power chair at the beginning of this year. So if you want to go up in these apartment buildings, we now have a powered chair, which is fabulous. It's called Expedition. I didn't even mention that one. I mean it's just -- there's no end. I mean we have invested pretty heavily in R&D over the past four years, five years, six years, seven years and spending close to 7% of sales and the new products are flowing. So those are -- I mentioned a couple of other ones before, Joanne, but that hopefully is a good look for you. Thank you. Yes. We can. Yeah. It's a great question. So we -- we have now -- we exited the year over 50% in the U.S. on our knees being cementless. The rate does vary in other countries of the world, but it's been a steady climb, frankly. They are going to be more conservative on cementless than hips just because it's weight-bearing versus hips. And do I think it will get to close to 100 like hips? Probably not, just because of bone quality, because it's weight-bearing. But we have not seen a slowdown. It's been just this kind of steady march. If you recall a few years ago, it was kind of 30%, then it moved up to 40%, now it's north of 50% now and I think you will just continue to see that kind of steady climb. Where we will end, I don't know. It's hard to predict, but probably somewhere in the 70%s is kind of what I would -- I think it will. So there's still room to run on cementless, and obviously, we have a proven system that's delivering terrific long-term results, given that we have done 1 million of them already. Yeah. There's one extra selling day, one less selling day in Q3. But for the full year, it's the same number of days. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Great. So, first of all, I want to thank all of you for your patience working through our technical challenges. As you can see, we had a terrific finish to last year, a really good start this year and had a chance to be out with our sales teams across Stryker and I could tell you the momentum is palpable. It feels like it's going to be a strong year. We, obviously, have -- are going to continue to have some challenges around spotting this in the supply chain, but it certainly feels like the worst is behind us as we experienced last year. So I want to thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our first quarter results with you in April. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 13.2% in the quarter. The fourth quarter's average selling days were in line with 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable by 0.6%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg businesses, which all contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 3.8% unfavorable impact on sales, the supply chain disruption somewhat lessened during the quarter and our capital order book continues to be very robust as demand from our customers remains strong. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 11.2%. International organic sales growth was 18.3%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 9.7% with U.S. organic sales growth of 8.9% and international organic growth of 11.7%. The impact from pricing in the year was unfavorable by 0.9% and 2022 had the same number of selling days as 2021. Our adjusted EPS of $3 in the quarter was up 10.7% from 2021, driven by higher sales and strict cost discipline, partially offset by inflationary pressures and the impact of foreign currency exchange translation, which was unfavorable $0.16. Our full year adjusted EPS was $9.34, which represents growth of 2.8% from full year 2021, reflecting the favorable impact of sales growth, lower net interest costs and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by inflationary pressures and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.31. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 19.3%, with organic sales growth of 16.9%, which included 14.9% of U.S. organic growth and 22.5% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.7%, led by double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, Steri-Shield, waste management and smoke evacuation. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.7%, highlighted by strong growth in sports medicine, communications, video, general surgery and ProCare. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 22.9%, driven by our emergency care and acute businesses. The growth was fueled by double-digit growth across our emergency care and Prime Structure businesses, and also benefited from improvement in product supply throughout the quarter. Our U.S. Neurovascular business had organic sales growth of 1.5%, driven by continued market softness and competitive pressures. The U.S. Neurocranial business had impressive organic growth of 19.7%, which included double-digit growth in our Sonopet iQ, Signature High Speed Drills, silver glide bipolar forceps and Max space Neuro product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 22.5%, reflecting double-digit growth in all businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia and emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 8.3% with organic sales growth of 8.4%, which included organic growth of 6.2% in the U.S. and 13.6% internationally. Our U.S. hip business grew 11.3% organically, reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by the recent launch of our Insignia Hip Stem, the ongoing success of the Mako THA 4.1 software upgrade and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. knee business grew 7.8% organically against a very strong Q4 2022 comparable of over 14%. This reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 11.9% organically with strong performances across all three businesses, led by double-digit growth in upper extremities and foot and ankle, and strong performances in plating and nailing. Our U.S. Spine business grew 0.5%, led by performance in our enabling technology business, including the recently launched Q Guidance navigation system. U.S. Other Ortho declined organically by 18.7%, primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 13.6% organically, which reflects strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and India. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 62.7% was unfavorable, approximately 310 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021 and in line with Q3 2022, reflecting the impact of the purchases of electronic components at premium prices and other inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs, and unfavorable business mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.5% of sales, which represents a 90-basis-point decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021. Full year adjusted R&D spending was 6.7% of sales, which was slightly higher than our 2021 adjusted R&D spending of 6.6% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 30.6% of sales, which was 150 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects the impact of increased focus on discretionary cost control and headcount discipline. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 26.6% of sales, which was approximately 70 basis points unfavorable to the fourth quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned inflationary pressures, primarily on gross margin and the negative impact, resulting from foreign currency exchange translation, somewhat offset by cost discipline. Other income and expense of $53 million for the quarter decreased from 2021, primarily due to net favorable interest income. For 2023, we expect a quarterly run rate of $65 million for other income and expense. Our fourth quarter and full year had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.8% and 14%, respectively, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $1.9 billion of cash and marketable securities, and total debt of $13 billion. Approximately $150 million of term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, which brings our year-to-date payments to $650 million. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations is $2.6 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings, partially offset by lower accounts receivable collections due to higher sales at the end of the year, the impact of higher costs for certain electronic components and pre-buying of certain other critical raw material inventory during the year. For 2023, we anticipate that capital spending will be approximately $600 million. Again, in 2023, we do not plan to do any share buybacks and we will continue to focus on further debt reduction. And now I will provide 2023 full year sales and earnings guidance. As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that there will continue to be macroeconomic volatility, including supply chain constraints, recession and inflationary risks and currency fluctuations. Despite this environment, we have positive momentum in many parts of our business heading into 2023, including continued procedural recovery, many new product introductions and a very robust order book for our capital products. Given the above, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8.5% for the full year 2023 when compared to 2022. There are the same number of selling days in 2023 compared to 2022, with one extra day in Q1 and one less day in Q3. Based on the steady progress of our pricing actions, we would expect the full year impact of price to be between zero percent and minus 0.5%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be modestly unfavorably impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year. This is included in our guidance. While we are not specifically guiding the quarters, keep in mind that as you compare the first quarter to the prior year quarter, Q1 2022 did not have the inflationary pressures that we are now experiencing. So despite a strong growth outlook, we do not expect Q1 EPS to be much better than Q1 2022. Finally, for the full year 2023, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.85 to $10.15, representing a return to op margin expansion. This guidance range assumes a gradual improvement of the global operating environment, including a progressive easing of supply chain disruptions throughout the year. And now, I will open up the call for Q&A. Yeah. Yeah. First of all, just picking up where Kevin left off, if you think about the topline, entering the year with such a strong order book, it's really going to kind of bode well for growth of our big capital businesses. The other thing we are really seeing is this procedural expansion and so we feel really good about our momentum, especially in hips and knees and trauma and extremities. So we are going to continue to see those grow as well. That plays into the mix of what we see when we get down to gross margin. We do think the first half of the year we will be working our way through some of that higher dollar inventory that was built up at the end of last year. We are seeing some bright spots in supply chain. We are seeing an environment where we think there will be less spot buys and so all of that will go into in terms of us progressively improving both our gross margin and our op margin. I think the other thing to keep in mind, too, is that, our pricing initiatives and actions really took hold in Q4 and we felt that especially on the MedSurg side. We will benefit from those actions for the full year in 2023. We will also see that's not included in price. All the new products that Kevin talked about that we will launch, those come out at premium prices. So that will also benefit and help us with our op margin improvement. And then the last thing is, we still have some targeted restructurings that will take place in 2023, especially in the first half of 2023. So we will also begin to feel the benefit of those in the second half. So I think Q1 is a little pressured year-over-year just because the inflation wasn't sitting in last year's op margin and it is sitting in 2023 op margin. But I think as the year progresses, we will continue to improve on that op margin, and obviously, that will drive to the EPS growth that we guided to. Hi, Vijay. I will take some of these. If I miss a part, you can correct me. First of all, the growth is not front-end loaded. It's pretty steady throughout each of the quarters and you will see that there is going to be solid growth just given sort of the momentum that we are feeling from fourth quarter. In terms of the order book, we exited 2022 with an increase in the order book year-over-year. So we are actually feeling very bullish about capital sales, about our customer's willingness to buy capital. So we don't -- we feel like that's a great tailwind for the whole year and did I miss the third part? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. As I mentioned, we assume that we will see gradual improvement in the supply chain. We saw some of that in Q4. We actually feel pretty good about our access to supply, we are seeing a reduced volume of spot buys, which are those really high cost items and we are also beginning to work with our original set of vendors and also going up the food chain and actually working with chip suppliers so that we feel like we have a good handle on what's going to happen with supply chain, but it should become better quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter with good improvement and visible improvement in the back half of the year. Yeah. Yeah. Great question. I will start out and just touch on the margin expansion. We typically do not guide on op margins. So we are not going to pinpoint an expansion number. I think backing up from EPS and looking at tax and OI&E and where we are with sales that, you will see that the math doesn't work unless we expand op margin. So I think what you will see is a progressive improvement each quarter in that expansion, especially as the comparable includes inflation from the prior year, so that's what our plan is. Thanks, Matt. We can. Yeah. I think you are astute in your numbers. Definitely, it will be back half margin expansion for 2023. So you are right, we will see relative flat EPS in the first quarter, and then obviously, meaningful expansion starting in Q2, but really accelerating in Q3 and Q4 to drive to the EPS that we guided. Yeah. And that's not a new commentary. So the last four months, I think, our commentary has been very consistent on capital. Our hospitals having challenges with their P&L and in some cases, sure, it's not yet -- we are not seeing it in orders. We are not seeing any cancellation of orders. Are some projects being delayed here and there? Sure. But it really is not having any kind of material impact on our outlook for capital. Again, a lot of our capital is revenue-producing type of capital. So you wouldn't expect any kind of slowdown. But even the large capital area, if I look at our communications business within Endoscopy, had a fantastic year, helped drive some of the Endoscopy growth and they have a terrific order book going into next year and that's large capital that sometimes in prior recessionary cycles have been deferred. So we just aren't seeing it yet. So that gives us optimism to kind of lean in on the growth for at least for 2023. Yeah. I think as you think about inflation, obviously, we felt the impact of the inflation numbers in the -- that were in Q3, especially that were very large. A moderation of that, I would say, occurred in Q4. But keep in mind, to the extent that we purchased raw materials or made inventory, those inflated raw material prices, that's capitalized in our inventory. The other place that we will feel inflation and that it carries over to in this year is really going to be labor costs that went up that are baked in now solidly for the year. We are still experiencing a pretty high inflation in our freight and transportation costs. Energy costs, especially in Europe, now have inflation baked into them, we will feel it there. I think what we are thinking, though, is we are not -- as we look at 2023, that we are not thinking that inflation will continue to be at the levels that it was showing in 2022. So we are feeling that, that will moderate and that's what's included in our guidance. Thank you. Yeah. I think as you think about the biggest contributor to cash flow, honestly, it's earnings. So as we see progressive improvement in earnings throughout the year, I think, we will see that carry over into cash flow. There are some things that were maybe one-offs that we felt that we hope will get better in 2023. That bolus of AR that we had at the end of the year in 2022, obviously, we will collect that and kind of get back to a regular cadence of DSO. And then, finally, as inventory costs moderate and we feel more confident about supply, we will draw down on some of the safety stocks that we had pre-buy. We will also see just lower cost of inventory in raw materials and that should carry over to cash flow, too. And then the other area that I would highlight that maybe doesn't get a lot of attention is, we continue to work on our AP and AP days, and we have made incredible improvements over the past two years to three years in terms of working with vendors and pushing AP out to beyond 70 days and we will continue to work on that as well. So I think all of that bodes well for cash flow improvement. But generally, I think, what you will see is as you see progressive improvement in earnings. You will also see cash flow fall out. Yeah. Yeah. The -- obviously, the segment that has the biggest impact is really our MedSurg businesses. We saw Q4 pretty much all positive pricing impacts across MedSurg and so we expect that to continue into 2023. I mean that being said, on the Ortho side, there's a lot of work around contracts and structures and rebates, and so we are seeing good momentum there as well on pricing. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that, pricing is legacy product over legacy product and so to the extent that we have these product launches, like Kevin was talking about, we generally will launch with premium pricing over the legacy product, but it won't be included in that pricing statistic. It really gets included in volume. So net-net, I think, you will see probably more favorable pricing coming out of the MedSurg businesses, but we are making great progress on the Ortho side, too."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, as well as Mako, Vocera and Wright Medical. Procedural volumes continue to recover throughout the fourth quarter in most countries. Parts of Asia-Pacific, however, have continued to be more volatile due to ongoing COVID-related impacts. While volumes are recovering, hospital staffing pressures have continued in pockets around the globe and patient backlog remains. As mentioned on the Q3 call, these challenges will likely resolve gradually and we continue to expect this will be a moderate tailwind as we move through 2023. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained very healthy in the quarter, as seen from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Endoscopy and Instruments divisions. Even considering our finish, we exited the year with a very strong order book. Next, specific to Mako, we had a record quarter of installations in both the U.S. and internationally. We continue to be agnostic to the form these deals take and will continue to offer flexible options for our customers to acquire capital equipment. The great progress of our Mako offense has resulted in strong growth of our installed base alongside continued increases in utilization. In the U.S., we saw approximately 55% of knees and almost 30% of hips performed using Mako in the quarter. Also, in December, we surpassed our 1 million cementless knee procedure with cementless knees continuing to index higher in make accounts. So in addition to being the leader in robotic-assisted surgery, we are also well ahead on cementless knee adoption. Finally, we are making good progress with the development of our Mako spine and shoulder applications, and expect to have the initial launch of spine in the back half of 2024 and the initial shoulder launch at the end of 2024. Now to our key acquisition and integration activities, our Vocera integration continues to progress well, and as a reminder, we will anniversary in February of this year. Q4 results were consistent with our commentary on the last earnings call, as is the expected sales ramp beginning in Q2 of this year. Turning the page to Wright Medical, we have now passed the two-year mark of the integration of Wright Medical. This has been our largest acquisition to-date. Now complete, we have exceeded expectations on both our sales and synergy assumptions, as the cultural fit was strong and we implemented our integration playbook very effectively. Additionally, it was a catalyst that drove the creation of three separate business units, allowing us to serve unique customers across core trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle. All three businesses exited the year with terrific momentum and strong R&D pipelines. Overall, this acquisition has proven to be a great success and we are excited about what the future holds. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Yeah. Vic, as it relates to China, as you all know, right, China, as it relates to total Stryker less than 2% of our sales. So even as you consider some of the lockdowns and things in 2022, immaterial to our results in terms of Q4. Then as you think about 2023, early days as it relates to Neurovascular VBP. We are certainly keeping an eye on that and as we think about Q1 and the full year of 2023, when we get to the next earnings call, if there's anything material to disclose, we will certainly do it at that time. Hey, Pito. It's Jason. We won't quantify in terms of what we have from an order book perspective. But I would just point back to, I think, what Glenn said earlier around and maybe it was Kevin. But the order book, as we exited 2022 is even larger than when we exited 2021. So we continue to be quite bullish on the capital side as we enter the New Year."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Megan, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly and comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and updates on Vocera and capital equipment. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. For the quarter, organic sales growth was 10% with double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses led by Endoscopy, Medical and Neurocranial. Our Hip and Knee businesses also delivered double-digit growth, reflecting the continued recovery of elective procedures and our worldwide Mako momentum. Lastly, we continued our strong international performance with double-digit organic growth led by Europe, Canada and emerging markets despite negative growth in China. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $2.12 a share driven by our strong sales performance, partially offsetting negative foreign currency and inflationary pressures. We expect these pressures to continue but at a more moderate level for the remainder of 2022. We are pleased with our strong sales growth, which would have been even higher if not for material shortages, mostly affecting Medical and Instruments. Meanwhile, we are taking actions to deal with the cost headwinds, including inflationary challenges. First, as noted in Q2, given the higher input costs, we took a series of pricing actions across our portfolio. We have begun to see the impact of these initiatives, lessening the negative price impact on our business in Q3, but it will take time to see the full effect given the timing of contract renewals and rebates from pirate contracts expiring.  Second, we have taken additional actions around cost, including the reduction of discretionary items, hiring actions and are proceeding with target restructuring plans in parts of our business. We continue to invest in R&D, demonstrating our continued focus on new product pipelines. This includes investments in R&D for enabling technologies, robotics, imaging and navigation, including our recently launched Q Guidance navigation system in Spine. Notably, we are making good progress with the development of our spine and shoulder applications for Mako. We have stopped the Cardan spine robotic project to focus all our energies on Mako and expect that the Mako spine and shoulder launches will occur in a similar time frame. Also during the quarter, we signed an agreement to purchase Cerus Endovascular, a technology leader in the hemorrhagic segment. This deal is pending customary closing conditions. We remain confident in the outlook of our business and expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech, which is reflected in our narrowing of full year organic sales growth to the higher end of our prior range, now 8.5% to 9%. However, worsening foreign currency and continued inflationary pressures have caused us to lower our full year adjusted EPS range to $9.15 to $9.25 per share. Overall, our team has shown good resiliency, and I'm pleased that employee engagement remains very high. We continue to be recognized across many countries, professions, gender and age groups as a great place to work, most recently as one of the world's best workplaces by Fortune. As we look ahead to 2023, we feel optimistic about growth with high customer demand and exciting new product launches. Though the inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges will continue to impact next year, the strong growth outlook, combined with our pricing and cost actions, will position us well to return to strong earnings growth.  I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Beach: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the procedural, geographic and capital trends during the quarter. In addition, I'll provide an update on the integration progress of the Vocera business. Procedural volumes continue to recover throughout the third quarter in most countries, and we are beginning to reach normalized levels across most of our business. While we are seeing volumes recover, hospital staffing pressures have continued to impact the ability to reduce procedural backlog in a meaningful way. These challenges will likely resolve gradually, and we continue to expect this will be a moderate tailwind into next year. Geographically, procedural volumes steadily improved during the quarter in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Parts of Asia Pacific have continued to be more volatile due to ongoing COVID-related impacts. Demand for our capital products remained very strong in the quarter as seen from the double-digit growth of our Medical division. However, we did realize some installation delays as well as hospital scheduling challenges. Specific to Mako, installations for the quarter were soft as we realized delays stemming from variability in the hospital environment. However, our order book remains strong, and we expect a good fourth quarter for Mako. We will update you on our key Mako metrics in January. Now to our key integration activities. We continue to be pleased with our Vocera integration progress and remain excited about the strong growth potential of this platform technology. However, in Q3, we elected to delay some installations shifting from on-prem servers to our cloud solution with certain customers. Also, as we do with all acquisitions, we are shifting the legacy sales force to the Stryker model, which has caused some disruption. These delays resulted in revenues that were essentially flat to Q3 2021. However, the order pipeline remains strong and customer retention remains very high at 99% for software renewals. We expect these processes to continue into Q1 of next year, after which we will be positioned to drive robust sales growth. In summary, while the macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, procedural volumes are improving and the underlying demand for our products remain strong, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive strong revenue growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 9.9% in the quarter. The third quarter's average selling days were in line with 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.7%.  We have started to see the positive impact of pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg businesses, which all had positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 3.7% unfavorable impact on sales. We continue to experience supply chain disruptions that have increased costs and led to inconsistent product availability. This is especially impacting the shipping and delivery time lines related to capital products in our MedSurg businesses. Nevertheless, our capital order book continues to be very robust as demand from our customers remained strong. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 9.2%. International organic sales growth was 11.8%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, specifically emerging markets, Canada, Japan and Europe, somewhat offset by lingering COVID impacts in other Asia Pac countries. Our adjusted EPS of $2.12 in the quarter was down $0.08 from 2021 due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.08. Additionally, higher costs associated with gross margin challenges were offset by the benefit from higher sales and cost discipline.  Now I'll provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 13.5% with organic sales growth of 10.8%, which included 9.6% of U.S. organic growth and 14.4% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 2.2% led by our Surgical Technology business.  From a product perspective, sales growth was highlighted by growth in smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield. During the quarter, Instruments experienced supply chain challenges primarily related to its capital products. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 14% highlighted by double-digit growth in both the core Endoscopy and Sports Medicine businesses. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 13.7% driven by growth in our Sage and acute care businesses fueled by ProCuity and Prime structure demand. As previously noted, Medical continues to experience supply chain challenges that primarily impact emergency care products. Our U.S. Neurovascular business had an organic decline of 2% driven by a strong double-digit comparable in 2021, disruptions due to hospital staffing shortages and slower clinic volumes as well as competitive pressures. The U.S. neurocranial business had organic sales growth of 12.7%, which included solid growth in our Max space and Neuro products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 14.4%, reflecting double-digit growth in all businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Japan, China and other emerging markets. Orthopaedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 8.7%, which included organic growth of 8.7% in the U.S. and 8.9% internationally. This reflects the impact of our strong international growth and solid growth in our Hip, Knee and Trauma and Extremities businesses. Our U.S. Hip business grew 12.4% organically, reflecting strong primary Hip growth fueled by the recent launch of our Insignia Hip Stem and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. New York Knee business grew 14% organically, reflecting our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 10.4% organically with strong performances across all 4 businesses, led by double-digit growth in upper extremities highlighted by our new products Perform and BLUEPRINT. Our U.S. Spine business sales grew 2% from solid performance in our enabling technology business, somewhat offset by the impact of lower surgery volumes in the competitive environment. Our U.S. Other ortho declined organically by 11.2% primarily driven by the impact of the aforementioned delays in Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 8.9% organically, which reflects the strong momentum in Europe as procedural volumes improve as well as strong performances in Japan, Canada and India, somewhat offset by COVID-related volatility in Australia. Now I will focus on the operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 62.6% was unfavorable approximately 370 basis points from the third quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of the purchases of electronic components at premium prices and other inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs as well as inefficiencies from supply chain disruption and the unfavorable impact of price and foreign exchange on sales. Sequentially, from Q2 2022, gross margin was 70 basis points unfavorable. This included the impact from unfavorable business mix, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, including premium pricing and operational inefficiencies. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout the remainder of the year and into 2023. For the full year 2022, we now expect adjusted gross margin compared to 2021 to be adversely impacted by approximately 250 basis points. Adjusted R&D spending was 7.1% of sales, which represents a 40 basis points increase from 2021. This reflects our continued commitment to funding innovation and the related future growth that we'll provide. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.1% of sales, which was 100 basis points lower than 2021. This reflects the impact of an increased focus on discretionary cost control and head count discipline. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 22.3% of sales, which was approximately 310 basis points unfavorable to the third quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned gross margin challenges and the net negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange translation, somewhat offset by cost discipline. Adjusted other income and expense decreased from 2021, primarily resulting from lower interest expense and favorable interest income. We anticipate Q4 OI&E to be approximately $70 million. Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.5%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be at the low end of our previously communicated range of 14.5% to 15%, which is slightly lower than 2021.  Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.8 billion. Approximately $250 million of term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, which brings our year-to-date payments to $500 million.  Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $1.6 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings, partially offset by the impact of higher costs for certain electronic components, pre-buying of certain other critical raw material inventory and seasonal inventory increases. Considering our third quarter results, our strong order book for capital equipment and the sales momentum in our implant and capital businesses, we now expect full year 2022 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9%.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we now expect net sales in the full year to be adversely impacted by approximately 4% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be adversely impacted by approximately $0.35 to $0.40 for the full year, which is included in our revised earnings guidance range. Based on continuing inflationary and supply chain pressures, balanced with our strong sales and additional cost-reduction actions and most significantly, the anticipated future impact of foreign currency, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.15 to $9.25. And now I will open the call up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan Chase.\nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a really nice top line here. That said, I do want to ask my first question on operating margins both for third quarter and fourth quarter. And it came in a lot lower. It looks like half was for currency. I think -- what I'd like to know is how much of what we saw to the negative was transient in third quarter. And what's driving the strong sequential improvement into fourth quarter here?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Robbie, this is Glenn. Good questions. As we looked at the third quarter and the impact and what changed from Q2 specifically, we just -- what we saw was, we saw that our visibility to supply had improved and that we were seeing sort of moderate sort of improvement. But the rate of improvement relative to the cost was not improving at that kind of outlook. So we continue to see higher-than-expected premium costs. We saw other inflation across almost all categories. But as I noted, most noticeably in labor, metals, transportation. And then all of that and that sort of variability of supply chain really drove just inefficiencies in our manufacturing process. And so that -- we had lots of stops and starts, which, as you know, just drives up more cost. So I think if I think about it, what's transient, what's not, I think in Q4, we have good visibility to supply and feel confident enough to raise our sales guidance, which is what we did. And so we'll feel that in Q4.  I still think we're going to see a little bit of this fluid environment where we'll continue to experience some higher costs. And I would tell you that once we get our hands around sort of one electronic component issue, then we'll be contacted from a [N minus 2] vendor about another issue. And so we're feeling that sort of through -- as we're managing through sort of our supply chain issues.\nRobert Marcus: Great. And as we go into 2023, where I think everybody is starting to focus, I don't think there's much issue with the top line with 9.9 in the quarter, 8.5% to 9% for the year. That looks really good. I think people feel comfortable into next year. Where there's questions is down the P&L and on EPS. And Kevin, you mentioned the comment about strong EPS growth next year. I see The Street -- my numbers looks north of 50 basis points margin expansion. Next year, which might be a little high given the trends we're seeing here, would love to hear if you have any initial comments on thoughts on 2023 and particularly what that strong EPS growth means.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. We're going to give specific guidance in January, as we always do. But I did make that comment in my opening remarks to signal that this year is an aberration. We will get back to strong earnings, which does absolutely imply margin expansion in 2023. But specifics, we'll get to you in January.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: I wanted to ask first about the supply shortages. Kevin or Glenn, I don't know if you are willing to comment on how much you think they impacted you. How much do you expect to be impacted in Q4? And are these sales you expect to get back over time? And I had one follow-up.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Larry, I think not to give specific guidance on numbers relative to the disruptions, but suffice to say that on some products, we are very hand-to-mouth in terms of how we're getting componentry to complete those products and ship them to customers. On some, we have a little bit better visibility. I would tell you that with our order backlog at an all-time high, we are seeing pretty significant disruptions across our capital businesses. We're very focused on getting product to customers. We know that's important. And we are working hard to make sure that as we can secure supply that we work around the clock to get those products finished and get them out to customers.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Larry, what I'd add is our problems are in the MedSurg side of our business. And on the MedSurg side of our business, we're not going to lose sales. So if we have problems in the implant side, those sales would be lost to competitors. In this case, customers are waiting. The products aren't urgent. We do have a plan to get these products to our customers. Medical's numbers, which were pretty impressive at 13-plus percent organic, would have been materially higher because of the emergency care demand and the same with Instruments. Those are the two divisions that had the most impact. Frankly, we have a lot of nickeling issues across our portfolio, but those two divisions were severely impacted in Q3. You'll see recovery -- some recovery in Q4 and into next year. But I really don't expect to lose any of those sales, which gives me a lot of confidence going into next year that our sales -- positive sales trajectory will continue.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And then maybe a little bit more color on the softness with Mako this quarter. How confident are you in the rebound in Q4? And Glenn, I know the other line is not just Mako, but when can we expect to see that line turn positive?\nJason Beach: Larry, it's Jason. I'll start here and talk a little bit about Mako. And then, Glenn, if you want to comment on the other piece, feel free. But as it relates to Mako, like I said in my prepared remarks, the orders were soft. But if you look at the order pipeline, it is very robust. And we continue to be, I'll say, the robotic-assisted choice in the marketplace. And so we feel good about Q4. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we expect a strong quarter.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, Larry. The only thing I'd add is there are a couple of products in that line item other. But yes, you're right, that's where Mako is. I don't really want to guide you on Q4. I think sequentially, we will definitely see improvement. But in terms of when will we see full positivity, we'll talk about that in January.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Just one last comment to add. What I'm really encouraged by is quarter after quarter after quarter, we're seeing the knee -- Mako as a percent of our total Knees go up, hips as a percent of -- Mako Hips as a percent of total Hips go up, cementless percent of total Knees go up, and cementless tends to correlate very well with Mako. So all those vectors are heading the right direction. Yes, we've had some more delays in getting these robots installed and sold to our customers. But Q4 will be good and will continue our positive trajectory.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Guys, congrats on a good top line print here. Kevin, maybe my first question here is on '23. I guess, did I hear you guys say labor situation improves that big tailwind in '23? And how should we think about this capital versus supply chain impact, those dynamics, right? Its strong capital order book versus supply chain dynamics, how does that impact '23? Any new products that we should be thinking of? Again, I'm not asking for specific guidance, but maybe some qualitative comments on these variables.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Sure. I'll stay in the land of qualitative, Vijay, at this time of the year. But first, we are seeing a tailwind in procedural demand. So procedures are recovering around the world, a little slower in the Asia Pac regions. But given what happened with COVID, we expect that tailwind, as you saw, with very good growth in our Hip and Knee business that will continue into fourth quarter and I think a pretty modest or moderate tailwind in throughout 2023 and maybe even into 2024. So that's one positive tailwind. We have a number of new products we're launching: System 9 camera in the early part of the year -- sorry, System 9 power tool in the early part of the year; 1780 camera around the middle of the year; and then we've got a defibrillator, which is a little less certain on timing because it's a PMA product, but the life pack perhaps towards the latter part of the year. But those are big, massive and important products. And you know what happens when we launch those products. I kind of call it a super cycle within MedSurg of new product launches. We have the Insignia Hips stem, which is less than 50% of the way launched. You know that these implant launches take multiple years to get all the sets out into the field, but tremendous momentum. You saw our Hip numbers have looked good the last couple of quarters relative to competition because of the Insignia Stem, and that will just continue to gain steam going forward. So those are a number of the positives. What I'd say on the order book side, that we know we have this big, big backlog of orders that customers are willing to wait for, in many cases, especially in emergency care. Orders are not being canceled. That gives us a lot of confidence that the demand is there. We just have to make sure we can get the supply to the customers. And we've been securing chips. We've been securing different products. But as Glenn mentioned, it's been hit and miss along -- sometimes it's just a resin, sometimes it's a small component. So there's been spottiness. It's getting better, but it's kind of getting better slowly. So we'll fight our way through that probably in the first half of next year. But tremendous demand in the absence of new products, and those new products will just sort of give us extra momentum going into next year. I just picked a few. But -- sorry for some of my divisions. I didn't mention the hip, the shoulder, the Foot & Ankle. And so there's a lot of other ones, but those are sort of the -- some of the big ones.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful color, Kevin. Glenn, maybe one for you. At current FX rates, how should we think about EPS impact for '23? In the 250 basis points of gross margin impact, what is being capitalized? What percentage of that 250 basis points is being capitalized on the balance sheet?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Okay, Vijay. Vijay, the -- on the FX rates, without overly guiding for next year, but I think if you look at sort of what happened in 2022, rates really took off in sort of Q3, Q4. And so the comparable for Q1, Q2, I still think will have a pretty big impact for rates next year as you look at sort of your modeling for next year. And then in terms of just the capitalized variance piece, we -- I won't give you specifics. But I will remind you that to the extent we are making spot buys, it relates to raw materials that get put in inventory, and then the future utilization of those raw materials is usually over an 8- to 9-month time frame. So that gets a little bit more -- to Kevin's comment, that we'll still feel some of this into -- well into Q2 of next year. And to the extent we're still in a spot-buy-premium situation in Q1 of 2023, then that will bleed into, say, Q3 as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: The first one is the messaging has been very consistent throughout this year about the strong capital demand. And understand that there's a give and take between backlog of orders because the orders to fill orders canceled and new orders. So I guess, can you talk specifically on new orders during 3Q and what you're seeing for 4Q against your expectations?\nJason Beach: Yes. Pito, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. I would point you back to some of the commentary around the order book. And if you look at our capital businesses, it continues to be very strong. And so as we look to the fourth quarter, similar to the comments Kevin said around Medical and Instruments, we certainly expect a recovery in the fourth quarter with Instruments and another strong quarter for Medical as well.\nKevin Lobo: And even Endoscopy, who had a very strong Q3, they grew their orders as well in the quarter. So they will also have another strong quarter in Q4. So it's really across our portfolio where the demand is very, very strong. And we're not seeing sort of a capital slowdown, which I know I've heard out that some other companies mentioned. We're just not seeing that in our orders. We're not having orders canceled. It's kind of -- it's something I haven't seen in my tenures here, customers ordering things and then canceling it. So we feel very good about our position. Our orders have not slowed down. They just continue to grow. Just one little example, which I really enjoy is on Vocera, we've now integrated that with our ProCuity bed. So the alerts for falls from the bed actually goes straight to the badge, and we're already showing this to our customers and getting really wild positive feedback from customers on this. And again, it's early days, but the ProCuity momentum, which really powered our strong Medical growth this quarter, is just building. And it's kind of the second year of the launch. It's really just gaining steam. And now with its interoperability with Vocera, that provides an extra bit of energy to that business.\nPito Chickering: Okay. Fair enough. And then a follow-up on Neurovascular's a touch weaker this quarter. Just curious, how that is market versus competition versus supply shortages?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks. We've seen a slow market this year in the U.S. in Neurovascular, not exactly sure why. There's a number of different theories out there as to why the market itself has been slow. I'd say that's probably most of it. But there are new competitors in both aspiration as well stent retrievers. The FDA has kind of reduced the requirements -- the clinical requirements in those categories. So there are a number of new players which affects part of it. But the market has been soft. And maybe it's a COVID issue that some of these patients that would have had strokes are not having stroke because of the mortality effects of COVID. It's hard to know exactly why, but the market has slowed down definitely in the U.S. I think that's probably the bigger portion, but there are also some competitive pressures. Keep in mind that for us, the U.S. is much smaller than our OUS business in Neurovascular, has always been that way. It's the one business that kind of has the reverse of the rest of our portfolio. So we continue to feel bullish about the long-term prospects on this business. We're only treating a small percentage of people that have strokes. And as I noted in my opening remarks, we've just completed signed an agreement for a tuck-in acquisition in the intraocular space.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: The first one is just on the restructuring you talked about. Is that something that's going to be impactful to next year, specifically to help drive that at EPS growth? And then do you have other levers that are kind of below the line that you can pull on that to help with the EPS growth for next year?\nKevin Lobo: Well, EPS growth, as I mentioned, there'll be a combination of price. And in fact, some businesses are taking on their second round of price increases. And having the timing of those start to really appear as contracts roll off. So price is one component. Cost reduction clearly is another component. The restructuring -- these actions are very targeted. So it's really around things we were going to do anyways to improve our processes. We're just accelerating those activities. We'll see some of that this year. We'll see some of that into early part of next year, and it will have an impact in our earnings per share for sure next year.\nGlenn Boehnlein: And Matt, below the line, if you look at sort of in an taxes, it's -- there are some opportunities related to how quickly we pay down the term loan. So there could be some pickups relative to interest expense, although those would be minor given the rates. And then taxes is -- I don't expect any surprises, sort of steady as we've been there.\nMatthew O'Brien: Okay. And then on with the new -- sorry, go ahead.\nKevin Lobo: I was going to say one last comment before. We will get mix benefits from the new products that we launched. So that's one thing to -- and you won't see that in the price line, but we'll definitely get that benefit through the P&L, which helps our earnings.\nMatthew O'Brien: Okay. Okay. I appreciate that. And then, Kevin, I think back to the Analyst Day maybe 1.5 years ago, you talked about Mako with these new indications of shoulder and spine kind of coming out, I think, more a step -- like having one 1 year then one the following year. Is this now commentary about these two coming out at the same time because maybe Spine is getting pushed a little bit later than you expected before? And I didn't hear you specifically say spine and shoulder for Mako next year. So is this something we should expect more like '24 and beyond?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. You know what, we're not ready to give you a time line now. I wouldn't expect it next year. But in one of the next upcoming calls, perhaps January or the one after that, we will give you some expected time lines. The reason that they're coming out at the same time now, there's two things. One is Spine's kind of moved ahead in its pace, and shoulder kind of moved back a little bit because we had to adapt to the Tornier implants and bring in the BLUEPRINT software and marry that with Mako. So we were on a certain time line with Stryker shoulder implants, but we wanted to switch to the Tornier implants. They're the market-leading implants. So we had to sort of delay that one. But Spine has been moved forward. So the team has done a terrific job. We had two projects that we are pursuing: the Cardan one as well as Mako. Mako is going to be the answer for us. We've already started to show some surgeons, and we've received very, very positive feedback on that. So we're excited. And so again, the timing, hopefully, possibly as early as January, I'll give you more specifics on it. As you know, robots are complicated. That's why we're sort of hesitant to first give you time lines until we feel more confident. But I'd say that a lot of the challenges that we had before, we've overcome. And we've had good meetings with the FDA. We're on a very good trajectory on both of those projects. Hard for me actually to know which one will be first as they'll come out pretty -- in pretty close proximity to each other.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Jennings with Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: I wanted to start just on pricing. It sounds like guys are getting some traction there on your pricing initiatives. Should we be thinking about price turning positive? I think it's 70 basis points headwind in 3Q. Or is that too aggressive? Just wanted to get a better sense. And the follow-up question is just on just the ASCs with your ortho business, but primarily joints. Any updates just in terms of receptivity for Mako robots? And also just the pace of ASCs opening, and that seems to be maybe the bottleneck in terms of the pace of migration overall orthopedic procedures into ASCs. But wanted to just get a better sense of what you're seeing in ASCs as well.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Josh, it's Glenn. I'll take the first one on pricing. I think, first of all, we're having obviously some big initiatives going on around pricing, making sure that we're educating customers in terms of what's happening to us relative to the cost of raw materials and things like that. Pricing is mostly impacting MedSurg. That's not to say there's not as big of impact on the ortho side. Keep in mind, too, that most of our businesses are under some sort of contracts. And so a lot of this sort of pacing is relative to as those contracts come up for negotiation, we can enter into that with those customers. I think so far, we're seeing good progress. We expect to continue to see good progress into Q4. I won't call out a guide yet for next year. But what I would tell you, one of the things that also will give us a little bit of lift that may not be reflected in pricing is the comment that Kevin made relative to new products that are released. And most new products that are released are released at a premium price relative to the legacy price. And so that will give us a little bit of uplift as well.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. And related to your question on ASCs, we -- our offense continues to exceed our expectation. Just the bundle that we provide for the ASC to make life easy for them has been very well received. Close to half of the deals that we win includes a Mako in these orthopedic ASCs. We've now crossed sort of the 10% mark of large joints that are done in ASCs. It keeps going up, not at a rapid rate, but it's a steady climb. And to your point, the gating factor is just construction and refurbishment of these ASCs to enable more procedures. But every hospital system I talked to is preparing themselves for another -- a new ASC. It's a trend that had started prior to COVID and has accelerated. And we expect that, that will continue. But we love our position. The breadth of our portfolio, having capital disposables and implants puts us in a really leading position. And Makos, as I said, almost all the time are included, and that gives us a giant advantage.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatthew Miksic: A lot of great color as been covered here. But I'd first just love to see the interoperability and connected care comments around Vocera and just color around Mako spine and shoulders is exciting. I wanted to just maybe focus a little bit back to margins on some of the purchasing comments you made, Glenn. And just to get a feel for how much of what impacted you in the third quarter had to do with spot buys purchases made in previous quarters. And whether any -- I think you mentioned that some of those prices are getting a little bit easier, which -- or better maybe, which then -- is that -- have we hit a high watermark in terms of the sort of impact on margins or is it too early to say? And I had one follow-up.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Okay. Yes, Matt, I think -- I mean a couple of things. As you sort of think about the guidance, the 250 basis points, in rough terms, half of that is being driven by sort of the premiums that we're paying on those spot buy purchases. And then the other half is really kind of solidly grounded in what we're seeing on the inflation and the inefficiency side, somewhat tempered by sort of some cost discipline even within our operations. On the spot buys, I think what I was saying is that we have better visibility now to our ability to acquire supply. We are seeing some moderation, although not as much as I think we were hoping to see, as we entered into Q3 in terms of what those costs are. So things are just -- they're not coming down as quick as we wanted them to nor do I expect that our spot purchases in Q4 will come down significantly either. And then on the inflation side, a lot of that is flowing through increases in labor, increases in commodity prices that we're paying. Because we're in this difficult supply chain situation, we're having to use a lot of, say, airfreight versus ocean freight, which cost a lot more to expedite raw materials coming in so that we can manufacture and get out to customers. And so those are the type of inflationary things that we're feeling that are in that number.\nMatthew Miksic: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one of the dynamics, Q3 to Q4, you mentioned that product mix was a bit of a headwind for you in Q3. Maybe if you could highlight some of the ways in which -- if you expect that to improve in Q4 or Q1. And around that, in particular, it seems like your businesses are sort of seeing a better look from some of the staffing challenges in hospitals than some other companies. And not everyone is seeing improvement. So just wondering how you think about what you're seeing in priorities of its and needs versus other procedures. Any color that you're getting that would kind of help folks understand what exactly is happening, what's happening and how it's maybe unevenly affecting different procedures and different settings?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Okay. Let me take the first part of that question relative to mix and what we saw in Q3 and how we think that might play out in Q4. I think you can sort of look at sort of sales growth as a proxy for where we felt the pain of mix. Instruments was down, and that's a fairly highly profitable business for us. NV was also a little bit down, and that too is a highly profitable business for us. And so those not being a normal proportion of our sales really sort of hurt us somewhat at the margin line. I think Instruments has good visibility to supply moving into Q4, and so I do expect that we'll see a good performance out of Instruments as we wrap up the year. NV, it's a little bit different. It's not capital and there's not sort of a backlog of orders. NV is very procedural-based. But I know that NV is very focused on finishing out the year and hitting their quotas. And so I think we'll see some improvement out of NV as well.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Just last point on mix. I think Australia is one of the big, big markets for Stryker. And they've been hit by COVID and delays, and they do expect a stronger -- it's already started. We're seeing that start to build, and that's a highly profitable business as well. So those are -- that's another element of mix we're going to see improve in Q4 versus Q3. And then your other question, I'm not sure I totally got it, but I think you were talking about different procedures and how we're seeing the recovery and clearly get the needs. We're seeing robust recovery. There's big waiting lists, which in the U.K. and physicians who took -- maybe took some time off in summer a little bit more than they normally would, given coming off the COVID are very busy now, and they're starting to operate more. As much staff is available for them, the more they're going to operate. And staffing is still a little bit challenged, but it's been gradually improving. So there, we see robust kind of growth going into next year. Spine has been a little bit more choppy, to be honest. And I don't think it went down as much as the needs did. If you look at the Omicron variant and everything that -- spine procedures were still a little bit more resilient. And so we're not seeing that pop quite at the same extent as we are in our Hip and Knee. And I mentioned already Neurovascular in the U.S. where the market is soft, and that's the one that -- I saw some comments related to TAVR that talked about the market being a little bit soft. And I wonder if that patient profile with all these comorbidities, there might be something similar that could be impacting the ischemic stroke portion of the market. So that's -- hopefully answered that part of your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.\nRick Wise: Kevin, two questions for me. First, we've touched on it a little bit, but you talked about Asia Pacific being -- continuing to be volatile and China negative growth and that -- those pressures continuing through the end of '22. Just in general, at a high level, are you -- what's the setup for next year? Are you assuming as you look at the landscape that things are going to get better? Just, again, your high-level thoughts there?\nKevin Lobo: Sure. Sure. At a high level, COVID has had a delayed impact in a lot of Asia Pacific. And we certainly expect to get better. We're already seeing it. Japan had a really nice quarter this quarter. Australia will pick up in Q4. Some of the ASEAN countries are improving. So I do expect the outlook to be better next year in Asia Pacific overall than this year. Our emerging markets had really robust double-digit growth in spite of China being slightly negative. It was negative really driven by volume-based procurement in the orthopedic side of our business and pretty good performance on the MedSurg and Neurotechnology side of the business. But we, finally, after many years, started to build tremendous momentum in Latin America as well as emerging Europe, at least in Africa, where we're gaining really tremendous momentum with -- really driven by Mako as well as our 1688 camera. That's driving really strong growth this year. And I think that should continue going into next year. Even India has really had a terrific year this year. And as you know, we've had our share of challenges in the past. So I would say the international story for Stryker is starting to click. As you saw since 2019, our international organic growth has outpaced the U.S., and that did not happen in my first seven years as CEO. And I do expect that to continue. And frankly, the COVID tailwind should really cement that going forward.\nRick Wise: Great. And one other sort of big-picture question, Kevin. I mean you usually have great perspectives on this kind of stuff. One of the toughest questions to answer for me is how, when, where do some of these supply chain issues, particularly around chips, how does it get resolved? When does it get resolved? And I'd be curious to hear what you're thinking for the industry. But what are you thinking -- how are you going to resolve this so that you can stop boring about it for Stryker? Is it just you just have to wait? Or are there tangible steps that you can take or the industry needs to take still to get past this topic? Appreciate that.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, it's a great question. I would tell you this year has been extremely frustrating unlike any year I've had where, to be honest, we misestimated. We thought early on, we were going to have 100 to 200 basis points of pressure. And now Glenn is saying it's 250. So that's something we did not call. It's been difficult to predict. I think one of the steps that we're taking, which is really kind of exciting, is as you move to new products, so as we move to System 9 and as we move to 1788, we're using new-generation chips. And the supply availability is actually quite high for new-generation trips. And so the faster we can migrate to new products, it actually helps secure our ability to have supply. And so we are pushing our R&D teams really hard to be able to shift to these newer products because our challenge is, frankly, the older-generation chips. And that's why emergency care is so pressured, emergency care being defibrillators primarily. Because their PMA products, we can't just swap the chip out. It goes through a whole regulatory regime, and those are older-generation chips. So the faster we can migrate to new products, the faster that secures our chip availability. It's been kind of a moving target as we've secured chips with one supplier, we have a new problem with another supplier. And even things like resins. And so it's been a very unusual and tough year, but it's slowly getting better, Rick. And as we launch new products, that will get us really healthy because new chips aren't the problem. Our problem is really getting the old electronics. And frankly, the camera business, I give our Endoscopy team a lot of credit that they were able to actually qualify some new products. And because it's not P&A, they were able to really drive good growth, but it's been a scramble. And we're hopeful that things get stable. Really, I think we're going to be in this soup for probably another couple of quarters by the middle of the year. And then I think the guys will start to clear. But you know what, that's -- I don't know a total crystal ball, and we haven't been right this year. But that's sort of how it looks right now, that they'll still be a little choppy, but it's just moderately getting better as we go through the year.\nOperator: Next question comes from Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley.\nDrew Ranieri: Kevin and Glenn, just maybe, Kevin, on your comments about ProCuity, the bed launch, you're gaining momentum there and it's in your second year of launch. Just kind of curious how launch is progressing. And if you could give us an update on where you are in terms of market share, the replacement cycle. And then really, what should we expect now that you have integrated Vocera into the ProCuity bed? Should that have a meaningful acceleration into the ProCuity launch?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I'm very bullish on ProCuity. It's a fantastic product, and the cross-sell capability with Vocera, where we were strong, let's say, with ProCuity or beds and Vocera wasn't as strong or Vocera. Conversely, Vocera was strong, but we didn't have a strong bed position. That cross-sell opportunity is already presenting itself. We've been in front of some very big accounts, and we're showing them this integrated system. And we've already gotten some orders. And so I'm bullish. It had a terrific third quarter. We're trying to make them as fast as we can right now, which is a high-class problem. And so I think you're going to see very good results for ProCuity. It's a winning bed, and Vocera is just going to add gas to the fire.\nDrew Ranieri: And Glenn, maybe one for you, but I know you don't necessarily want to give '23 guidance at all. But just as you're thinking about free cash flow and Kevin's comments about strong EPS growth for next year, can you help us contextualize that on maybe what free cash flow growth we should see for next year or working capital improvements?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think right now, just given all the variability in kind of where we are, we're just focused on this year and finishing up. I'd hate to throw out a number for free cash flow conversion. I think it would be safe to assume that it wouldn't be far away from our historical averages, and that's probably where we would land for next year. Keep in mind, for next year, our focus will still be debt repayment. And we'll pay down the rest of that term loan before we allocate other capital to M&A.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Saxon with Needham & Company.\nDavid Saxon: Maybe to start on extremities. Just wondering what you're seeing in the foot and ankle market. Did any procedures perform better or worse than others? And then I'll ask my second question upfront here. Maybe can you talk about the Q Guidance System, how that early launch is going? And maybe you can touch on the launch strategy, pricing and feedback you got from NASS.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So starting with Foot & Ankle had a really terrific Q3. The highest growth within Foot & Ankle is coming out of our total ankle where we have a clear market leadership that had double-digit growth. But even though the midfoot, 4-foot procedures are picking back up, as you know, the pandemic did kind of slow entente somewhat, but they had a very good Q3. We had a number of new launches in that category for foot launches. So we're feeling very good about that going forward. But it was a strong Q3 that contributed to -- especially in the United States, that contributed to the double-digit growth that we had in Trauma Extremities in the U.S. in the second year. Oh, Q Guidance, yes. We had really terrific feedback because -- it's an incredibly fast internally developed camera, much faster than what you see the competition using. It also actually provides suggestions about which screws to use and -- so that's very novel as well. And that will be the camera that will be ported to Mako for the future, and it really simplifies the workflow. Very, very positive feedback. That contributed to the strong enabling technology performance. So we had a number of very good sales of the Q Guidance System in Q3, and that's picking up into Q4. So, so far so good on that launch. Obviously, we still want to get to Mako. And we also have another project called CoPilot. That's the kind of the internal code name, which is really around drills and providing some haptic feedback, which we were able to show some of the surgeons at NASS to great feedback because that doesn't exist in the market today. So we have a pretty comprehensive portfolio in enabling technology for Spine. It's going to take us some time to bring these additional products to the market, but Q Guidance was very well received, especially because of the speed and efficiency that we offer without requiring them to change their workflow.\nOperator: Next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer.\nSteven Lichtman: A couple of follow-ups. Jason, in capital, we talked a lot this evening about supply. But in the prepared remarks, you talked about installation delays due to variability in the hospital environment and scheduling challenges. Can you provide a little more color on what you're seeing specifically when you talk about that and the variability? And were those comments related to both traditional Medical and Mako? And then I just have a quick one for Glenn.\nJason Beach: Yes. I'd say a couple of different things just as you think about that and think about capital. Obviously, our larger capital is beyond Mako, right? But what we're seeing is sometimes I think when we talk about staffing challenges, people go right to nurses and some of those things. But really, what we're talking about here is even like if you think about our comm business, you'll have scheduled installations. People show up to do an install. They'll get canceled. They'll have to come back. And so that's the variability that I'm referring to that sometimes delays installs, and ultimately, revenue and gets pushed out. Glenn, in terms of second piece?\nGlenn Boehnlein: He didn't ask yet.\nSteven Lichtman: Yes. So Glenn, just my -- the follow-up for Glenn, just one variable for next year I wanted to ask you about is FX. So I mean based on where rates are today -- I mean, you talked about some of the -- qualitatively about the impact next year, but would the impact next year versus this be about the same as what you're seeing this year versus last based on where rates are sitting today?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think without doing the math or having any other basis in next year, if I just look at rates, it's, yes, roughly going to be the same. We'll be more precise in January, but that's a pretty good starting point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Happy Halloween. Just a couple for me. Kevin, we're a few years past the K2 acquisition. And given where the performance has been these past few years, I wanted to get your assessment of kind of the Spine business and how you feel that's come together. And that dovetails into my next question, which is just Vocera having some disruptions. What did you learn from the disruptions in Q2? And kind of what are you expecting from the disruption you have in Vocera and how you maybe improve upon what you went through with K2 in terms of disruption with Vocera?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So let me first say the Vocera disruption is very different than K2M destruction. K2M is an overlap deal, where you have the same sales reps selling the same kinds of products. That's the hardest kind of deal to integrate. Frankly, we learned a lot from K2M that we then put into our Wright Medical integration, which has gone extremely well. That's more analogous where the Foot & Ankle is an example or upper extremities, you have overlapping reps. Vocera is not an overlap deal. So that one is going to be a lot easier to get through. We did the same thing with Physio-Control. If you remember, we merged the emergency care, our power costs for the ambulances with defibrillators, and we merged that sales force. And we had some disruption in the first year that we got through pretty fast. And then we got into a torrid double-digit kind of growth trajectory thereafter. So Vocera will have a little bit of disruption. It's not just because of the sales force, but also because we'd like to move more of the business to the cloud, which will be better for us and better for our customers long term versus being on-premise. And so we don't mind taking a little bit of pain in the -- for the next quarter or two. But thereafter, you should expect that to be able to sing. It's a lot easier from an integration standpoint. This is just running this record offense without having to have reps competing.  As I think about Spine, it's obviously the most competitive market we play in. It's a very tough market. K2M was not a very expensive acquisition compared to alternatives that we looked at the time. It's been okay deal. It hasn't been one of our best deals, but it solved a problem for us where we would have frankly been growing below-market rates had we not done the deal. We were able to kind of hang on to be able to grow around market rates with some good innovation. And now that we've got our enabling technology road map, I'm actually pretty excited about Spine in the future. It's going to continue to be a bit of a dogfight through sort of the end of next year, but going into '24, already with Q Guidance, we have a bit of a spring in our step, a new expandable distribution deal with Life Spine. So we're starting to feel a little bit of momentum, our Monterey new launch as well. So we're starting to feel a bit of momentum, but it's not having a robot as a problem. We do have this project with Mako that will help solve that problem. And we are committed to Spine long term. But clearly, it is the most challenging market of all. But certainly don't -- for me, Vocera will have probably roughly flat sales growth year-over-year for Q4, Q1, and then you should expect Vocera to start to zoom after that.\nRyan Zimmerman: That's very helpful. And then if I could just squeeze one more in real quick. In terms of delivery, you talked about some of the capital cycle and the dynamics of the supply chain. And just if you were to order a product today from you guys and upon receipt, it takes maybe 90 days under normal circumstances, just help us understand some of these orders that are pulling through or extending beyond the quarter. I mean I don't know if you guys, Glenn, want to quantify this. But is it 20 days now because of the delays -- 110 days total, I mean? Is it a few months after? Just as we think about kind of the extension of the order book, which still tends to be strong, what does this mean quantitatively in terms of order to delivery?\nJason Beach: Ryan, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. And what I would say is, first off, I'd point you back to my prepared remarks in terms of this being a moderate tailwind for some time, right? In terms of how much longer is the delivery cycle, candidly, it's going to vary by product cycle, right, or the type of product that it is. And so we're certainly not going to quantify in terms of the impact there, but it certainly does vary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies.\nMatthew Taylor: I'll just ask a follow-up on that theme, I guess. I was really interested in your comments about kind of the procedural backlog and perhaps taking some time to burn off in addition to your order book. So the royalty that up is just as, a, are there areas of your portfolio where you see greater or lesser backlog, just to help us think about how those things could come back over time? And I guess, what are you looking at to predict that you could actually see this procedural runoff take more than 2023 and into 2024?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I think Hip and Knees are the areas where I think it's not just a Stryker thing. I think the market will be more robust. And certainly, you can talk to our competitors, and I think they would share that osteoarthritis doesn't improve itself. These patients are going to need these procedures. Aging population and demographics play in our favor. And I think you're going to see that tailwind. It's just -- I just don't think it's going to be -- surgeons aren't going to be operating on weekends, and their staffs not available to have a big spike and then kind of a return to normal. That's why I think it will be a gradual tailwind for multiple quarters. But those are -- that's the business I think you're going to see that kind of sustained positive momentum on the surgery volumes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist.\nSamuel Brodovsky: This is Sam on for the team. Just -- I'll just ask both ears upfront. Just on SG&A about, call it, 100-ish basis points improvement in 2Q, 3Q here. Should we think about that being sustainable in the 4Q? And then with the restructuring, is there room for that to continue to improve into '23? And then similar question on R&D. I mean, should we think about that 7% level being right for the full year? And how should we think about that directionally into '23?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Sam, this is Glenn. On SG&A, I think generally, the only thing that really becomes significantly variable is just sales commissions that flows through there. So in terms of the kind of procedures and controls that we put in place relative to discretionary cost control, we should see that continue into Q4. And so that's probably a pretty good proxy.  And then on R&D, we've been hovering at that level, honestly, for several quarters. And so the only variability might be that sales are a little larger in Q4, which might actually make the percentage go down a little bit in R&D. But I do think that, that run rate is a good approximate.\nKevin Lobo: For the full year.\nGlenn Boehnlein: For the full year.\nSamuel Brodovsky: Is that on a dollar basis?\nGlenn Boehnlein: On a percentage basis.\nKevin Lobo: Percentage.\nGlenn Boehnlein: 6%, 7% of sales roughly, that's a pretty good number for a full year. Keep in mind, Q4 is seasonally our strongest. So you are going to see much higher op margin than you've seen certainly in the last 2 quarters in Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: I'll just be quick here, realizing we're deep in the call. But just on China, when do you expect the VBP dynamics to subside or anniversary for you?\nJason Beach: This is Jason. I'll take this one. So just as a reminder, right, China overall is less than 2% of our sales. And the sales that are exposed to VBP are actually less than 1%, so fairly immaterial. But relative to kind of the next impact, there will be an impact as we go into next year around NV. Obviously, we're not going to guide at this point, but you'll hear more about that as we get into next year.\nJayson Bedford: And Jason, does that start in '23? Or will you see any impact here in the fourth quarter?\nJason Beach: It will start in '23. Again, we'll talk more about timing when we get closer, but it will be '23.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeff Johnson: Just a quick follow-up. Really just a clarification. Jason, in your prepared remarks, you talked about Mako installs being delayed during the quarter. I think in a follow-up to Larry Biegelsen's question, you talked about orders for Mako being soft. Just was orders, was it the installs? And maybe a little more color just on what exactly happened in the third quarter and what the confidence is that recovering in the fourth.\nJason Beach: Yes. No, my comments were definitely specific to installs. I may have made a comment relative to a strong order book, which is absolutely the case, and we do expect a strong fourth quarter.\nOperator: There are no more questions waiting. So I will pass the conference back over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: Well, thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year-end 2022 results with you as well as our 2023 guidance in January. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and updates on Vocera and capital equipment. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. For the quarter, organic sales growth was 10% with double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses led by Endoscopy, Medical and Neurocranial. Our Hip and Knee businesses also delivered double-digit growth, reflecting the continued recovery of elective procedures and our worldwide Mako momentum. Lastly, we continued our strong international performance with double-digit organic growth led by Europe, Canada and emerging markets despite negative growth in China. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $2.12 a share driven by our strong sales performance, partially offsetting negative foreign currency and inflationary pressures. We expect these pressures to continue but at a more moderate level for the remainder of 2022. We are pleased with our strong sales growth, which would have been even higher if not for material shortages, mostly affecting Medical and Instruments. Meanwhile, we are taking actions to deal with the cost headwinds, including inflationary challenges. First, as noted in Q2, given the higher input costs, we took a series of pricing actions across our portfolio. We have begun to see the impact of these initiatives, lessening the negative price impact on our business in Q3, but it will take time to see the full effect given the timing of contract renewals and rebates from pirate contracts expiring.  Second, we have taken additional actions around cost, including the reduction of discretionary items, hiring actions and are proceeding with target restructuring plans in parts of our business. We continue to invest in R&D, demonstrating our continued focus on new product pipelines. This includes investments in R&D for enabling technologies, robotics, imaging and navigation, including our recently launched Q Guidance navigation system in Spine. Notably, we are making good progress with the development of our spine and shoulder applications for Mako. We have stopped the Cardan spine robotic project to focus all our energies on Mako and expect that the Mako spine and shoulder launches will occur in a similar time frame. Also during the quarter, we signed an agreement to purchase Cerus Endovascular, a technology leader in the hemorrhagic segment. This deal is pending customary closing conditions. We remain confident in the outlook of our business and expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech, which is reflected in our narrowing of full year organic sales growth to the higher end of our prior range, now 8.5% to 9%. However, worsening foreign currency and continued inflationary pressures have caused us to lower our full year adjusted EPS range to $9.15 to $9.25 per share. Overall, our team has shown good resiliency, and I'm pleased that employee engagement remains very high. We continue to be recognized across many countries, professions, gender and age groups as a great place to work, most recently as one of the world's best workplaces by Fortune. As we look ahead to 2023, we feel optimistic about growth with high customer demand and exciting new product launches. Though the inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges will continue to impact next year, the strong growth outlook, combined with our pricing and cost actions, will position us well to return to strong earnings growth.  I will now turn the call over to Jason. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. We're going to give specific guidance in January, as we always do. But I did make that comment in my opening remarks to signal that this year is an aberration. We will get back to strong earnings, which does absolutely imply margin expansion in 2023. But specifics, we'll get to you in January. Yes. Larry, what I'd add is our problems are in the MedSurg side of our business. And on the MedSurg side of our business, we're not going to lose sales. So if we have problems in the implant side, those sales would be lost to competitors. In this case, customers are waiting. The products aren't urgent. We do have a plan to get these products to our customers. Medical's numbers, which were pretty impressive at 13-plus percent organic, would have been materially higher because of the emergency care demand and the same with Instruments. Those are the two divisions that had the most impact. Frankly, we have a lot of nickeling issues across our portfolio, but those two divisions were severely impacted in Q3. You'll see recovery -- some recovery in Q4 and into next year. But I really don't expect to lose any of those sales, which gives me a lot of confidence going into next year that our sales -- positive sales trajectory will continue. Yes. Just one last comment to add. What I'm really encouraged by is quarter after quarter after quarter, we're seeing the knee -- Mako as a percent of our total Knees go up, hips as a percent of -- Mako Hips as a percent of total Hips go up, cementless percent of total Knees go up, and cementless tends to correlate very well with Mako. So all those vectors are heading the right direction. Yes, we've had some more delays in getting these robots installed and sold to our customers. But Q4 will be good and will continue our positive trajectory. Okay. Sure. I'll stay in the land of qualitative, Vijay, at this time of the year. But first, we are seeing a tailwind in procedural demand. So procedures are recovering around the world, a little slower in the Asia Pac regions. But given what happened with COVID, we expect that tailwind, as you saw, with very good growth in our Hip and Knee business that will continue into fourth quarter and I think a pretty modest or moderate tailwind in throughout 2023 and maybe even into 2024. So that's one positive tailwind. We have a number of new products we're launching: System 9 camera in the early part of the year -- sorry, System 9 power tool in the early part of the year; 1780 camera around the middle of the year; and then we've got a defibrillator, which is a little less certain on timing because it's a PMA product, but the life pack perhaps towards the latter part of the year. But those are big, massive and important products. And you know what happens when we launch those products. I kind of call it a super cycle within MedSurg of new product launches. We have the Insignia Hips stem, which is less than 50% of the way launched. You know that these implant launches take multiple years to get all the sets out into the field, but tremendous momentum. You saw our Hip numbers have looked good the last couple of quarters relative to competition because of the Insignia Stem, and that will just continue to gain steam going forward. So those are a number of the positives. What I'd say on the order book side, that we know we have this big, big backlog of orders that customers are willing to wait for, in many cases, especially in emergency care. Orders are not being canceled. That gives us a lot of confidence that the demand is there. We just have to make sure we can get the supply to the customers. And we've been securing chips. We've been securing different products. But as Glenn mentioned, it's been hit and miss along -- sometimes it's just a resin, sometimes it's a small component. So there's been spottiness. It's getting better, but it's kind of getting better slowly. So we'll fight our way through that probably in the first half of next year. But tremendous demand in the absence of new products, and those new products will just sort of give us extra momentum going into next year. I just picked a few. But -- sorry for some of my divisions. I didn't mention the hip, the shoulder, the Foot & Ankle. And so there's a lot of other ones, but those are sort of the -- some of the big ones. And even Endoscopy, who had a very strong Q3, they grew their orders as well in the quarter. So they will also have another strong quarter in Q4. So it's really across our portfolio where the demand is very, very strong. And we're not seeing sort of a capital slowdown, which I know I've heard out that some other companies mentioned. We're just not seeing that in our orders. We're not having orders canceled. It's kind of -- it's something I haven't seen in my tenures here, customers ordering things and then canceling it. So we feel very good about our position. Our orders have not slowed down. They just continue to grow. Just one little example, which I really enjoy is on Vocera, we've now integrated that with our ProCuity bed. So the alerts for falls from the bed actually goes straight to the badge, and we're already showing this to our customers and getting really wild positive feedback from customers on this. And again, it's early days, but the ProCuity momentum, which really powered our strong Medical growth this quarter, is just building. And it's kind of the second year of the launch. It's really just gaining steam. And now with its interoperability with Vocera, that provides an extra bit of energy to that business. Yes. Thanks. We've seen a slow market this year in the U.S. in Neurovascular, not exactly sure why. There's a number of different theories out there as to why the market itself has been slow. I'd say that's probably most of it. But there are new competitors in both aspiration as well stent retrievers. The FDA has kind of reduced the requirements -- the clinical requirements in those categories. So there are a number of new players which affects part of it. But the market has been soft. And maybe it's a COVID issue that some of these patients that would have had strokes are not having stroke because of the mortality effects of COVID. It's hard to know exactly why, but the market has slowed down definitely in the U.S. I think that's probably the bigger portion, but there are also some competitive pressures. Keep in mind that for us, the U.S. is much smaller than our OUS business in Neurovascular, has always been that way. It's the one business that kind of has the reverse of the rest of our portfolio. So we continue to feel bullish about the long-term prospects on this business. We're only treating a small percentage of people that have strokes. And as I noted in my opening remarks, we've just completed signed an agreement for a tuck-in acquisition in the intraocular space. Well, EPS growth, as I mentioned, there'll be a combination of price. And in fact, some businesses are taking on their second round of price increases. And having the timing of those start to really appear as contracts roll off. So price is one component. Cost reduction clearly is another component. The restructuring -- these actions are very targeted. So it's really around things we were going to do anyways to improve our processes. We're just accelerating those activities. We'll see some of that this year. We'll see some of that into early part of next year, and it will have an impact in our earnings per share for sure next year. I was going to say one last comment before. We will get mix benefits from the new products that we launched. So that's one thing to -- and you won't see that in the price line, but we'll definitely get that benefit through the P&L, which helps our earnings. Yes. You know what, we're not ready to give you a time line now. I wouldn't expect it next year. But in one of the next upcoming calls, perhaps January or the one after that, we will give you some expected time lines. The reason that they're coming out at the same time now, there's two things. One is Spine's kind of moved ahead in its pace, and shoulder kind of moved back a little bit because we had to adapt to the Tornier implants and bring in the BLUEPRINT software and marry that with Mako. So we were on a certain time line with Stryker shoulder implants, but we wanted to switch to the Tornier implants. They're the market-leading implants. So we had to sort of delay that one. But Spine has been moved forward. So the team has done a terrific job. We had two projects that we are pursuing: the Cardan one as well as Mako. Mako is going to be the answer for us. We've already started to show some surgeons, and we've received very, very positive feedback on that. So we're excited. And so again, the timing, hopefully, possibly as early as January, I'll give you more specifics on it. As you know, robots are complicated. That's why we're sort of hesitant to first give you time lines until we feel more confident. But I'd say that a lot of the challenges that we had before, we've overcome. And we've had good meetings with the FDA. We're on a very good trajectory on both of those projects. Hard for me actually to know which one will be first as they'll come out pretty -- in pretty close proximity to each other. Okay. And related to your question on ASCs, we -- our offense continues to exceed our expectation. Just the bundle that we provide for the ASC to make life easy for them has been very well received. Close to half of the deals that we win includes a Mako in these orthopedic ASCs. We've now crossed sort of the 10% mark of large joints that are done in ASCs. It keeps going up, not at a rapid rate, but it's a steady climb. And to your point, the gating factor is just construction and refurbishment of these ASCs to enable more procedures. But every hospital system I talked to is preparing themselves for another -- a new ASC. It's a trend that had started prior to COVID and has accelerated. And we expect that, that will continue. But we love our position. The breadth of our portfolio, having capital disposables and implants puts us in a really leading position. And Makos, as I said, almost all the time are included, and that gives us a giant advantage. Yes. Just last point on mix. I think Australia is one of the big, big markets for Stryker. And they've been hit by COVID and delays, and they do expect a stronger -- it's already started. We're seeing that start to build, and that's a highly profitable business as well. So those are -- that's another element of mix we're going to see improve in Q4 versus Q3. And then your other question, I'm not sure I totally got it, but I think you were talking about different procedures and how we're seeing the recovery and clearly get the needs. We're seeing robust recovery. There's big waiting lists, which in the U.K. and physicians who took -- maybe took some time off in summer a little bit more than they normally would, given coming off the COVID are very busy now, and they're starting to operate more. As much staff is available for them, the more they're going to operate. And staffing is still a little bit challenged, but it's been gradually improving. So there, we see robust kind of growth going into next year. Spine has been a little bit more choppy, to be honest. And I don't think it went down as much as the needs did. If you look at the Omicron variant and everything that -- spine procedures were still a little bit more resilient. And so we're not seeing that pop quite at the same extent as we are in our Hip and Knee. And I mentioned already Neurovascular in the U.S. where the market is soft, and that's the one that -- I saw some comments related to TAVR that talked about the market being a little bit soft. And I wonder if that patient profile with all these comorbidities, there might be something similar that could be impacting the ischemic stroke portion of the market. So that's -- hopefully answered that part of your question. Sure. Sure. At a high level, COVID has had a delayed impact in a lot of Asia Pacific. And we certainly expect to get better. We're already seeing it. Japan had a really nice quarter this quarter. Australia will pick up in Q4. Some of the ASEAN countries are improving. So I do expect the outlook to be better next year in Asia Pacific overall than this year. Our emerging markets had really robust double-digit growth in spite of China being slightly negative. It was negative really driven by volume-based procurement in the orthopedic side of our business and pretty good performance on the MedSurg and Neurotechnology side of the business. But we, finally, after many years, started to build tremendous momentum in Latin America as well as emerging Europe, at least in Africa, where we're gaining really tremendous momentum with -- really driven by Mako as well as our 1688 camera. That's driving really strong growth this year. And I think that should continue going into next year. Even India has really had a terrific year this year. And as you know, we've had our share of challenges in the past. So I would say the international story for Stryker is starting to click. As you saw since 2019, our international organic growth has outpaced the U.S., and that did not happen in my first seven years as CEO. And I do expect that to continue. And frankly, the COVID tailwind should really cement that going forward. Yes. Look, it's a great question. I would tell you this year has been extremely frustrating unlike any year I've had where, to be honest, we misestimated. We thought early on, we were going to have 100 to 200 basis points of pressure. And now Glenn is saying it's 250. So that's something we did not call. It's been difficult to predict. I think one of the steps that we're taking, which is really kind of exciting, is as you move to new products, so as we move to System 9 and as we move to 1788, we're using new-generation chips. And the supply availability is actually quite high for new-generation trips. And so the faster we can migrate to new products, it actually helps secure our ability to have supply. And so we are pushing our R&D teams really hard to be able to shift to these newer products because our challenge is, frankly, the older-generation chips. And that's why emergency care is so pressured, emergency care being defibrillators primarily. Because their PMA products, we can't just swap the chip out. It goes through a whole regulatory regime, and those are older-generation chips. So the faster we can migrate to new products, the faster that secures our chip availability. It's been kind of a moving target as we've secured chips with one supplier, we have a new problem with another supplier. And even things like resins. And so it's been a very unusual and tough year, but it's slowly getting better, Rick. And as we launch new products, that will get us really healthy because new chips aren't the problem. Our problem is really getting the old electronics. And frankly, the camera business, I give our Endoscopy team a lot of credit that they were able to actually qualify some new products. And because it's not P&A, they were able to really drive good growth, but it's been a scramble. And we're hopeful that things get stable. Really, I think we're going to be in this soup for probably another couple of quarters by the middle of the year. And then I think the guys will start to clear. But you know what, that's -- I don't know a total crystal ball, and we haven't been right this year. But that's sort of how it looks right now, that they'll still be a little choppy, but it's just moderately getting better as we go through the year. Yes. I'm very bullish on ProCuity. It's a fantastic product, and the cross-sell capability with Vocera, where we were strong, let's say, with ProCuity or beds and Vocera wasn't as strong or Vocera. Conversely, Vocera was strong, but we didn't have a strong bed position. That cross-sell opportunity is already presenting itself. We've been in front of some very big accounts, and we're showing them this integrated system. And we've already gotten some orders. And so I'm bullish. It had a terrific third quarter. We're trying to make them as fast as we can right now, which is a high-class problem. And so I think you're going to see very good results for ProCuity. It's a winning bed, and Vocera is just going to add gas to the fire. Yes. So starting with Foot & Ankle had a really terrific Q3. The highest growth within Foot & Ankle is coming out of our total ankle where we have a clear market leadership that had double-digit growth. But even though the midfoot, 4-foot procedures are picking back up, as you know, the pandemic did kind of slow entente somewhat, but they had a very good Q3. We had a number of new launches in that category for foot launches. So we're feeling very good about that going forward. But it was a strong Q3 that contributed to -- especially in the United States, that contributed to the double-digit growth that we had in Trauma Extremities in the U.S. in the second year. Oh, Q Guidance, yes. We had really terrific feedback because -- it's an incredibly fast internally developed camera, much faster than what you see the competition using. It also actually provides suggestions about which screws to use and -- so that's very novel as well. And that will be the camera that will be ported to Mako for the future, and it really simplifies the workflow. Very, very positive feedback. That contributed to the strong enabling technology performance. So we had a number of very good sales of the Q Guidance System in Q3, and that's picking up into Q4. So, so far so good on that launch. Obviously, we still want to get to Mako. And we also have another project called CoPilot. That's the kind of the internal code name, which is really around drills and providing some haptic feedback, which we were able to show some of the surgeons at NASS to great feedback because that doesn't exist in the market today. So we have a pretty comprehensive portfolio in enabling technology for Spine. It's going to take us some time to bring these additional products to the market, but Q Guidance was very well received, especially because of the speed and efficiency that we offer without requiring them to change their workflow. Yes. So let me first say the Vocera disruption is very different than K2M destruction. K2M is an overlap deal, where you have the same sales reps selling the same kinds of products. That's the hardest kind of deal to integrate. Frankly, we learned a lot from K2M that we then put into our Wright Medical integration, which has gone extremely well. That's more analogous where the Foot & Ankle is an example or upper extremities, you have overlapping reps. Vocera is not an overlap deal. So that one is going to be a lot easier to get through. We did the same thing with Physio-Control. If you remember, we merged the emergency care, our power costs for the ambulances with defibrillators, and we merged that sales force. And we had some disruption in the first year that we got through pretty fast. And then we got into a torrid double-digit kind of growth trajectory thereafter. So Vocera will have a little bit of disruption. It's not just because of the sales force, but also because we'd like to move more of the business to the cloud, which will be better for us and better for our customers long term versus being on-premise. And so we don't mind taking a little bit of pain in the -- for the next quarter or two. But thereafter, you should expect that to be able to sing. It's a lot easier from an integration standpoint. This is just running this record offense without having to have reps competing.  As I think about Spine, it's obviously the most competitive market we play in. It's a very tough market. K2M was not a very expensive acquisition compared to alternatives that we looked at the time. It's been okay deal. It hasn't been one of our best deals, but it solved a problem for us where we would have frankly been growing below-market rates had we not done the deal. We were able to kind of hang on to be able to grow around market rates with some good innovation. And now that we've got our enabling technology road map, I'm actually pretty excited about Spine in the future. It's going to continue to be a bit of a dogfight through sort of the end of next year, but going into '24, already with Q Guidance, we have a bit of a spring in our step, a new expandable distribution deal with Life Spine. So we're starting to feel a little bit of momentum, our Monterey new launch as well. So we're starting to feel a bit of momentum, but it's not having a robot as a problem. We do have this project with Mako that will help solve that problem. And we are committed to Spine long term. But clearly, it is the most challenging market of all. But certainly don't -- for me, Vocera will have probably roughly flat sales growth year-over-year for Q4, Q1, and then you should expect Vocera to start to zoom after that. Yes. I think Hip and Knees are the areas where I think it's not just a Stryker thing. I think the market will be more robust. And certainly, you can talk to our competitors, and I think they would share that osteoarthritis doesn't improve itself. These patients are going to need these procedures. Aging population and demographics play in our favor. And I think you're going to see that tailwind. It's just -- I just don't think it's going to be -- surgeons aren't going to be operating on weekends, and their staffs not available to have a big spike and then kind of a return to normal. That's why I think it will be a gradual tailwind for multiple quarters. But those are -- that's the business I think you're going to see that kind of sustained positive momentum on the surgery volumes. For the full year. Percentage. Well, thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year-end 2022 results with you as well as our 2023 guidance in January. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 9.9% in the quarter. The third quarter's average selling days were in line with 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.7%.  We have started to see the positive impact of pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg businesses, which all had positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 3.7% unfavorable impact on sales. We continue to experience supply chain disruptions that have increased costs and led to inconsistent product availability. This is especially impacting the shipping and delivery time lines related to capital products in our MedSurg businesses. Nevertheless, our capital order book continues to be very robust as demand from our customers remained strong. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 9.2%. International organic sales growth was 11.8%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, specifically emerging markets, Canada, Japan and Europe, somewhat offset by lingering COVID impacts in other Asia Pac countries. Our adjusted EPS of $2.12 in the quarter was down $0.08 from 2021 due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.08. Additionally, higher costs associated with gross margin challenges were offset by the benefit from higher sales and cost discipline.  Now I'll provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 13.5% with organic sales growth of 10.8%, which included 9.6% of U.S. organic growth and 14.4% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 2.2% led by our Surgical Technology business.  From a product perspective, sales growth was highlighted by growth in smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield. During the quarter, Instruments experienced supply chain challenges primarily related to its capital products. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 14% highlighted by double-digit growth in both the core Endoscopy and Sports Medicine businesses. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 13.7% driven by growth in our Sage and acute care businesses fueled by ProCuity and Prime structure demand. As previously noted, Medical continues to experience supply chain challenges that primarily impact emergency care products. Our U.S. Neurovascular business had an organic decline of 2% driven by a strong double-digit comparable in 2021, disruptions due to hospital staffing shortages and slower clinic volumes as well as competitive pressures. The U.S. neurocranial business had organic sales growth of 12.7%, which included solid growth in our Max space and Neuro products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 14.4%, reflecting double-digit growth in all businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Japan, China and other emerging markets. Orthopaedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 8.7%, which included organic growth of 8.7% in the U.S. and 8.9% internationally. This reflects the impact of our strong international growth and solid growth in our Hip, Knee and Trauma and Extremities businesses. Our U.S. Hip business grew 12.4% organically, reflecting strong primary Hip growth fueled by the recent launch of our Insignia Hip Stem and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. New York Knee business grew 14% organically, reflecting our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 10.4% organically with strong performances across all 4 businesses, led by double-digit growth in upper extremities highlighted by our new products Perform and BLUEPRINT. Our U.S. Spine business sales grew 2% from solid performance in our enabling technology business, somewhat offset by the impact of lower surgery volumes in the competitive environment. Our U.S. Other ortho declined organically by 11.2% primarily driven by the impact of the aforementioned delays in Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 8.9% organically, which reflects the strong momentum in Europe as procedural volumes improve as well as strong performances in Japan, Canada and India, somewhat offset by COVID-related volatility in Australia. Now I will focus on the operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 62.6% was unfavorable approximately 370 basis points from the third quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of the purchases of electronic components at premium prices and other inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs as well as inefficiencies from supply chain disruption and the unfavorable impact of price and foreign exchange on sales. Sequentially, from Q2 2022, gross margin was 70 basis points unfavorable. This included the impact from unfavorable business mix, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, including premium pricing and operational inefficiencies. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout the remainder of the year and into 2023. For the full year 2022, we now expect adjusted gross margin compared to 2021 to be adversely impacted by approximately 250 basis points. Adjusted R&D spending was 7.1% of sales, which represents a 40 basis points increase from 2021. This reflects our continued commitment to funding innovation and the related future growth that we'll provide. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.1% of sales, which was 100 basis points lower than 2021. This reflects the impact of an increased focus on discretionary cost control and head count discipline. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 22.3% of sales, which was approximately 310 basis points unfavorable to the third quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned gross margin challenges and the net negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange translation, somewhat offset by cost discipline. Adjusted other income and expense decreased from 2021, primarily resulting from lower interest expense and favorable interest income. We anticipate Q4 OI&E to be approximately $70 million. Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.5%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be at the low end of our previously communicated range of 14.5% to 15%, which is slightly lower than 2021.  Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.8 billion. Approximately $250 million of term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, which brings our year-to-date payments to $500 million.  Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $1.6 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings, partially offset by the impact of higher costs for certain electronic components, pre-buying of certain other critical raw material inventory and seasonal inventory increases. Considering our third quarter results, our strong order book for capital equipment and the sales momentum in our implant and capital businesses, we now expect full year 2022 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9%.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we now expect net sales in the full year to be adversely impacted by approximately 4% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be adversely impacted by approximately $0.35 to $0.40 for the full year, which is included in our revised earnings guidance range. Based on continuing inflationary and supply chain pressures, balanced with our strong sales and additional cost-reduction actions and most significantly, the anticipated future impact of foreign currency, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.15 to $9.25. And now I will open the call up for Q&A. Robbie, this is Glenn. Good questions. As we looked at the third quarter and the impact and what changed from Q2 specifically, we just -- what we saw was, we saw that our visibility to supply had improved and that we were seeing sort of moderate sort of improvement. But the rate of improvement relative to the cost was not improving at that kind of outlook. So we continue to see higher-than-expected premium costs. We saw other inflation across almost all categories. But as I noted, most noticeably in labor, metals, transportation. And then all of that and that sort of variability of supply chain really drove just inefficiencies in our manufacturing process. And so that -- we had lots of stops and starts, which, as you know, just drives up more cost. So I think if I think about it, what's transient, what's not, I think in Q4, we have good visibility to supply and feel confident enough to raise our sales guidance, which is what we did. And so we'll feel that in Q4.  I still think we're going to see a little bit of this fluid environment where we'll continue to experience some higher costs. And I would tell you that once we get our hands around sort of one electronic component issue, then we'll be contacted from a [N minus 2] vendor about another issue. And so we're feeling that sort of through -- as we're managing through sort of our supply chain issues. Yes. Larry, I think not to give specific guidance on numbers relative to the disruptions, but suffice to say that on some products, we are very hand-to-mouth in terms of how we're getting componentry to complete those products and ship them to customers. On some, we have a little bit better visibility. I would tell you that with our order backlog at an all-time high, we are seeing pretty significant disruptions across our capital businesses. We're very focused on getting product to customers. We know that's important. And we are working hard to make sure that as we can secure supply that we work around the clock to get those products finished and get them out to customers. Yes, Larry. The only thing I'd add is there are a couple of products in that line item other. But yes, you're right, that's where Mako is. I don't really want to guide you on Q4. I think sequentially, we will definitely see improvement. But in terms of when will we see full positivity, we'll talk about that in January. Okay, Vijay. Vijay, the -- on the FX rates, without overly guiding for next year, but I think if you look at sort of what happened in 2022, rates really took off in sort of Q3, Q4. And so the comparable for Q1, Q2, I still think will have a pretty big impact for rates next year as you look at sort of your modeling for next year. And then in terms of just the capitalized variance piece, we -- I won't give you specifics. But I will remind you that to the extent we are making spot buys, it relates to raw materials that get put in inventory, and then the future utilization of those raw materials is usually over an 8- to 9-month time frame. So that gets a little bit more -- to Kevin's comment, that we'll still feel some of this into -- well into Q2 of next year. And to the extent we're still in a spot-buy-premium situation in Q1 of 2023, then that will bleed into, say, Q3 as well. And Matt, below the line, if you look at sort of in an taxes, it's -- there are some opportunities related to how quickly we pay down the term loan. So there could be some pickups relative to interest expense, although those would be minor given the rates. And then taxes is -- I don't expect any surprises, sort of steady as we've been there. Josh, it's Glenn. I'll take the first one on pricing. I think, first of all, we're having obviously some big initiatives going on around pricing, making sure that we're educating customers in terms of what's happening to us relative to the cost of raw materials and things like that. Pricing is mostly impacting MedSurg. That's not to say there's not as big of impact on the ortho side. Keep in mind, too, that most of our businesses are under some sort of contracts. And so a lot of this sort of pacing is relative to as those contracts come up for negotiation, we can enter into that with those customers. I think so far, we're seeing good progress. We expect to continue to see good progress into Q4. I won't call out a guide yet for next year. But what I would tell you, one of the things that also will give us a little bit of lift that may not be reflected in pricing is the comment that Kevin made relative to new products that are released. And most new products that are released are released at a premium price relative to the legacy price. And so that will give us a little bit of uplift as well. Okay. Yes, Matt, I think -- I mean a couple of things. As you sort of think about the guidance, the 250 basis points, in rough terms, half of that is being driven by sort of the premiums that we're paying on those spot buy purchases. And then the other half is really kind of solidly grounded in what we're seeing on the inflation and the inefficiency side, somewhat tempered by sort of some cost discipline even within our operations. On the spot buys, I think what I was saying is that we have better visibility now to our ability to acquire supply. We are seeing some moderation, although not as much as I think we were hoping to see, as we entered into Q3 in terms of what those costs are. So things are just -- they're not coming down as quick as we wanted them to nor do I expect that our spot purchases in Q4 will come down significantly either. And then on the inflation side, a lot of that is flowing through increases in labor, increases in commodity prices that we're paying. Because we're in this difficult supply chain situation, we're having to use a lot of, say, airfreight versus ocean freight, which cost a lot more to expedite raw materials coming in so that we can manufacture and get out to customers. And so those are the type of inflationary things that we're feeling that are in that number. Okay. Let me take the first part of that question relative to mix and what we saw in Q3 and how we think that might play out in Q4. I think you can sort of look at sort of sales growth as a proxy for where we felt the pain of mix. Instruments was down, and that's a fairly highly profitable business for us. NV was also a little bit down, and that too is a highly profitable business for us. And so those not being a normal proportion of our sales really sort of hurt us somewhat at the margin line. I think Instruments has good visibility to supply moving into Q4, and so I do expect that we'll see a good performance out of Instruments as we wrap up the year. NV, it's a little bit different. It's not capital and there's not sort of a backlog of orders. NV is very procedural-based. But I know that NV is very focused on finishing out the year and hitting their quotas. And so I think we'll see some improvement out of NV as well. Yes. I think right now, just given all the variability in kind of where we are, we're just focused on this year and finishing up. I'd hate to throw out a number for free cash flow conversion. I think it would be safe to assume that it wouldn't be far away from our historical averages, and that's probably where we would land for next year. Keep in mind, for next year, our focus will still be debt repayment. And we'll pay down the rest of that term loan before we allocate other capital to M&A. He didn't ask yet. Yes. I think without doing the math or having any other basis in next year, if I just look at rates, it's, yes, roughly going to be the same. We'll be more precise in January, but that's a pretty good starting point. Yes. Sam, this is Glenn. On SG&A, I think generally, the only thing that really becomes significantly variable is just sales commissions that flows through there. So in terms of the kind of procedures and controls that we put in place relative to discretionary cost control, we should see that continue into Q4. And so that's probably a pretty good proxy.  And then on R&D, we've been hovering at that level, honestly, for several quarters. And so the only variability might be that sales are a little larger in Q4, which might actually make the percentage go down a little bit in R&D. But I do think that, that run rate is a good approximate. For the full year. On a percentage basis. 6%, 7% of sales roughly, that's a pretty good number for a full year. Keep in mind, Q4 is seasonally our strongest. So you are going to see much higher op margin than you've seen certainly in the last 2 quarters in Q4."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the procedural, geographic and capital trends during the quarter. In addition, I'll provide an update on the integration progress of the Vocera business. Procedural volumes continue to recover throughout the third quarter in most countries, and we are beginning to reach normalized levels across most of our business. While we are seeing volumes recover, hospital staffing pressures have continued to impact the ability to reduce procedural backlog in a meaningful way. These challenges will likely resolve gradually, and we continue to expect this will be a moderate tailwind into next year. Geographically, procedural volumes steadily improved during the quarter in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Parts of Asia Pacific have continued to be more volatile due to ongoing COVID-related impacts. Demand for our capital products remained very strong in the quarter as seen from the double-digit growth of our Medical division. However, we did realize some installation delays as well as hospital scheduling challenges. Specific to Mako, installations for the quarter were soft as we realized delays stemming from variability in the hospital environment. However, our order book remains strong, and we expect a good fourth quarter for Mako. We will update you on our key Mako metrics in January. Now to our key integration activities. We continue to be pleased with our Vocera integration progress and remain excited about the strong growth potential of this platform technology. However, in Q3, we elected to delay some installations shifting from on-prem servers to our cloud solution with certain customers. Also, as we do with all acquisitions, we are shifting the legacy sales force to the Stryker model, which has caused some disruption. These delays resulted in revenues that were essentially flat to Q3 2021. However, the order pipeline remains strong and customer retention remains very high at 99% for software renewals. We expect these processes to continue into Q1 of next year, after which we will be positioned to drive robust sales growth. In summary, while the macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, procedural volumes are improving and the underlying demand for our products remain strong, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive strong revenue growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. Larry, it's Jason. I'll start here and talk a little bit about Mako. And then, Glenn, if you want to comment on the other piece, feel free. But as it relates to Mako, like I said in my prepared remarks, the orders were soft. But if you look at the order pipeline, it is very robust. And we continue to be, I'll say, the robotic-assisted choice in the marketplace. And so we feel good about Q4. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we expect a strong quarter. Yes. Pito, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. I would point you back to some of the commentary around the order book. And if you look at our capital businesses, it continues to be very strong. And so as we look to the fourth quarter, similar to the comments Kevin said around Medical and Instruments, we certainly expect a recovery in the fourth quarter with Instruments and another strong quarter for Medical as well. Yes. I'd say a couple of different things just as you think about that and think about capital. Obviously, our larger capital is beyond Mako, right? But what we're seeing is sometimes I think when we talk about staffing challenges, people go right to nurses and some of those things. But really, what we're talking about here is even like if you think about our comm business, you'll have scheduled installations. People show up to do an install. They'll get canceled. They'll have to come back. And so that's the variability that I'm referring to that sometimes delays installs, and ultimately, revenue and gets pushed out. Glenn, in terms of second piece? Ryan, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. And what I would say is, first off, I'd point you back to my prepared remarks in terms of this being a moderate tailwind for some time, right? In terms of how much longer is the delivery cycle, candidly, it's going to vary by product cycle, right, or the type of product that it is. And so we're certainly not going to quantify in terms of the impact there, but it certainly does vary. This is Jason. I'll take this one. So just as a reminder, right, China overall is less than 2% of our sales. And the sales that are exposed to VBP are actually less than 1%, so fairly immaterial. But relative to kind of the next impact, there will be an impact as we go into next year around NV. Obviously, we're not going to guide at this point, but you'll hear more about that as we get into next year. It will start in '23. Again, we'll talk more about timing when we get closer, but it will be '23. Yes. No, my comments were definitely specific to installs. I may have made a comment relative to a strong order book, which is absolutely the case, and we do expect a strong fourth quarter."

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company’s most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today’s press release that is an exhibit to Stryker’s current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker’s second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker’s CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today’s call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and updates on Mako and Vocera. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. For the quarter, organic sales growth was 6% with high single-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by endoscopy, instruments and neurocranial. Our hip and knee businesses delivered high single-digit growth in the face of tough compares from 2021. Internationally, we posted high single-digit organic growth with strength in Canada, Europe and Japan as well as double-digit organic growth in emerging markets despite the China COVID-related slowdowns. During the quarter, we continue to have robust demand for our capital products. However, we had meaningful shipment delays as a result of ongoing product supply challenges mostly affecting our large capital businesses. As a reminder, less than 10% of our revenue is large capital, with about 15% of our revenue being smaller operating capital that drives revenue for hospitals. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $2.25 as we faced increasing negative impacts from foreign exchange as well as inflationary pressures and significant premiums on inventory spot buys. We expect these pressures to continue in the back half of the year. However, the supply situation is improving. Given the higher input costs, we have begun to take a series of pricing actions across our portfolio. These will take time to be reflected in our results given the phasing of contract renewals in many areas of our business. We continue to invest in R&D at a healthy ratio of sales, demonstrating our continued focus on new product pipelines. We remain confident in the outlook of our business and expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med-tech. However, even with disciplined spending, the worsened foreign exchange situation and other pressures will prevent us from delivering leverage to earnings in 2022. With half of the year behind us and a very strong order book, we now expect full year organic sales growth of 8% to 9% and due largely to foreign currency exchange, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.30 to $9.50 per share. Overall, our team has shown good resiliency and we are on track for another strong year of sales growth. Our employee engagement remains very high and we continue to win awards as a Great Place to Work, most recently as a Great Place to Work for Millennials by Fortune. We are also gearing up for some exciting new product launches in 2023 and look forward to an improved supply chain picture. Through the many challenges that we had faced since 2020, we feel optimistic about how we are positioning ourselves for the future. I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Beach: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the procedural and geographic trends during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the integration progress of the Vocera business. Procedural volumes continued to recover throughout the second quarter in most countries. While we are seeing volumes recover, hospital staffing pressures have continued, impacting the ability to reduce procedural backlog in a meaningful way. These challenges will likely continue, meaning the tailwind of pent-up demand will be more moderate but last longer. Geographically, procedural volumes steadily improved during the quarter in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Procedural trends in parts of Asia and Australia have been more volatile due to ongoing COVID-related impacts. In addition to the continued procedural recovery, we had a strong quarter of Mako installations, up 19% versus 2021. However, as we are balancing customer purchasing preferences, the mix of these deals has resulted in less revenue per quarter. We are pleased with how the growing installation base continues to fuel market-leading implant growth. The order book remains strong for Mako and the percentage of implants using the robot continues to increase. We will update you on our installations and utilization metrics at the end of the year. Demand for our capital products remained very strong in the quarter. While we experienced solid customer order performance from our capital businesses, the sales growth was restricted because of ongoing headwinds, which included raw material shortages, primarily related to electronic components and installation delays in parts of our business due to hospital staffing challenges. The raw material shortages continue to be most impactful in our medical business, both within our acute care and emergency care business units. Based on our current supply outlook, we expect medical to have a strong second half. Now to our key integration activities. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of the Vocera integration. Since acquiring the company, we have seen double-digit growth in the first and second quarter versus the same periods in 2021. We are already starting to realize synergies and remain excited about the potential this product will create for both Stryker and the customers we serve. In summary, while the macroeconomic environment remains volatile, procedural volumes are improving and the underlying demand for our products remain strong, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive strong growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today’s press release. Our organic sales growth was 6.1% in the quarter. The second quarter’s average selling days were in line with 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4%. Foreign currency had a 3% unfavorable impact on sales. Despite a challenging comparable versus 2021, our organic sales growth has been solid and was led by double-digit performances in our Endoscopy and Instruments businesses as well as strong growth in our international businesses. Our sales growth has been somewhat constrained by the continued supply chain challenges and electronic component shortages, especially impacting the capital products in our MedSurg businesses, primarily in our medical business. Our capital order book continues to be very robust as demand from our customers continues to be strong. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 4.7%. International organic sales growth was 9.7%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, specifically emerging markets, Canada, Japan and Europe, somewhat offset by lingering COVID impacts in Australia and China. Our adjusted EPS of $2.25 in the quarter was in line with 2021 driven by our sales momentum and favorable adjusted tax rate offset by gross margin challenges and the impact of foreign currency exchange. Our second quarter EPS was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange of $0.05 versus 2021. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 10.6%, with organic sales growth of 7.9%, which included 7.2% of U.S. organic growth and 9.9% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.1%, led by double-digit growth in our orthopedic instruments and surgical technology businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was highlighted by double-digit growth in power tools, surge account, irrigation, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 15.4%, reflecting very strong performances across all of their portfolio, including video products and double-digit growth of our communications and sports medicine businesses. Medical, which includes our recently acquired Vocera business, had a U.S. organic sales decline of 2.4% driven by the aforementioned supply chain challenges primarily impacting our emergency care products. Medical sage and acute care businesses boosted double-digit organic growth. During the quarter, we also saw significant growth in orders for our beds and emergency care products driven by very strong customer demand. Our U.S. Neurovascular business posted an organic decline of 1.8% driven by a strong double-digit comparable in 2021 as well as competitive pressures, disruptions due to hospital staffing shortages and softer market conditions in part because of supply shortages of contrast use in procedures. The U.S. neurocranial business posted organic sales growth of 9.4%, which included solid growth in our ENT navigation, balloon dilation and neuro products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 9.9%, reflecting double-digit growth in the endoscopy, neurovascular and neurocranial businesses, somewhat offset by medical. Geographically, this included strong performances in Japan and emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 3.9% which included organic growth of 1.6% in the U.S. and 9.5% internationally. This reflects the impact of strong international growth and solid growth in our hip, knee and extremity businesses. Our U.S. hips business grew 4.5% organically reflecting strong primary hip growth reflected by the recent launch of our Insignia Hip Stem and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. knee business grew 5.3% organically, reflecting our market-leading position in robotic knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 3.1% organically against a significant comparable in 2021. This growth was led by double-digit growth in our upper extremities, somewhat offset by softness in the trauma market. Our U.S. Spine business declined 3.6% organically, reflecting a slightly slower scoliosis season, partially offset by solid performance in our enabling technology business. Our U.S. Other ortho declined organically by 13.8% primarily driven by the impact related to the aforementioned deal mix changes of Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 9.5% organically, which reflects the strong momentum in Europe as procedural volumes improve as well as strong performances in Japan, Canada and India somewhat offset by COVID-related volatility in Australia and Korea. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.3% was unfavorable, approximately 270 basis points from the second quarter of 2021. Compared to 2021, our gross margin was adversely impacted by the purchases of electronic components at premium prices on the spot market and other inflationary pressures, primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs as well as operational efficiencies due to component shortages. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout 2022. We expect Q3 gross margin to be similar to Q2. Q4 should see some improvement and the full year gross margin compared to 2021 will be negatively impacted by approximately 200 basis points. Adjusted R&D was 7.2% of sales, which represents a 60 basis point increase from 2021. This reflects our continued commitment to innovation funding and the related future growth that we will provide. Our adjusted SG&A was 32.4% of sales, which was 100 basis points lower than 2021. This reflects continued cost discipline, somewhat offset by the ramping of certain prioritized expenses and hiring that support future growth. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 23.7% of sales, which was approximately 220 basis points unfavorable to the second quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned inflationary impacts resulting in gross margin challenges and the net negative impact resulting from foreign currency. Adjusted other income and expense decreased from 2021 primarily resulting from an equity investment gain and favorable interest income. We anticipate a normalized run-rate of adjusted OI&E to be approximately $70 million per quarter for the remainder of 2022. Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.9%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, which is consistent with the ETR performance we experienced in 2021. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.4 billion. Approximately $450 million of debt was paid down in the quarter. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $732 million. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and continued focus on working capital management, partially offset by the impact of higher costs for certain electronic components and pre-buying certain other critical raw material inventory. Considering our second quarter results, the strong order book for capital equipment and the sales momentum in our implant businesses, we now expect full year 2022 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 9%. This performance assumes that the market environment experienced in Q2 continues to improve throughout the rest of the year with supply chain disruptions easing in the back half of the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year to be adversely impacted by approximately 2% to 3% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be adversely impacted by approximately $0.25 to $0.30 in the full year, which is included in our revised earnings guidance range. Based on our performance in the second quarter, including consideration of the continued supply chain challenges and the inflationary environment, together with our increased sales guidance and continued financial discipline, and most significantly, the anticipated future impact related to foreign currency, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.30 to $9.50. The low end of this guidance range assumes that the continued macroeconomic volatility persists, including procedural disruptions and worsening of the electronic component availability. We will continue to evaluate the changing environment and we will provide updates to our guidance as necessary. And now, I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nRobbie Marcus: Maybe I’d start on second half it’s sort of like a tale of two cities where you have this really strong top line and somewhat of a pressured bottom line. And moving organic sales guidance up 100 basis points is great to see, but it does look like roughly two-thirds of EPS down move is currency a little bit from operations. So maybe just walk us through – it sounds like medical is going to get a good chunk better in the second half? Maybe just give us a little color of how you get the confidence to raise the top line and where exactly you are seeing the softening operating margin constant currency?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Sure, Robbie. This is Kevin. I’ll take that. So first of all, I feel very good about the momentum that we have across all of our businesses. Medical for sure is going to have a much better second half. They were the division that was most affected by the shortages. We do have a line of sight towards the supply of key electronic components and we are going to ramp up as fast as we can to meet that demand. But we also have softer comps. This second quarter was by far the most difficult comparative from the prior year. So we have softer comps across, frankly, all of our businesses in Q3 and Q4. And the order book, not just for Medical, but if I look at the other MedSurg businesses like Instruments and Endoscopy, which both had terrific Q2s, they are going to continue to have strong growth in Q3, Q4. So, we obviously feel very good about the demand from our hospital customers. That gives us the confidence to raise our sales growth. We exited the first half at 7.5%, with a very tough Q2 comp. So, we feel pretty good about getting to the 8% to 9% on the top line. On the bottom line, as you can see, based on the change in our guidance from last quarter, $0.15, if you look at the midpoint of our range, $0.15 of our drop is due to foreign currency. So, that’s the majority of the adjustment on the EPS line. And we are really fighting through significant supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures and right now, obviously, taking it on the chin for our customers at least for this year. But we are taking – obviously starting to take pricing actions. Those – we won’t see a lot of that in this year. It will start to roll kind of more into next year. But I’d say the majority of our takedown is due to foreign currency, but obviously, very significant supply chain pressures that we are dealing with, but a very strong demand situation overall.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Maybe as a quick follow-up, Kevin or Glenn, I am getting a little greedy here, but I am already looking out to next year. And we have heard from a number of companies that have reported so far to use 2022 as a base year, don’t treat it as a one-time easy comp. And I look at sell-side numbers for next year and it’s about 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. So I know nobody is good enough to forecast next year yet. But if you have any early thoughts on 2023 margins, are you committed to growing margins next year? And just if you have any color on your interpretation of the – where the sell-side sits right now? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. As you can imagine, a lot has changed in the last 6 months. A lot could change in the next 6 months. And as you know, we always give guidance in January, which we will do. But what I will say is the spot buy situation has been pretty significant. It’s been a big part of our gross margin negative story for this year. That is starting to abate. I would hope that, that gets better next year. But obviously, we will update you in January in terms of the overall outlook. I would not call this year an easy year from the top line comparative. Driving organic growth of 8% to 9% is pretty heavy, but we do have a lot of very exciting launches next year. We have System 9 for power tools, 78 [ph] camera launch, a LIFEPAK defibrillator launch, a Neptune S which is a smaller version of Neptune for GI and ASC. Those are all really outstanding launches. So I do expect that the top line will continue to hum for Stryker next year. The bottom line, like we are going to work through these challenges, and we’ll have more to talk about in January.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on the capital environment comments. Kevin, maybe just a little more color on what you are seeing with the large and small capital. And your comments on the Mako deal mix changes. I assume that’s because hospitals are preferring volume-based agreements. So, why do you think that behavior is changing? I mean, I think people on the call might – that may give people a concern that there is some change in the hospital capital environment? And I have one follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Larry, first of all, on the Mako side, what I would tell you is this is not a new trend. This has been happening over the past kind of 6 months where we are seeing more deals being financed versus outright purchased and actually a move towards more rental agreements. And if you have a rental agreement, you can’t recognize all the revenue upfront. Even in some of our overall finance deals, we could recognize more of the revenue upfront. In a rental, the customer has the right to return the product. And so you can’t record all of the revenue upfront and that’s what our competitors are also offering. We are not really worried, because we’ve had virtually no returns of our product. Once we get our products in and you can tell by our utilization of Mako, which again, we’ll report on at the end of the year, we have highly utilized machines. And so – but that’s really – that’s a shift that’s been ongoing. It wasn’t a new factor this quarter. We are really pleased with the number of installations. But the revenue per unit that we can recognize upfront is lower. And we will be able to recognize more of this revenue over the life of the contracts. And then as it relates to the rest of the capital equipment environment, what I’d tell you is we wouldn’t be taking up our sales if we felt that the capital environment was softening in any way, shape or form. The small capital is needed to be able to do procedures, power tools, wear-out cameras need to be replaced. And the medical business is continuing to get fantastic order growth whether it’s on the defibrillator or power costs as well as our ProCuity bed the orders are continuing to really pour in. We are not seeing hospital construction projects being halted at all. And look at our communications business, which is a large capital business, they had a terrific quarter in the second quarter and their order books continuing to grow. So the timing of construction may get delayed a quarter or so, but no one’s canceling these projects. Nobody is canceling any of our orders. So we’re feeling, at least through the end of this year, feeling pretty bullish about the overall environment. Hospital liquidity is still strong. Now of course, they are feeling pressure on their profits but their liquidity is in a healthy position. And that’s really where the source of funding comes for capital.\nLawrence Biegelsen: That’s very helpful. And Glenn thanks for the color on the gross margin. Kind of plugging the numbers into the model, it implies that OpEx growth is, call it, mid-single digits year-over-year in 2022 on a reported basis. I don’t know if my math is right. But how do you do that in an inflationary environment where you’re growing sales 8% to 9% organically? Thanks for taking the questions.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Larry, that was quick with the model. A couple of things to keep in mind We are seeing really good performance in our operating expenses, especially SG&A. Single biggest driver in SG&A is really sort of hiring and how prudent are we being about our hiring and the related costs that come along with every time we add a new employee. So we’ve positioned ourselves pretty well relative to that halfway through the year here and feel confident that we will be able to drive sort of meaningful leverage within our SG&A. I mean that being said, we are also mindful that we need to invest in R&D to make sure that we can hit a lot of these key product launches that we’re lined up for, for next year. And then honestly, too, if you move on down the rest of the P&L, I think I kind of gave you a little bit of guidance on OI&E. And we’re also seeing favorable performance in our ETR, which helps at the bottom as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please proceed.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good – year. Maybe Kevin, one on the guidance here. So the organic was raised by 50 basis points versus the prior guidance. I think the press release had some commentary about the guide raise was based on strong capital orders. Is the guide assuming the capital sales trends to improve in the back half as the supply chain improves? Or are we still looking at perhaps a constrained supply chain environment in the back half? And you did mention implant strength. I couldn’t help but notice the hip strength and you had new product launch in hips. Are we seeing share gains within hips?\nKevin Lobo: Well, let me start with the Hips. We’re feeling really great about our Hip business. And as you know, the Insignia launch was – is a very big launch. It’s not actually even fully launched. So we are still deploying sets out in the field. But the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. And that also is compatible with the Mako robot. The Mako robot utilization for hips is also increasing pretty significantly, which is exciting. That’s due in part to the Hip 4.0 software that we launched, I guess, about two or three quarters ago. That new software, combined with this hip stem, I believe will position us for growing above the market in hips. Not everybody has reported yet. So let’s see how that plays out this quarter. But we’re really only getting started with that stem launch and very excited about the hip business. What was the first part of the question?\nVijay Kumar: Capital.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So on the first part of your question was on capital. So clearly, Medical is going to improve in the second half versus their performance. They were down organically in the first half of the year. They are going to be up pretty significantly in the second half of the year because they were the most affected by the shortages of electronics. We still – even though we’re guiding to this 8% to 9%, that doesn’t assume that we completely bleed everything. We’re still living in a bit of a tough environment out there. And so there is that risk ongoing that might move us towards the lower end of the range or move us up to the higher end of the range. On the implant side, we’re feeling pretty good about procedures are largely back to normal in most parts of the world. And really, it’s about the hospital staffing. If that staffing gets better, then obviously, there is a lot of pent-up demand for procedures. And we’re feeling very good about our position in those businesses.\nVijay Kumar: That’s helpful comments, Kevin. Maybe one for Glenn here, I think your updated guidance assumes 200 basis points of gross margin impact. I think the prior guide was 100 basis points. That’s almost an incremental, I think if I’m doing the math right, $0.35 to $0.40 impact. Along with FX impact of $0.15, it’s almost incremental $0.50 that Stryker is eating. Are you holding back, Glenn, on the expenses? And is that enough to sustain the 8% to 9% growth? Or maybe just talk about within the P&L, were you comfortable toggling the model, you can still achieve the sales growth metrics?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think a couple of things. First of all, this backlog of orders really gives us a lot of confidence that we have the sales in place to deliver on this increased sales guidance as a baseline. It also implies that we’ve spent a lot of money on the spot buys and electronic components and pre-buying other inventories so that we feel confident and comfortable that we actually have the right sort of supply and raw materials in place to deliver on these few rails. I mean that being said, we are mindful in being a good steward of the operating expenses and not letting that get away from us. I think that’s prudent just given the current environment and given the environment that that we might be heading into. And so we haven’t really taken our foot off of that pedal in terms of controlling that at all for the whole year. And so I don’t expect that, that will change in the back half of the year. If you look at like sales force hiring, it almost universally occurs for the most part, in literally the first month of the year for every single division. They fill out their sales forces at that point in time. So I don’t feel like there is a big gap that I’m staring down that can’t really deliver on the sales growth. I think the name of the game is really going to be delivering for our customers these finished products based on what we have in our supply chain and what we currently have in inventories. And that’s going to really drive that sales growth number.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nPito Chickering: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice execution, pretty tough markets. You’ve been pretty crystal clear on this call that CapEx demand remains very robust. But a lot of large not-for-profit health systems have a September 30 year-end. And because the margin pressure you’re facing hospitals due to labor. We’ve heard some discussions around CapEx reductions beginning with our fiscal ‘23 budgets, which began in the fourth quarter. So do you assume any changes of the macro CapEx environment when hospitals update their CapEx plans for this calendar fourth quarter?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Right now, we’re not baking in any major changes. Certainly, if you look at prior situations where hospitals were under fire, we really didn’t see much of an impact at all in the small capital area. The one area you could see some impact would be in the larger capital. But of course, a lot of our business, we do have financing through Stryker Flex Financial, which does help with offsetting the kind of pressures that the hospital has in terms of overall capital. And as I mentioned earlier, coming out of the – out of 2020 with CARES Act funding, liquidity of hospitals is actually pretty good right now. So with our portfolio mix, I think we’re in good shape. If you think about something like Mako, it’s still early in the cycle and hospitals are really anxious to get that product. It’s not like they have old Makos that they are trying to upgrade and change. They are looking at increasing adoption early in the cycle. So I think our portfolio lends itself very well to what hospitals need. And they are going to prioritize our capital and potentially not prioritize other people’s capital. You could say that’s an optimistic outlook but just the way orders are continuing to stream in. And we haven’t had really any orders canceled. And we don’t have a history of that in our company. So do I have great visibility into the second half of next year? No. Do I have really good visibility through the end of this year and probably into the early part of next year? Yes, I think we do.\nPito Chickering: Okay. Fair enough. On the same topic of hospitals under pressure just from labor, you talk to us getting some price increases versus normal decreases. I’m just curious – and I do understand it takes time for contracts to sort of roll off. But are you seeing any RFP sort of today or in the last sort of few months, which is showing confidence that hospitals are willing to absorb these price increases to offset your increased inflationary pressures? Thanks so much.\nJason Beach: Yes. Peter, it’s Jason. So I’d say a couple of things. I mean we’re not, for competitive reasons, going to get into the various tactics around pricing and those things. But I will say we see some shoots of confidence, if you will, in terms of customers willing to take price. And they understand the environment that we’re working in, right? So it’s going to look, to your point, very different depending on the business that we’re talking to. On the implant side, you’ve got the contract cycles and some of those things. But then there is also the MedSurg side that has historically gotten price, right? And we continue to expect that we will as we move forward.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Matthew O’Brien with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nMatthew O’Brien: Kevin, thanks for taking the questions. I think this question for Glenn. Glenn, you’ve got a bunch of different acute situations happening right now with FX and wages going up in raw materials and freight. It’s clear you’re going to carry a lot of those extra costs throughout this year. But do you think we can start to see – we’re starting to see easing of some of those things right now. We can start to see somewhat of a snapback in the first half of next year in earnings or just given your inventory levels and cost structure, is it something that’s likely going to persist into the first half of next year and maybe get better or more like second half of next year on the earnings side?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Okay, Matt. Without giving 2023 guidance, what I will say is the spot buy and the chip situation in the electronic component situation, we are seeing some easing of that. And we are seeing examples of where we are going to our regular suppliers and they are supplying us these components based on our negotiated contract pricing. So we’re not necessarily having the only spot markets for everything. That being said, some of these other costs that are really driven by inflation and they are commodity oriented for metals, for plastics, for transportation, some of those, I think, are going to linger for a while for sure. And I would expect to see those bleed into next year, certainly the first half of next year. But I am hopeful that the spot by kind of premium things that we have experienced pretty severely in this quarter and in Q1, we will actually start to bag.\nMatthew O’Brien: Got it. That’s very helpful. And then the Instruments and Endoscopy numbers were really strong. I would just love to hear about durability of that – of those products are not the most sexy products, I guess, for lack of a better term, I guess, across med-tech. So just talk about the durability there. And then Kevin, I think you said last quarter that Neurovascular had some competitive pressures in ischemic. Is that still the case today? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Yes. First of all, I actually think Instruments and Endoscopy are pretty sexy businesses. But really, this is really about having terrific products. Our power tools are market-leading. Our flight helmets are market-leading. Procedures are picking up. And if procedures pick up, every time you do an orthopedic procedure using our flight helmet, you’re using our – if you’re using cement, you’re using our cement mixers. You’re using our power tools in the general surgery area. You’re using our cameras. They go through the autoclave and then they break down and then they have got to be replaced. And so we have obviously the leading imaging system. And so – and our sports medicine business has just been on fire, right? It’s growing strong double digits. And our ASC offense, we had a fabulous second quarter in ASC. We have a couple of new shoulder products with our in-space balloon as well as our ALF [ph] event peak anchors. And so we have a lot of strength across those two businesses. And they always have been kind of consistent growers for Stryker, if you go back over the last 15 years. And so they are going to continue their momentum. They have a really great engine of R&D and new products and power tools and cameras have new launches coming up next year. So I think it’s absolutely – they are absolutely durable. What was the second part, sorry?\nMatthew O’Brien: NV.\nKevin Lobo: NV. Yes. So Neurovascular, look, the market has been a bit soft in the U.S. Just keep in mind, the U.S. is certainly smaller in NV. They actually have more of their sales outside of the United States. It’s a little different than the rest of the Stryker portfolio. But the market has been a bit softer. And on the aspiration side, there have been a lot of competitive entrants in the United States. A lot of new aspiration products, which when the new products are launched, it does take surgeon attention. They want to try them out. And so there is been a bit of a factor there that has touched that business. But overall, I still feel very good about the Neurovascular business. It’s still going to – we’re still treating just a small fraction of the patients that need to be served. And over time, we’re sure that, that business will pick up, not just outside the U.S. but also inside the U.S.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please proceed.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. I want to talk a little bit about the pricing environment, both the headwinds that you experienced in the quarter. And then it sounds like you’re going contract by contract and trying to right fly some of that to reflect inflation.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think – hi, Joanne, in terms of Q2, we did experience some of the pricing difficulties that you felt in the pricing number, the 1.4% negative that we disclosed. I will say that that’s pretty consistent with the range that we feel in normal years. I do think that we have a very big focus with our sales teams on pricing and with our customers. And we actually saw positive pricing performance related to our U.S. MedSurg and Neurotechnology business, which is a good indicator that we are starting to enter these conversations with our customers. Our customers are doing their diligence. They understand that just with their staffing, with their nursing that prices are going up and that’s impacting us, too. And so we are having the conversations. Although given the contracting nature of some of our business, it just takes time for some of these things to stick. And so I do think that we are beginning to really lay the groundwork to really impact pricing over the future well into next year. And so I’m confident that we’re laying the processes in place now to make sure that we work with our customers to implement price increases.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. And keep in mind, Joanne, like some of the contracts have rebate clauses. And so you see those rebates do show up in our price number and that’s a bit of a lag effect, right? So they earn the rebate and then the rebate flows through. So that’s another part of this timing issue where it will take time for this to show up even as we negotiate higher prices for our products.\nJoanne Wuensch: I appreciate that clarification. As a second question, are some of the pipeline products, maybe even for next year, including other applications of the robot, maybe finally shoulder or spine? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Joanne, could you repeat that for us? Sorry, we had a little trouble here.\nJoanne Wuensch: Sure. No problem. The question has to do with your pipeline products and the timing of other applications for robots for applications such as spine and/or shoulder applications.\nJason Beach: Yes. Joanne, it’s Jason. So at this point, we don’t have anything further to announce. Obviously, as we get closer to launch timing, we will do that but nothing further at this point.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. The one thing I’d tell you is the Spine team is pretty excited about. But just separate for Mako, Joanne, I would say the Spine team is pretty excited about Q guidance, which received approval. Okay. It’s not a full robotic solution but it is a pretty exciting offering within enabling technologies. We now have the spinal application approved and the cranial application is sitting with the FDA. But that should give them a bit of a lift in the second half.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joshua Jennings with Cowen. Please proceed.\nJoshua Jennings: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Kevin, I was hoping to just ask about staffing shortages and impact on the implant business. I think they kind of felt that they may have peaked during the Omicron surge. And absenteeism contributed to the staffing shortage pressuring like procedure volumes. But do you feel – and it’s probably hard to quantify that staffing shortage have improved gradually over the last few months? Or are we – has that kind of stalled? And are you expecting within your updated organic revenue guidance that staffing shortages will improve? It sounded like one of your previous answers that that wasn’t the case but just wanted to clarify that.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Certainly, we saw choppiness in the second quarter. That’s kind of the word I would use. And it could be related to staffing challenges just hiring staff and having consistent staff that actually know the procedure, so you can do the same number of procedures that you used to do in a day and COVID, which affected, frankly, some of the nurses as well as patients who had to delay their procedure because they got contracted COVID. So that type of choppiness is actually still lingering right now as we speak. But we’ve seen a nice uptick in procedural volumes, and we do expect that uptick to gradual proof we’re not calling for a giant spike. But we are calling for this kind of environment to continue and see gradual improvement from where we were in the second quarter through the rest of the year.\nJoshua Jennings: Understood. Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up on just the Spine business and I know there was some scolio softness. It sounds like Glenn called out. Is there anything to highlight just with the market recovery in spine relative to other ortho procedure categories? Or do you think the 2Q performance was more Stryker-specific? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.\nJason Beach: Yes. It’s Jason. I don’t think at this point there is anything more to highlight. I mean obviously, we’re early in the earnings cycle as well. So tough to tell how we compare the rest of market but I’d say nothing else to add at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Please proceed.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to touch on the Mako dynamics. And you talked about some different ordering patterns. Is that more indicative of maybe going into competitive accounts where you haven’t been historically and they want to rent before they fully commit? And then I do have a follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. It’s not that we’re showing up anywhere differently. It’s just that if your competitor offers a rental option, the customer says do you have a rental option. And so the idea is look, we’re not going to let our prior contracting approach stop us from competing. And so we’ve introduced a rental option and started to promote that, just to make sure that that’s not one of the barriers and that let the technologies fight head-to-head and let the best technology win. So it’s more of a response to what has been happening in the marketplace, not so much that we’re going into different accounts. We’ve always been active in competitive accounts as well as active in – with surgeons that use Stryker products. We’re really pretty agnostic. Whoever wants to use robotics, we want to make sure that if we show up and that they are able to try our technologies, and we believe we have the best system in the market.\nKyle Rose: Great. And then historically, you’ve talked about trends in the ASC market and putting together one sales team into the ASC. Maybe just touch on what trends you’re seeing in the ASC and how that focused sales approach is playing out commercially? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, I’m really excited about our success in the ASC market. One of the ways you can gauge that is just our sports medicine business, which is normally involved in those deals and has been a big beneficiary of the overall Stryker offense and also Mako. So with the Mako, sales in the ASC has continued to increase. So if you look at the percentage of Makos and ASCs versus hospitals, that ratio has been gradually increasing. It increased again in the second quarter. So the ASC is a place that Stryker can really play well given that we’re so deep in the orthopedic service line with capital equipment as well as implants and disposables.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Please proceed.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask two here upfront. First, if you could just go into some more detail on what’s holding back trauma whether that’s a product portfolio issue or a market issue, that would be great. And then Kevin, you mentioned a couple of times being excited about the pipeline. I wanted to just highlight maybe two or three products that you guys have coming in the next 6 to 12 months that we should be paying attention to?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. First of all, I think there is nothing holding back our trauma business. I would tell you that we had a massive comp from the prior year, if you go back to the prior year second quarter, we had pretty massive comparative. We have a great train business, whether it’s the upper extremities business, which grew double digits again and we will continue to grow double digits for the rest of the year. I think Foot & Ankle, the total ankle had another really strong quarter in the second quarter. It was a little bit soft on the sort of the 4-foot procedures. And then the overall sort of underlying core trauma business, the market was a little bit softer that happens from quarter-to-quarter, right? So whether it’s weather, whether it’s who knows what, it’s not unusual. But I have zero worries about our Trauma and Extremities business. We are widely excited about the way right medical is integrated into our business. And we have a business, as you’ve seen over the past 5 years, that performs very, very well. And so there is nothing holding that business back. I’m pretty bullish on that business for the future. Was there a second part?\nChris Pasquale: Pipeline.\nKevin Lobo: Product pipeline, I think I mentioned before that we are really entering a pretty exciting period going into next year with System 9 and next-generation power tools, 78 camera, the next-generation camera life pack defibrillator, which is the big sort of the big, large complex defibrillator and then the Neptune AS [ph], which is a smaller version of Neptune that will get us into procedure areas that not currently in today, especially GI, which is a very, very high volume procedure. An amazing feature of this product is the ability to be able to capture the polyp. And if you have to watch what they have to do today to find polyps within the waste that they have to sort through, it’s not very pretty. And this is a very, very elegant solution with this innovation. And so something we are very excited about being able to launch. It will get us, frankly, into brand new markets where we don’t even play today. So, those are some of the launches, I am sure I am missing a few from some of the other divisions. But those are big launches. And as you know, when we launch those big – when we have these big launches, they really do drive growth than they had historically.\nChris Pasquale: That’s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nSteve Lichtman: Thank you. Hi, guys. Glenn, on the increased headwind you are building in for inflation this year, I was wondering versus your assumptions on the 1Q call where the biggest deltas were. Was it the persistence of spot buying at elevated prices that maybe are going on longer? Is it higher base assumption on input and labor costs? Just wondering if one stood out or if it was just across the board?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think probably the single biggest thing was the spot buy and the premiums. I think as we entered into Q2 and exited Q1, we saw that, that was happening. But who could imagine the demand that was out there relative to us competing with car companies and a whole bunch of different kind of competitors that we never really had before with those vendors. And so, I would say that those premiums that we paid just so that we could make sure that we were serving our customers and could deliver them products were the single biggest thing that maybe changed from guidance last time to guidance this time. I think the other though persistent thing that we are seeing is just because the supply chain has been so spotty, we also are just – we are feeling inefficiencies in our processes and how we manage our manufacturing across the globe with sort of inconsistencies of when we will have raw materials available for teams to work on. So, I do say it’s probably spot buys is the one big thing that really sticks out. But a lot of these little nits on inflation are also impacting us as well.\nSteve Lichtman: Got it. And then just secondly, on China, I know obviously not a big business for you and you grew emerging markets solidly in the quarter. But just wondering what you saw there specifically in the second quarter? And any easing of pressures in China as we exited the quarter?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, China, it was a tough quarter, and I think anybody you talk to would say that just given the lockdowns and all the challenges. So, we certainly had negative growth in China in the quarter. But our other emerging markets were pretty fantastic. And that growth was able to offset the negative that we had in China. It’s looking like it’s starting to get better. But we didn’t fare, I don’t think any better than our competitors. It was definitely a tough quarter Q2 in China. We do have some businesses that were – like our neurovascular business continue to do very well in China. They were a little less impacted, just the nature of that type of procedure. But the rest of our businesses felt the same pressure as everybody else.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Rich Newitter with Truist. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little historical perspective on the capital spending situation. We are all looking forward and the prospect of recession is obviously there. At what point historically for your capital mix of businesses have you seen – what have you seen as the leading indicator for when replacement cycles do, in fact, elongate? Clearly, you are not seeing it yet, but is there a point at which we should be braced for that happening?\nKevin Lobo: Well, I think, look, the recession would have to be pretty prolonged. We always have a delayed reaction across our portfolio, whether it’s more elective procedures or whether it’s capital equipment. We tend to get affected much later in the cycle versus other parts of the healthcare system. So, it would have to be prolonged, which I think the economists for now are not really calling for kind of a prolonged recession. The other factor is really hospital liquidity. That’s a big factor. So, if you go back to the financial meltdown, it wasn’t just that there was a recession, right? There was a liquidity crisis. And when that happens, that’s when you see – you saw our medical business, the large capital business, really get impacted. But we don’t see a liquidity crisis today. The hospital balance sheets are actually quite strong. So, that gives us some confidence. And plus, look, Stryker is a different company than it was back in the financial meltdown. Large capital is a big part of our company. We have diversified dramatically in the past decade, so much so that it’s less than 10% of our overall sales. So, even if there was an impact, it’s certainly not going to hurt us anywhere near the way it would have hurt us a decade ago.\nUnidentified Analyst: That’s really helpful. And then maybe just one more on Mako, like big-ticket capital, it sounds like the message was there was no real change in buying or demand for robotic reprioritization of hip and knee, Mako robotics, per se. But maybe there was just some revenue mix and some changes in the revenue recognition. Is that right that the actual in-quarter demand, not just the order book, but the in-quarter demand for Mako was pretty much unchanged and strong?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, it was strong. I mean I think Jason mentioned in his prepared remarks, it was – we were up 19% versus the prior year. Now a good part of that was international. But even in the U.S., we had growth versus the prior year. And that’s actually starting to pick up in the U.S. So, demand is very strong. So, you have to remember where we are in the cycle of robotics, right. We are in the early stages, in the early cycle of robotic surgery adoption. And I think if we were in a later cycle might be a bit different story. But because it’s robotics, it’s still early. There are still people who are anxious to get their hands on robots. And we are now very active in all the teaching hospitals. And the residents are coming out and they want a robot. And when they go into their new facility and the facility doesn’t have a robot, they put a lot of pressure on their hospital to adopt it. Now how they choose to pay for it, what type of contracting arrangements to get into, that’s a whole other story. But facilities are buying their fourth and their fifth and their sixth robots. And so they are doing that because they absolutely believe in the value of robotics. That has nothing to do with marketing. It’s all about really trying to provide best value for their customers and for their patients.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nTravis Steed: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I would love a little bit more clarification on the 200 basis point margin headwind you called out. How much of that is actually coming from some of the more acute spot buying that you mentioned versus the other inflationary things like plastics, metals and travel? Is it roughly half and half, or is it 75-25? Just any directional color would be helpful.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Sure. I think as you look at sort of that basket of cost, the spot buy certainly are significant, maybe approaching half of that basket of costs. I mean that being said, keep in mind that as we made those spot buy purchases, the underlying inventory goes on the balance sheet. And then it bleeds out into our P&L over the utilization period. So, it’s not something that goes away from us in the short-term. The other basket of costs, though, we do feel that inflation. We feel it in labor. We feel it in transportation. We are seeing it in commodities. And that’s something that I am not necessarily expecting will necessarily go away for us over the longer term.\nTravis Steed: No, that’s really helpful as we kind of think about our models for the next year. So, that’s helpful. And I guess on pricing, do you think you could see it going flattish next year, or could it be something that goes positive? And then I don’t know if you have any other quick comments on the sports medicine market and smoke evacuation, that would be helpful as well. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nJason Beach: Yes. Travis, it’s Jason. Just really quickly on the pricing piece, and then I will hand it over to Glenn on the sports med. But relative to guiding on price, we are not going to guide on price for next year. And when we get closer to 2023 earnings season, you will hear more, but nothing to guide there.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. On your question on Smoke Evac and sports medicine, first of all, Smoke Evac continues to be very high growth. There are six states that are mandating smoke-free ORs. There are seven other states that have legislation that’s pending. And so you can see the momentum around smoke-free operating rooms is absolutely increasing. And we are in a great position and we had fantastic growth in smoke evacuation. That should continue. And then on Sports Med, this is about our company and we are now becoming – we are fast becoming a leader in sports medicine, which obviously wasn’t the case a decade ago. First, we started off with our hip portfolio with the Pivot acquisition and some – and really becoming the leader in hip arthroscopy. We already had a decent knee offering. And shoulder had been our weakness, and we have really bolstered our shoulder portfolio. So, in all the key areas, we now have very compelling product opportunities. And when we are absolutely growing faster than the market and have been for the last couple of years. But I think the ASC shift has put an accelerator on our sports medicine business. And I think you know that sits within our Endoscopy division. But that business has a fabulous outlook for the future. I mentioned the in-space balloon for massive rotator cuff repair. The [indiscernible] product has just recently launched, which really addresses gaps that we had in the sort of smaller rotator cuff repair part of the sports medicine business. So, I am extremely bullish about sports medicine for the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nDrew Ranieri: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, just to go back to one of your comments about the trauma market. And I think specifically it was on foot and ankle. You mentioned there was some softness on forefoot procedures. Just curious if that was the overall market or if there is anything else that you were seeing there. And then second, just on ProCuity, you have talked about it being just a strong launch. Curious kind of what you are thinking in terms of the durability there. And are you taking competitive share, or is it really growth really all driven by replacements at this point? Thanks for taking the questions.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, the orders are continuing to pile up on ProCuity and it’s not just in friendly shops. So, we are clearly winning competitive business. This is an absolutely fantastic product. The thing we have is there are a lot of microchips used in that product. And so we are being constrained on being able to ship to meet the demand. That is going to get better in the second half and into next year. But it’s really – it’s a terrific product. And that’s going to continue to drive growth. It’s kind of year two of the product launch and if we weren’t so supply constrained, we would be shipping a lot more of those products. But beds don’t sort of ramp as quickly in terms of the buying cycle as a power tool or as a camera. So, I would expect the next let’s call it, 2 years to be really, really strong for ProCuity. And what was the second thing? On foot and ankle, look, we will have to see what happens when everybody else reports and kind of see what’s happening in the marketplace. It was a little bit softer for us on the forefoot side, but strong on the total ankle side. And let’s just – we will have to see how that plays out. I really – it’s a little premature to know kind of how we are doing. I would say we are pretty excited about – we have a number of fore-foot launches. We had some supply challenges in getting those launches activated. But like the easy foot [ph] launch, for example, or easy as we call it, sorry, it looks like a staple. Terrific product for procedures. But we stumbled a little bit in – just because of supply chain challenges in getting these new launches for MIS forefoot. Those launches will – I just mentioned one of those is EasyFuse. But there is about five of these products which we will start to see the impact of those in the second half of the year. So, I am feeling optimistic going forward, but the second quarter was a little bit choppy. Nothing that’s overly concerning.\nDrew Ranieri: Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Matson with Needham & Company. Please proceed.\nMichael Matson: Yes. Thanks for fitting me in. Just had two questions, I guess I will just go ahead and give them to you both to you here. So, the – with the System 9 and the 17 EDA coming up next year, is there any risk that we are going to see a slowdown in those businesses? I know how important those product lines are to instruments in endoscopy. And then the second question would just be around R&D. It’s 7.2% in the first half. Looking back at my model, that’s up almost 200 basis points over the past 10 years. Is this the new normal, or could it keep going higher from here?\nKevin Lobo: Well, let me start with the product launches. When we do these new launches, we have sales forces that know how to kind of drive revenue. And these are products that do wear out and do need to be replaced. And so I am not expecting any slowdown whatsoever. If anything, you should see growth continue and then gradually increase. And sometimes, it’s not the first year that you see the spike. You sort of see it, but you certainly see it by the second year. So, to me this is just a continuation of – it will continue a very, very good trend. Look, R&D has gone up and part of it’s because of the mix of our businesses. If you think about neurovascular, it’s a little more thirsty because of the clinicals that are required. We are launching a lot of new products. So, our spend has increased. And look, we were over 7% of sales, I think for the full year. I don’t know that we will stay over 7% but we will be kind of in that neighborhood as a percentage of sales. I don’t know that it goes a lot higher from here. I think that’s a pretty healthy level of R&D. But look, that fuels our growth and growth doesn’t come for free. So, you do have to invest in innovation if you want to continue to grow. But I think this is probably a good level. And we will kind of stay at this level unless our portfolio drastically changes. We are doing more in the world of digital. That does cost some money, make over pursuing different applications. That is a bit first for R&D. But I would say that this is a pretty good level.\nMichael Matson: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please proceed.\nJeff Johnson: Hi guys. Good afternoon. Maybe just a couple of clarifying questions. First, on pricing. You sound pretty good on pricing going forward. Is that largely driven by the strong new product cycle coming in MedSurg and you typically can get a little price on new MedSurg products, or do you – would you expect in MedSurg to take bigger than normal price increases on these new products? And then on the implant side, have you had any tangible conversations with hospitals yet about maybe less bad pricing dynamics in contracts over the next couple of years, or is that just still a hope at this point but nothing tangible yet to talk about?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. On the first question, I want to be really clear here that whenever we do launch new products, whatever price – we normally will raise the price. But you won’t see that in the price line of our quarterly results. So, price the way we report price is like-for-like. So, as the System 9, if it comes in at a higher price for the first year, that will show up in mix and volume, it will not show up in the price line. So, in the second year, that like-for-like will start to show up. So, just to be clear about that, we always – ProCuity is a good example. The ProCuity price is higher than our beds. But in the first year of that launch, you don’t see that showing up in the price line. It shows up in volume mix. So, I hope I am clear on that. But obviously, that’s going to be part of our strategy. As we launch new products, we are going to be able to raise prices. As it relates to implants, early days yet. We have had a couple of early conversations and they have gone reasonably well. But it is way too early for me to be able to give you a sign of what is going to come in the future and we will have more to share on future calls.\nJeff Johnson: Alright. That’s helpful. And then just one more on gross margins, just kind of it’s about 100 basis points headwind is on the spot buy, heightened costs this year on that. If those spot prices do come down over the next six months as it seems like you think they could, is that 30 days to 60 days to work that into the product and turn that over onto the P&L? So, that tends to be a short cycle, those benefits could show up quickly? And then maybe on the implant side, where that is getting capitalized to the balance sheet right now, those higher costs. Is there a significantly greater headwind next year, another 100 basis points that’s being capitalized on to the balance sheet right now that hasn’t yet come through this year. So, we have to think maybe an incremental 100 basis point headwind there, that could get offset by the short cycle spot by pricing coming down next year and net-net, those could offset, or just conceptually, maybe how do we think about those two moving parts?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Without getting too granular about next year, the way these bleed out, it’s not necessarily short-term in terms of how they bleed out. We worked pretty diligently to secure the kind of supply that was available when we could get it. And so that has a longer tail in terms of when we will feel the bleed out into our P&L. And that would apply to either side implants or the MedSurg businesses.\nJeff Johnson: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Shagun Singh with RBC. Please proceed.\nShagun Singh: Thank you for taking the question. I will just keep it to one. Just on M&A, how are you thinking about the current M&A environment? Your appetite for deals at the moment given valuations where they are, are you more or less likely to do one? And do you – should we expect you to continue to focus on tuck-ins versus larger deals given the recent Vocera acquisition? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks for the question. Certainly, we are focused on tuck-ins, not just given Vocera, but also Wright Medical. So, we did Wright Medical not so long ago. And then we did Vocera. As Glenn mentioned, we paid $450 million of debt down in the last quarter. So, right now, given our balance sheet situation, our focus is really on tuck-ins. All of our businesses are actively pursuing these kind of tuck-ins. But you should expect that that’s kind of in our near-term, let’s say, through the end of this year. Our focus will be much more on the tuck-ins. And obviously, valuations are down. That doesn’t mean that the companies that have these lower valuations are excited to sell at these new values. I think it’s going to take a little time for that to set in before we are going to see a lot of those companies want to sell. So, I don’t think that we are going to miss a window, so to speak, just because we are focused on the tuck-ins. But we do need to digest the acquisitions. We do need to fortify our balance sheet, but we will continue to pursue tuck-ins.\nOperator: Thank you. The last question is from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Please proceed.\nRyan Zimmerman: Hey. Thanks for fitting me in. I will try and be quick on my questions. Number one, just I want to ask the pricing question in a different way. And as they think about price and the ability to take it, I mean I know you are not going to give us what kind of pricing is going to take. But how do you think about inflation? And what persists over the next six months or into next year in terms of how much that you can carry through? So, inflation versus an 8% is a reasonable thing we can push through a similar type price increase into next year? And then the follow-up question is just around Mako dynamics and the shift to either a rent or a lease type model. We see with Intuitive 40%-plus in the last quarter. Is that the right level to think about for where this shakes out and settles out in terms of Mako adoption and the business model? Thanks for taking the questions.\nKevin Lobo: Hey Ryan, I will handle the pricing/inflation one first. I do think some of the normal things that you think about relative to the inflationary environment we are in and we are feeling will persist and will live on into next year. We see labor increases. We see increases in these commodities. I do think it will take a while before transportation and freight settles down to a more, what I will call normal cadence in terms of ocean freight versus air freight. And so I think that will take a while to settle out. And in fact, where we enter into conversations with our customers about sort of what our cost makeup looks like, and we are very frank with them. There are no surprises to them in terms of where we are seeing real increase in the real kind of raw materials and components that go into our products. And those are the kind of discussions that customers may not want to have, but they know and they expect it’s coming. And so when we lead to go after price, we lead with details and with information so that they understand that underneath our pricing increase, we are feeling real increases in the components that go into our products.\nJason Beach: Ryan, it’s Jason. In terms of the Mako question, I guess what I would say is in terms of the right mix, I think what’s important here is we think about the different options. We are trying to be flexible with the customer to ultimately drive the installed base to then get to continue market-leading growth on the implant side, right. So, that’s really what’s important for us and less about kind of that mix as we think about finance, direct purchase, etcetera. So, we are excited where we are headed with Mako. As I said in my opening remarks of the 19% install increase year-on-year. And so I will just kind of leave it there as we are thinking about Mako.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So, I will now turn the call over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: Great. Well, thank you all for joining our call, and thank you for all your questions. We look forward to sharing our third quarter results with you in October. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today’s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Lobo",
            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and updates on Mako and Vocera. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. For the quarter, organic sales growth was 6% with high single-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by endoscopy, instruments and neurocranial. Our hip and knee businesses delivered high single-digit growth in the face of tough compares from 2021. Internationally, we posted high single-digit organic growth with strength in Canada, Europe and Japan as well as double-digit organic growth in emerging markets despite the China COVID-related slowdowns. During the quarter, we continue to have robust demand for our capital products. However, we had meaningful shipment delays as a result of ongoing product supply challenges mostly affecting our large capital businesses. As a reminder, less than 10% of our revenue is large capital, with about 15% of our revenue being smaller operating capital that drives revenue for hospitals. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $2.25 as we faced increasing negative impacts from foreign exchange as well as inflationary pressures and significant premiums on inventory spot buys. We expect these pressures to continue in the back half of the year. However, the supply situation is improving. Given the higher input costs, we have begun to take a series of pricing actions across our portfolio. These will take time to be reflected in our results given the phasing of contract renewals in many areas of our business. We continue to invest in R&D at a healthy ratio of sales, demonstrating our continued focus on new product pipelines. We remain confident in the outlook of our business and expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med-tech. However, even with disciplined spending, the worsened foreign exchange situation and other pressures will prevent us from delivering leverage to earnings in 2022. With half of the year behind us and a very strong order book, we now expect full year organic sales growth of 8% to 9% and due largely to foreign currency exchange, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.30 to $9.50 per share. Overall, our team has shown good resiliency and we are on track for another strong year of sales growth. Our employee engagement remains very high and we continue to win awards as a Great Place to Work, most recently as a Great Place to Work for Millennials by Fortune. We are also gearing up for some exciting new product launches in 2023 and look forward to an improved supply chain picture. Through the many challenges that we had faced since 2020, we feel optimistic about how we are positioning ourselves for the future. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Yes. Sure, Robbie. This is Kevin. I'll take that. So first of all, I feel very good about the momentum that we have across all of our businesses. Medical for sure is going to have a much better second half. They were the division that was most affected by the shortages. We do have a line of sight towards the supply of key electronic components and we are going to ramp up as fast as we can to meet that demand. But we also have softer comps. This second quarter was by far the most difficult comparative from the prior year. So we have softer comps across, frankly, all of our businesses in Q3 and Q4. And the order book, not just for Medical, but if I look at the other MedSurg businesses like Instruments and Endoscopy, which both had terrific Q2s, they are going to continue to have strong growth in Q3, Q4. So, we obviously feel very good about the demand from our hospital customers. That gives us the confidence to raise our sales growth. We exited the first half at 7.5%, with a very tough Q2 comp. So, we feel pretty good about getting to the 8% to 9% on the top line. On the bottom line, as you can see, based on the change in our guidance from last quarter, $0.15, if you look at the midpoint of our range, $0.15 of our drop is due to foreign currency. So, that's the majority of the adjustment on the EPS line. And we are really fighting through significant supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures and right now, obviously, taking it on the chin for our customers at least for this year. But we are taking – obviously starting to take pricing actions. Those – we won't see a lot of that in this year. It will start to roll kind of more into next year. But I'd say the majority of our takedown is due to foreign currency, but obviously, very significant supply chain pressures that we are dealing with, but a very strong demand situation overall. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. As you can imagine, a lot has changed in the last 6 months. A lot could change in the next 6 months. And as you know, we always give guidance in January, which we will do. But what I will say is the spot buy situation has been pretty significant. It's been a big part of our gross margin negative story for this year. That is starting to abate. I would hope that, that gets better next year. But obviously, we will update you in January in terms of the overall outlook. I would not call this year an easy year from the top line comparative. Driving organic growth of 8% to 9% is pretty heavy, but we do have a lot of very exciting launches next year. We have System 9 for power tools, 78 [ph] camera launch, a LIFEPAK defibrillator launch, a Neptune S which is a smaller version of Neptune for GI and ASC. Those are all really outstanding launches. So I do expect that the top line will continue to hum for Stryker next year. The bottom line, like we are going to work through these challenges, and we'll have more to talk about in January. Yes. Larry, first of all, on the Mako side, what I would tell you is this is not a new trend. This has been happening over the past kind of 6 months where we are seeing more deals being financed versus outright purchased and actually a move towards more rental agreements. And if you have a rental agreement, you can't recognize all the revenue upfront. Even in some of our overall finance deals, we could recognize more of the revenue upfront. In a rental, the customer has the right to return the product. And so you can't record all of the revenue upfront and that's what our competitors are also offering. We are not really worried, because we've had virtually no returns of our product. Once we get our products in and you can tell by our utilization of Mako, which again, we'll report on at the end of the year, we have highly utilized machines. And so – but that's really – that's a shift that's been ongoing. It wasn't a new factor this quarter. We are really pleased with the number of installations. But the revenue per unit that we can recognize upfront is lower. And we will be able to recognize more of this revenue over the life of the contracts. And then as it relates to the rest of the capital equipment environment, what I'd tell you is we wouldn't be taking up our sales if we felt that the capital environment was softening in any way, shape or form. The small capital is needed to be able to do procedures, power tools, wear-out cameras need to be replaced. And the medical business is continuing to get fantastic order growth whether it's on the defibrillator or power costs as well as our ProCuity bed the orders are continuing to really pour in. We are not seeing hospital construction projects being halted at all. And look at our communications business, which is a large capital business, they had a terrific quarter in the second quarter and their order books continuing to grow. So the timing of construction may get delayed a quarter or so, but no one's canceling these projects. Nobody is canceling any of our orders. So we're feeling, at least through the end of this year, feeling pretty bullish about the overall environment. Hospital liquidity is still strong. Now of course, they are feeling pressure on their profits but their liquidity is in a healthy position. And that's really where the source of funding comes for capital. Well, let me start with the Hips. We're feeling really great about our Hip business. And as you know, the Insignia launch was – is a very big launch. It's not actually even fully launched. So we are still deploying sets out in the field. But the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. And that also is compatible with the Mako robot. The Mako robot utilization for hips is also increasing pretty significantly, which is exciting. That's due in part to the Hip 4.0 software that we launched, I guess, about two or three quarters ago. That new software, combined with this hip stem, I believe will position us for growing above the market in hips. Not everybody has reported yet. So let's see how that plays out this quarter. But we're really only getting started with that stem launch and very excited about the hip business. What was the first part of the question? Yes. So on the first part of your question was on capital. So clearly, Medical is going to improve in the second half versus their performance. They were down organically in the first half of the year. They are going to be up pretty significantly in the second half of the year because they were the most affected by the shortages of electronics. We still – even though we're guiding to this 8% to 9%, that doesn't assume that we completely bleed everything. We're still living in a bit of a tough environment out there. And so there is that risk ongoing that might move us towards the lower end of the range or move us up to the higher end of the range. On the implant side, we're feeling pretty good about procedures are largely back to normal in most parts of the world. And really, it's about the hospital staffing. If that staffing gets better, then obviously, there is a lot of pent-up demand for procedures. And we're feeling very good about our position in those businesses. Yes. Right now, we're not baking in any major changes. Certainly, if you look at prior situations where hospitals were under fire, we really didn't see much of an impact at all in the small capital area. The one area you could see some impact would be in the larger capital. But of course, a lot of our business, we do have financing through Stryker Flex Financial, which does help with offsetting the kind of pressures that the hospital has in terms of overall capital. And as I mentioned earlier, coming out of the – out of 2020 with CARES Act funding, liquidity of hospitals is actually pretty good right now. So with our portfolio mix, I think we're in good shape. If you think about something like Mako, it's still early in the cycle and hospitals are really anxious to get that product. It's not like they have old Makos that they are trying to upgrade and change. They are looking at increasing adoption early in the cycle. So I think our portfolio lends itself very well to what hospitals need. And they are going to prioritize our capital and potentially not prioritize other people's capital. You could say that's an optimistic outlook but just the way orders are continuing to stream in. And we haven't had really any orders canceled. And we don't have a history of that in our company. So do I have great visibility into the second half of next year? No. Do I have really good visibility through the end of this year and probably into the early part of next year? Yes, I think we do. Yes. Yes. First of all, I actually think Instruments and Endoscopy are pretty sexy businesses. But really, this is really about having terrific products. Our power tools are market-leading. Our flight helmets are market-leading. Procedures are picking up. And if procedures pick up, every time you do an orthopedic procedure using our flight helmet, you're using our – if you're using cement, you're using our cement mixers. You're using our power tools in the general surgery area. You're using our cameras. They go through the autoclave and then they break down and then they have got to be replaced. And so we have obviously the leading imaging system. And so – and our sports medicine business has just been on fire, right? It's growing strong double digits. And our ASC offense, we had a fabulous second quarter in ASC. We have a couple of new shoulder products with our in-space balloon as well as our ALF [ph] event peak anchors. And so we have a lot of strength across those two businesses. And they always have been kind of consistent growers for Stryker, if you go back over the last 15 years. And so they are going to continue their momentum. They have a really great engine of R&D and new products and power tools and cameras have new launches coming up next year. So I think it's absolutely – they are absolutely durable. What was the second part, sorry? NV. Yes. So Neurovascular, look, the market has been a bit soft in the U.S. Just keep in mind, the U.S. is certainly smaller in NV. They actually have more of their sales outside of the United States. It's a little different than the rest of the Stryker portfolio. But the market has been a bit softer. And on the aspiration side, there have been a lot of competitive entrants in the United States. A lot of new aspiration products, which when the new products are launched, it does take surgeon attention. They want to try them out. And so there is been a bit of a factor there that has touched that business. But overall, I still feel very good about the Neurovascular business. It's still going to – we're still treating just a small fraction of the patients that need to be served. And over time, we're sure that, that business will pick up, not just outside the U.S. but also inside the U.S. Yes. And keep in mind, Joanne, like some of the contracts have rebate clauses. And so you see those rebates do show up in our price number and that's a bit of a lag effect, right? So they earn the rebate and then the rebate flows through. So that's another part of this timing issue where it will take time for this to show up even as we negotiate higher prices for our products. Joanne, could you repeat that for us? Sorry, we had a little trouble here. Yes. The one thing I'd tell you is the Spine team is pretty excited about. But just separate for Mako, Joanne, I would say the Spine team is pretty excited about Q guidance, which received approval. Okay. It's not a full robotic solution but it is a pretty exciting offering within enabling technologies. We now have the spinal application approved and the cranial application is sitting with the FDA. But that should give them a bit of a lift in the second half. Yes. Certainly, we saw choppiness in the second quarter. That's kind of the word I would use. And it could be related to staffing challenges just hiring staff and having consistent staff that actually know the procedure, so you can do the same number of procedures that you used to do in a day and COVID, which affected, frankly, some of the nurses as well as patients who had to delay their procedure because they got contracted COVID. So that type of choppiness is actually still lingering right now as we speak. But we've seen a nice uptick in procedural volumes, and we do expect that uptick to gradual proof we're not calling for a giant spike. But we are calling for this kind of environment to continue and see gradual improvement from where we were in the second quarter through the rest of the year. Yes. It's not that we're showing up anywhere differently. It's just that if your competitor offers a rental option, the customer says do you have a rental option. And so the idea is look, we're not going to let our prior contracting approach stop us from competing. And so we've introduced a rental option and started to promote that, just to make sure that that's not one of the barriers and that let the technologies fight head-to-head and let the best technology win. So it's more of a response to what has been happening in the marketplace, not so much that we're going into different accounts. We've always been active in competitive accounts as well as active in – with surgeons that use Stryker products. We're really pretty agnostic. Whoever wants to use robotics, we want to make sure that if we show up and that they are able to try our technologies, and we believe we have the best system in the market. Yes. Look, I'm really excited about our success in the ASC market. One of the ways you can gauge that is just our sports medicine business, which is normally involved in those deals and has been a big beneficiary of the overall Stryker offense and also Mako. So with the Mako, sales in the ASC has continued to increase. So if you look at the percentage of Makos and ASCs versus hospitals, that ratio has been gradually increasing. It increased again in the second quarter. So the ASC is a place that Stryker can really play well given that we're so deep in the orthopedic service line with capital equipment as well as implants and disposables. Yes. First of all, I think there is nothing holding back our trauma business. I would tell you that we had a massive comp from the prior year, if you go back to the prior year second quarter, we had pretty massive comparative. We have a great train business, whether it's the upper extremities business, which grew double digits again and we will continue to grow double digits for the rest of the year. I think Foot & Ankle, the total ankle had another really strong quarter in the second quarter. It was a little bit soft on the sort of the 4-foot procedures. And then the overall sort of underlying core trauma business, the market was a little bit softer that happens from quarter-to-quarter, right? So whether it's weather, whether it's who knows what, it's not unusual. But I have zero worries about our Trauma and Extremities business. We are widely excited about the way right medical is integrated into our business. And we have a business, as you've seen over the past 5 years, that performs very, very well. And so there is nothing holding that business back. I'm pretty bullish on that business for the future. Was there a second part? Product pipeline, I think I mentioned before that we are really entering a pretty exciting period going into next year with System 9 and next-generation power tools, 78 camera, the next-generation camera life pack defibrillator, which is the big sort of the big, large complex defibrillator and then the Neptune AS [ph], which is a smaller version of Neptune that will get us into procedure areas that not currently in today, especially GI, which is a very, very high volume procedure. An amazing feature of this product is the ability to be able to capture the polyp. And if you have to watch what they have to do today to find polyps within the waste that they have to sort through, it's not very pretty. And this is a very, very elegant solution with this innovation. And so something we are very excited about being able to launch. It will get us, frankly, into brand new markets where we don't even play today. So, those are some of the launches, I am sure I am missing a few from some of the other divisions. But those are big launches. And as you know, when we launch those big – when we have these big launches, they really do drive growth than they had historically. Yes. Look, China, it was a tough quarter, and I think anybody you talk to would say that just given the lockdowns and all the challenges. So, we certainly had negative growth in China in the quarter. But our other emerging markets were pretty fantastic. And that growth was able to offset the negative that we had in China. It's looking like it's starting to get better. But we didn't fare, I don't think any better than our competitors. It was definitely a tough quarter Q2 in China. We do have some businesses that were – like our neurovascular business continue to do very well in China. They were a little less impacted, just the nature of that type of procedure. But the rest of our businesses felt the same pressure as everybody else. Well, I think, look, the recession would have to be pretty prolonged. We always have a delayed reaction across our portfolio, whether it's more elective procedures or whether it's capital equipment. We tend to get affected much later in the cycle versus other parts of the healthcare system. So, it would have to be prolonged, which I think the economists for now are not really calling for kind of a prolonged recession. The other factor is really hospital liquidity. That's a big factor. So, if you go back to the financial meltdown, it wasn't just that there was a recession, right? There was a liquidity crisis. And when that happens, that's when you see – you saw our medical business, the large capital business, really get impacted. But we don't see a liquidity crisis today. The hospital balance sheets are actually quite strong. So, that gives us some confidence. And plus, look, Stryker is a different company than it was back in the financial meltdown. Large capital is a big part of our company. We have diversified dramatically in the past decade, so much so that it's less than 10% of our overall sales. So, even if there was an impact, it's certainly not going to hurt us anywhere near the way it would have hurt us a decade ago. Yes, it was strong. I mean I think Jason mentioned in his prepared remarks, it was – we were up 19% versus the prior year. Now a good part of that was international. But even in the U.S., we had growth versus the prior year. And that's actually starting to pick up in the U.S. So, demand is very strong. So, you have to remember where we are in the cycle of robotics, right. We are in the early stages, in the early cycle of robotic surgery adoption. And I think if we were in a later cycle might be a bit different story. But because it's robotics, it's still early. There are still people who are anxious to get their hands on robots. And we are now very active in all the teaching hospitals. And the residents are coming out and they want a robot. And when they go into their new facility and the facility doesn't have a robot, they put a lot of pressure on their hospital to adopt it. Now how they choose to pay for it, what type of contracting arrangements to get into, that's a whole other story. But facilities are buying their fourth and their fifth and their sixth robots. And so they are doing that because they absolutely believe in the value of robotics. That has nothing to do with marketing. It's all about really trying to provide best value for their customers and for their patients. Yes. Look, the orders are continuing to pile up on ProCuity and it's not just in friendly shops. So, we are clearly winning competitive business. This is an absolutely fantastic product. The thing we have is there are a lot of microchips used in that product. And so we are being constrained on being able to ship to meet the demand. That is going to get better in the second half and into next year. But it's really – it's a terrific product. And that's going to continue to drive growth. It's kind of year two of the product launch and if we weren't so supply constrained, we would be shipping a lot more of those products. But beds don't sort of ramp as quickly in terms of the buying cycle as a power tool or as a camera. So, I would expect the next let's call it, 2 years to be really, really strong for ProCuity. And what was the second thing? On foot and ankle, look, we will have to see what happens when everybody else reports and kind of see what's happening in the marketplace. It was a little bit softer for us on the forefoot side, but strong on the total ankle side. And let's just – we will have to see how that plays out. I really – it's a little premature to know kind of how we are doing. I would say we are pretty excited about – we have a number of fore-foot launches. We had some supply challenges in getting those launches activated. But like the easy foot [ph] launch, for example, or easy as we call it, sorry, it looks like a staple. Terrific product for procedures. But we stumbled a little bit in – just because of supply chain challenges in getting these new launches for MIS forefoot. Those launches will – I just mentioned one of those is EasyFuse. But there is about five of these products which we will start to see the impact of those in the second half of the year. So, I am feeling optimistic going forward, but the second quarter was a little bit choppy. Nothing that's overly concerning. Well, let me start with the product launches. When we do these new launches, we have sales forces that know how to kind of drive revenue. And these are products that do wear out and do need to be replaced. And so I am not expecting any slowdown whatsoever. If anything, you should see growth continue and then gradually increase. And sometimes, it's not the first year that you see the spike. You sort of see it, but you certainly see it by the second year. So, to me this is just a continuation of – it will continue a very, very good trend. Look, R&D has gone up and part of it's because of the mix of our businesses. If you think about neurovascular, it's a little more thirsty because of the clinicals that are required. We are launching a lot of new products. So, our spend has increased. And look, we were over 7% of sales, I think for the full year. I don't know that we will stay over 7% but we will be kind of in that neighborhood as a percentage of sales. I don't know that it goes a lot higher from here. I think that's a pretty healthy level of R&D. But look, that fuels our growth and growth doesn't come for free. So, you do have to invest in innovation if you want to continue to grow. But I think this is probably a good level. And we will kind of stay at this level unless our portfolio drastically changes. We are doing more in the world of digital. That does cost some money, make over pursuing different applications. That is a bit first for R&D. But I would say that this is a pretty good level. Yes. On the first question, I want to be really clear here that whenever we do launch new products, whatever price – we normally will raise the price. But you won't see that in the price line of our quarterly results. So, price the way we report price is like-for-like. So, as the System 9, if it comes in at a higher price for the first year, that will show up in mix and volume, it will not show up in the price line. So, in the second year, that like-for-like will start to show up. So, just to be clear about that, we always – ProCuity is a good example. The ProCuity price is higher than our beds. But in the first year of that launch, you don't see that showing up in the price line. It shows up in volume mix. So, I hope I am clear on that. But obviously, that's going to be part of our strategy. As we launch new products, we are going to be able to raise prices. As it relates to implants, early days yet. We have had a couple of early conversations and they have gone reasonably well. But it is way too early for me to be able to give you a sign of what is going to come in the future and we will have more to share on future calls. Yes. Thanks for the question. Certainly, we are focused on tuck-ins, not just given Vocera, but also Wright Medical. So, we did Wright Medical not so long ago. And then we did Vocera. As Glenn mentioned, we paid $450 million of debt down in the last quarter. So, right now, given our balance sheet situation, our focus is really on tuck-ins. All of our businesses are actively pursuing these kind of tuck-ins. But you should expect that that's kind of in our near-term, let's say, through the end of this year. Our focus will be much more on the tuck-ins. And obviously, valuations are down. That doesn't mean that the companies that have these lower valuations are excited to sell at these new values. I think it's going to take a little time for that to set in before we are going to see a lot of those companies want to sell. So, I don't think that we are going to miss a window, so to speak, just because we are focused on the tuck-ins. But we do need to digest the acquisitions. We do need to fortify our balance sheet, but we will continue to pursue tuck-ins. Hey Ryan, I will handle the pricing/inflation one first. I do think some of the normal things that you think about relative to the inflationary environment we are in and we are feeling will persist and will live on into next year. We see labor increases. We see increases in these commodities. I do think it will take a while before transportation and freight settles down to a more, what I will call normal cadence in terms of ocean freight versus air freight. And so I think that will take a while to settle out. And in fact, where we enter into conversations with our customers about sort of what our cost makeup looks like, and we are very frank with them. There are no surprises to them in terms of where we are seeing real increase in the real kind of raw materials and components that go into our products. And those are the kind of discussions that customers may not want to have, but they know and they expect it's coming. And so when we lead to go after price, we lead with details and with information so that they understand that underneath our pricing increase, we are feeling real increases in the components that go into our products. Great. Well, thank you all for joining our call, and thank you for all your questions. We look forward to sharing our third quarter results with you in October. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 6.1% in the quarter. The second quarter's average selling days were in line with 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4%. Foreign currency had a 3% unfavorable impact on sales. Despite a challenging comparable versus 2021, our organic sales growth has been solid and was led by double-digit performances in our Endoscopy and Instruments businesses as well as strong growth in our international businesses. Our sales growth has been somewhat constrained by the continued supply chain challenges and electronic component shortages, especially impacting the capital products in our MedSurg businesses, primarily in our medical business. Our capital order book continues to be very robust as demand from our customers continues to be strong. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 4.7%. International organic sales growth was 9.7%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, specifically emerging markets, Canada, Japan and Europe, somewhat offset by lingering COVID impacts in Australia and China. Our adjusted EPS of $2.25 in the quarter was in line with 2021 driven by our sales momentum and favorable adjusted tax rate offset by gross margin challenges and the impact of foreign currency exchange. Our second quarter EPS was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange of $0.05 versus 2021. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 10.6%, with organic sales growth of 7.9%, which included 7.2% of U.S. organic growth and 9.9% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.1%, led by double-digit growth in our orthopedic instruments and surgical technology businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was highlighted by double-digit growth in power tools, surge account, irrigation, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 15.4%, reflecting very strong performances across all of their portfolio, including video products and double-digit growth of our communications and sports medicine businesses. Medical, which includes our recently acquired Vocera business, had a U.S. organic sales decline of 2.4% driven by the aforementioned supply chain challenges primarily impacting our emergency care products. Medical sage and acute care businesses boosted double-digit organic growth. During the quarter, we also saw significant growth in orders for our beds and emergency care products driven by very strong customer demand. Our U.S. Neurovascular business posted an organic decline of 1.8% driven by a strong double-digit comparable in 2021 as well as competitive pressures, disruptions due to hospital staffing shortages and softer market conditions in part because of supply shortages of contrast use in procedures. The U.S. neurocranial business posted organic sales growth of 9.4%, which included solid growth in our ENT navigation, balloon dilation and neuro products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 9.9%, reflecting double-digit growth in the endoscopy, neurovascular and neurocranial businesses, somewhat offset by medical. Geographically, this included strong performances in Japan and emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 3.9% which included organic growth of 1.6% in the U.S. and 9.5% internationally. This reflects the impact of strong international growth and solid growth in our hip, knee and extremity businesses. Our U.S. hips business grew 4.5% organically reflecting strong primary hip growth reflected by the recent launch of our Insignia Hip Stem and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. knee business grew 5.3% organically, reflecting our market-leading position in robotic knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 3.1% organically against a significant comparable in 2021. This growth was led by double-digit growth in our upper extremities, somewhat offset by softness in the trauma market. Our U.S. Spine business declined 3.6% organically, reflecting a slightly slower scoliosis season, partially offset by solid performance in our enabling technology business. Our U.S. Other ortho declined organically by 13.8% primarily driven by the impact related to the aforementioned deal mix changes of Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 9.5% organically, which reflects the strong momentum in Europe as procedural volumes improve as well as strong performances in Japan, Canada and India somewhat offset by COVID-related volatility in Australia and Korea. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.3% was unfavorable, approximately 270 basis points from the second quarter of 2021. Compared to 2021, our gross margin was adversely impacted by the purchases of electronic components at premium prices on the spot market and other inflationary pressures, primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs as well as operational efficiencies due to component shortages. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout 2022. We expect Q3 gross margin to be similar to Q2. Q4 should see some improvement and the full year gross margin compared to 2021 will be negatively impacted by approximately 200 basis points. Adjusted R&D was 7.2% of sales, which represents a 60 basis point increase from 2021. This reflects our continued commitment to innovation funding and the related future growth that we will provide. Our adjusted SG&A was 32.4% of sales, which was 100 basis points lower than 2021. This reflects continued cost discipline, somewhat offset by the ramping of certain prioritized expenses and hiring that support future growth. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 23.7% of sales, which was approximately 220 basis points unfavorable to the second quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned inflationary impacts resulting in gross margin challenges and the net negative impact resulting from foreign currency. Adjusted other income and expense decreased from 2021 primarily resulting from an equity investment gain and favorable interest income. We anticipate a normalized run-rate of adjusted OI&E to be approximately $70 million per quarter for the remainder of 2022. Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.9%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, which is consistent with the ETR performance we experienced in 2021. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.4 billion. Approximately $450 million of debt was paid down in the quarter. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $732 million. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and continued focus on working capital management, partially offset by the impact of higher costs for certain electronic components and pre-buying certain other critical raw material inventory. Considering our second quarter results, the strong order book for capital equipment and the sales momentum in our implant businesses, we now expect full year 2022 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 9%. This performance assumes that the market environment experienced in Q2 continues to improve throughout the rest of the year with supply chain disruptions easing in the back half of the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year to be adversely impacted by approximately 2% to 3% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be adversely impacted by approximately $0.25 to $0.30 in the full year, which is included in our revised earnings guidance range. Based on our performance in the second quarter, including consideration of the continued supply chain challenges and the inflationary environment, together with our increased sales guidance and continued financial discipline, and most significantly, the anticipated future impact related to foreign currency, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.30 to $9.50. The low end of this guidance range assumes that the continued macroeconomic volatility persists, including procedural disruptions and worsening of the electronic component availability. We will continue to evaluate the changing environment and we will provide updates to our guidance as necessary. And now, I will open up the call for Q&A. Yes. Larry, that was quick with the model. A couple of things to keep in mind We are seeing really good performance in our operating expenses, especially SG&A. Single biggest driver in SG&A is really sort of hiring and how prudent are we being about our hiring and the related costs that come along with every time we add a new employee. So we've positioned ourselves pretty well relative to that halfway through the year here and feel confident that we will be able to drive sort of meaningful leverage within our SG&A. I mean that being said, we are also mindful that we need to invest in R&D to make sure that we can hit a lot of these key product launches that we're lined up for, for next year. And then honestly, too, if you move on down the rest of the P&L, I think I kind of gave you a little bit of guidance on OI&E. And we're also seeing favorable performance in our ETR, which helps at the bottom as well. Yes. I think a couple of things. First of all, this backlog of orders really gives us a lot of confidence that we have the sales in place to deliver on this increased sales guidance as a baseline. It also implies that we've spent a lot of money on the spot buys and electronic components and pre-buying other inventories so that we feel confident and comfortable that we actually have the right sort of supply and raw materials in place to deliver on these few rails. I mean that being said, we are mindful in being a good steward of the operating expenses and not letting that get away from us. I think that's prudent just given the current environment and given the environment that that we might be heading into. And so we haven't really taken our foot off of that pedal in terms of controlling that at all for the whole year. And so I don't expect that, that will change in the back half of the year. If you look at like sales force hiring, it almost universally occurs for the most part, in literally the first month of the year for every single division. They fill out their sales forces at that point in time. So I don't feel like there is a big gap that I'm staring down that can't really deliver on the sales growth. I think the name of the game is really going to be delivering for our customers these finished products based on what we have in our supply chain and what we currently have in inventories. And that's going to really drive that sales growth number. Okay, Matt. Without giving 2023 guidance, what I will say is the spot buy and the chip situation in the electronic component situation, we are seeing some easing of that. And we are seeing examples of where we are going to our regular suppliers and they are supplying us these components based on our negotiated contract pricing. So we're not necessarily having the only spot markets for everything. That being said, some of these other costs that are really driven by inflation and they are commodity oriented for metals, for plastics, for transportation, some of those, I think, are going to linger for a while for sure. And I would expect to see those bleed into next year, certainly the first half of next year. But I am hopeful that the spot by kind of premium things that we have experienced pretty severely in this quarter and in Q1, we will actually start to bag. Yes. I think – hi, Joanne, in terms of Q2, we did experience some of the pricing difficulties that you felt in the pricing number, the 1.4% negative that we disclosed. I will say that that's pretty consistent with the range that we feel in normal years. I do think that we have a very big focus with our sales teams on pricing and with our customers. And we actually saw positive pricing performance related to our U.S. MedSurg and Neurotechnology business, which is a good indicator that we are starting to enter these conversations with our customers. Our customers are doing their diligence. They understand that just with their staffing, with their nursing that prices are going up and that's impacting us, too. And so we are having the conversations. Although given the contracting nature of some of our business, it just takes time for some of these things to stick. And so I do think that we are beginning to really lay the groundwork to really impact pricing over the future well into next year. And so I'm confident that we're laying the processes in place now to make sure that we work with our customers to implement price increases. Yes. I think probably the single biggest thing was the spot buy and the premiums. I think as we entered into Q2 and exited Q1, we saw that, that was happening. But who could imagine the demand that was out there relative to us competing with car companies and a whole bunch of different kind of competitors that we never really had before with those vendors. And so, I would say that those premiums that we paid just so that we could make sure that we were serving our customers and could deliver them products were the single biggest thing that maybe changed from guidance last time to guidance this time. I think the other though persistent thing that we are seeing is just because the supply chain has been so spotty, we also are just – we are feeling inefficiencies in our processes and how we manage our manufacturing across the globe with sort of inconsistencies of when we will have raw materials available for teams to work on. So, I do say it's probably spot buys is the one big thing that really sticks out. But a lot of these little nits on inflation are also impacting us as well. Yes. Sure. I think as you look at sort of that basket of cost, the spot buy certainly are significant, maybe approaching half of that basket of costs. I mean that being said, keep in mind that as we made those spot buy purchases, the underlying inventory goes on the balance sheet. And then it bleeds out into our P&L over the utilization period. So, it's not something that goes away from us in the short-term. The other basket of costs, though, we do feel that inflation. We feel it in labor. We feel it in transportation. We are seeing it in commodities. And that's something that I am not necessarily expecting will necessarily go away for us over the longer term. Yes. On your question on Smoke Evac and sports medicine, first of all, Smoke Evac continues to be very high growth. There are six states that are mandating smoke-free ORs. There are seven other states that have legislation that's pending. And so you can see the momentum around smoke-free operating rooms is absolutely increasing. And we are in a great position and we had fantastic growth in smoke evacuation. That should continue. And then on Sports Med, this is about our company and we are now becoming – we are fast becoming a leader in sports medicine, which obviously wasn't the case a decade ago. First, we started off with our hip portfolio with the Pivot acquisition and some – and really becoming the leader in hip arthroscopy. We already had a decent knee offering. And shoulder had been our weakness, and we have really bolstered our shoulder portfolio. So, in all the key areas, we now have very compelling product opportunities. And when we are absolutely growing faster than the market and have been for the last couple of years. But I think the ASC shift has put an accelerator on our sports medicine business. And I think you know that sits within our Endoscopy division. But that business has a fabulous outlook for the future. I mentioned the in-space balloon for massive rotator cuff repair. The [indiscernible] product has just recently launched, which really addresses gaps that we had in the sort of smaller rotator cuff repair part of the sports medicine business. So, I am extremely bullish about sports medicine for the future. Yes. Without getting too granular about next year, the way these bleed out, it's not necessarily short-term in terms of how they bleed out. We worked pretty diligently to secure the kind of supply that was available when we could get it. And so that has a longer tail in terms of when we will feel the bleed out into our P&L. And that would apply to either side implants or the MedSurg businesses."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the procedural and geographic trends during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the integration progress of the Vocera business. Procedural volumes continued to recover throughout the second quarter in most countries. While we are seeing volumes recover, hospital staffing pressures have continued, impacting the ability to reduce procedural backlog in a meaningful way. These challenges will likely continue, meaning the tailwind of pent-up demand will be more moderate but last longer. Geographically, procedural volumes steadily improved during the quarter in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Procedural trends in parts of Asia and Australia have been more volatile due to ongoing COVID-related impacts. In addition to the continued procedural recovery, we had a strong quarter of Mako installations, up 19% versus 2021. However, as we are balancing customer purchasing preferences, the mix of these deals has resulted in less revenue per quarter. We are pleased with how the growing installation base continues to fuel market-leading implant growth. The order book remains strong for Mako and the percentage of implants using the robot continues to increase. We will update you on our installations and utilization metrics at the end of the year. Demand for our capital products remained very strong in the quarter. While we experienced solid customer order performance from our capital businesses, the sales growth was restricted because of ongoing headwinds, which included raw material shortages, primarily related to electronic components and installation delays in parts of our business due to hospital staffing challenges. The raw material shortages continue to be most impactful in our medical business, both within our acute care and emergency care business units. Based on our current supply outlook, we expect medical to have a strong second half. Now to our key integration activities. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of the Vocera integration. Since acquiring the company, we have seen double-digit growth in the first and second quarter versus the same periods in 2021. We are already starting to realize synergies and remain excited about the potential this product will create for both Stryker and the customers we serve. In summary, while the macroeconomic environment remains volatile, procedural volumes are improving and the underlying demand for our products remain strong, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive strong growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Glenn. Yes. Peter, it's Jason. So I'd say a couple of things. I mean we're not, for competitive reasons, going to get into the various tactics around pricing and those things. But I will say we see some shoots of confidence, if you will, in terms of customers willing to take price. And they understand the environment that we're working in, right? So it's going to look, to your point, very different depending on the business that we're talking to. On the implant side, you've got the contract cycles and some of those things. But then there is also the MedSurg side that has historically gotten price, right? And we continue to expect that we will as we move forward. Yes. Joanne, it's Jason. So at this point, we don't have anything further to announce. Obviously, as we get closer to launch timing, we will do that but nothing further at this point. Yes. It's Jason. I don't think at this point there is anything more to highlight. I mean obviously, we're early in the earnings cycle as well. So tough to tell how we compare the rest of market but I'd say nothing else to add at this point. Yes. Travis, it's Jason. Just really quickly on the pricing piece, and then I will hand it over to Glenn on the sports med. But relative to guiding on price, we are not going to guide on price for next year. And when we get closer to 2023 earnings season, you will hear more, but nothing to guide there. Ryan, it's Jason. In terms of the Mako question, I guess what I would say is in terms of the right mix, I think what's important here is we think about the different options. We are trying to be flexible with the customer to ultimately drive the installed base to then get to continue market-leading growth on the implant side, right. So, that's really what's important for us and less about kind of that mix as we think about finance, direct purchase, etcetera. So, we are excited where we are headed with Mako. As I said in my opening remarks of the 19% install increase year-on-year. And so I will just kind of leave it there as we are thinking about Mako."

This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC.  Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you. Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter as well as recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.  For the quarter, organic sales growth exceeded 9% with double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by Endoscopy, Instruments and Neurocranial. Our Orthopedics and Spine businesses delivered high single-digit growth, highlighting procedural recovery throughout the quarter. Internationally, we posted mid-single-digit organic growth, highlighted by double-digit organic growth in Europe and emerging markets.  During the quarter, we continue to have robust demand for our capital products. However, we had meaningful shipment delays as a result of ongoing product supply challenges, mostly affecting our large capital businesses.  For the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.97, reflecting growth compared to the first quarter of 2021 despite the ongoing impacts from inflationary pressures and significant premiums on inventory spot buys. We expect these supply chain pressures to persist throughout the year, although they will moderate with less reliance on spot buys in the second half of the year. In addition, we continue to invest in R&D at a healthy rate of 7.2% of sales, demonstrating our continued focus on our new product pipelines.  Despite the ongoing supply chain pressures and the continued COVID volatility in certain regions of the world, we remain confident in the outlook of our business, and we expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech. However, as previously mentioned, despite continued discipline with our spending, the pressure on our supply chain will impact our ability to deliver earnings leverage in 2022.  With one quarter behind us, a very strong order book and these macroeconomic dynamics, we now expect full year organic sales growth towards the high end of our guidance range of 6% to 8% and expect adjusted earnings per share at the lower end of our guidance range of $9.60 to $10 a share.  During the quarter, we also closed the acquisition of Vocera, and I'm excited about the highly complementary and innovative portfolio that Vocera brings to our Medical division. We believe that this deal will drive strong value creation in the years ahead.  Finally, I am pleased about our ongoing commitment to our talent and culture, which is reflected in the recognition of Stryker for the 12th year in a row as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. Over this time, our employee base has moved from 20,000 to 46,000, and I would like to thank our leaders for maintaining our positive culture as we have grown.  In addition, we also published our second annual comprehensive report during the quarter, which captures our environmental, social and governance strategy and details our commitments and disclosures on our 3 pillars of corporate responsibility: stronger people, healthier planet and good business.  Overall, I am pleased with our start to the year despite the challenging macroeconomic environment and believe we are well positioned for the future.  I will now turn the call over to Preston.\nPreston Wells: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the procedural and geographic trends during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the continued integration of Wright Medical and the initial integration progress of the Vocera business.  After being impacted in January by the Omicron variant, procedural volumes recovered sequentially throughout the quarter as COVID-related delays and restrictions eased. While we see -- while we're seeing volumes recover towards more normal levels, there continues to be some overhang from hospital staffing shortages, which is causing scheduling disruptions around the world. This improvement in procedural volumes is primarily impacting our implant-related businesses, including Hips, Knees, Spine and Extremities. In addition to the procedural recovery, our double-digit growth in Knees continues to benefit from the growing Mako install base. We also grew high single digits in Foot & Ankle, Upper Extremities and Hips, driven by continued new product penetration. Within our Hips business, the launch of the new Insignia Hip Stem, along with the Mako 4.1 software, which also incorporates Insignia into the Mako robotic platform, continues to proceed well and should be a tailwind to our Hips business throughout the year.  Geographically, procedures recovered during the quarter in the United States, Europe and Latin America, which resulted in strong double-digit growth in those regions. Procedural trends in Asia have been more volatile due to the ongoing COVID-related impacts. With Japan and Australia beginning to see improvements towards the end of the quarter, while other parts of the region saw COVID rates peak in March. In China, COVID-related impacts were more widely seen beginning in March, and we expect to see negative impact on procedural volumes in China during the second quarter as a result of strict lockdown restrictions across major cities in the country.  Demand for our capital products remained strong in the quarter, including double-digit growth in orders, which bolstered the strong order book for capital products that we carried over from 2021. As a reminder, our capital business makes up less than 25% of our total sales with under 10% coming from large capital items like beds, robotics, booms and lights, and the remainder coming from small capital products like power tools and cameras, which facilitate surgical procedures. The strong demand in the quarter is occurring across our portfolio, including our small capital products within Instruments, Endoscopy and Neurocranial that support the recovery of procedural volumes.  While we experienced solid growth from our capital businesses in the quarter, the growth was limited as a result of ongoing headwinds, including raw material shortages, primarily related to electronic components and installation delays because of hospital staffing challenges. The raw material shortages have had the largest impact in our medical business, both within our acute care and emergency care business units. These macro challenges will continue to be pronounced in the second quarter. We continue to partner closely with our customers to ensure we are meeting their more immediate and longer-term capital requirements.  Turning to our key integration activities. The integration of Vocera is in its early stages, and we are pleased with how the teams are working together to maximize the opportunity. On a pro forma basis, the Vocera business continued its strong double-digit momentum during the quarter. And finally, the Wright Medical integration continues to progress well across all regions, which is reflected in the double-digit growth of our U.S. Trauma & Extremities business during the quarter, which was led by excellent performances in both U.S. Foot & Ankle and U.S. Upper Extremities.  In summary, while the macro environment remains volatile, procedural volumes are improving and the underlying demand for our products remains strong, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive market-leading growth.  With that, I will turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the related drivers. Similar to last quarter, sales comments will be provided based on our new reporting structure. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.  Our organic sales growth was 9.2% in the quarter. The first quarter's average selling days were in line with Q1 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1%. Foreign currency had an unfavorable 1.8% impact on sales.  During the quarter, we saw a recovery of surgical procedures and accelerated sales momentum as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has eased in the U.S. and Europe. However, our sales growth has been constrained by continuing supply chain challenges and electronic component shortages, especially impacting the capital products in our MedSurg businesses and primarily our Medical business.  Our capital order book has continued to be very robust as demand from our customers has continued to be strong. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 10.5%, reflecting strong double-digit growth in many of our businesses. International organic sales showed growth of 6%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe and emerging markets, somewhat offset by lingering COVID impacts in Australia, Canada and China. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.97 increased 2.1%, reflecting sales growth, partially offset by a higher tax rate and gross margin inflationary pressures. Our first quarter EPS was negatively impacted from foreign currency by $0.02 versus 2021.  Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12.1%, with organic sales growth of 10.8%, which included 12.2% of U.S. organic growth.  Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 16.3%, led by strong growth in their orthopedic instruments and Surgical Technologies businesses, highlighted by growth in SurgiCount, waste management, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield products.  Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 17.7%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including video products and double-digit growth of their communications and Sports Medicine businesses.  The Medical business, which includes our recently acquired Vocera business, which closed in February, had U.S. organic sales growth of 6.2%, reflecting solid performances in their stage and acute care businesses, somewhat offset by the aforementioned supply chain challenges primarily impacting our emergency care products.  During the quarter, we also saw significant growth in orders for our acute care and emergency care businesses, driven by very strong demand. Assuming normalization of the customer environment and certain reduction of certain supply constraints, we expect these orders to contribute to another strong year for Medical in 2022.  Our U.S. Neurovascular business posted an organic decline of 1.4% versus a very strong comparable growth of approximately 20% in 2021. The U.S. Neurocranial business posted organic sales growth of 16.6%, which included solid growth in our max space, NSE drills and bioreabsorbable products.  Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 7%, reflecting double-digit growth in the Endoscopy and Neurovascular businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in China and Australia.  Orthopaedics & Spine had constant currency and organic sales growth of 7.2%, which included 8.2% of organic growth in the U.S. This reflects the impact of the ramp-up in surgical procedures during the quarter.  Our Hips business grew 8.5% organically in the U.S., reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by the launch of our Insignia Hip Stem and improved underlying market dynamics. Our Knee business grew 17.5% organically in the U.S., reflecting the previously mentioned strong recovery of procedures and our market-leading position in robotic knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma & Extremities business grew 10.6% organically, reflecting double-digit growth in Foot & Ankle, Upper Extremities and Biologics. Our U.S. Spine business grew 3.7% organically, led by the performance of our enabling technology products. Other ortho declined organically in the U.S. as the impact of hospital operational staffing challenges and lengthening purchasing cycles limited our ability to place Makos during the quarter. Comparatively, in Q1 2021, other ortho had growth of 49%. Assuming normalization of the customer environment, we expect another strong year for Mako in 2022.  Internationally, Orthopaedics & Spine grew 4.8% organically, which reflects the strong momentum in Europe as surgical procedures ramped up as well as a strong performance in Hips and Knees in Japan, somewhat offset by lingering COVID challenges in Australia, Canada and China.  Now I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.1% was unfavorable approximately 130 basis points from the first quarter of 2021. Compared to prior year, our gross margin was adversely impacted by purchases of electronic components at premium prices on the spot market and other inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, electronic components, steel and transportation costs as well as operational inefficiencies due to the aforementioned raw material shortages. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout 2022 and to be more pronounced in the first half of this year.  Adjusted R&D spending was 7.2% of sales, which represents a 35 basis point increase versus first quarter of 2021, and this reflects our continued commitment to innovation funding and the related future growth it will provide. Our SG&A was 35.1% of sales, which was 5 basis points lower compared to the first quarter of 2021. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by the ramping of certain expenses and hiring to support future growth.  In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 21.8% of sales, which is approximately 160 basis points unfavorable to the first quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by inflationary impacts resulting in gross margin challenges and other continued investments in innovation, somewhat offset by our sales momentum and cost discipline.  Other income and expense decreased as compared to the first quarter in 2021, primarily resulting from an equity investment gain as well as lower interest expense. Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.9%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 16%.  Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.9 billion, which includes the additional $1.5 billion of debt raised to fund the Vocera acquisition. During the quarter, our long-term credit rating at S&P was downgraded from A- to BBB+, and our long-term rating at Moody's was reaffirmed at Baa1.  Turning to cash flow. Our Q1 cash from operations was $203 million. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and continued focus on working capital management, partially offset by the impact of prebuying certain electronic component inventory and approximately $130 million of charges related to the stock compensation payments for the Vocera acquisition that are accounted for in operating cash flow.  Given the dynamic supply chain pressures, COVID uncertainty, strong order book for capital equipment and considering our first quarter results, we now expect full year 2022 organic sales growth towards the high end of our previously guided range of 6% to 8%. This performance assumes that the recovery environment experienced in Q1 continues to improve throughout the rest of the year with a normal procedure environment, returning during the second half of the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year to be adversely impacted by approximately 1.2%.  Adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be reversely impacted by approximately $0.10 to $0.15 in the full year, and this is included in our guidance range. Based on our performance in the first quarter and including consideration of the continued supply chain challenges, the inflationary environment and the anticipated impact related to foreign currency. We expect adjusted net earnings -- adjusted earnings per share towards the lower end of our previous guidance range of $9.60 to $10 per share. The low end of the guidance range assumes the continued macro environmental volatility persists, including inflationary pressures that could impact costs, particularly our cost of sales and includes more transient spot buying and longer-term supply chain challenges.  We will continue to evaluate the changing environment, and we'll provide updates to our guidance as necessary. And now I will open the call up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question we have comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Congrats on a strong [indiscernible]here. Maybe one on the capital environment, Kevin. There's been a lot of questions on the hospital capital budget cycle. Maybe talk about your order book, how it's perhaps different? And I couldn't help but observe the other line item, which includes Mako was down year-on-year. I understand it's a tough comp, was it just comps? Or anything to do with the capital cycle here?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Sure, Vijay. First, I'd tell you that hospital liquidity is still very strong. And as a result, our orders have actually grown in the quarter. We had a strong order book coming into the year, and we added to that very significantly with strong double-digit growth in orders in the first quarter.  And as we mentioned in our opening remarks, large capital has been disrupted partially because of shortages of primarily electronics, but also hospital's ability to actually receive the capital either because of short staffing or because some of their construction projects were delayed.  I'm not concerned about the shortage in other ortho for the first quarter. Our order book for Mako is very, very strong. We had a lot of delays in actually installations, and they're going to have a strong year overall. And certainly, we did have a big comp from the prior year. But the order book for Mako is very strong. The order book for all of our capital is very strong. You saw the actual sales results in Instruments, Endoscopy, Neurocranial.  The small capital, in fact, is -- we're able to largely meet those orders that were growing our challenges is meeting the orders of larger capital, primarily Medical, but also to a lesser degree to Mako. But overall, no concerns, strong demand for Mako and you saw the results in the Hip and Knee business that really benefits from the strong performance we had in Mako throughout the pandemic.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Kevin. And maybe one on guidance here. To one off of a really strong start here, 9% organic, guide 6% to 8% now looks like you guys are pointing towards the high end, is there perhaps some conservatism baked in when you look at the back half? Certainly, your comps are 7% average for the back half. If the recovery trends do persist, perhaps it seems like the top line is a little conservative, maybe walk us through the assumptions for the back half.\nKevin Lobo: Well, we're not going to give guidance by quarter, Vijay. But what I would tell you is the second quarter, we have very difficult comps. If you remember, the second quarter of last year was extremely strong. And yes, you're right that Q3 and Q4, the comps do get a lot easier.  I would say that we are still a little bit nervous about our ability to meet the demand for these orders and capital because of the supply chain pressure. So there is a little bit of conservatism based into that just because the environment is pretty uncertain. We do assume an improvement -- continued improvement in procedural volumes. If that continues to play out well, and certainly, there is the potential for us to do even better than what we've guided.  But based on what we know today, that we feel pretty good about sales at the high end of the original range given the strong start to the year and the strong order book.\nOperator: We now have the next question from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse.\nMatthew Miksic: Congrats on a really strong quarter. Kevin, I'll ask the question because I'm sure folks are wondering, and then I have 1 quick follow-up, if that's all right. But just to follow-up on Vijay's question about the robot trends, is this a -- would you say this is a -- these are challenges that all competitors across large capital robots and otherwise are having -- putting systems into hospitals at the moment? Or in other words, would you expect that these aren't things that are going to put you at a disadvantage competitively over the next several quarters? And I have just one quick follow-up.\nPreston Wells: Hey, Matt, it's Preston. You're right. It's something that we're seeing across the board. As Kevin said, it's really more of the macro elements around the ability for hospitals to be able to put the equipment in and get it installed that's driving it. And so that's something that everybody is facing heard that from several folks as well. So it's not something that puts us at a disadvantage at all. As Kevin mentioned, we feel very strong about where we're headed for Mako and what we're expecting to deliver for Mako this year.\nMatthew Miksic: Great. And then a follow-up on Hips, just to give us some perspective. It was a really nice bump up here on the back of these launches that you described. I'm just wondering if you could give us some sense of how confident we should be about that going forward? Or is there some trialing? Or there's a couple of quarters here that we should sort of need to digest the interest in the hips? Or do you really feel like you've turned the corner?\nPreston Wells: Yes. I would say that we certainly are very pleased with the initial launch of Insignia as we recently just launched at AAOS. So it's certainly an indication as we think about going forward and what we expect to drive from our Hips. So we're happy with the initial phases of the launch. We expect Insignia will continue to provide a tailwind along with Mako, along with the recovery of procedural volumes.\nOperator: We now have a question from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask on down the P&L, and you mentioned cost headwinds a couple of times during the presentation, and you were able to still hold the guidance range, albeit at the lower end. I was just hoping maybe you could walk us through sizing some of these impacts and the cadence as it flows into and out of the P&L as we start thinking about building second, third and fourth quarter?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Robbie, I would tell you that when we gave guidance back in January, we discussed pressure of 50 to 100 basis points on our gross margin. And I would tell you that, that is looking like it is trending to the upper end for the full year. And if I think about where we're going to feel most of that pronounced increase, it's probably Q1 and Q2 here with some easing in Q3 and Q4.  If you think about the types of costs, obviously, there are these spot buys where we're paying pretty exorbitant prices for chips and the related electronic components. But there are also increases in labor or supplier labor, warehouse and distribution costs are going up.  And then related to that, just because of supply shortages, we're also feeling a little bit of the inefficiencies that, that might be driving in our own manufacturing facilities. So all of those are obviously putting pressure on our gross margin.  Then the last thing I'll mention, and I know this has probably come up in other calls is just freight is another place where we're seeing real increases. And a lot of that is just because of the tight supply chain and even the tightness of our ability to deliver products to our customers, we're seeing a lot of overnight deliveries. We're seeing a lot more air freight when normally we would use a more economical mode for freight. So all of that is kind of compounding in terms of what we're implying as inflationary pressures.  I do see some of that easing up, but I would tell you for the longer term, these labor costs, these transportation costs are probably a little more permanent than some of the other costs as we think about it.  And then moving down the P&L, if you think about what we're spending in R&D, we just -- we're not backing off of that innovation spend. We really honestly think it's very important to keep that product pipeline going and keep it robust. Launches like our Insignia Hip, we're going to be able to fuel growth as long as we continue to fund that R&D.  On the -- further down in SG&A, we have tried to moderate some of the more discretionary SG&A costs. But the single biggest cost there is sales commissions. And as long as our sales force are out there selling, we're going to continue to pay them and pay them well because it's important to us. Beyond that, we have some moderation in other income and expense, and I gave you the guidance on tax. So I think we're trending pretty much in line with all of that.\nRobert Marcus: Great. I appreciate that. If I could sneak one quick follow-up in, we heard from Baxter this morning, they have a growing order book like you, and they're hoping to be able to shorten it and sell-through throughout 2022. Is that your expectation as well that the chip supply should improve, and you'll be able to clear a lot of the order book within 2022?\nPreston Wells: Yes, Robbie. I think that we certainly believe that we're going to work through that backlog. It's still early days as we're confronted with the supply challenges. And we're certainly working actively with those chip suppliers and trying to get through. And as Kevin mentioned, certainly, second quarter will be a little bit more disrupted than we think about the later part of the year. So we'll work through it throughout the year.  We're not -- as we think about our overall guidance and certainly getting to that upper end or exceeding that upper end, would be working all the way through the entirety of that backlog. So right now, what we're doing is really focused on just getting the supply and working through it for the remainder of the year.\nOperator: We now have Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Just -- I wanted to start with the inflation and pricing. So just how are you guys kind of managing the rising cost? And what's your ability to offset it? And where are you guys able to take price? It looks like price got a little better, if I'm looking at Q1 versus Q4, if I'm looking at that correctly. And I have 1 follow-up.\nPreston Wells: Yes, Larry, thanks for the question. So we're looking at it a few different ways. So obviously, we continue to focus on some of the internal projects that we had going with CTG 2.0 that are really looking at how we change our cost structure. But beyond that, we are looking at areas around price.  And just as a reminder, we do have some businesses that historically we've been able to gain some price in particularly on our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses. But as we look at all of our businesses in the future, as we have contracts that are coming up on our orthopedic side, we will be looking at whatever price actions that are appropriate at that point in time.  And along the MedSurg business, again, same thing, we'll be looking at price actions as appropriate going forward. So we are looking at that as a way to continue to help with the rise in inflation.\nLawrence Biegelsen: That's helpful. And then I know China is small for you guys, but a little more color on what you're seeing on the ground there from the lockdowns and your expectations for the VBP for Recon, which it seems like it's delayed to the second quarter? And then Trauma and Neurovascular, if there's anything on the horizon there?\nPreston Wells: Yes. So Larry, on China, as you mentioned, it is small. It's about 2% of our total business. And those products that are being currently impacted by VBP, so think about joint replacement, trauma and extremities, are less than half of that. And so we have that factored into our guidance. We've talked about that before. So we're expecting that to really play out this year from a trauma and joint replacement standpoint.  Neurovascular, it's early days. There are some activities happening at a province level. So we're still early in that process and don't really expect any major impacts there for 2022.  In terms of what we're seeing on the ground with regards to the COVID impacts, we're saying the same thing that everybody else is hearing. The strict lockdown policy is certainly having an impact on procedural volume. And we expect that to continue to play out in second quarter.  Where it goes from there, I think, is still to be determined. But we would expect probably easing as they go through this latest wave, look probably towards the back half in terms of procedural volumes.\nOperator: The next question is from Joanne Wuensch with Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch: I want to spend a little bit of time talking about Vocera, the closing of it and your expectations for growth in revenue in this fiscal year?\nPreston Wells: Yes, Joanne, thanks for the question on both. I mean as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's very early. I mean we just closed the deal in February. When we announced the deal, we talked about our general expectations in this marketplace where the market and the sales are growing in the teens. And so we would expect that to continue initially. But as we get it integrated into our businesses that we're going to be able to accelerate the growth of Vocera by being able to put it into more hands and more hospitals. So we do expect that we'll be accelerating throughout the year. But again, we're early, early days in terms of the integration.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Joanne, is so far so good in terms of retention. We were able to retain a lot of the employees that we had identified, frankly, all of the key employees have been retained. And the integration efforts, even though it's early, we had a very good month of March, no disruption whatsoever in the sales cycle.  So while it is early, so far, so good, and we're very bullish on the prospects. So Vocera having a very good year this year and obviously continuing into the future.\nJoanne Wuensch: But to put a little finer point on that, what is your expected impact on revenue and EPS? Because we have organic revenue, and we have an EPS range, and I would assume this is incorporated in your updated guidance.\nKevin Lobo: It is incorporated in our updated guidance. As we said from the beginning, we expect them to continue. And you'll see it in the inorganic numbers. Every quarter, you'll see where Vocera shows up, you will see very strong double-digit growth on the top line. And what we said on the bottom line is that it certainly -- there's a modest impact on the bottom line. So really, nothing really more to add there. We're going to fuel the growth. It will be a good year this year, and it will be accretive starting next year\nOperator: We now have Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank.\nPhilip Chickering: One more question on the inflationary pressures. Can you provide some color on what percent the products came freight versus raw materials versus labor? I'm just trying to understand how much of this pressure is sort of permanent like labor, let's stick around in 2023. You said that the prices are trending to the high end of 100 basis points you talked about last quarter. What do you assume that ends in the fourth quarter?\nPreston Wells: Yes. So Peter, we aren't going to provide that breakout in terms of the various parts of the business. I mean it does continue to fluctuate around depending on where some of the shortages are. Like Glenn said, if we have supply shortages, we are seeing increases in freight that's more mix based on airfreight and things like that.  So going to provide that breakout. Certainly, we do expect, as Glenn mentioned, there are going to be some portions of this that will be more permanent in nature and some of that will be more transient as we go through where it lands. I think we're still early. And certainly, as we think about our guidance that we laid out, we do expect it to have impact as we continue throughout the year, but certainly within the range of the guidance that we provided.\nPhilip Chickering: Okay. And then talking to you about the hospitals recently, they're talking about a lot of supply inflation that they're seeing. Just back there with the pricing question, do you guys think that you have the ability to pass on some price help off to some of these inflationary pressures? And kind of how should we think about price for different divisions or different geographies?\nPreston Wells: Yes. So I think the answer is yes. I mean we are evaluating that. We're looking at pricing actions across our businesses, and it will be different. It will be different based on the different types of businesses that we're in, the contracts that are in place and in different geographies for sure. So it's not going to be a one-size-fits-all as we think about this, it will be a very deliberate approach across our different business units and across our different geographies.\nPhilip Chickering: Let me just -- to quantify that, if a negative 1% price or in the first quarter, I think we end the year sort of flat? Or kind of how much price that we can get during the year?\nPreston Wells: Yes, not something that we're guiding on.\nOperator: We now have a question from Ryan Zimmerman of BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: I want to follow up on a couple of things. Glenn, on your comments on EPS guidance, you said that you continue to expect more transient spot buying and long-term supply challenges. I think that was pretty clear in your messaging. But as I think about companies like Hologic last night, who saw incremental headwinds on some of these electronic components more than they initially thought. I mean how derisked have you -- I mean at the low end of that 9 60, how comfortable are you that if this market gets worse for electronics that we wouldn't have to go lower? I mean, how much have you incorporated there, I guess?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. That's a tough question. I mean I think I don't have a crystal ball. What I do have is I can see what we have prebought in our inventory. I do have the input from our suppliers and how they are looking at that sort of chip availability.  And I also see the amount of activity that we have currently ongoing in terms of buying in that spot market. And I would tell you that Q2 is probably going to look pretty similar to Q1 in terms of that kind of pressure. But I am building up inventories and I'm building up component inventories. And so I expect it to ease a little bit as I look at Q3 and Q4. And I think right now, that's the best I can do in terms of sort of eyeballing in where I think the impact of that will be in the P&L and also in terms of where our guidance has come in.  I think we didn't lower our guidance from Q -- from January because we still saw a pathway to get within this guidance based on the activity we're seeing now.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay. I appreciate the color there. And then Kevin, I appreciate the comments about Neurovascular having a tough comp. But as we think about that market, particularly in the U.S., and the product profile today, how do you think about the long-term growth rate in the Neurovascular segment given kind of where we're at? And the performance we saw this quarter? And what gets you back to kind of that sustained long-term growth rate?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, I still think this is a fabulous market long term. There's just no question. It's a great market. We had a tough comp -- there also was a bit of competitive activity in the U.S. in the ischemic side of the business. We see this from time to time from quarter-to-quarter. So we certainly weren't expecting double-digit growth in the U.S. It was a little lower than we expected because of the competitive activity, but nothing too alarming.  And we will have a very strong year. We're going to have a double-digit growth year in neurovascular globally, and the U.S. will pick up in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So it's still a great market. We're only treating a small fraction of the patients that have stroke today. And for that reason, with the pipeline and the great leadership team that we have over there in Neurovascular, I know that this is going to be a very good long-term business.\nOperator: We now have David Saxon of Needham & Company.\nDavid Saxon: Just wanted to get a sense on if you're seeing backlog procedures come back? And if so, kind of where you're seeing those concentrated whether it's Hips or Knees or Spine?\nPreston Wells: Yes. Thanks for the question. So in terms of the backlog, as we've said in previous calls, the backlog has built up over really the last 24 months as many patients hadn't had procedures done. So certainly, we saw that the uptick with procedures being done this past quarter.  It's hard to say what portion of that was backlog versus new patients entering into the funnel. So there has to be some piece of that backlog that's been worked down. But really, for the full backlog to be worked through, it's going to take a sustained recovery. So we're thinking about many quarters of recovery and being back to normal that's going to get that backlog all the way down.  In terms of where it's coming from, it's really going to be across all of those products that are more deferrable. So Hips, Knees, Spine, some of the Extremities products that we would expect to see that coming from. But as we've said previously, really, it's going to take several quarters of sustained normal that will work that full backlog down.\nDavid Saxon: Okay. Great. And just on the U.S. spine 3.7% growth. Just wonder, how you think you did from a market share perspective? And what's driving your growth?\nPreston Wells: Yes, it's early in terms of the overall market growth assessment. But just like we look at Hips and Knees, we're pleased with the quarter. We're pleased with procedures recovering, certainly having an impact on Spine. We're happy with our product portfolio. And so we do expect that Spine will continue to benefit as procedures come back to more normal levels throughout the rest of the year.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt O'Brien of Piper Sandler.\nAndrew Stafford: This is Drew on for Matt. I just want to follow up on Vocera with maybe a little bit more of a high-level question. We're obviously translating -- transitioning from pandemic to a postpandemic environment, which will presumably result in the changes in some hostile environment have operated compared to the last couple of years. Is that changing how your customers are thinking about the value proposition or use case for Vocera at all?\nKevin Lobo: Well, I think the pressure that's being put on the health care system and particularly nurses was obviously very acute during the pandemic. And with the shortages that are out there right now, hospitals are looking for solutions that are going to help keep their nurses engaged, help ensure that their errors aren't being made in the hospital, improved workflow, so I think our timing is perfect and that Vocera should be able -- this is a tailwind that's not over. I think this tailwind will continue to last for the next couple of years because it does provide really a reduced cognitive load for nurses. It makes their jobs easier. They're much happier when we have Vocera in their hospitals.  So we're really excited. We think our timing is really ideal, and this is a multiyear tailwind.\nOperator: We now have Jason Wittes of Loop Capital.\nJason Wittes: Just on cash flows. Obviously, you're having some P&L impact from inflationary expenses. How is that impacting your cash flows? And generally speaking, what sort of cash flow generation should we anticipate for this year?  And I guess related to that, when do you think you get back to a point where we could see another Vocera-like-sized acquisition from Stryker?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I'll tell you what, I'll take the cash flow one, and I'll have Preston talk about the M&A one. So on cash flows, a couple of places. We're feeling the inflationary pressures that flow through with earnings first and foremost. And we'll see that all year long as those flow through all the way to cash flow.  I think the other thing that you can see is that because we're in a position where we're prebuying inventories and raw material inventories to make sure we have enough supply, we'll see increases in inventory that may be, under normal conditions, we wouldn't necessarily have.  In terms of where I think cash flows will land, I still think we're seeing really good performance in working capital. We're performing relative to guidance in terms of CapEx spending, and so those fundamentals are still in place. And I would still expect us to deliver sort of a 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion, excluding the Vocera impact related to that acquisition, the $130 million that related to a payout of -- related to the employees' acceleration of options in their stock. So aside from that, we'll still be in that 70% to 80% range.\nPreston Wells: Yes. So in terms of -- sorry, in terms of acquisition activities as we move forward, as we've said previously, following the Vocera deal, our first focus is going to be on pay down of the debt. And then we'll certainly continue to evaluate tuck-in opportunities along the way as well.  As we think about larger type deals like Vocera, it really is going to depend on a couple of things. I think, number one, the cash flow performance, as Glenn mentioned before. And then the second is really going to be about the opportunities. I mean we're not going to just do larger-sized deals just to do them. Certainly, it's going to be the right opportunities. I think, overall, just thinking about it, we still have the bandwidth to continue to operate in that space and complete those type tuck-ins and eventually get back to a Vocera-type-sized deal.\nMatthew Miksic: I appreciate that detail. If I could just maybe a clarification on Mako. Did I hear you earlier specify that there were still some staffing issues sort of impacting installations there? Or did I mishear that? Just curious about the dynamics right now for installing Mako systems.\nPreston Wells: No, that's correct. I think a lot of times when we talk about staffing, we immediately think about just the nursing staffing component, but staffing has been an impact at all different types of areas across the hospital. And so with a lot of our larger capital items, we've seen some delays in installations or even just in construction projects that have led to some of those delays in Mako was impacted by that during the quarter as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Drew Ranieri from Morgan Stanley.\nAndrew Ranieri: Just more of a product question, and then I had a follow-up. But you guys highlighted Q guidance and System 8 power tools kind of AAOS, I know that they were more limited launches here in 2022. But just given the macro factors here, supply chain disruptions. I mean, does that really stall what we could expect these products to deliver in 2023 with your spine growth or any pull-through there with enabling technologies or pricing benefits on the power tools?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I mean, at this point, I would say there's no -- we're obviously not giving guidance on 2023. But in terms of those products, still early Q guidance not is still in the approval process. So we still have a ways to go there. But in terms of the next power tools, also similar we're still early in terms of getting that out from a launch standpoint next year. So at this point, no update in terms of major impacts or expectations to what it might have on our numbers for next year.\nAndrew Ranieri: Okay. And then just with Insignia, I think it was also highlighted that instrument tray, it's more attuned for ASC usage. So is there anything that you're seeing with the recent launch that really shows that ASCs are being receptive? Or is just the general environment may be masking any uptake there of the new platform at ASCs?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So what I'd say is Insignia product is ideal for direct interior, which, of course, is very popular in the ASCs. But not just in the ASCs, also in the hospital. And even though we only launched it very recently, the feedback has been incredibly positive. And so we have a great design for the product. Surgeons are finding it terrific approaching the offsets, the sizes, the fit that it's really delivering on what we thought. So we couldn't be happier with the launch at least this initial phase of the launch. And this will be a tailwind for our Hip business, and it will actually pick up as more and more sets are deployed in the field, you'll see it actually accelerate through Q3, Q4 and into next year.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Joshua Jennings of Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: Just two, one on just the natural margin tailwind, Glenn, that you talked about earlier in the year, potentially driving some operating margin expansion at least by the fourth quarter. Can you just help maybe frame that up a little bit better? Just thinking about you're not guiding to upside to the 6% to 8% range, we're getting to the top but getting through that top end of the revenue guidance range. Just how impactful that natural margin tailwind from increased volume could be? Any quantification, it's probably hard, but would be helpful even directionally.  And then just was curious, Kevin and Preston on just the strong recovery in Knees and Hips versus Spine. I mean, Spine is recovering but not as quickly. And any thoughts on just why Spine market recovery or volume recovery is a little bit slower than Knees and Hips so far in 2022?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, Josh, I think I heard your question right, is what kind of op margin lift could we get out of sales performance that's above the 10%. So a couple of things. And anything that we delivered above the 10% would still have that kind of gross margin and inflation overhang. So we would feel that pressure. But you are correct that there's a natural operating expense leverage that incur that we incur when we sort of pierce through some of those larger double-digit growth items. So I expect that you would see delivery at the op margin level in excess of where you're seeing us now that the 22% roughly. So it would be accretive to that for sure.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. On your second question around the spine market versus hip and knee market, even if you go back to pre-pandemic, the hip and knee market was growing on a dollar basis was growing faster than the spine market. And the spine market did have some elements of the more acute procedures that were less deferrable. And so it didn't decline nearly as much as the hip and knee business did. So not as much of a decline. And then, therefore, not as much of a pickup in a market that, frankly, hasn't been historically growing quite as fast as Hips and Knees. So those are the dynamics, I think, that you're seeing play out here. We're delighted with our performance certainly in our -- if you look at our Knee business and Hips just this quarter, we were leading the market in Knees for a long time. Mako has been an enormous driver. Our cementless procedures are roughly 1 out of every 2 knees in the United States are going in cementless. So we have a real competitive advantage that you're seeing play out with our Knee number, but excited that our Hip number is now moving up as well. But I'm not surprised to see those growing faster than the Spine business. We'll have to see when everyone else reports how the markets played out. But to me, it's not that surprising.\nOperator: We now have a question from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink.\nDanielle Antalffy: Just a quick question on -- I'm not going to ask about inflationary pressures per se, but what I am going to ask is supply constraints that you saw if there's any way, I know there's a lot of balls in the air as far as trying to nail down the different impacts to the top line in the quarter between COVID and supply constraints things like that, but whether you can quantify, even just directionally, the impact from the supply constraints that you did see in the quarter? And then I have 1 follow-up on the backlog.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. No, nothing that we're going to specifically quantify with regard to that. I mean we still had pretty strong growth in our MedSurg businesses, which are -- where primarily our capital businesses are. But just know that there was impact in that -- those sales as a result.  As we mentioned, from an electronic component standpoint, primarily in the medical business as opposed to some of the others. But not something that we're going to quantify.\nDanielle Antalffy: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a commentary on the backlog. The question I have there is, if there's still backlog being worked down in such a meaningful way, is this impacting the referral chain at all? And I guess what I'm getting about is -- getting at is how this impacts sort of midterm growth, sort of once we're through the acute COVID period, I'm trying to think about hospital staffing issues and how all of these reconciles and what this means for really midterm growth less near term?\nGlenn Boehnlein: No. I think if I understand your question correctly, I mean I think the way we have to think about this is we've had 24 months of irregular activity with regards to these procedures. And so throughout that time period, we've seen that backlog, quite frankly, just grow. I mean the number of people that haven't had procedures done as a result, whether they're currently in the funnel, whether they've been deferred from the funnel. And then as we keep going forward, the part of what we're going to continue to see is we're going to see new patients entering that funnel. So I don't think there's going to be a slowdown at all. And that's why what we're saying with this backlog, it's not something you're going to see pronounced in any 1 particular quarter or a month, it's going to be something that's going to be a longer-term work down that we're going to see from people kind of funneling through the whole process. So I think you're going to just see that growth rate continue to just be pretty steady and growing.\nOperator: We now have the final question on the line from Richard Newitter of Truist.\nRichard Newitter: So just the first one, going back to some of the pricing commentary. I was wondering if you might be willing to comment a bit by tariff setting. The reason I ask, I was trying to think through some areas, perhaps where Stryker's better positioned to take price even than other med tech companies and your potential or your competitive advantage in the ASCs immediately came to mind. I'm just wondering if that's one of the areas where potentially, there might be the possibility of renegotiated contracts, in particular, are going to offer some opportunity there?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, given the inflationary environment, as Preston mentioned earlier, we are obviously going to look at pricing actions across our portfolio. In some places, it's going to be easier than other places given the nature of our contracts. But for competitive reasons, we're really not going to disclose the tactics, the strategies, which products. Every quarter, you see we do report our price, you'll get to see the overall impact, but it's not something we're really -- I'm going to get into on this call.\nRichard Newitter: Okay. Fair enough. And then just maybe one last one. I think you said you're steering towards the lower end of earnings guidance for earnings per share. And you said that this assumes that at the lower end, at least, assumes that supply chain pressures persist throughout the remainder of the year. But you also said that you expect some improvement as you move into 3Q and 4Q. I just want to make sure I'm reconciling those 2 comments appropriately.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think you're conceptualizing, right? I think what we're trying to communicate is, in the short term, how we saw inflation impacting us in Q1 will feel similar inflation in Q2. We expect the environment to improve, which also means that we also expect to start delivering more of the capital that's been in our order book in Q3 and Q4. Plus, we'll feel the impact of a lesser comparable for one on the top line. And we'll also feel the impact of that sort of back procedural backlog starting to free up, which from a mix standpoint also helps the bottom line.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. And I would like to hand the call back over to Kevin for some final remarks.\nKevin Lobo: So thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our second quarter results with you in July. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Lobo",
            "content": "Thank you. Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter as well as recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.  For the quarter, organic sales growth exceeded 9% with double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by Endoscopy, Instruments and Neurocranial. Our Orthopedics and Spine businesses delivered high single-digit growth, highlighting procedural recovery throughout the quarter. Internationally, we posted mid-single-digit organic growth, highlighted by double-digit organic growth in Europe and emerging markets.  During the quarter, we continue to have robust demand for our capital products. However, we had meaningful shipment delays as a result of ongoing product supply challenges, mostly affecting our large capital businesses.  For the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.97, reflecting growth compared to the first quarter of 2021 despite the ongoing impacts from inflationary pressures and significant premiums on inventory spot buys. We expect these supply chain pressures to persist throughout the year, although they will moderate with less reliance on spot buys in the second half of the year. In addition, we continue to invest in R&D at a healthy rate of 7.2% of sales, demonstrating our continued focus on our new product pipelines.  Despite the ongoing supply chain pressures and the continued COVID volatility in certain regions of the world, we remain confident in the outlook of our business, and we expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech. However, as previously mentioned, despite continued discipline with our spending, the pressure on our supply chain will impact our ability to deliver earnings leverage in 2022.  With one quarter behind us, a very strong order book and these macroeconomic dynamics, we now expect full year organic sales growth towards the high end of our guidance range of 6% to 8% and expect adjusted earnings per share at the lower end of our guidance range of $9.60 to $10 a share.  During the quarter, we also closed the acquisition of Vocera, and I'm excited about the highly complementary and innovative portfolio that Vocera brings to our Medical division. We believe that this deal will drive strong value creation in the years ahead.  Finally, I am pleased about our ongoing commitment to our talent and culture, which is reflected in the recognition of Stryker for the 12th year in a row as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. Over this time, our employee base has moved from 20,000 to 46,000, and I would like to thank our leaders for maintaining our positive culture as we have grown.  In addition, we also published our second annual comprehensive report during the quarter, which captures our environmental, social and governance strategy and details our commitments and disclosures on our 3 pillars of corporate responsibility: stronger people, healthier planet and good business.  Overall, I am pleased with our start to the year despite the challenging macroeconomic environment and believe we are well positioned for the future.  I will now turn the call over to Preston. Yes. Sure, Vijay. First, I'd tell you that hospital liquidity is still very strong. And as a result, our orders have actually grown in the quarter. We had a strong order book coming into the year, and we added to that very significantly with strong double-digit growth in orders in the first quarter.  And as we mentioned in our opening remarks, large capital has been disrupted partially because of shortages of primarily electronics, but also hospital's ability to actually receive the capital either because of short staffing or because some of their construction projects were delayed.  I'm not concerned about the shortage in other ortho for the first quarter. Our order book for Mako is very, very strong. We had a lot of delays in actually installations, and they're going to have a strong year overall. And certainly, we did have a big comp from the prior year. But the order book for Mako is very strong. The order book for all of our capital is very strong. You saw the actual sales results in Instruments, Endoscopy, Neurocranial.  The small capital, in fact, is -- we're able to largely meet those orders that were growing our challenges is meeting the orders of larger capital, primarily Medical, but also to a lesser degree to Mako. But overall, no concerns, strong demand for Mako and you saw the results in the Hip and Knee business that really benefits from the strong performance we had in Mako throughout the pandemic. Well, we're not going to give guidance by quarter, Vijay. But what I would tell you is the second quarter, we have very difficult comps. If you remember, the second quarter of last year was extremely strong. And yes, you're right that Q3 and Q4, the comps do get a lot easier.  I would say that we are still a little bit nervous about our ability to meet the demand for these orders and capital because of the supply chain pressure. So there is a little bit of conservatism based into that just because the environment is pretty uncertain. We do assume an improvement -- continued improvement in procedural volumes. If that continues to play out well, and certainly, there is the potential for us to do even better than what we've guided.  But based on what we know today, that we feel pretty good about sales at the high end of the original range given the strong start to the year and the strong order book. Yes. The only thing I'd add, Joanne, is so far so good in terms of retention. We were able to retain a lot of the employees that we had identified, frankly, all of the key employees have been retained. And the integration efforts, even though it's early, we had a very good month of March, no disruption whatsoever in the sales cycle.  So while it is early, so far, so good, and we're very bullish on the prospects. So Vocera having a very good year this year and obviously continuing into the future. It is incorporated in our updated guidance. As we said from the beginning, we expect them to continue. And you'll see it in the inorganic numbers. Every quarter, you'll see where Vocera shows up, you will see very strong double-digit growth on the top line. And what we said on the bottom line is that it certainly -- there's a modest impact on the bottom line. So really, nothing really more to add there. We're going to fuel the growth. It will be a good year this year, and it will be accretive starting next year Yes. That's a tough question. I mean I think I don't have a crystal ball. What I do have is I can see what we have prebought in our inventory. I do have the input from our suppliers and how they are looking at that sort of chip availability.  And I also see the amount of activity that we have currently ongoing in terms of buying in that spot market. And I would tell you that Q2 is probably going to look pretty similar to Q1 in terms of that kind of pressure. But I am building up inventories and I'm building up component inventories. And so I expect it to ease a little bit as I look at Q3 and Q4. And I think right now, that's the best I can do in terms of sort of eyeballing in where I think the impact of that will be in the P&L and also in terms of where our guidance has come in.  I think we didn't lower our guidance from Q -- from January because we still saw a pathway to get within this guidance based on the activity we're seeing now. Yes. Look, I still think this is a fabulous market long term. There's just no question. It's a great market. We had a tough comp -- there also was a bit of competitive activity in the U.S. in the ischemic side of the business. We see this from time to time from quarter-to-quarter. So we certainly weren't expecting double-digit growth in the U.S. It was a little lower than we expected because of the competitive activity, but nothing too alarming.  And we will have a very strong year. We're going to have a double-digit growth year in neurovascular globally, and the U.S. will pick up in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So it's still a great market. We're only treating a small fraction of the patients that have stroke today. And for that reason, with the pipeline and the great leadership team that we have over there in Neurovascular, I know that this is going to be a very good long-term business. Well, I think the pressure that's being put on the health care system and particularly nurses was obviously very acute during the pandemic. And with the shortages that are out there right now, hospitals are looking for solutions that are going to help keep their nurses engaged, help ensure that their errors aren't being made in the hospital, improved workflow, so I think our timing is perfect and that Vocera should be able -- this is a tailwind that's not over. I think this tailwind will continue to last for the next couple of years because it does provide really a reduced cognitive load for nurses. It makes their jobs easier. They're much happier when we have Vocera in their hospitals.  So we're really excited. We think our timing is really ideal, and this is a multiyear tailwind. Yes. I mean, at this point, I would say there's no -- we're obviously not giving guidance on 2023. But in terms of those products, still early Q guidance not is still in the approval process. So we still have a ways to go there. But in terms of the next power tools, also similar we're still early in terms of getting that out from a launch standpoint next year. So at this point, no update in terms of major impacts or expectations to what it might have on our numbers for next year. Yes. So what I'd say is Insignia product is ideal for direct interior, which, of course, is very popular in the ASCs. But not just in the ASCs, also in the hospital. And even though we only launched it very recently, the feedback has been incredibly positive. And so we have a great design for the product. Surgeons are finding it terrific approaching the offsets, the sizes, the fit that it's really delivering on what we thought. So we couldn't be happier with the launch at least this initial phase of the launch. And this will be a tailwind for our Hip business, and it will actually pick up as more and more sets are deployed in the field, you'll see it actually accelerate through Q3, Q4 and into next year. Yes. On your second question around the spine market versus hip and knee market, even if you go back to pre-pandemic, the hip and knee market was growing on a dollar basis was growing faster than the spine market. And the spine market did have some elements of the more acute procedures that were less deferrable. And so it didn't decline nearly as much as the hip and knee business did.

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the related drivers. Similar to last quarter, sales comments will be provided based on our new reporting structure. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.  Our organic sales growth was 9.2% in the quarter. The first quarter's average selling days were in line with Q1 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1%. Foreign currency had an unfavorable 1.8% impact on sales.  During the quarter, we saw a recovery of surgical procedures and accelerated sales momentum as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has eased in the U.S. and Europe. However, our sales growth has been constrained by continuing supply chain challenges and electronic component shortages, especially impacting the capital products in our MedSurg businesses and primarily our Medical business.  Our capital order book has continued to be very robust as demand from our customers has continued to be strong. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 10.5%, reflecting strong double-digit growth in many of our businesses. International organic sales showed growth of 6%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe and emerging markets, somewhat offset by lingering COVID impacts in Australia, Canada and China. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.97 increased 2.1%, reflecting sales growth, partially offset by a higher tax rate and gross margin inflationary pressures. Our first quarter EPS was negatively impacted from foreign currency by $0.02 versus 2021.  Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12.1%, with organic sales growth of 10.8%, which included 12.2% of U.S. organic growth.  Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 16.3%, led by strong growth in their orthopedic instruments and Surgical Technologies businesses, highlighted by growth in SurgiCount, waste management, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield products.  Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 17.7%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including video products and double-digit growth of their communications and Sports Medicine businesses.  The Medical business, which includes our recently acquired Vocera business, which closed in February, had U.S. organic sales growth of 6.2%, reflecting solid performances in their stage and acute care businesses, somewhat offset by the aforementioned supply chain challenges primarily impacting our emergency care products.  During the quarter, we also saw significant growth in orders for our acute care and emergency care businesses, driven by very strong demand. Assuming normalization of the customer environment and certain reduction of certain supply constraints, we expect these orders to contribute to another strong year for Medical in 2022.  Our U.S. Neurovascular business posted an organic decline of 1.4% versus a very strong comparable growth of approximately 20% in 2021. The U.S. Neurocranial business posted organic sales growth of 16.6%, which included solid growth in our max space, NSE drills and bioreabsorbable products.  Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 7%, reflecting double-digit growth in the Endoscopy and Neurovascular businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in China and Australia.  Orthopaedics & Spine had constant currency and organic sales growth of 7.2%, which included 8.2% of organic growth in the U.S. This reflects the impact of the ramp-up in surgical procedures during the quarter.  Our Hips business grew 8.5% organically in the U.S., reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by the launch of our Insignia Hip Stem and improved underlying market dynamics. Our Knee business grew 17.5% organically in the U.S., reflecting the previously mentioned strong recovery of procedures and our market-leading position in robotic knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma & Extremities business grew 10.6% organically, reflecting double-digit growth in Foot & Ankle, Upper Extremities and Biologics. Our U.S. Spine business grew 3.7% organically, led by the performance of our enabling technology products. Other ortho declined organically in the U.S. as the impact of hospital operational staffing challenges and lengthening purchasing cycles limited our ability to place Makos during the quarter. Comparatively, in Q1 2021, other ortho had growth of 49%. Assuming normalization of the customer environment, we expect another strong year for Mako in 2022.  Internationally, Orthopaedics & Spine grew 4.8% organically, which reflects the strong momentum in Europe as surgical procedures ramped up as well as a strong performance in Hips and Knees in Japan, somewhat offset by lingering COVID challenges in Australia, Canada and China.  Now I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.1% was unfavorable approximately 130 basis points from the first quarter of 2021. Compared to prior year, our gross margin was adversely impacted by purchases of electronic components at premium prices on the spot market and other inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, electronic components, steel and transportation costs as well as operational inefficiencies due to the aforementioned raw material shortages. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout 2022 and to be more pronounced in the first half of this year.  Adjusted R&D spending was 7.2% of sales, which represents a 35 basis point increase versus first quarter of 2021, and this reflects our continued commitment to innovation funding and the related future growth it will provide. Our SG&A was 35.1% of sales, which was 5 basis points lower compared to the first quarter of 2021. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by the ramping of certain expenses and hiring to support future growth.  In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 21.8% of sales, which is approximately 160 basis points unfavorable to the first quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by inflationary impacts resulting in gross margin challenges and other continued investments in innovation, somewhat offset by our sales momentum and cost discipline.  Other income and expense decreased as compared to the first quarter in 2021, primarily resulting from an equity investment gain as well as lower interest expense. Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.9%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 16%.  Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.9 billion, which includes the additional $1.5 billion of debt raised to fund the Vocera acquisition. During the quarter, our long-term credit rating at S&P was downgraded from A- to BBB+, and our long-term rating at Moody's was reaffirmed at Baa1.  Turning to cash flow. Our Q1 cash from operations was $203 million. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and continued focus on working capital management, partially offset by the impact of prebuying certain electronic component inventory and approximately $130 million of charges related to the stock compensation payments for the Vocera acquisition that are accounted for in operating cash flow.  Given the dynamic supply chain pressures, COVID uncertainty, strong order book for capital equipment and considering our first quarter results, we now expect full year 2022 organic sales growth towards the high end of our previously guided range of 6% to 8%. This performance assumes that the recovery environment experienced in Q1 continues to improve throughout the rest of the year with a normal procedure environment, returning during the second half of the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year to be adversely impacted by approximately 1.2%.  Adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be reversely impacted by approximately $0.10 to $0.15 in the full year, and this is included in our guidance range. Based on our performance in the first quarter and including consideration of the continued supply chain challenges, the inflationary environment and the anticipated impact related to foreign currency. We expect adjusted net earnings -- adjusted earnings per share towards the lower end of our previous guidance range of $9.60 to $10 per share. The low end of the guidance range assumes the continued macro environmental volatility persists, including inflationary pressures that could impact costs, particularly our cost of sales and includes more transient spot buying and longer-term supply chain challenges.  We will continue to evaluate the changing environment, and we'll provide updates to our guidance as necessary. And now I will open the call up for Q&A. Yes. Robbie, I would tell you that when we gave guidance back in January, we discussed pressure of 50 to 100 basis points on our gross margin. And I would tell you that, that is looking like it is trending to the upper end for the full year. And if I think about where we're going to feel most of that pronounced increase, it's probably Q1 and Q2 here with some easing in Q3 and Q4.  If you think about the types of costs, obviously, there are these spot buys where we're paying pretty exorbitant prices for chips and the related electronic components. But there are also increases in labor or supplier labor, warehouse and distribution costs are going up.  And then related to that, just because of supply shortages, we're also feeling a little bit of the inefficiencies that, that might be driving in our own manufacturing facilities. So all of those are obviously putting pressure on our gross margin.  Then the last thing I'll mention, and I know this has probably come up in other calls is just freight is another place where we're seeing real increases. And a lot of that is just because of the tight supply chain and even the tightness of our ability to deliver products to our customers, we're seeing a lot of overnight deliveries. We're seeing a lot more air freight when normally we would use a more economical mode for freight. So all of that is kind of compounding in terms of what we're implying as inflationary pressures.  I do see some of that easing up, but I would tell you for the longer term, these labor costs, these transportation costs are probably a little more permanent than some of the other costs as we think about it.  And then moving down the P&L, if you think about what we're spending in R&D, we just -- we're not backing off of that innovation spend. We really honestly think it's very important to keep that product pipeline going and keep it robust. Launches like our Insignia Hip, we're going to be able to fuel growth as long as we continue to fund that R&D.  On the -- further down in SG&A, we have tried to moderate some of the more discretionary SG&A costs. But the single biggest cost there is sales commissions. And as long as our sales force are out there selling, we're going to continue to pay them and pay them well because it's important to us. Beyond that, we have some moderation in other income and expense, and I gave you the guidance on tax. So I think we're trending pretty much in line with all of that. Yes. I'll tell you what, I'll take the cash flow one, and I'll have Preston talk about the M&A one. So on cash flows, a couple of places. We're feeling the inflationary pressures that flow through with earnings first and foremost. And we'll see that all year long as those flow through all the way to cash flow.  I think the other thing that you can see is that because we're in a position where we're prebuying inventories and raw material inventories to make sure we have enough supply, we'll see increases in inventory that may be, under normal conditions, we wouldn't necessarily have.  In terms of where I think cash flows will land, I still think we're seeing really good performance in working capital. We're performing relative to guidance in terms of CapEx spending, and so those fundamentals are still in place. And I would still expect us to deliver sort of a 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion, excluding the Vocera impact related to that acquisition, the $130 million that related to a payout of -- related to the employees' acceleration of options in their stock. So aside from that, we'll still be in that 70% to 80% range. Yes, Josh, I think I heard your question right, is what kind of op margin lift could we get out of sales performance that's above the 10%. So a couple of things. And anything that we delivered above the 10% would still have that kind of gross margin and inflation overhang. So we would feel that pressure. But you are correct that there's a natural operating expense leverage that incur that we incur when we sort of pierce through some of those larger double-digit growth items. So I expect that you would see delivery at the op margin level in excess of where you're seeing us now that the 22% roughly. So it would be accretive to that for sure. Yes. No, nothing that we're going to specifically quantify with regard to that. I mean we still had pretty strong growth in our MedSurg businesses, which are -- where primarily our capital businesses are. But just know that there was impact in that -- those sales as a result.  As we mentioned, from an electronic component standpoint, primarily in the medical business as opposed to some of the others. But not something that we're going to quantify. No. I think if I understand your question correctly, I mean I think the way we have to think about this is we've had 24 months of irregular activity with regards to these procedures. And so throughout that time period, we've seen that backlog, quite frankly, just grow. I mean the number of people that haven't had procedures done as a result, whether they're currently in the funnel, whether they've been deferred from the funnel. And then as we keep going forward, the part of what we're going to continue to see is we're going to see new patients entering that funnel. So I don't think there's going to be a slowdown at all. And that's why what we're saying with this backlog, it's not something you're going to see pronounced in any 1 particular quarter or a month, it's going to be something that's going to be a longer-term work down that we're going to see from people kind of funneling through the whole process. So I think you're going to just see that growth rate continue to just be pretty steady and growing. Yes. I think you're conceptualizing, right? I think what we're trying to communicate is, in the short term, how we saw inflation impacting us in Q1 will feel similar inflation in Q2. We expect the environment to improve, which also means that we also expect to start delivering more of the capital that's been in our order book in Q3 and Q4. Plus, we'll feel the impact of a lesser comparable for one on the top line. And we'll also feel the impact of that sort of back procedural backlog starting to free up, which from a mix standpoint also helps the bottom line."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the procedural and geographic trends during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the continued integration of Wright Medical and the initial integration progress of the Vocera business.  After being impacted in January by the Omicron variant, procedural volumes recovered sequentially throughout the quarter as COVID-related delays and restrictions eased. While we see -- while we're seeing volumes recover towards more normal levels, there continues to be some overhang from hospital staffing shortages, which is causing scheduling disruptions around the world. This improvement in procedural volumes is primarily impacting our implant-related businesses, including Hips, Knees, Spine and Extremities. In addition to the procedural recovery, our double-digit growth in Knees continues to benefit from the growing Mako install base. We also grew high single digits in Foot & Ankle, Upper Extremities and Hips, driven by continued new product penetration. Within our Hips business, the launch of the new Insignia Hip Stem, along with the Mako 4.1 software, which also incorporates Insignia into the Mako robotic platform, continues to proceed well and should be a tailwind to our Hips business throughout the year.  Geographically, procedures recovered during the quarter in the United States, Europe and Latin America, which resulted in strong double-digit growth in those regions. Procedural trends in Asia have been more volatile due to the ongoing COVID-related impacts. With Japan and Australia beginning to see improvements towards the end of the quarter, while other parts of the region saw COVID rates peak in March. In China, COVID-related impacts were more widely seen beginning in March, and we expect to see negative impact on procedural volumes in China during the second quarter as a result of strict lockdown restrictions across major cities in the country.  Demand for our capital products remained strong in the quarter, including double-digit growth in orders, which bolstered the strong order book for capital products that we carried over from 2021. As a reminder, our capital business makes up less than 25% of our total sales with under 10% coming from large capital items like beds, robotics, booms and lights, and the remainder coming from small capital products like power tools and cameras, which facilitate surgical procedures. The strong demand in the quarter is occurring across our portfolio, including our small capital products within Instruments, Endoscopy and Neurocranial that support the recovery of procedural volumes.  While we experienced solid growth from our capital businesses in the quarter, the growth was limited as a result of ongoing headwinds, including raw material shortages, primarily related to electronic components and installation delays because of hospital staffing challenges. The raw material shortages have had the largest impact in our medical business, both within our acute care and emergency care business units. These macro challenges will continue to be pronounced in the second quarter. We continue to partner closely with our customers to ensure we are meeting their more immediate and longer-term capital requirements.  Turning to our key integration activities. The integration of Vocera is in its early stages, and we are pleased with how the teams are working together to maximize the opportunity. On a pro forma basis, the Vocera business continued its strong double-digit momentum during the quarter. And finally, the Wright Medical integration continues to progress well across all regions, which is reflected in the double-digit growth of our U.S. Trauma & Extremities business during the quarter, which was led by excellent performances in both U.S. Foot & Ankle and U.S. Upper Extremities.  In summary, while the macro environment remains volatile, procedural volumes are improving and the underlying demand for our products remains strong, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive market-leading growth.  With that, I will turn the call over to Glenn. Hey, Matt, it's Preston. You're right. It's something that we're seeing across the board. As Kevin said, it's really more of the macro elements around the ability for hospitals to be able to put the equipment in and get it installed that's driving it. And so that's something that everybody is facing heard that from several folks as well. So it's not something that puts us at a disadvantage at all. As Kevin mentioned, we feel very strong about where we're headed for Mako and what we're expecting to deliver for Mako this year. Yes. I would say that we certainly are very pleased with the initial launch of Insignia as we recently just launched at AAOS. So it's certainly an indication as we think about going forward and what we expect to drive from our Hips. So we're happy with the initial phases of the launch. We expect Insignia will continue to provide a tailwind along with Mako, along with the recovery of procedural volumes. Yes, Robbie. I think that we certainly believe that we're going to work through that backlog. It's still early days as we're confronted with the supply challenges. And we're certainly working actively with those chip suppliers and trying to get through. And as Kevin mentioned, certainly, second quarter will be a little bit more disrupted than we think about the later part of the year. So we'll work through it throughout the year.  We're not -- as we think about our overall guidance and certainly getting to that upper end or exceeding that upper end, would be working all the way through the entirety of that backlog. So right now, what we're doing is really focused on just getting the supply and working through it for the remainder of the year. Yes, Larry, thanks for the question. So we're looking at it a few different ways. So obviously, we continue to focus on some of the internal projects that we had going with CTG 2.0 that are really looking at how we change our cost structure. But beyond that, we are looking at areas around price.  And just as a reminder, we do have some businesses that historically we've been able to gain some price in particularly on our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses. But as we look at all of our businesses in the future, as we have contracts that are coming up on our orthopedic side, we will be looking at whatever price actions that are appropriate at that point in time.  And along the MedSurg business, again, same thing, we'll be looking at price actions as appropriate going forward. So we are looking at that as a way to continue to help with the rise in inflation. Yes. So Larry, on China, as you mentioned, it is small. It's about 2% of our total business. And those products that are being currently impacted by VBP, so think about joint replacement, trauma and extremities, are less than half of that. And so we have that factored into our guidance. We've talked about that before. So we're expecting that to really play out this year from a trauma and joint replacement standpoint.  Neurovascular, it's early days. There are some activities happening at a province level. So we're still early in that process and don't really expect any major impacts there for 2022.  In terms of what we're seeing on the ground with regards to the COVID impacts, we're saying the same thing that everybody else is hearing. The strict lockdown policy is certainly having an impact on procedural volume. And we expect that to continue to play out in second quarter.  Where it goes from there, I think, is still to be determined. But we would expect probably easing as they go through this latest wave, look probably towards the back half in terms of procedural volumes. Yes, Joanne, thanks for the question on both. I mean as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's very early. I mean we just closed the deal in February. When we announced the deal, we talked about our general expectations in this marketplace where the market and the sales are growing in the teens. And so we would expect that to continue initially. But as we get it integrated into our businesses that we're going to be able to accelerate the growth of Vocera by being able to put it into more hands and more hospitals. So we do expect that we'll be accelerating throughout the year. But again, we're early, early days in terms of the integration. Yes. So Peter, we aren't going to provide that breakout in terms of the various parts of the business. I mean it does continue to fluctuate around depending on where some of the shortages are. Like Glenn said, if we have supply shortages, we are seeing increases in freight that's more mix based on airfreight and things like that.  So going to provide that breakout. Certainly, we do expect, as Glenn mentioned, there are going to be some portions of this that will be more permanent in nature and some of that will be more transient as we go through where it lands. I think we're still early. And certainly, as we think about our guidance that we laid out, we do expect it to have impact as we continue throughout the year, but certainly within the range of the guidance that we provided. Yes. So I think the answer is yes. I mean we are evaluating that. We're looking at pricing actions across our businesses, and it will be different. It will be different based on the different types of businesses that we're in, the contracts that are in place and in different geographies for sure. So it's not going to be a one-size-fits-all as we think about this, it will be a very deliberate approach across our different business units and across our different geographies. Yes, not something that we're guiding on. Yes. Thanks for the question. So in terms of the backlog, as we've said in previous calls, the backlog has built up over really the last 24 months as many patients hadn't had procedures done. So certainly, we saw that the uptick with procedures being done this past quarter.  It's hard to say what portion of that was backlog versus new patients entering into the funnel. So there has to be some piece of that backlog that's been worked down. But really, for the full backlog to be worked through, it's going to take a sustained recovery. So we're thinking about many quarters of recovery and being back to normal that's going to get that backlog all the way down.  In terms of where it's coming from, it's really going to be across all of those products that are more deferrable. So Hips, Knees, Spine, some of the Extremities products that we would expect to see that coming from. But as we've said previously, really, it's going to take several quarters of sustained normal that will work that full backlog down. Yes, it's early in terms of the overall market growth assessment. But just like we look at Hips and Knees, we're pleased with the quarter. We're pleased with procedures recovering, certainly having an impact on Spine. We're happy with our product portfolio. And so we do expect that Spine will continue to benefit as procedures come back to more normal levels throughout the rest of the year. Yes. So in terms of -- sorry, in terms of acquisition activities as we move forward, as we've said previously, following the Vocera deal, our first focus is going to be on pay down of the debt. And then we'll certainly continue to evaluate tuck-in opportunities along the way as well.  As we think about larger type deals like Vocera, it really is going to depend on a couple of things. I think, number one, the cash flow performance, as Glenn mentioned before. And then the second is really going to be about the opportunities. I mean we're not going to just do larger-sized deals just to do them. Certainly, it's going to be the right opportunities. I think, overall, just thinking about it, we still have the bandwidth to continue to operate in that space and complete those type tuck-ins and eventually get back to a Vocera-type-sized deal. No, that's correct. I think a lot of times when we talk about staffing, we immediately think about just the nursing staffing component, but staffing has been an impact at all different types of areas across the hospital. And so with a lot of our larger capital items, we've seen some delays in installations or even just in construction projects that have led to some of those delays in Mako was impacted by that during the quarter as well."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter, MAKO performance insights and updates on recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results and 2024 guidance before opening the call to Q&A. First, I want to recognize and celebrate our achievement of surpassing $20 billion in sales. We continue to be a high-growth company with a focus on our mission to deliver for our patients and customers. As we begin 2024, I am very excited about our future. We are in a strong position with robust demand across both procedures and capital, easing macro constraints and a strong pipeline of innovation. I want to thank our over 50,000 employees for their unrelenting determination, agility and performance. We've delivered terrific sales growth of over 11% in Q4 and the full year despite strong comparatives from the prior year. Our commercial execution, including many successful product introductions was excellent across our businesses and regions. Globally, for both Q4 and the full year, we had double-digit organic sales growth in instruments, endoscopy, medical, neuro cranial, hips, knees and trauma and extremities. For the full year, we also had double-digit organic sales growth both in the U.S. and internationally. Spine and neurovascular also demonstrated good performances while making notable advancements in future innovations and acquisitions. It was a comprehensive performance across our businesses, and we have built significant momentum entering 2024. For the sixth straight year, our international sales growth, excluding China VBP outpaced our strong U.S. business. Canada, Australia and most emerging markets had double-digit growth, while Europe and Japan grew in high single digits. International continues to be a large growth opportunity for us. Next, we delivered quarterly and full year adjusted EPS of $3.46 and $10.60, respectively, which represents 15% growth for Q4 and 13% growth compared to the full year of 2022. This was driven by our strong sales, but also demonstrates our continued operating margin recovery. We remain focused on driving high growth now and in the future through investments in organic innovation and M&A. We expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of medtech, which is reflected in our full year 2024 guidance of organic sales growth of 7.5% to 9%. This growth, combined with an accelerated margin expansion plan, translates to an adjusted EPS of $11.70 to $12 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Beach: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as MAKO, Vocera and our recently announced agreement to acquire SERF. During the quarter, we saw strong procedural demand. We continue to expect the ortho markets will remain strong in 2024, driven by continued adoption in robotic-assisted surgery, demographics, a more favorable pricing environment and healthy patient activity levels with surgeons. While supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe, our supply is stable overall and gradually improving. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained very robust in the quarter with double-digit organic growth in medical, instruments and endoscopy. Hospital CapEx budgets remain healthy, and our capital order book remains elevated as we enter 2024. Next, specific to MAKO, we had a record quarter of installations globally. The progress of our MAKO offense, including our recent direct-to-consumer campaign, has resulted in strong growth of our installed base alongside continued increases in utilization. In the U.S., we saw 60% of knees and 34% of hips performed using MAKO as we exited the year. Globally, we exited the year with just over 40% of knees and nearing 20% of hips performed using MAKO. We have momentum, and a significant opportunity remains as MAKO adoption increases. We are nearing the two-year anniversary of our Vocera acquisition and remain very excited about the acquired assets, as it provides a platform for us to be at the intersection of medical devices, software and clinical support. With integration activities now complete, which included a migration towards the cloud as well as the commercial reorganization, we are pleased with the accelerating double-digit sales and order growth achieved as we exited the year. In 2023, we saw many cross-sell wins, including new bed business leveraging Vocera. Also, we completed the seamless experience created between the Vocera platform and both ProCuity and our new wireless structure. This year and beyond will bring even more integrations and enhancements with a focus on scalability, user experience, automated workflow and documentation. We expect strong double-digit annual sales growth to continue for years to come, and we are excited to have Vocera as part of the Stryker family. Lastly, we are progressing with our recently announced agreement to acquire SERF, and we expect the deal will close this quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.4% in the quarter, compared to 13.2% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter of 2023 has the same number of selling days as 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.7%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.3% favorable impact on sales in the quarter. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 12.7%. International organic sales growth was 7.7%, against a very strong comparable of over 18% in 2022. This performance included positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Canada, Japan and most emerging markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 11.5%, with U.S. organic sales growth of 11.7% and international organic sales growth of 10.9%. Excluding the impact of China VBP, international growth was 12.8%. The impact for pricing in the year was favorable 0.6%. Foreign currency had a 0.5% unfavorable impact, and 2023 as the same number of selling days as 2022. Our adjusted EPS of $3.46 in the quarter was up 15.3% from 2022, driven by higher sales and operating margin expansion, as well as lower other income and expenses. Foreign currency exchange translation had a favorable impact of $0.02. Our full year adjusted EPS was $10.60, which represents growth of 13.5% from full year 2022, reflecting the favorable impact of sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.10. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12% and organic sales growth of 11.8%, which included 13.8% of U.S. organic growth and 5.7% of international growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.5%, with strong double-digit growth across its Surgical Technology and Orthopedic Instruments businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, SteriShield, smoke evacuation and surg account. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 17.9%, with double-digit growth in its Communications, Endo, BEU and Sports Medicine businesses. From a product perspective, this includes strong growth in booms, lights and video. During the quarter, the Endoscopy business continued to see very strong momentum of the 1788 camera system, which had its full launch in September. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.9%, led by performances in its Vocera, Acute Care and Sage businesses. This included strong growth in Vocera badges, beds, stretchers and Prevalon repositioning products. All of this was against a very strong comparable growth of over 20% in 2022. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 7.6%, reflecting solid performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neurocranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 14%, which included double-digit growth in the neurosurgical and ENT businesses, with strong growth in high-speed drill and balloon dilation products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 5.7%, reflecting double-digit growth in our instruments and neurocranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Australia, Canada and Japan. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency and organic sales growth of 10.7%, which included organic growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and 10.1% internationally. Our U.S. Knee business grew 12.9% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Hip business also grew 12.9% organically, reflecting solid primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 12.1% organically, with strong performances across all of its businesses, including Upper Extremities, Biologics, Core Trauma, and Foot and Ankle. Our U.S. Spine business grew 6%, led by the performance in our Enabling Technology and Interventional Spine businesses. Internationally, Orthopedics and Spine grew 10.1% organically, including strong performances in Canada and most emerging markets, particularly driven by Mako and strong Knee performance across most geographies. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.9% was favorably – was favorable approximately 120 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily driven by the continued easing of certain cost pressures, including the elimination of spot buy purchases that we experienced in 2022, and the continued benefit of pricing initiatives. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.6% of sales, which was 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. Our adjusted SG&A was 31% of sales, which was 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022 due to continued investments, including sales growth incentives and a more normalized cadence of travel and meetings. In summary, for the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 27.2% of sales, which was approximately 60 basis points favorable to the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, our adjusted operating margin was 24.2% of sales, a 40 basis points increase over 2022. This performance is mainly driven by the easing of certain gross margin cost pressures throughout the second half of the year as well as the positive impact of our pricing actions. Adjusted other income and expense of $31 million for the quarter was $23 million lower than 2022, mainly driven by higher interest income and other favorable discrete items. For 2024, we expect our full year other income and expense to be approximately $250 million. Our fourth quarter and full year had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.6% and 14.1%, respectively, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2024, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13 billion. During the year, we paid down the remaining $850 million outstanding on the $1.5 billion term loan associated with the Vocera acquisition and achieved our deleveraging commitments. In Q4, we also refinanced certain debt maturities, including prefunding of $600 million that is due in May 2024. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was $3.7 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections. For 2024, we anticipate that capital spending will be $650 million to $700 million. We do not anticipate any share buybacks. And now I will provide 2024 full year sales and earnings guidance. Based on our momentum from 2023, strong procedural volumes, healthy demand for capital products and a stabilizing macroeconomic environment, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 9% for 2024. There is one additional selling day in 2024 compared to 2023, with one less day in Q1 and one more day in both Q3 and Q4. Based on the steady progress of our pricing actions, we would expect the full year impact of price to be roughly flat. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be modestly, unfavorably impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year. EPS will be negatively impacted $0.05 to $0.10. This is included in our guidance. Finally, for the full year 2024, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.70 to $12, representing our commitment to accelerated operating margin expansion in 2024 as well as the stabilized – stabilizing operating environment. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we do expect seasonality for sales and related earnings to be similar to 2023, but adjusted for the quarterly differences in 2024 selling days. And now I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: At this time we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Okay. Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks and congrats on another fantastic quarter. Kevin, maybe to start, I feel like it's a bit of déjà vu, where we were sitting here at exactly this time last year and investors were starting to worry after a good year in 2022. And how good can 2023 be, and now people are wondering about 2024. So I was hoping you could give a little color behind the 7.5% to 9% organic sales growth. How much of that is transitory? How much of that is durable pricing? And any key drivers you could point us to? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. It certainly was a terrific year in 2023. We had 9.7% organic the year before and over 11% organic in 2023. And frankly, we feel very good going into 2024. At some point, you think the comps will start to catch up a little bit. And so we think 7.5% to 9% is a strong guide. I can tell that coming off all of the domestic sales meetings, there is tremendous energy and excitement among our teams. The procedure volumes are strong. The capital markets are very strong. Hospitals are spending. We have we exited the year with more backlog than we began the year, which means, obviously, our orders are continuing to be strong for capital equipment. So we – and we have a number of new launches, again, planned in 2024. Obviously, 2023 was a great year of capitalizing on product launches, whether it's System 9, whether it was Neptune S, whether it was the 1788. We have other launches coming again. So our pipeline of innovation is very strong. And so I expect us to continue to grow at the high end of MedTech, in a MedTech market that is quite healthy.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Maybe, Glenn, a follow-up for you. And I appreciate you don't guide quarterly, but there's a lot you could do to help us get models in the right spot based on what you can say. And I guess, really the question is, my math is implying 50 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. You talked about the top line should look like 2023. And I imagine that looks like a normal comparable quarter and first quarter and maybe some sharper seasonality than historically down 3Q up 4Q. Also, anything down the P&L operating margin that we should be considering in that seasonality? Thanks.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think, Robbie – and I tried to sort of lay this out at the end of my guidance there, but I think a good place to start would be to look at sort of the cadence of sales and earnings in 2023. And really just adjust out for one selling day in Q1 and then adding two on the back end. And so as you look at pay Stryker, how are you going to deliver op margin expansion throughout the year, it's probably a little more back half loaded just based on the cadence that we'll see through the year for sales and related op income.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the question. And I'll echo Robbie's congratulations on a really strong year and finish to the year. Kevin, I'd love to hear your updated thoughts on M&A headed into 2024. Your focus has been on paying down debt in 2023. Is your focus in 2024 on smaller deals? Are you open to considering something larger? And is the target area is the same as the ones you shared at the orthopedic meeting last year? And I had one follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Larry. I would say that we're back on M&A offense now, what I'll call our normal M&A offense. And as you've seen in the past with Stryker that would typically mean larger volume of tuck-in deals. And those can be large, and they can also be small. During the pause, while we paid down debt, all of our BD teams worked very actively. Believe me, they have a long list of targets, and we are going to be active now that we've gotten our leverage back to where we'd like to be. So let's say we're back to the normal Stryker offense. Expect us to be doing deals. We are open to larger deals. But our history would tell you that the vast majority of our deals are going to be smaller tuck-ins, but we can do many deals versus being very limited last year.\nLawrence Biegelsen: That's helpful. And Glenn, to follow up on Robbie's question on the margins. First, is it coming – the margin expansion coming – how much is coming from gross margin versus operating margin? And are you committed still to the 200 basis points getting back to the pre-COVID margin by 2025? I mean, it actually – I don't know if the math – not to get too much into it, but it looks like – I thought it looks like over 100 basis points implied in the guidance this year. So I assume we can all figure that out off-line, but just any color on gross versus operating margin and the 200 basis points for the two-year, sprinting back to pre-COVID margins would be helpful. Thanks.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, Larry, I think, first of all, we're not backing off of our sprint to 2019 op margin at all. And we have clearly had a plan to get there by the end of 2025. As I said at Analyst Day, we have good opportunities in operating expenses and in gross margin. I think if you look at our delivery in 2023, we got about 80 basis points out of gross margin and we invested in some operating expenses that we had indicated would get back to sort of normalized spend. So my thoughts on 2024 is that expansion will generally be led by operating expenses, but there continues to be really good opportunities in gross margins that we continue to work on. And if you think about some of these things, price isn't going away from us. We're still going to continue to work on that. Viju elaborated on the benefit we have of low-cost manufacturing sites, and we'll continue to see expansion there. We have opportunities in purchasing and procurement, supplier consolidation. On the OpEx side, we'll continue to expand into shared services in some of these low-cost areas where we have those. And then honestly, from OpEx, we have a lot of natural leverage. It just comes when you're growing at the rate that we're growing.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRyan Zimmerman: Yes, thanks for taking the question. So I want to ask about orthopedics. It's just been stellar performance. And we've heard from you and one of your peers. And Kevin, I just would appreciate if you can kind of characterize the confidence that this continues to persist for 2024. And how are you improving or what are you doing to improve potentially productivity on the Mako unit to capture demand that's continuing to be so strong?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks. We're delighted with the progress that we've made. 60% of U.S. Knees being done on the robot is pretty remarkable given how long ago we launched the Total Knee application and SNFs starting to really climb since we launched the 4.0 software has been terrific. Cementless continues to climb as well. And that tends to index much higher with the use of Mako. And as you know, we are clearly the leader in not just in robotic-assisted surgery, but clearly the leader in Cementless as well. So a lot of good things going on with a market that is obviously a little better than it has been historically. But Mako continues to be the engine of growth, and that's true in the hospital. That's true in the ASPs as well. And we're seeing continued growth in the ASP, where our Stryker offense is really winning at a pretty spectacular rates as it relates to new builds and big renovations. So we have a lot of momentum across all of those dimensions, which translates to terrific performance as you saw with hips and knees. But the other part of our story is trauma extremities. So the right medical acquisition has been a complete home run of a deal. And you’re seeing that not only has it been great for our extremities business, but it enabled us to focus a lot more on our core trauma business. And we really had all of our businesses in trauma extremities humming as we exited the year. And some great product launches towards the end of the year and some more to come in 2024.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay. And then maybe turning to medical because it is now, I think the biggest unit inside the company and the comps are increasingly tougher in the first half of this year. It’s been exemplary growth through late 2022, and then in the first half 2023, inside of that, you talked about Vocera continuing to be a double-digit grower, but if you can level set us on the entire portfolio, how you think about the ability of that business to continue to be accretive to overall growth and maybe what the appropriate expectations are around the medical segment given how much is in that segment.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, we love our medical business. And frankly, it’s become a big and very fast growing business. We continue to expect it to grow above Stryker’s average growth rate. That is going to be true for the next five years. From quarter-to-quarter, it does bounce around a little bit because, of course, there’s capital, a lot of large capital within medical. But you also have increasingly more stable revenue with Sage, which is doing spectacularly well. Then you’ve got, obviously, the AED demand, which has exploded. And we have a terrific AED business, tremendous innovation, we launched the Xpedition stair chair in the early part of the year, the first powered stair chair, which the firehouses absolutely love. And then you’ve got a lot of new demand for the wireless connection, wireless stretchers. So just tremendous innovation, tremendous leadership position, and now a much more diverse set of businesses than we had historically. So I think medical is the business. And Stryker that’s the most underestimated because AEDs are high growth, our powered cots are high growth, and now our bed business is doing really well behind ProCuity. And then you have Vocera in addition to that. So really, I would expect high growth from all of those different businesses. Sage, Vocera, beds, stretchers, AEDs because of innovation that we’re constantly innovating. And we have a couple of big launches in medical coming this year as well. So it’s an exciting time to be at medical. And we also have an outstanding leadership team. They’ve really focused on talent for years and years and years. And so I’m very bullish on medical. And I think again, whatever people have in their models, we’ve tended to beat medical and people back for the last six years.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good evening, and thank you for taking the questions and very nice end to the year. I’m curious about where you are in your super cycle, and not to use sports analogy, but are you halfway through halftime or you have a couple more innings to go? I know I’m mixing. My metaphors there and also sort of similarly AAOS, what should we be expecting for that? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I’ll take the first part and then Jason can talk about AAOS. Look, that, that I would say that our pipeline of innovation is incredibly strong. When I mentioned the term super cycle, that really was referring to, let’s call them big platform launches. But the reality is we’re driving tremendous growth even in some of the divisions that don’t have big platform growth launches, if you think about upper extremities, if you think about foot and ankle, but I would say the big ones coming up, we have this Pangea launch within our core trauma business, which is a big platform launch.\nQ: So those are the ones I’d point out too. But I – what I tell you is every business has launches planned and some of them, you accumulate a number of small launches and you end up driving pretty terrific growth. But I would say maybe we’re kind of midway through the large platforms. But I would tell you everyone’s reloading. So we launched 1788 and they’re reloading and already working on 1888.\nM&A :\nJason Beach: Yes, Joanne, it’s Jason. Happy to follow-up after the call as well. But AAOS will be exciting. Some of the products that Kevin just referred to we will be demoing at AAOS starting with Blueprint, followed by Pangea, 1788 camera will also be demoed as well, so it’ll be action packed. So we’ll plan on seeing you out there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, congrats on a really strong print here. I had two questions, maybe first one on the guidance here. 7.5% to 9% for the fiscal 2024. What is being assumed for China VBP? Any backlog contribution? And I’m looking at Q1 that’s the toughest comp of the year. Should Q1 still be within that annual guidance range of 7.5% to 9%?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Hi, Vijay. As we look at – I don’t want to guide quarterly, but I would tell you that the cadence of what we’re going to deliver from the mid-point will play out similar to 2023. But keep in mind, you got to back out one selling day in Q1 is what I would say and then on VBP, I’ll let Jason.\nJason Beach: Yes, Vijay. It’s Jason. On VBP, I think we don’t disclose in terms of the impact there. So we won’t. But in terms of a follow-up to your capital question, as we think about the capital environment, really the tone has not changed there. We feel really good. Orders are very healthy. I mentioned that we came into the year with an elevated level, so we feel good. And just as a reminder, right, if you think about our capital sales, so our smaller capital being, call it 15% of our sales needs to continue to be refreshed as you think about kind of the procedural volume and then large capital being 10% of our sales, again very healthy from both an order and backlog perspective. So we feel good about that in 2024.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And Kevin, maybe one for you on that. I saw you mentioned direct-to-consumer campaign on MAKO is very successful. Could you just elaborate on that? And I’m curious, do you think, like, on the Spine side, we could perhaps see adoption rates similar to knee, where 50%, 60% of Spine procedures could be done in MAKO at some point in the future?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Well, first, the direct-to-consumer has been terrific. I mean, obviously, we have such a lead in robotics as a surgery. We want to make sure that we’re differentiating our product among the rest of products and the searches and the impressions that we have exceeded our expectations. We’re really pleased we’re going to continue that program for a good portion of this year. And so that’s certainly helped create a tremendous interest among consumers as well as hospitals, who actually watch the same ads as consumers. So we’re very excited about that. Spine, we couldn’t be more happy, because certainly that’s been a gap in our portfolio relative to others. And this has got terrific workflow. And look, I think robotic adoption tends to really grow. No matter what procedure you’re doing, if you have a good solution, it will over time become the majority and eventually standard of care. And we’ve obviously seen this in the general surgery world as it relates to prostate and starting to happen in other cases. And I think it’s going to happen in orthopedics. So Spine might take a little longer, but I absolutely do believe it’s going to be key for us in the future. We’re extremely excited. We’ve been showing surgeons the MAKO spine getting terrific feedback on the workflow and the speed and the efficiency. And again, that’s within the same ecosystem as the Q Guidance. So we’ve been selling a lot of Q Guidance software, which is used to navigate those procedures. And that same camera, which is the fastest camera on the market, will be compatible with MAKO when we launch it. So I do believe it’ll become for pedicle screw placement, at least the vast majority of the procedures in the future.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shagun Singh with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nShagun Singh: Great, thank you so much. Kevin, I was hoping to get your thoughts on utilization, it’s been a key topic this last week across some healthcare sectors. What trends are you seeing in healthcare utilization across different care settings? What is driving it and how do you think about the sustainability of it? Is it being driven by the aging demographics? Is it innovation? Is it just low market penetration? And I think you did indicate that there is still a backlog and it is contributing, but is it a meaningful contributor to growth on a year-over-year basis? And then I have a follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Well, I think if you look at the hospitals and what they’re saying, that’s kind of one of the indicators we look at. They’re busy, right? The hospitals are busy, patients, definitely aging demographics plays for Stryker’s portfolio that definitely plays to our advantage. And every day, 10,000 more people are turning 65. The activity levels are also increasing, right. The advent of Pickleball has been a terrific thing for our business. More active people who are elderly tend to want to stay active. And activity levels are kind of the biggest predictor of needing joint replacements and sports medicine procedures. So we’re seeing very good activity levels. And so I don’t really want to talk about backlog. I just think what we’re seeing is patients presenting, frankly, some patients who are just wanting to be more active, losing weight and then wanting to be more active and then being eligible for surgery. So we do see really good waiting lists for surgeries for surgeons in the orthopedic space, hospitals ordering capital, whether it’s small capital or large capital, building more ASCs. The ASC trend has actually really helped, because patients love it. They go, they get home the same day, they have a terrific experience, and they tell all their friends, and that word of mouth is spreading for hip and knees, absolutely, for hip and knee surgeries that is happening. And our percent of procedures in ASCs continues to climb. So I think those are the – there’s a number of factors I just outlined, all of them pointing to, at least for this year, continued good demand. And I don’t know how temporary it is. This could be continuing, frankly, for a period of time, because I think demographics and activity levels are the two drivers that we’re seeing, at least for our portfolio of businesses.\nShagun Singh: That’s really helpful. And then just on guidance, you guys delivered or you put up a pretty strong initial guide out of the gates. Does it give you room for upside as you move through the year? And I guess, more specifically, what areas could we potentially look to drive that upside? Thank you for taking the question.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Great question. First of all, we have a history that we generally like to follow, and I would tell you that it’s early days. We’re here in January looking at 2024, we feel very confident about where we’re going to perform on sales and driving off margin expansion. At this point, I’m not going to comment on the potential to go beyond that, but we feel very good about the guidance that we put out.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nPito Chickering: Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions and congrats on an amazing year. On the gross margins, can you help bridge the third quarter to fourth quarter gross margins? How much of the impact was mixed? And then you have the good guys and bad guys that can help us understand that sequential change?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Sure, Pito. Without going into too much detail, I would say, the single biggest item was really mix in terms of what was growing much faster in Q4 versus Q3 relative to sort of some of the other items. We also had really solid price performance in Q4, which contributed to that. And then lastly, sort of in typical Stryker fashion, we hit a little bit of a hockey stick here in Q4, too. And so that actually benefits up the gross margin line.\nPito Chickering: Great. And then on pricing, back in third quarter, I think it was about 30 basis points favorable, it’s 70 basis points favorable this quarter. Guidance assumes flat pricing for 2024. I guess, shouldn’t there be some positive pricing in 2024 just as the fourth quarter comes out? And after you gotten accelerating pricing throughout the year, I guess, why should 2024 pricing flatten out? Thanks so much.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Keep in mind, flat is the average for the whole company. And the way that that pricing guide is calculated, it’s legacy product over legacy product. So a lot of our pricing increases carry over into 2024. They’re just comparing to the new higher price. I would also say, too, flat is the average of some up and some down. And so we absolutely will see price increases across some of our businesses. And that will be balanced with some of the challenges we have in, say, Spine or some of our other orthopedic businesses. So I do think we haven’t backed off our pricing strategy one bit, and we fully expect to sort of maximize the benefit we’re going to get out of pricing.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question, Glenn. Maybe just a finer point on some of the op margin guide. It looks like the 200 basis points, more than half of that’s in 2024. Can you just confirm that there’s a little bit of kind of math going around? Just want to make sure we got the math in 2024 correct. And with such a big ramp in 2024 on the guidance, just can you give a little more confidence on what you’re doing to kind of achieve that 100 basis points plus in 2024? What you’re seeing on the cost input side, just to kind of drive confidence that that’s achievable in 2024?\nKevin Lobo: Sure. Yes. I think you can do the math as well as I can, especially given all the areas that I’ve guided in the full year. So I definitely think you’re in the zip code for what we think will happen in 2024. And honestly, if we look at sort of what we’ve laid out and planned for the year, first of all, the natural leverage we get from growth versus fixed cost in operating expenses certainly will provide us some benefits. We also won’t stand still in a lot of the gross margin initiatives that I mentioned, and those will move forward and also provide some benefit that we’ll see in 2024. And so I would tell you that we haven’t walked lightly on this. I would say that across the globe, Stryker is very focused on these op margin expansion projects and sustainable op margin expansion for 2024 and 2025. And so we feel very confident that we’ll be able to deliver that.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks. And then maybe one quick question on MAKO shoulder just to make sure that’s still expected to come in 2024 and anything else you want to say on that at this point. Thanks a lot.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Listen, as we’ve said from the beginning, MAKO shoulder will launch at the end of 2024. So I don’t expect to have much at all of a revenue impact. That said, it’s not like our shoulder business needs MAKO shoulder to be growing at strong double digits. They have terrific products within upper extremities with shoulder ID with a number of really pyrocarbon humeral. We have a fracture stem for Perform, which is incredible, a Reverse Perform stemless. So they have four terrific launches with an upper extremity. So they’re going to do fine even before MAKO. But MAKO will be the end of the year. The feedback from searches have been terrific. But that’ll have much more of an impact in 2025, not so much in 2024.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matthew O’Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O’Brien: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on MAKO, this question might be for Jason. Just the domestic number this quarter was a little bit soft, and we’re hearing about one of your competitors just giving their system away because it’s not all that great. Can you talk about the dynamics that you’re seeing in the market, especially domestically for MAKO in terms of placing systems, selling systems, and then just having to get really aggressive on the pricing side, just given the environment that you’re in? And then conversely, the OUS number looks phenomenal again. Just where are we at in terms of growing that business over the next several years? And I do have one follow-up.\nJason Beach: Yes, I’ll start this and Kevin, feel free obviously to weigh in. But as we think about the MAKO offense, and I think we’ve said this previously as well. When we think about the various options to bring MAKO to market, we’ve been flexible, right, whether it’s leasing, rentals, et cetera. So I think we’re very competitive from that standpoint. And to your comment on kind of where we are, I would still say whether it’s U.S. or internationally, early innings here, we’ve got a lot of runway relative to MAKO. But as we think about the financing options, it’s not going to be an impediment for us to expand the MAKO footprint.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. The only thing I would add to Jason’s comments are every ASC MAKO that’s installed is financed everyone, and that’s becoming a bigger percentage of the MAKO installation. So what you’re seeing is more financed rentals and financed versus outright capital purchases. So that obviously the revenue number and the revenue growth of 3 percentage or less is not the installation growth. The installation growth is higher than what you’re seeing. And over time that’ll start to normalize and then you’ll start to see the growth rate be more reflective of the installation rate. But we’re going through this kind of transition phase right now, and we are giving them away. So we charge for it and we have different pricing models, obviously, and we want the customers to have skin in the game, so that if we just give it away, they have no incentive to use it. And what we don’t want are a bunch of robots collecting dust. So we care a lot and we monitor utilization of the robots very, very significantly. And then, of course, OUS we’re seeing terrific pickup and a lot more purchases than finance. We do offer financing around the world, but so far in international we’re seeing a lot more purchases than we are financing, which is why you see the revenue spike. But again, international has a huge potential. It’s kind of where we were in the U.S. about five years ago.\nMatthew O’Brien: Understood. Thanks for that. And then sticking with MAKO, Kevin, you mentioned, shoulder, you don’t really need the application as much because you’re crushing it on the shoulder side. But in spine, you’re doing better the last couple of quarters. I haven’t really heard why that is. I don’t know if it’s just some of the dislocation or not. But I think it’s probably a bigger opportunity on the spine side of the business going forward. These centers that already have MAKO and use it for hips and knees, can you quickly transfer the system to the spine part of those institutions or facilities and start to pick up share fairly quickly? Or is this something that’s going to take many, many quarters? We’re talking 2025, 2026 before it really starts to impact the spine business. Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. What I’d say is, first of all, the MAKO brand is extremely well known. That’s a very, very big positive. And I think what you’re going to see is a much faster uptake than you would have seen had we not had already had MAKO on hips and knees. Will it take a little bit of time? Sure. Will a spine surgeon want to share the robot with hips and knee surgeons? Not sure yet. Obviously, that’s something we’re going to see play out, whether they’re going to want their own robot or they’re going to be willing to operate on the days that the hip and knee people aren’t operating. So that’s a whole dynamic. I think that’ll vary account by account. So we’re already working on our commercialization plans. I think part of the reason for our success is – success with the Q guidance, which is one half of the system. So you’re going to have the Q guidance and then as well, MAKO, they know it’s coming now. Customers have gone to Leesburg, Virginia, our spine headquarters, to see MAKO spine. And many of them have stopped their purchases of other robots knowing that this is coming. So I think that’s what’s helping to contribute to our, let’s call it somewhat improved performance, but we still would like to grow at a higher rate than we are right now. And we know we need not just MAKO, but also the CO-PILOT product. So we’re going to go from being behind to being ahead. And CO-PILOT should launch in a similar time frame slightly ahead of MAKO spine. So you’re now going to have the CO-PILOT product plus MAKO spine, where our competitors will just have their robot. The ones that have robot will just have a robot without CO-PILOT with haptic feedback that can do the laminectomy and discectomy portions of the procedure, which complements the pedicle screw placement. So we’re really going to be in a great position by the time third quarter comes around. Robots do take time, so the scaling will take time, but I think it’ll be certainly much faster than the initial people who came in with robotics, they know, they benefit from it, and they know and they can trust the MAKO brand.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJosh Jennings: Hi good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to, hopefully, Kevin, ask about just got a temperature check on the health care delivery systems capacity for orthopedic procedure growth. I think heading in to 2023 after experiencing 2022, there were concerns around staffing shortages, et cetera, and potentially be creating a bottleneck for procedure volume growth. That clearly didn’t play out in 2023. It doesn’t sound like from your comments, it’s going to play out. You expect it to play out in 2024. But are there any capacity constraint issues in the U.S. health care delivery system for orthopedic procedure volume growth as we go forward in 2024 and 2025 or is that fully in the rearview mirror?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, I think it’s largely in the rearview mirror. There’s still niggling things here and there, but it’s gotten very quiet. You saw that in Q4. It’s just a boomer of a Q4. And kind of the normal seasonality, I think we now have finally a normalized year for you to compare is, of course, adjusted for selling days, but there is a normalized year finally. And yes, they’ve gotten their staffing issues solved largely, and they do prioritize orthopedics, because orthopedics is a moneymaker for hospitals, right? Cardiovascular and orthopedic procedures are two money makers. And so if they are short staffed, they are going to prioritize staffing for orthopedics. I would say the only area that still has a lot of room to run is ASCs. So every hospital is constructing ASCs, and that’s going to continue to be an engine of future growth. But I’d say we’re in a very normalized environment. They have the capacity. They can operate additional days, which we saw some of that in Q4 again, which we hadn’t seen for a couple of years. So, I think the hospitals are absolutely ready now, and a lot of that’s behind us.\nJosh Jennings: Excellent. Just one follow-up on MAKO. Just with the record system placement quarter. Was hoping to just get some details on where – what you’re seeing in terms of second or even third system purchases by hospitals, hospital systems, any kind of percentage of total systems or – or how big of an opportunity do you see kind of getting that second, third, maybe even fourth system into hospitals? Thanks for taking the questions.\nJason Beach: Hey Josh, it’s Jason. First, I would say there are many hospital systems across the U.S. that are second, third system. For competitive reasons, we don’t disclose kind of number of units installed. But you certainly see numerous systems with multiple MAKOs. I think as you fast forward to a shoulder and spine application, you’re going to see more and more of that when you think about utilization and the need for future systems. So that’s kind of how we think about that.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, frankly, I would say it’s rare to have one MAKO in a hospital now. There are some that have five, six, seven MAKOs. I think 60% of our knees are going to MAKOs. There’s got to be a lot of MAKOs to be able to drive that kind of volume. So the days of people saying, well, this is my first MAKO, those days in the U.S. are kind of fading. That phenomenon still exists outside the U.S.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Pasquale with Nephron. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Just quickly on the SERF acquisition. Are there any particular portfolio gaps you closed with that deal? Or is it more about expanding your distribution footprint internationally?\nJason Beach: Yes, Chris, it’s Jason. And we’ll talk about this more after the close. But it really is – it helps from a hip portfolio perspective. But beyond that, we haven’t said much at this point. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we’re set to close this quarter, and then we’ll certainly talk more to that.\nChris Pasquale: Okay. And then I’m curious how you’re thinking about the outlook for neurovascular in 2024. 2023 was a better year for that segment in the U.S., but it kind of got offset by international. And along with Spine, it was really one of only two segments not to grow high single digits or better. So what’s the game plan to drive better growth in that business? And do you have what you need internally? Or do you need to look for supplements to that?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, we continue to like the neuromuscular market, as there’s still a large number of patients that are being treated. It’s an attractive market growing high single digits. And we do expect to grow in line, at least in line with the market. We are obviously very hard hit by China this year with the VBP. We had a very big neurovascular business in China. So that hurt. I don’t know that we completely lapped it, but it’s going to – we’re going to get to the bottom of China pretty soon, and then that will be behind us. We also have the Cerus acquisition, which is off to a very good start outside the United States. We are seeking U.S. approval, I believe. That will be some time in 2025, maybe beginning of 2026. So we still have a bit of time to wait for that, but that is a fabulous product for intrasecular technology. We are looking at an area like liquid embolic. We don’t have that product, as you want to think about one that we we’re going to be looking into. Every business has something they’d like to add. But we do have a good pipeline. We don’t talk about neurovascular pipeline too much because they get subject to regulatory approval through the PMA process. So – but the team does have some very good products that are lining up. And I do believe we’re going to be back to kind of much closer market growth, slightly above market growth in the years ahead. But as the market we continue to like, it obviously has gotten much more competitive on the ischemic side, and we continue to have a very strong business on the hemorrhagic side. We launched a couple of products last year, the Vector 46 catheter, the Tetra [ph] coil and that kind of fueled some very good U.S. growth as you saw in the back half of the year. So we like the business. Yes, it’s not as fast growing as it was historically, but it’s still a very good business. We’re committed to it and do expect that that will pick up as we put VBP in the rearview mirror.\nChris Pasquale: Great. Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I’ll echo everyone’s congrats on a really strong end of the year and a strong start to 2024. Just a quick question on the orthopedics market in general. One of the things I’ve been trying to get a handle on is what’s really happening in underlying market growth. Obviously, 2023 benefited from some semblance of a backlog work down. But it seems like yourselves and your competitors – not that you have guided specifically for Ortho, but seem to be signaling higher than sort of normal, call it, pre-COVID market growth. And I’m curious, beyond pricing, what’s really changed here? Has capacity increased? We talked about ASCs. What’s changed fundamentally in the orthopedic – large joint orthopedics market that might be driving higher – sustainably higher growth versus pre-COVID levels?\nJason Beach: Danielle, it’s Jason. I think a couple of things, right? And Kevin even alluded to this, I think, earlier as well. But I think there’s a variety of things around demographics. Kevin touched on activity levels. Certainly, that plays a part here. We talked about a more favorable pricing environment. Certainly, it plays a role. And then if you think just from an adoption standpoint with robotic-assisted surgery, I think there’s a variety of dynamics at play here that have come into play in terms of elevated market levels. And if you saw what we published coming out of Investor Day, we’ve said over the next two years to three years, we expect this to be in kind of that mid-single-digit range. So we're certainly confident in 2024 and beyond as we think about the ortho markets.\nDanielle Antalffy: And I guess just to follow up on that, how much of that is Stryker specific though, because given the innovation on Stryker side, the success of MAKO and pull through there? How much is market broadly versus Stryker specific if you can even remotely quantify that?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Danielle. Look, we've always talked about outgrowing the market, let's call it around numbers, 300 basis points ahead of the market. And in the past, there was time when hips weren't quite growing that fast until we launched Insignia stem. But if you go back over the last decade, we have been growing roughly 300 basis points faster than market. So if the market moves up, then our numbers move up as well. And I think you've seen that all year, this year, as you've seen in the last couple of years. So that's kind of the way I'd look at it is whatever the market grows, we should be roughly 300 basis points faster because we have this huge lead in robotic-assisted surgery, as well as cementless, and we just have a team that's firing on all cylinders.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatt Miksic: Hey, everybody. Thanks so much. So maybe a couple of follow-ups, some of the things that have come up. But I'd love to try to get some additional color on M&A. You talked about sort of being back on OpEx, which is awesome. And just maybe if you could talk a little bit about what that means, large versus small, sort of new platform versus maybe something that strengthens one of your existing businesses, like, I don't know, neurotech or ENT or neuromod has come up in the past or anything you could talk about that would be great. And then I have one follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Hey, Matt. Look, I can't get too specific with you, the nature of M&A. M&A is fluid and the deals have to make sense financially. You have to have the buyer that's ready to sell when you want to acquire. I think because of the pent-up demand in the businesses, we have a lot of mouths to feed and they're hungry. And so I would think in, let's say, at least the first half of the year, it'll probably be more of tucking things in that because we've been staying close to these companies and we have a bunch of deals that are teed up. But then once you get through the first half of the year, I think it becomes open field. And then open field means maybe more tuck ins, but it means maybe more things that are in the adjacency categories. We're always open to those, but a lot of things have to, stars have to align in order to be able to do those deals. But we're back on the normal Stryker offense. And again, what does that mean? It means most of the deals by number are going to be those tuck-in deals, but things like Vocera and neurovascular and those types of Physio-Control, those kinds of deals are going to pop up that are more in the adjacent categories. But I can't predict this honestly, because I don't know what's going to happen. But we are out hunting and we are excited to get back to a more regular M&A. It's been a huge part of our offense. We know how to do this. We've gotten really good acumen around evaluations and around integrations, which early in my tenure, we weren't so good at integrations. And if I look at Wright Medical, it's just been a role model for how to integrate a complex business, and the results have been stellar [ph].\nMatt Miksic: That's great. Thank you for that. And then just follow-up on ASCs. It's always been a sort of hot topic, I guess, in the last few years, particularly coming out of the pandemic. So just maybe some thoughts, if you could, on where you are in terms of the build out of that opportunity. Maybe where like the percentage of hips and knees that are now you think being done through that channel and then sort of back to the M&A side of it. Is there other businesses that have some synergy there? You've obviously done well with equipment and with MAKO, with your OR equipment and implant pull through for these ASCs. But anything else makes sense to kind of bridge and lever that success you've had there? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks, Matt. Okay. I could spend a long time on this, but I'll just sort of cut to the chase and say that, look, things are continuing to progress in the ASC. We're now running between 12% to 15% of our hips and knees in the ASC. That's higher, certainly, than it was last year. So it continues to climb at a gradual rate because the rate limiting factor is capacity and the buildouts of these ASCs, but it is definitely continuing a steady climb. We have everything we need for orthopedic ASCs, and when I say everything, I mean booms, lights, power tools, Steri-Shield, Neptune waste management, operating table, every implant from foot and ankle to shoulder to hips to knees to spine. And I'm going to include spine in that because we just most recently did a really terrific ASC deal in spine. A lot of spine procedures are moving to the ASC. We did this in Duluth, Minnesota, which is a really exciting deal. And we were able to leverage spine in addition to a lot of other capital equipment in the ASC. And so those new builds and big renovations, we are absolutely beautifully positioned. What we're now looking at, now that we're a little bit in the GI space with Neptune and the POM acquisition that we have is, what else can we do in that space and other things we could add in that space. Now, I'm not saying that's specifically about ASC. It's about how we are. We like to be really busy in a call point, and now that we're in the GI call point, what every call point we go into, we say, what else can we bring to that call point? What other value can we bring? I'm not predicting that we'll do something in that space, but that's kind of how we look at it. But as it relates to the orthopedic ASC, we are in an incredibly good position to be able to win in the ASC market.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nCaitlin Cronin: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a great quarter. Just jumping up on Matt's question earlier. Momentum in spine really seems to be strong. Do you have any more clarity on how much you've been able to capitalize on the disruption in the space or expect to kind of capitalize from the disruption?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, I tell you. Listen, our performance thus far has really nothing to do with the disruption of the consolidation. It's just starting. We've just started to hear some disruption in Texas as an example and a couple of other little spots. So I would say very early days of disruption, and that's not the reason why we're doing better. We've kind of really improved our offense in spine, especially as it relates to enabling tech. I think the Q guidance was a big shot in the arm for the spine business. They've done a terrific job selling that and, of course, leveraging that for implants. That's been more of a factor than disruption. I think we're going to see the disruption starting this year, and hopefully we'll be able to pick up on that. But thus far, there really hasn't been much in the way of disruption, and we're going to see that play out over the course of this year.\nCaitlin Cronin: Got it. And then just a quick one on MAKO shoulder. You noted great feedback from docs. What's kind of going to be the use case for the docs? Is it going to be outcomes, time saving, et cetera?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, just – look, there's a whole series of outcomes, just to simplify it, it makes a very hard procedure very easy to do. That's the way I would simplify it. Why was the partial knee so wildly successful? It was a hard procedure to do and the robot made it easy. And the shoulder is harder to do than a partial knee, and it's going to make a very hard procedure very easy to do. Take stress off the surgeon, have very predictable results. That's been the value profit. There are surgeons I talk to you now that due to high volume of knees that tell me at the end of the day, I'm not tired anymore. This robot is taking away my stress. It's just making life easier for me, and you can multiply that by 10 for shoulder replacements.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Good evening, guys. First on price, how are you thinking about the relative pricing outlook in 2024 as you look at the major segments of MedSurg, Neuro versus Ortho, Spine, anything meaningfully different than what we saw in 2023 directionally? And I know we touched on this at Investor Day, but what gives you the confidence in the sustainability of this firmer pricing environment? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. It's Glenn. So as we look at price, first of all we've really honed in a strategy and a group that solely focuses on pricing for the whole company. If we think about sort of the segments, I don't think you'll see a lot of different performance in what we see out of our segments in general. MedSurg and Neurotech has more of an ability to gain pricing and we see price increases in those businesses. And honestly, even before the pandemic, we would see price increases coming out of the MedSurg businesses. I would say on the Ortho side, the trend has really been that it's just been less negative. Also, if you think about those ortho contracts, they're generally three-year contracts. So we haven't really been cycled through all those contracts yet. We have real discussions around inflation in our business with our customers. They know it, their experience it themselves. And so we're just – I'm not expecting to see positive come out of the ortho side, but we'll probably continue to see less negative.\nSteven Lichtman: Got it. And then Glenn, just on Pillar 2, is there an impact in 2024 that you're offsetting? And how are you thinking about sort of the potential impact in 2025 based on what you know today?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. No, good question. As we think about 2024, there is an impact for us. I think that through our tax planning and other strategies, we feel like we have fully offset that impact, and that's included in our effective tax rate guidance. For 2025, it's just – it's too early to comment at this point, to be honest. It's something we're just starting to look at, and we'll have more on that probably a year from now.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Matson with Needham & Company, Inc. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMike Matson: Yes. Thanks. It sounds like you're looking at doing some more M&A here. I was just curious if you could remind us where your leverage ratio is? And if you have a target at the – how high you'd be willing to go there?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. We generally tried to maintain a leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3. And I think we do the calc on 2023 where we're sitting at year-end, we're squarely on the lower end of that range. So we do feel like there is some room, if needed depending on sort of what we see in the acquisition landscape. But I fully expect that sort of given the normal cadence of acquisitions and that product tuck-ins are generally what we sort of normally go after. We likely won't be out borrowing to do those types of acquisitions.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. And so keep in mind that 3 is not necessarily an upper limit, right? So that's a normal landing zone for us, this 2.5 to 3 for the right deal at the right price. Could we go higher than 3? Sure, we would. And we have obviously have to commit to paying down the debt. But we don't really look at us as sort of being constrained that way. So for the right asset, if it's going to be value-creating for Stryker, we are not afraid to push beyond the 3, but that's kind of the land we like to live in as a landing zone.\nMike Matson: Yes, I understand. And then just wanted to ask one about Sports Medicine, I didn't really hear much there. Do you feel like that business is kind of where you want it in terms of the product offering and the scale?\nKevin Lobo: I am so glad you asked about sports. It's absolutely a rocket ship of growth for us for the past five, six, seven years. They have a number of shoulder launches coming out this year, I believe, four different shoulder launches. They call it internally this shoulder [indiscernible], which is quite motivating. But we've done a terrific job with hip. We've had a terrific job with knee, but shoulder has been kind of the area that we've needed to have new products. But they've been just an amazing business. It was a startup 12 years ago, and it just become a big, fast-growing business. It's really helped us win ASC deals. Frankly, having a really every ASC deal is orthopedic, ASC deal involves sports, and because we have such a strong portfolio we are able to win those deals. But historically, we wouldn't have been able to, and it's an incredibly exciting year of new product launches, particularly in shoulder. And I think some of those hopefully might be shown in AAOS, I'll have to get back to you on that. But I'm very bullish. We have a fabulous leader who's been leading the sports medicine business since the start-up when we had just a camera and not really much in the way of implants. And we are now formidable in sport medicine. Certainly in the U.S., certainly in Europe, we still have work to do in the emerging markets in Asia Pacific, but really a fabulous business. And it's been part of the growth engine within Endoscopy. And you've seen Endoscopy post pretty impressive results, certainly last year and this year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDrew Ranieri: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll put both of mine together. But Kevin, you were so early on in the orthopedic robotics landscape just with soft tissue robotics. What are your kind of your current thoughts on supporting that ecosystem today versus entering soft tissue robotics? Is it something that's concerning you? Or just how are you thinking about that opportunity? And then second, just could you talk about the PROstep launch from earlier in the fourth quarter or late third quarter? Just any metrics you can kind of share there on the foot business? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. So as it relates to soft tissue robotics, listen, it's a very interesting space. As you know, there's a very large and very successful company that kind of dominates the space. We certainly don't have a problem selling Endoscopy, if you look at our numbers. Certainly, for our 1788 and our cameras we're doing extremely well. We still have huge room for growth outside of being in soft tissue robotics. It's an area that we're certainly interested in, but very respectful of the large incumbent. And I'm not sure that we'd want to try to take them head on, just like anybody trying to come and take us head on in our space wouldn't be so easy. But it is an area that we like, there are loads and loads of companies, start-ups in the space, and we're looking at them. And it's not inconceivable that we would make a move at some point. But again, not expecting to come out and launch something that would go head-to-head with the Goliath and try to take them down. So, but it is a space we're pursuing, we're interested. We're looking at companies, and it's not impossible that we would make a move at some point in the future. It's just not an easy space. As you know, robots are hard. And we're going to be very thoughtful and very careful. But we don't see this kind of – at this point anyways, as a major threat to our Endoscopy business at all.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nMatt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one about the sprint of margins here and ask you, you do produce some upside on the top line and the margins over the course of this year and next year. How do you think about delivering that to the bottom line versus reinvesting in above that goal to get back to your pre-COVID margins?\nKevin Lobo: I mean, first of all, it's heavily dependent on sort of the mix that we get if we over deliver on sales in terms of how much margin we can get to. I would say that 200 basis points expansion is the absolute goal, and that will be the target. And we get there a little sooner, so be it. But we won't take our – our eye off of making sure that we're doing what's right in the business so that we can deliver that 200 basis points.\nMatt Taylor: And that – I wanted to ask another one on Vocera. You talked a lot about it on this call, and it's obviously doing well. Can you talk a little bit about how that's expanding its tentacles kind of throughout your organization? And anything else we should expect from it in the future as it connects some of the different technologies and provide you some cross-selling opportunities?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Great. Listen, I – integrations are challenging. In this one, we had some challenges with the cloud. We had to restructure the sales force. We are already seeing terrific integration with both beds and now more recently with our wireless stretcher. We had – they had a list before we bought the company, and we've expanded that list of connecting products and those products that we're going to connect to the ecosystem are not just Stryker products. So there are third-party companies that are coming to us and asking to be connected to our ecosystem. So we want to be a vital resource within hospitals. We're even looking at emergency departments that don't have really well automated workflow that actually do the documentation that take cognitive load off of nurses. So the potential every day, it just keeps expanding and expanding it. So it's wildly exciting. And the team now – the new sales team is really, really pick up in a big way. And so we're super excited. We're not ready – ready to talk about which products we'll be integrating. We'd rather do the integration and tell you about it. And we'd like to sort of give you a full year update. So a year from now, I expect we'll give you kind of a wholesome update and include more of those products that will be attached to the ecosystem. But we are really, really excited about this acquisition. It's a platform. So I'd say after MAKO, this is the second platform acquisition that I've done during my tenure. The other deals we've done, none of them were platforms. And that means it has wild upside potential over time. Now it's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take time. But this is – for us is – it will be very sticky in hospitals. It will just be a renewal, recurring revenue. And then as you add more and more to the ecosystem; it becomes something that hospitals can't live without. So that's our dream, and we're pretty optimistic given where we are right now, given the momentum that we have, given the interest that we have, both from parts of Stryker as well as third-party companies wanting to integrate to the system.\nMatt Taylor: Great. Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Glenn.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nRichard Newitter: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I'll just ask one here, and by the way, congrats again on a fantastic quarter, solid end to the year. So just clearly, you guys – since your Analyst Day, in particular, have been conveying how committed you are to margin expansion. You're kind of putting a stake in the ground, really strong guidance here for 2024. I guess I'm just going to ask, how should we think about that margin guidance relative to the potential and willingness to take on margin dilution as you get more aggressive on the M&A front? Should we think of that as something that already had contemplated the potential to need to absorb some dilution? Is there – are you more focused on top line accretion and more sensitive to kind of margin accretion faster than historically? I would just love your thoughts there and how we should think about kind of this margin trajectory and sprinting back to pre-COVID with respect to deals and how that will fit in the P&L.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Rich. Thanks for the question. Look, I think back to 2017, 2018, 2019, we were expanding margins before some dilution. We have around 80 basis points. And we were not growing at this kind of growth rate, right? We were growing in the 6s and 7s organically, not double-digit growth organically or high single-digit growth organically. So with that higher growth, this is not a crazy level of margin expansion that we think we could do. But doing small deals. And if they're small tuck-in varieties, there's some dilution that will come with that. We expect we're going to eat that and be able to deliver the 200 basis points. If a deal came along, let's say, something like a MAKO, which, as you know, occurs once a decade, maybe. It's not an everyday occurrence. That had dilution, but we felt it was just so great for the company that we had to do it. We would go ahead and do it. And then we would look at our numbers and say, is this something we can absorb or isn't it? Our going-in assumption is that that's not a likely occurrence. It's not impossible though. And I never want to rule anything out when it comes to M&A. If something really delicious appears and we think that this is going to be great for our future, we're going to go ahead and do it, and then we'll do our math and figure out can we get there with the 200 basis points. But in the normal cadence of operations of Stryker – and that means doing a number of deals that have a little bit of dilution here or there – we're going to eat it and we'll deliver our 200 basis points. If something bigger happens like a MAKO, as you know, was very dilutive but has proven to be a pretty terrific asset for our company, we're not going to say, well, we're going to wait two years and then we'll do it later. We're going to go ahead and do it. But again, I don't see that on the horizon. It's not obvious to me. But I'd never want to rule that out. It would be foolish, frankly, to be beholden to a certain financial target and pass up what could be very value creating for our company. But again, it's not our current frame of mind, not our current thought process. But I don't want to rule out that that could be a possibility.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you all for joining our call. As you can see, we have terrific momentum as we finish the year. We're excited about 2024, and we look forward to sharing our first quarter results with you in April. Thank you.",

            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter, MAKO performance insights and updates on recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results and 2024 guidance before opening the call to Q&A. First, I want to recognize and celebrate our achievement of surpassing $20 billion in sales. We continue to be a high-growth company with a focus on our mission to deliver for our patients and customers. As we begin 2024, I am very excited about our future. We are in a strong position with robust demand across both procedures and capital, easing macro constraints and a strong pipeline of innovation. I want to thank our over 50,000 employees for their unrelenting determination, agility and performance. We've delivered terrific sales growth of over 11% in Q4 and the full year despite strong comparatives from the prior year. Our commercial execution, including many successful product introductions was excellent across our businesses and regions. Globally, for both Q4 and the full year, we had double-digit organic sales growth in instruments, endoscopy, medical, neuro cranial, hips, knees and trauma and extremities. For the full year, we also had double-digit organic sales growth both in the U.S. and internationally. Spine and neurovascular also demonstrated good performances while making notable advancements in future innovations and acquisitions. It was a comprehensive performance across our businesses, and we have built significant momentum entering 2024. For the sixth straight year, our international sales growth, excluding China VBP outpaced our strong U.S. business. Canada, Australia and most emerging markets had double-digit growth, while Europe and Japan grew in high single digits. International continues to be a large growth opportunity for us. Next, we delivered quarterly and full year adjusted EPS of $3.46 and $10.60, respectively, which represents 15% growth for Q4 and 13% growth compared to the full year of 2022. This was driven by our strong sales, but also demonstrates our continued operating margin recovery. We remain focused on driving high growth now and in the future through investments in organic innovation and M&A. We expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of medtech, which is reflected in our full year 2024 guidance of organic sales growth of 7.5% to 9%. This growth, combined with an accelerated margin expansion plan, translates to an adjusted EPS of $11.70 to $12 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. It certainly was a terrific year in 2023. We had 9.7% organic the year before and over 11% organic in 2023. And frankly, we feel very good going into 2024. At some point, you think the comps will start to catch up a little bit. And so we think 7.5% to 9% is a strong guide. I can tell that coming off all of the domestic sales meetings, there is tremendous energy and excitement among our teams. The procedure volumes are strong. The capital markets are very strong. Hospitals are spending. We have we exited the year with more backlog than we began the year, which means, obviously, our orders are continuing to be strong for capital equipment. So we – and we have a number of new launches, again, planned in 2024. Obviously, 2023 was a great year of capitalizing on product launches, whether it's System 9, whether it was Neptune S, whether it was the 1788. We have other launches coming again. So our pipeline of innovation is very strong. And so I expect us to continue to grow at the high end of MedTech, in a MedTech market that is quite healthy. Yes. Thanks, Larry. I would say that we're back on M&A offense now, what I'll call our normal M&A offense. And as you've seen in the past with Stryker that would typically mean larger volume of tuck-in deals. And those can be large, and they can also be small. During the pause, while we paid down debt, all of our BD teams worked very actively. Believe me, they have a long list of targets, and we are going to be active now that we've gotten our leverage back to where we'd like to be. So let's say we're back to the normal Stryker offense. Expect us to be doing deals. We are open to larger deals. But our history would tell you that the vast majority of our deals are going to be smaller tuck-ins, but we can do many deals versus being very limited last year. Yes. Thanks. We're delighted with the progress that we've made. 60% of U.S. Knees being done on the robot is pretty remarkable given how long ago we launched the Total Knee application and SNFs starting to really climb since we launched the 4.0 software has been terrific. Cementless continues to climb as well. And that tends to index much higher with the use of Mako. And as you know, we are clearly the leader in not just in robotic-assisted surgery, but clearly the leader in Cementless as well. So a lot of good things going on with a market that is obviously a little better than it has been historically. But Mako continues to be the engine of growth, and that's true in the hospital. That's true in the ASPs as well. And we're seeing continued growth in the ASP, where our Stryker offense is really winning at a pretty spectacular rates as it relates to new builds and big renovations. So we have a lot of momentum across all of those dimensions, which translates to terrific performance as you saw with hips and knees. But the other part of our story is trauma extremities. So the right medical acquisition has been a complete home run of a deal. And you're seeing that not only has it been great for our extremities business, but it enabled us to focus a lot more on our core trauma business. And we really had all of our businesses in trauma extremities humming as we exited the year. And some great product launches towards the end of the year and some more to come in 2024. Yes. Look, we love our medical business. And frankly, it's become a big and very fast growing business. We continue to expect it to grow above Stryker's average growth rate. That is going to be true for the next five years. From quarter-to-quarter, it does bounce around a little bit because, of course, there's capital, a lot of large capital within medical. But you also have increasingly more stable revenue with Sage, which is doing spectacularly well. Then you've got, obviously, the AED demand, which has exploded. And we have a terrific AED business, tremendous innovation, we launched the Xpedition stair chair in the early part of the year, the first powered stair chair, which the firehouses absolutely love. And then you've got a lot of new demand for the wireless connection, wireless stretchers. So just tremendous innovation, tremendous leadership position, and now a much more diverse set of businesses than we had historically. So I think medical is the business. And Stryker that's the most underestimated because AEDs are high growth, our powered cots are high growth, and now our bed business is doing really well behind ProCuity. And then you have Vocera in addition to that. So really, I would expect high growth from all of those different businesses. Sage, Vocera, beds, stretchers, AEDs because of innovation that we're constantly innovating. And we have a couple of big launches in medical coming this year as well. So it's an exciting time to be at medical. And we also have an outstanding leadership team. They've really focused on talent for years and years and years. And so I'm very bullish on medical. And I think again, whatever people have in their models, we've tended to beat medical and people back for the last six years. Yes. I'll take the first part and then Jason can talk about AAOS. Look, that, that I would say that our pipeline of innovation is incredibly strong. When I mentioned the term super cycle, that really was referring to, let's call them big platform launches. But the reality is we're driving tremendous growth even in some of the divisions that don't have big platform growth launches, if you think about upper extremities, if you think about foot and ankle, but I would say the big ones coming up, we have this Pangea launch within our core trauma business, which is a big platform launch. Yes. Hi, Vijay. As we look at – I don't want to guide quarterly, but I would tell you that the cadence of what we're going to deliver from the mid-point will play out similar to 2023. But keep in mind, you got to back out one selling day in Q1 is what I would say and then on VBP, I'll let Jason. Yes. Well, first, the direct-to-consumer has been terrific. I mean, obviously, we have such a lead in robotics as a surgery. We want to make sure that we're differentiating our product among the rest of products and the searches and the impressions that we have exceeded our expectations. We're really pleased we're going to continue that program for a good portion of this year. And so that's certainly helped create a tremendous interest among consumers as well as hospitals, who actually watch the same ads as consumers. So we're very excited about that. Spine, we couldn't be more happy, because certainly that's been a gap in our portfolio relative to others. And this has got terrific workflow. And look, I think robotic adoption tends to really grow. No matter what procedure you're doing, if you have a good solution, it will over time become the majority and eventually standard of care. And we've obviously seen this in the general surgery world as it relates to prostate and starting to happen in other cases. And I think it's going to happen in orthopedics. So Spine might take a little longer, but I absolutely do believe it's going to be key for us in the future. We're extremely excited. We've been showing surgeons the MAKO spine getting terrific feedback on the workflow and the speed and the efficiency. And again, that's within the same ecosystem as the Q Guidance. So we've been selling a lot of Q Guidance software, which is used to navigate those procedures. And that same camera, which is the fastest camera on the market, will be compatible with MAKO when we launch it. So I do believe it'll become for pedicle screw placement, at least the vast majority of the procedures in the future. Okay. Well, I think if you look at the hospitals and what they're saying, that's kind of one of the indicators we look at. They're busy, right? The hospitals are busy, patients, definitely aging demographics plays for Stryker's portfolio that definitely plays to our advantage. And every day, 10,000 more people are turning 65. The activity levels are also increasing, right. The advent of Pickleball has been a terrific thing for our business. More active people who are elderly tend to want to stay active. And activity levels are kind of the biggest predictor of needing joint replacements and sports medicine procedures. So we're seeing very good activity levels. And so I don't really want to talk about backlog. I just think what we're seeing is patients presenting, frankly, some patients who are just wanting to be more active, losing weight and then wanting to be more active and then being eligible for surgery. So we do see really good waiting lists for surgeries for surgeons in the orthopedic space, hospitals ordering capital, whether it's small capital or large capital, building more ASCs. The ASC trend has actually really helped, because patients love it. They go, they get home the same day, they have a terrific experience, and they tell all their friends, and that word of mouth is spreading for hip and knees, absolutely, for hip and knee surgeries that is happening. And our percent of procedures in ASCs continues to climb. So I think those are the – there's a number of factors I just outlined, all of them pointing to, at least for this year, continued good demand. And I don't know how temporary it is. This could be continuing, frankly, for a period of time, because I think demographics and activity levels are the two drivers that we're seeing, at least for our portfolio of businesses. Yes. Great question. First of all, we have a history that we generally like to follow, and I would tell you that it's early days. We're here in January looking at 2024, we feel very confident about where we're going to perform on sales and driving off margin expansion. At this point, I'm not going to comment on the potential to go beyond that, but we feel very good about the guidance that we put out. Sure. Yes. I think you can do the math as well as I can, especially given all the areas that I've guided in the full year. So I definitely think you're in the zip code for what we think will happen in 2024. And honestly, if we look at sort of what we've laid out and planned for the year, first of all, the natural leverage we get from growth versus fixed cost in operating expenses certainly will provide us some benefits. We also won't stand still in a lot of the gross margin initiatives that I mentioned, and those will move forward and also provide some benefit that we'll see in 2024. And so I would tell you that we haven't walked lightly on this. I would say that across the globe, Stryker is very focused on these op margin expansion projects and sustainable op margin expansion for 2024 and 2025. And so we feel very confident that we'll be able to deliver that. Yes. Listen, as we've said from the beginning, MAKO shoulder will launch at the end of 2024. So I don't expect to have much at all of a revenue impact. That said, it's not like our shoulder business needs MAKO shoulder to be growing at strong double digits. They have terrific products within upper extremities with shoulder ID with a number of really pyrocarbon humeral. We have a fracture stem for Perform, which is incredible, a Reverse Perform stemless. So they have four terrific launches with an upper extremity. So they're going to do fine even before MAKO. But MAKO will be the end of the year. The feedback from searches have been terrific. But that'll have much more of an impact in 2025, not so much in 2024. Yes. The only thing I would add to Jason's comments are every ASC MAKO that's installed is financed everyone, and that's becoming a bigger percentage of the MAKO installation. So what you're seeing is more financed rentals and financed versus outright capital purchases. So that obviously the revenue number and the revenue growth of 3 percentage or less is not the installation growth. The installation growth is higher than what you're seeing. And over time that'll start to normalize and then you'll start to see the growth rate be more reflective of the installation rate. But we're going through this kind of transition phase right now, and we are giving them away. So we charge for it and we have different pricing models, obviously, and we want the customers to have skin in the game, so that if we just give it away, they have no incentive to use it. And what we don't want are a bunch of robots collecting dust. So we care a lot and we monitor utilization of the robots very, very significantly. And then, of course, OUS we're seeing terrific pickup and a lot more purchases than finance. We do offer financing around the world, but so far in international we're seeing a lot more purchases than we are financing, which is why you see the revenue spike. But again, international has a huge potential. It's kind of where we were in the U.S. about five years ago. Yes. What I'd say is, first of all, the MAKO brand is extremely well known. That's a very, very big positive. And I think what you're going to see is a much faster uptake than you would have seen had we not had already had MAKO on hips and knees. Will it take a little bit of time? Sure. Will a spine surgeon want to share the robot with hips and knee surgeons? Not sure yet. Obviously, that's something we're going to see play out, whether they're going to want their own robot or they're going to be willing to operate on the days that the hip and knee people aren't operating. So that's a whole dynamic. I think that'll vary account by account. So we're already working on our commercialization plans. I think part of the reason for our success is – success with the Q guidance, which is one half of the system. So you're going to have the Q guidance and then as well, MAKO, they know it's coming now. Customers have gone to Leesburg, Virginia, our spine headquarters, to see MAKO spine. And many of them have stopped their purchases of other robots knowing that this is coming. So I think that's what's helping to contribute to our, let's call it somewhat improved performance, but we still would like to grow at a higher rate than we are right now. And we know we need not just MAKO, but also the CO-PILOT product. So we're going to go from being behind to being ahead. And CO-PILOT should launch in a similar time frame slightly ahead of MAKO spine. So you're now going to have the CO-PILOT product plus MAKO spine, where our competitors will just have their robot. The ones that have robot will just have a robot without CO-PILOT with haptic feedback that can do the laminectomy and discectomy portions of the procedure, which complements the pedicle screw placement. So we're really going to be in a great position by the time third quarter comes around. Robots do take time, so the scaling will take time, but I think it'll be certainly much faster than the initial people who came in with robotics, they know, they benefit from it, and they know and they can trust the MAKO brand. Yes, I think it's largely in the rearview mirror. There's still niggling things here and there, but it's gotten very quiet. You saw that in Q4. It's just a boomer of a Q4. And kind of the normal seasonality, I think we now have finally a normalized year for you to compare is, of course, adjusted for selling days, but there is a normalized year finally. And yes, they've gotten their staffing issues solved largely, and they do prioritize orthopedics, because orthopedics is a moneymaker for hospitals, right? Cardiovascular and orthopedic procedures are two money makers. And so if they are short staffed, they are going to prioritize staffing for orthopedics. I would say the only area that still has a lot of room to run is ASCs. So every hospital is constructing ASCs, and that's going to continue to be an engine of future growth. But I'd say we're in a very normalized environment. They have the capacity. They can operate additional days, which we saw some of that in Q4 again, which we hadn't seen for a couple of years. So, I think the hospitals are absolutely ready now, and a lot of that's behind us. Yes, frankly, I would say it's rare to have one MAKO in a hospital now. There are some that have five, six, seven MAKOs. I think 60% of our knees are going to MAKOs. There's got to be a lot of MAKOs to be able to drive that kind of volume. So the days of people saying, well, this is my first MAKO, those days in the U.S. are kind of fading. That phenomenon still exists outside the U.S. Yes. Look, we continue to like the neuromuscular market, as there's still a large number of patients that are being treated. It's an attractive market growing high single digits. And we do expect to grow in line, at least in line with the market. We are obviously very hard hit by China this year with the VBP. We had a very big neurovascular business in China. So that hurt. I don't know that we completely lapped it, but it's going to – we're going to get to the bottom of China pretty soon, and then that will be behind us. We also have the Cerus acquisition, which is off to a very good start outside the United States. We are seeking U.S. approval, I believe. That will be some time in 2025, maybe beginning of 2026. So we still have a bit of time to wait for that, but that is a fabulous product for intrasecular technology. We are looking at an area like liquid embolic. We don't have that product, as you want to think about one that we we're going to be looking into. Every business has something they'd like to add. But we do have a good pipeline. We don't talk about neurovascular pipeline too much because they get subject to regulatory approval through the PMA process. So – but the team does have some very good products that are lining up. And I do believe we're going to be back to kind of much closer market growth, slightly above market growth in the years ahead. But as the market we continue to like, it obviously has gotten much more competitive on the ischemic side, and we continue to have a very strong business on the hemorrhagic side. We launched a couple of products last year, the Vector 46 catheter, the Tetra [ph] coil and that kind of fueled some very good U.S. growth as you saw in the back half of the year. So we like the business. Yes, it's not as fast growing as it was historically, but it's still a very good business. We're committed to it and do expect that that will pick up as we put VBP in the rearview mirror. Yes. Thanks, Danielle. Look, we've always talked about outgrowing the market, let's call it around numbers, 300 basis points ahead of the market. And in the past, there was time when hips weren't quite growing that fast until we launched Insignia stem. But if you go back over the last decade, we have been growing roughly 300 basis points faster than market. So if the market moves up, then our numbers move up as well. And I think you've seen that all year, this year, as you've seen in the last couple of years. So that's kind of the way I'd look at it is whatever the market grows, we should be roughly 300 basis points faster because we have this huge lead in robotic-assisted surgery, as well as cementless, and we just have a team that's firing on all cylinders. Yes. Hey, Matt. Look, I can't get too specific with you, the nature of M&A. M&A is fluid and the deals have to make sense financially. You have to have the buyer that's ready to sell when you want to acquire. I think because of the pent-up demand in the businesses, we have a lot of mouths to feed and they're hungry. And so I would think in, let's say, at least the first half of the year, it'll probably be more of tucking things in that because we've been staying close to these companies and we have a bunch of deals that are teed up. But then once you get through the first half of the year, I think it becomes open field. And then open field means maybe more tuck ins, but it means maybe more things that are in the adjacency categories. We're always open to those, but a lot of things have to, stars have to align in order to be able to do those deals. But we're back on the normal Stryker offense. And again, what does that mean? It means most of the deals by number are going to be those tuck-in deals, but things like Vocera and neurovascular and those types of Physio-Control, those kinds of deals are going to pop up that are more in the adjacent categories. But I can't predict this honestly, because I don't know what's going to happen. But we are out hunting and we are excited to get back to a more regular M&A. It's been a huge part of our offense. We know how to do this. We've gotten really good acumen around evaluations and around integrations, which early in my tenure, we weren't so good at integrations. And if I look at Wright Medical, it's just been a role model for how to integrate a complex business, and the results have been stellar [ph]. Yes, thanks, Matt. Okay. I could spend a long time on this, but I'll just sort of cut to the chase and say that, look, things are continuing to progress in the ASC. We're now running between 12% to 15% of our hips and knees in the ASC. That's higher, certainly, than it was last year. So it continues to climb at a gradual rate because the rate limiting factor is capacity and the buildouts of these ASCs, but it is definitely continuing a steady climb. We have everything we need for orthopedic ASCs, and when I say everything, I mean booms, lights, power tools, Steri-Shield, Neptune waste management, operating table, every implant from foot and ankle to shoulder to hips to knees to spine. And I'm going to include spine in that because we just most recently did a really terrific ASC deal in spine. A lot of spine procedures are moving to the ASC. We did this in Duluth, Minnesota, which is a really exciting deal. And we were able to leverage spine in addition to a lot of other capital equipment in the ASC. And so those new builds and big renovations, we are absolutely beautifully positioned. What we're now looking at, now that we're a little bit in the GI space with Neptune and the POM acquisition that we have is, what else can we do in that space and other things we could add in that space. Now, I'm not saying that's specifically about ASC. It's about how we are. We like to be really busy in a call point, and now that we're in the GI call point, what every call point we go into, we say, what else can we bring to that call point? What other value can we bring? I'm not predicting that we'll do something in that space, but that's kind of how we look at it. But as it relates to the orthopedic ASC, we are in an incredibly good position to be able to win in the ASC market. Yes, I tell you. Listen, our performance thus far has really nothing to do with the disruption of the consolidation. It's just starting. We've just started to hear some disruption in Texas as an example and a couple of other little spots. So I would say very early days of disruption, and that's not the reason why we're doing better. We've kind of really improved our offense in spine, especially as it relates to enabling tech. I think the Q guidance was a big shot in the arm for the spine business. They've done a terrific job selling that and, of course, leveraging that for implants. That's been more of a factor than disruption. I think we're going to see the disruption starting this year, and hopefully we'll be able to pick up on that. But thus far, there really hasn't been much in the way of disruption, and we're going to see that play out over the course of this year. Yes, just – look, there's a whole series of outcomes, just to simplify it, it makes a very hard procedure very easy to do. That's the way I would simplify it. Why was the partial knee so wildly successful? It was a hard procedure to do and the robot made it easy. And the shoulder is harder to do than a partial knee, and it's going to make a very hard procedure very easy to do. Take stress off the surgeon, have very predictable results. That's been the value profit. There are surgeons I talk to you now that due to high volume of knees that tell me at the end of the day, I'm not tired anymore. This robot is taking away my stress. It's just making life easier for me, and you can multiply that by 10 for shoulder replacements. Yes. And so keep in mind that 3 is not necessarily an upper limit, right? So that's a normal landing zone for us, this 2.5 to 3 for the right deal at the right price. Could we go higher than 3? Sure, we would. And we have obviously have to commit to paying down the debt. But we don't really look at us as sort of being constrained that way. So for the right asset, if it's going to be value-creating for Stryker, we are not afraid to push beyond the 3, but that's kind of the land we like to live in as a landing zone. I am so glad you asked about sports. It's absolutely a rocket ship of growth for us for the past five, six, seven years. They have a number of shoulder launches coming out this year, I believe, four different shoulder launches. They call it internally this shoulder [indiscernible], which is quite motivating. But we've done a terrific job with hip. We've had a terrific job with knee, but shoulder has been kind of the area that we've needed to have new products. But they've been just an amazing business. It was a startup 12 years ago, and it just become a big, fast-growing business. It's really helped us win ASC deals. Frankly, having a really every ASC deal is orthopedic, ASC deal involves sports, and because we have such a strong portfolio we are able to win those deals. But historically, we wouldn't have been able to, and it's an incredibly exciting year of new product launches, particularly in shoulder. And I think some of those hopefully might be shown in AAOS, I'll have to get back to you on that. But I'm very bullish. We have a fabulous leader who's been leading the sports medicine business since the start-up when we had just a camera and not really much in the way of implants. And we are now formidable in sport medicine. Certainly in the U.S., certainly in Europe, we still have work to do in the emerging markets in Asia Pacific, but really a fabulous business. And it's been part of the growth engine within Endoscopy. And you've seen Endoscopy post pretty impressive results, certainly last year and this year. Yes, sure. So as it relates to soft tissue robotics, listen, it's a very interesting space. As you know, there's a very large and very successful company that kind of dominates the space. We certainly don't have a problem selling Endoscopy, if you look at our numbers. Certainly, for our 1788 and our cameras we're doing extremely well. We still have huge room for growth outside of being in soft tissue robotics. It's an area that we're certainly interested in, but very respectful of the large incumbent. And I'm not sure that we'd want to try to take them head on, just like anybody trying to come and take us head on in our space wouldn't be so easy. But it is an area that we like, there are loads and loads of companies, start-ups in the space, and we're looking at them. And it's not inconceivable that we would make a move at some point. But again, not expecting to come out and launch something that would go head-to-head with the Goliath and try to take them down. So, but it is a space we're pursuing, we're interested. We're looking at companies, and it's not impossible that we would make a move at some point in the future. It's just not an easy space. As you know, robots are hard. And we're going to be very thoughtful and very careful. But we don't see this kind of – at this point anyways, as a major threat to our Endoscopy business at all. I mean, first of all, it's heavily dependent on sort of the mix that we get if we over deliver on sales in terms of how much margin we can get to. I would say that 200 basis points expansion is the absolute goal, and that will be the target. And we get there a little sooner, so be it. But we won't take our – our eye off of making sure that we're doing what's right in the business so that we can deliver that 200 basis points. Yes. Great. Listen, I – integrations are challenging. In this one, we had some challenges with the cloud. We had to restructure the sales force. We are already seeing terrific integration with both beds and now more recently with our wireless stretcher. We had – they had a list before we bought the company, and we've expanded that list of connecting products and those products that we're going to connect to the ecosystem are not just Stryker products. So there are third-party companies that are coming to us and asking to be connected to our ecosystem. So we want to be a vital resource within hospitals. We're even looking at emergency departments that don't have really well automated workflow that actually do the documentation that take cognitive load off of nurses. So the potential every day, it just keeps expanding and expanding it. So it's wildly exciting. And the team now – the new sales team is really, really pick up in a big way. And so we're super excited. We're not ready – ready to talk about which products we'll be integrating. We'd rather do the integration and tell you about it. And we'd like to sort of give you a full year update. So a year from now, I expect we'll give you kind of a wholesome update and include more of those products that will be attached to the ecosystem. But we are really, really excited about this acquisition. It's a platform. So I'd say after MAKO, this is the second platform acquisition that I've done during my tenure. The other deals we've done, none of them were platforms. And that means it has wild upside potential over time. Now it's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take time. But this is – for us is – it will be very sticky in hospitals. It will just be a renewal, recurring revenue. And then as you add more and more to the ecosystem; it becomes something that hospitals can't live without. So that's our dream, and we're pretty optimistic given where we are right now, given the momentum that we have, given the interest that we have, both from parts of Stryker as well as third-party companies wanting to integrate to the system. Yes. Thanks, Rich. Thanks for the question. Look, I think back to 2017, 2018, 2019, we were expanding margins before some dilution. We have around 80 basis points. And we were not growing at this kind of growth rate, right? We were growing in the 6s and 7s organically, not double-digit growth organically or high single-digit growth organically. So with that higher growth, this is not a crazy level of margin expansion that we think we could do. But doing small deals. And if they're small tuck-in varieties, there's some dilution that will come with that. We expect we're going to eat that and be able to deliver the 200 basis points. If a deal came along, let's say, something like a MAKO, which, as you know, occurs once a decade, maybe. It's not an everyday occurrence. That had dilution, but we felt it was just so great for the company that we had to do it. We would go ahead and do it. And then we would look at our numbers and say, is this something we can absorb or isn't it? Our going-in assumption is that that's not a likely occurrence. It's not impossible though. And I never want to rule anything out when it comes to M&A. If something really delicious appears and we think that this is going to be great for our future, we're going to go ahead and do it, and then we'll do our math and figure out can we get there with the 200 basis points. But in the normal cadence of operations of Stryker – and that means doing a number of deals that have a little bit of dilution here or there – we're going to eat it and we'll deliver our 200 basis points. If something bigger happens like a MAKO, as you know, was very dilutive but has proven to be a pretty terrific asset for our company, we're not going to say, well, we're going to wait two years and then we'll do it later. We're going to go ahead and do it. But again, I don't see that on the horizon. It's not obvious to me. But I'd never want to rule that out. It would be foolish, frankly, to be beholden to a certain financial target and pass up what could be very value creating for our company. But again, it's not our current frame of mind, not our current thought process. But I don't want to rule out that that could be a possibility. Thank you all for joining our call. As you can see, we have terrific momentum as we finish the year. We're excited about 2024, and we look forward to sharing our first quarter results with you in April. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.4% in the quarter, compared to 13.2% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter of 2023 has the same number of selling days as 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.7%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.3% favorable impact on sales in the quarter. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 12.7%. International organic sales growth was 7.7%, against a very strong comparable of over 18% in 2022. This performance included positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Canada, Japan and most emerging markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 11.5%, with U.S. organic sales growth of 11.7% and international organic sales growth of 10.9%. Excluding the impact of China VBP, international growth was 12.8%. The impact for pricing in the year was favorable 0.6%. Foreign currency had a 0.5% unfavorable impact, and 2023 as the same number of selling days as 2022. Our adjusted EPS of $3.46 in the quarter was up 15.3% from 2022, driven by higher sales and operating margin expansion, as well as lower other income and expenses. Foreign currency exchange translation had a favorable impact of $0.02. Our full year adjusted EPS was $10.60, which represents growth of 13.5% from full year 2022, reflecting the favorable impact of sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.10. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12% and organic sales growth of 11.8%, which included 13.8% of U.S. organic growth and 5.7% of international growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.5%, with strong double-digit growth across its Surgical Technology and Orthopedic Instruments businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, SteriShield, smoke evacuation and surg account. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 17.9%, with double-digit growth in its Communications, Endo, BEU and Sports Medicine businesses. From a product perspective, this includes strong growth in booms, lights and video. During the quarter, the Endoscopy business continued to see very strong momentum of the 1788 camera system, which had its full launch in September. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.9%, led by performances in its Vocera, Acute Care and Sage businesses. This included strong growth in Vocera badges, beds, stretchers and Prevalon repositioning products. All of this was against a very strong comparable growth of over 20% in 2022. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 7.6%, reflecting solid performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neurocranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 14%, which included double-digit growth in the neurosurgical and ENT businesses, with strong growth in high-speed drill and balloon dilation products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 5.7%, reflecting double-digit growth in our instruments and neurocranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Australia, Canada and Japan. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency and organic sales growth of 10.7%, which included organic growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and 10.1% internationally. Our U.S. Knee business grew 12.9% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Hip business also grew 12.9% organically, reflecting solid primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 12.1% organically, with strong performances across all of its businesses, including Upper Extremities, Biologics, Core Trauma, and Foot and Ankle. Our U.S. Spine business grew 6%, led by the performance in our Enabling Technology and Interventional Spine businesses. Internationally, Orthopedics and Spine grew 10.1% organically, including strong performances in Canada and most emerging markets, particularly driven by Mako and strong Knee performance across most geographies. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.9% was favorably – was favorable approximately 120 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily driven by the continued easing of certain cost pressures, including the elimination of spot buy purchases that we experienced in 2022, and the continued benefit of pricing initiatives. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.6% of sales, which was 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. Our adjusted SG&A was 31% of sales, which was 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022 due to continued investments, including sales growth incentives and a more normalized cadence of travel and meetings. In summary, for the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 27.2% of sales, which was approximately 60 basis points favorable to the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, our adjusted operating margin was 24.2% of sales, a 40 basis points increase over 2022. This performance is mainly driven by the easing of certain gross margin cost pressures throughout the second half of the year as well as the positive impact of our pricing actions. Adjusted other income and expense of $31 million for the quarter was $23 million lower than 2022, mainly driven by higher interest income and other favorable discrete items. For 2024, we expect our full year other income and expense to be approximately $250 million. Our fourth quarter and full year had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.6% and 14.1%, respectively, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2024, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13 billion. During the year, we paid down the remaining $850 million outstanding on the $1.5 billion term loan associated with the Vocera acquisition and achieved our deleveraging commitments. In Q4, we also refinanced certain debt maturities, including prefunding of $600 million that is due in May 2024. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was $3.7 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections. For 2024, we anticipate that capital spending will be $650 million to $700 million. We do not anticipate any share buybacks. And now I will provide 2024 full year sales and earnings guidance. Based on our momentum from 2023, strong procedural volumes, healthy demand for capital products and a stabilizing macroeconomic environment, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 9% for 2024. There is one additional selling day in 2024 compared to 2023, with one less day in Q1 and one more day in both Q3 and Q4. Based on the steady progress of our pricing actions, we would expect the full year impact of price to be roughly flat. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be modestly, unfavorably impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year. EPS will be negatively impacted $0.05 to $0.10. This is included in our guidance. Finally, for the full year 2024, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.70 to $12, representing our commitment to accelerated operating margin expansion in 2024 as well as the stabilized – stabilizing operating environment. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we do expect seasonality for sales and related earnings to be similar to 2023, but adjusted for the quarterly differences in 2024 selling days. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Yes. I think, Robbie – and I tried to sort of lay this out at the end of my guidance there, but I think a good place to start would be to look at sort of the cadence of sales and earnings in 2023. And really just adjust out for one selling day in Q1 and then adding two on the back end. And so as you look at pay Stryker, how are you going to deliver op margin expansion throughout the year, it's probably a little more back half loaded just based on the cadence that we'll see through the year for sales and related op income. Yes, Larry, I think, first of all, we're not backing off of our sprint to 2019 op margin at all. And we have clearly had a plan to get there by the end of 2025. As I said at Analyst Day, we have good opportunities in operating expenses and in gross margin. I think if you look at our delivery in 2023, we got about 80 basis points out of gross margin and we invested in some operating expenses that we had indicated would get back to sort of normalized spend. So my thoughts on 2024 is that expansion will generally be led by operating expenses, but there continues to be really good opportunities in gross margins that we continue to work on. And if you think about some of these things, price isn't going away from us. We're still going to continue to work on that. Viju elaborated on the benefit we have of low-cost manufacturing sites, and we'll continue to see expansion there. We have opportunities in purchasing and procurement, supplier consolidation. On the OpEx side, we'll continue to expand into shared services in some of these low-cost areas where we have those. And then honestly, from OpEx, we have a lot of natural leverage. It just comes when you're growing at the rate that we're growing. Yes. Sure, Pito. Without going into too much detail, I would say, the single biggest item was really mix in terms of what was growing much faster in Q4 versus Q3 relative to sort of some of the other items. We also had really solid price performance in Q4, which contributed to that. And then lastly, sort of in typical Stryker fashion, we hit a little bit of a hockey stick here in Q4, too. And so that actually benefits up the gross margin line. Keep in mind, flat is the average for the whole company. And the way that that pricing guide is calculated, it's legacy product over legacy product. So a lot of our pricing increases carry over into 2024. They're just comparing to the new higher price. I would also say, too, flat is the average of some up and some down. And so we absolutely will see price increases across some of our businesses. And that will be balanced with some of the challenges we have in, say, Spine or some of our other orthopedic businesses. So I do think we haven't backed off our pricing strategy one bit, and we fully expect to sort of maximize the benefit we're going to get out of pricing. Yes. It's Glenn. So as we look at price, first of all we've really honed in a strategy and a group that solely focuses on pricing for the whole company. If we think about sort of the segments, I don't think you'll see a lot of different performance in what we see out of our segments in general. MedSurg and Neurotech has more of an ability to gain pricing and we see price increases in those businesses. And honestly, even before the pandemic, we would see price increases coming out of the MedSurg businesses. I would say on the Ortho side, the trend has really been that it's just been less negative. Also, if you think about those ortho contracts, they're generally three-year contracts. So we haven't really been cycled through all those contracts yet. We have real discussions around inflation in our business with our customers. They know it, their experience it themselves. And so we're just – I'm not expecting to see positive come out of the ortho side, but we'll probably continue to see less negative. Yes. No, good question. As we think about 2024, there is an impact for us. I think that through our tax planning and other strategies, we feel like we have fully offset that impact, and that's included in our effective tax rate guidance. For 2025, it's just – it's too early to comment at this point, to be honest. It's something we're just starting to look at, and we'll have more on that probably a year from now. Yes. We generally tried to maintain a leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3. And I think we do the calc on 2023 where we're sitting at year-end, we're squarely on the lower end of that range. So we do feel like there is some room, if needed depending on sort of what we see in the acquisition landscape. But I fully expect that sort of given the normal cadence of acquisitions and that product tuck-ins are generally what we sort of normally go after. We likely won't be out borrowing to do those types of acquisitions."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as MAKO, Vocera and our recently announced agreement to acquire SERF. During the quarter, we saw strong procedural demand. We continue to expect the ortho markets will remain strong in 2024, driven by continued adoption in robotic-assisted surgery, demographics, a more favorable pricing environment and healthy patient activity levels with surgeons. While supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe, our supply is stable overall and gradually improving. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained very robust in the quarter with double-digit organic growth in medical, instruments and endoscopy. Hospital CapEx budgets remain healthy, and our capital order book remains elevated as we enter 2024. Next, specific to MAKO, we had a record quarter of installations globally. The progress of our MAKO offense, including our recent direct-to-consumer campaign, has resulted in strong growth of our installed base alongside continued increases in utilization. In the U.S., we saw 60% of knees and 34% of hips performed using MAKO as we exited the year. Globally, we exited the year with just over 40% of knees and nearing 20% of hips performed using MAKO. We have momentum, and a significant opportunity remains as MAKO adoption increases. We are nearing the two-year anniversary of our Vocera acquisition and remain very excited about the acquired assets, as it provides a platform for us to be at the intersection of medical devices, software and clinical support. With integration activities now complete, which included a migration towards the cloud as well as the commercial reorganization, we are pleased with the accelerating double-digit sales and order growth achieved as we exited the year. In 2023, we saw many cross-sell wins, including new bed business leveraging Vocera. Also, we completed the seamless experience created between the Vocera platform and both ProCuity and our new wireless structure. This year and beyond will bring even more integrations and enhancements with a focus on scalability, user experience, automated workflow and documentation. We expect strong double-digit annual sales growth to continue for years to come, and we are excited to have Vocera as part of the Stryker family. Lastly, we are progressing with our recently announced agreement to acquire SERF, and we expect the deal will close this quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Yes, Vijay. It's Jason. On VBP, I think we don't disclose in terms of the impact there. So we won't. But in terms of a follow-up to your capital question, as we think about the capital environment, really the tone has not changed there. We feel really good. Orders are very healthy. I mentioned that we came into the year with an elevated level, so we feel good. And just as a reminder, right, if you think about our capital sales, so our smaller capital being, call it 15% of our sales needs to continue to be refreshed as you think about kind of the procedural volume and then large capital being 10% of our sales, again very healthy from both an order and backlog perspective. So we feel good about that in 2024. Yes, I'll start this and Kevin, feel free obviously to weigh in. But as we think about the MAKO offense, and I think we've said this previously as well. When we think about the various options to bring MAKO to market, we've been flexible, right, whether it's leasing, rentals, et cetera. So I think we're very competitive from that standpoint. And to your comment on kind of where we are, I would still say whether it's U.S. or internationally, early innings here, we've got a lot of runway relative to MAKO. But as we think about the financing options, it's not going to be an impediment for us to expand the MAKO footprint. Hey Josh, it's Jason. First, I would say there are many hospital systems across the U.S. that are second, third system. For competitive reasons, we don't disclose kind of number of units installed. But you certainly see numerous systems with multiple MAKOs. I think as you fast forward to a shoulder and spine application, you're going to see more and more of that when you think about utilization and the need for future systems. So that's kind of how we think about that. Yes, Chris, it's Jason. And we'll talk about this more after the close. But it really is – it helps from a hip portfolio perspective. But beyond that, we haven't said much at this point. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we're set to close this quarter, and then we'll certainly talk more to that. Danielle, it's Jason. I think a couple of things, right? And Kevin even alluded to this, I think, earlier as well. But I think there's a variety of things around demographics. Kevin touched on activity levels. Certainly, that plays a part here. We talked about a more favorable pricing environment. Certainly, it plays a role. And then if you think just from an adoption standpoint with robotic-assisted surgery, I think there's a variety of dynamics at play here that have come into play in terms of elevated market levels. And if you saw what we published coming out of Investor Day, we've said over the next two years to three years, we expect this to be in kind of that mid-single-digit range. So we're certainly confident in 2024 and beyond as we think about the ortho markets."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2023 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Krista, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some other product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. Before I discuss the quarter, I would like to address the concerns around GLP-1 and what is being misunderstood. Our knee business is not at risk for a slowdown. There is an oversimplification taking place as it relates to the relationship between weight and knee replacements. This ignores the more important aspects of activity level and genetics. We are, in fact, optimistic about the positive impacts of these drugs in both the short term and the long term. In the short term, it will help to make ineligible people eligible for surgery sooner. And in the long term, it will likely lead to more surgery as people increase their activity levels. With that said, the rate and persistence of adoption of these medicines is still a large unknown as there are significant barriers to this taking place.  Lastly, as a reminder, we have a very diversified business, with knees representing about 10% of our sales. Now moving to our third quarter results. We delivered strong organic sales growth of 9.2% against last year's nearly 10% comparable despite one less selling day versus 2022. This performance included double-digit growth in MedSurg and Neurotechnology and high single-digit growth in Orthopedics and Spine, reflecting a sustained robust demand environment and our team's strong commercial execution. Our results were strong across the globe with high single-digit growth in both the U.S. and international markets. In addition, we remain focused on our pricing initiatives, once again realizing positive overall price. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.46, reflecting a 16% growth compared to the third quarter of 2022. This result was primarily driven from the strength of our sales but also demonstrates continued margin recovery.  Finally, we are narrowing our expectations for 2023 to the high end of our previously provided guidance ranges and now expect full year organic sales growth of 10% to 10.5% and earnings per share of $10.35 to $10.45 per share. Coming off full year 2022 organic sales growth of nearly 10%, a 10-plus percent organic sales growth in 2023 reflects the strength of our of innovation, and our team's sustained high performance, and we are encouraged by an important step in our margin improvement this year. I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Beach: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as capital demand, including Mako and an update on product launches. Procedural volumes remain strong, and we continue to expect patient backlog will support elevated orthopedic procedural demand through 2024. And while hospital staffing pressures and supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe, these challenges are resolving gradually and will continue to be a tailwind through the end of the year and into 2024. Demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter with double-digit organic growth in our Endoscopy and Instruments divisions. Our capital order backlog remains consistent with Q2 and elevated well above normal levels. Also, demand for Mako remains robust with strong U.S. and international installations, which will continue to drive our hips and knees business. Next, our product super cycle continues to drive positive momentum. In Q3, our 1788 camera platform moved to its full launch, which is gaining traction in the market and driving strong order growth.  In addition, we received 510(k) approval for our Pangea plating system in our Trauma and Extremities division. Pangea will be the largest launch in trauma's history and is a very comprehensive system that will facilitate complete hospital conversions. We are gearing up for a full launch in the second quarter of 2024. We have also extended the capabilities of our Vocera platform to now be compatible with our newly approved Prime Connect stretchers, the first wireless stretcher on the market. This wireless feature can be added to existing and new stretchers and will help address patient safety in the emergency room setting. These launches will continue to support our growth for multiple years. Our Mako spine and shoulder applications are on track, and we've received positive feedback from surgeons who have been exposed to the technology.  As a reminder, on November 8, we are hosting our Investor Day with the theme: Delivering Leading Growth, which will be webcast live on the Investor Relations page at stryker.com. We will have prepared remarks from numerous leaders across Stryker, followed by a guided product tour for those attending live. We will showcase several of our exciting product launches with investors and analysts having the opportunity to interact with many members of our leadership. We're excited to provide our priorities and expectations for Stryker in the coming years. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 9.2% in the quarter, the third quarter of 2023 had one less selling day than 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.3%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, almost all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.3% favorable impact on sales. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 9.3%. International organic sales growth was 8.9% and impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Europe and emerging markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.46 in the quarter was up 16% from 2022 driven by higher sales, operating margin expansion and a lower adjusted income tax rate, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange, which was unfavorable $0.02.  Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 10.3% and organic sales growth of 10.1% which included 10.9% of U.S. organic growth and 7.4% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 17.3%, and with strong double-digit growth across both its Surgical Technologies and Orthopedic instruments businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by Power Tools, SteriShield Waste Management smoke evacuation and surg account. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.6% with strong double-digit growth in its communications and sustainability businesses. In September, the Endoscopy business continued its full launch of the 1788 camera system, which provided strong sales momentum at the end of the quarter. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 5.7%, led by performances in its emergency care and stage businesses and was impacted by a strong comparable -- growth comparable in 2022 of almost 14%.  Medical continues to have a large backlog of capital orders, and we expect a solid Q4 despite a huge Q4 comparable. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 8.7%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neurocranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 14.5% which included double-digit growth in all 3 business units, neurosurgical, CMF and ENT. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 7.4% and reflecting double-digit growth in our instruments, endoscopy and neurocranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Australia, Europe and most emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 8%, which included organic growth of 6.9% in the U.S. and 10.6% internationally. Our U.S. knee business grew 5.3% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures.  Our U.S. hip business grew 3% organically, reflecting solid primary HIF growth fueled by our insignia hip Sam. The growth for both our knee and hip businesses reflects one less selling day in the quarter and a very strong comparable in 2022 of 12.4% per hips and 14% for knees. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 11.5% organically with strong performances across all businesses, led by upper extremities and foot and ankle. Our U.S. Spine business grew 5.4%, led by the performance of our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses including the recently launched Q guidance navigation system. Our U.S. other ortho increased organically by 1.8% due to higher Mako placements in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopedics and Spine grew 10.6% organically, including strong performances in Australia, Canada and most emerging markets.  Now I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.7% was favorable, approximately 210 basis points from the third quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily driven by the easing of certain cost pressures that we experienced in 2022, decreases in spot by purchases and the benefit of price and mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales, which represents a 30 basis point decrease from the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to a higher comparable in 2022 related to the ramping of cost for product launches. Our adjusted SG&A was 34.5% of sales, which was 140 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2022 due to continued investments, including sales growth incentives and a more normalized cadence of travel and meetings. We expect our full year SG&A as a percent of sales to be in line with 2019 levels as we continue to invest for growth.  In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 23.4% of sales, which was approximately 110 basis points favorable to the third quarter of 2022. This performance is driven by the aforementioned easing of certain cost pressures, primarily on gross margin. Adjusted other income and expense of $61 million for the quarter was slightly higher than 2022, driven by increased interest expense partially offset by higher interest income. The third quarter of 2023 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.2%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we now expect the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 14%. Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $1.9 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. During the quarter, we paid down $100 million of debt. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $2.2 billion, this performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections.  Considering our year-to-date results, our robust backlog for capital equipment and continued positive procedure trends, we now expect full year 2023 organic sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 10.5%. We expect pricing to be slightly positive for the full year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.6% and adjusted EPS will be unfavorably impacted from $0.10 to $0.15 per share for the full year, both of which are included in our guidance. Based on our performance in the first 9 months of the year, together with our strong sales momentum, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $10.35 to $10.45 per share. And now I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Sir, you may begin.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Congrats on another good quarter here. Kevin or Glenn, you're guiding to over 10% organic growth this year. What are some of the puts and takes to consider for next year on the top line in the bottom line. Any color on currency at this time. And we've seen a lot of companies increase their tax rate beyond '23 or guide to higher tax rate beyond '23. Anything we should be aware of with Stryker. And I had one quick follow-up.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Larry, I'll start out here and then Kevin can pile on. First of all, we're super excited about 10% to 10.5% growth for the full year 2023. And stay tuned to January, and we'll guide on 2024. As I think about currency, it's -- it was a little bit of a headwind in Q3. It's a little bit of a headwind in Q4. We don't necessarily think that it's going to get worse, but it's probably going to stay right where it is. We'll assess that for 2024 when we get to January for that guidance. And then on tax, we just continue to have some favorability on some of our discrete items and also the way our sort of global mix of taxable income is rolling up, and that has helped us tax as it relates to Pillar 2, at this point, we're not projecting really anything negative next year, if you think about our overall tax position. But of course, we'll include that in our guidance early next year. Thinking ahead, I keep talking about the super cycle of innovation. And it is really in full swing. You've seen that with the camera launch. You saw that with the amazing instruments performance in Q3 on the backs of the Neptune S launch and the power tool launch, which is really gaining momentum. And then we've got a very exciting next-generation professional defibrillator launch starting early next year. So we feel very good about our momentum really driven behind innovation and strong commercial execution.\nLawrence Biegelsen: That's helpful. And just one on the margins. I know you're going to talk about the long term, sprinting back to pre-COVID operating margins to next week at the analyst meeting. So I don't -- I know you're not going to front run that. But my question is, how much visibility do you have? And what's driving that getting back to pre-COVID margins?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. That's a good question, Larry. And we will give you more color on it next week at the analyst meeting. What I can say for now, though, is that we have pretty good visibility to the sort of our supply chain our raw material purchases. To the extent possible, we enter fixed contracts related to the pricing of that, which certainly impacts our outlook for 2024. We're not seeing any more spot buys. They basically have gone away for Q3. And so we do feel pretty positive about that. We're also feeling better about our freight as things get a little more normalized, and we're seeing less expediting of raw materials or even products. So we're in a good position there. I would tell you that all of this has a backdrop of inflation that we know we have to offset as we move forward. And as we sprint back to 2019. So we are working on that. Part of the strategy around that has really been a lot of the positive momentum that we've seen in pricing, and we will continue to work on our pricing strategies as we enter next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Great. I wanted to start on Ortho and hips and knees, and we've seen this a lot this quarter with increased seasonality. Wondering if you could speak to the trends in the quarter. Do you think you're still gaining share? And do you expect normal seasonality to return in fourth quarter?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. I'll take this question. I would say we did see what I'll call the more normal seasonality after the last few years of turbulence, starting with the pandemic. And so what that means is we think Q4 is going to be strong, seasonally strong as it was going back to '17, '18, '19. We're already seeing that kind of with the month of October. So I think we're doing fine. Our business is -- did not surprise us in terms of the results that we had. And obviously, we had giant comps from last year. If you look at the growth we had in Q3 of last year, feel very good about our position in both hips and knees and expect to have a good fourth quarter.\nRobert Marcus: Great. And maybe following up, same line of thought. Other ortho had a nice quarter. Maybe you could just speak to trends in robotics and Mako and placements and just the capital equipment environment overall?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, the capital equipment environment overall is healthy. And you see that in Endoscopy and Instruments numbers, even medical. The full year medical is going to be double-digit growth. It will be our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth in medical. Obviously, Q3 was a little softer than Q2, which was huge. And large capital does -- will vary a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, the environment is healthy. You saw the OUS numbers for other ortho are very big. So Mako is really picking up in both Asia Pacific as well as EMEA. But what we are -- so overall, just tremendous momentum across our business on the capital side.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPhilip Chickering: It's Pito. On the margins. I realized that you're not giving us margins sort of for 2024 yet. So focus on the third quarter gross margins. Can you bridge us on how you grew 220 basis points year-over-year. And how that compares to the guidance last quarter about gradual margin improvement. Are there any one timers in there? Because you're already sort of within 100 basis points of where you were in third quarter '19.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. There's a couple of pieces here. Obviously, one of the pieces is where we were a year ago as you looked at Q3 and the impacts we were feeling pretty severely from spot buys. Fast forward to where we are now, we're not seeing any spot buys. A lot of that is flushed through the income statement already. So that's some given improvement right there. We're also seeing sort of a more normalization of supply chain management. So a lot of that means we can get back to things like ocean freight and not air freighting all the time. We can have regular manufacturing scheduling and cadence which means that we don't have people cycling in and out, which is really inefficient. And so I think that combined a little bit with sort of the mix that we saw within the quarter just really helped us give a lift to the gross margin. I mean we still expect gradual improvement. And I think that's what you'll see. Keep in mind for Q4, seasonally, it's a big MS&T quarter. And so we'll feel that mix impact in Q4 in the gross margin.\nPhilip Chickering: Okay. And the follow-up question, like you talked about a big backlog in medical. Are you seeing hospital CapEx continue to grow as margins improve from hospitals? Or are you seeing any impact in the rising rate environment and/or additional pressure on physician compensation changing of hospitals to CapEx in the near term?\nJason Beach: Peter, it's Jason. I'll take this one. I think just to build on what Kevin said from a capital environment standpoint, it continues to be strong for us. And I think just to remind you, as you think about our capital, right, the large percentage of our capital is this revenue-generating capital that has to be replaced with procedures. And so that continues to be strong. And then, again, to Kevin's point on Medical, as you think about a double-digit year, the large capital continues to be strong. So really no change of tone for us as it relates to the capital environment.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: Number one, can you quantify the impact of the fewer selling days. And number two, you said that the shoulder and spine applications or may go on track. Could you remind us what on track means? And how do you see those products adopting and ramping over time?\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Great. Thanks, Joanne. What we've always said about a 1-day impact, it's roughly 1% total company. It obviously has a higher impact on implants than it does on capital equipment. But approximately a 1% total company impact. And we benefited from a day earlier in the year, I think it was Q1. And then this quarter, we lost today. The full year will be the same number of days. What we said around the timing is we expect Mako spine kind of around the middle of the year next year. That's on track. We were able to show that to some surgeons at NASS and got very good feedback on that. And that product will obviously be -- there will be a Mako application, which I've gotten to see, which is terrific. But it will also include an additional product that's coming out of our insurance division that will be used by spine surgeons as well. So we'll have a pretty tremendous ecosystem. And then shoulder will be towards the end of the year. We'll have an initial launch of shoulder. So those are the time lines we communicated previously, and we are pacing on track on both of those products.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Kevin, maybe on that last question on the Mako spine and shoulder, can you compare and contrast what a Mako application for spine and shoulder, what the launch curve should look like versus hip and knees. Are there any differences between hip and knee surgeons versus the spine market and shorter market?\nKevin Lobo: Well, I wouldn't say there's much of a difference, to be honest with you. In the case of Spine, you have to remember, we were first, right? So Mako was first. And when you're first, the uptake tends to be a little slower, to be honest. Overcoming people's objections, having to have to change management. I think if we think about spine, there are already a couple of players in the market, and we already have a very large footprint of robots in the market. So to me, that should be a faster ramp than what we saw with hips and knees. Shoulder will be different. It will be a first-time application with including bone preparation. So I think that one will probably be slower in terms of its uptake, but our shoulder business doesn't really need it. It's growing. It's been strong double digits for a long time and will continue to have an amazing pipeline. They launched a pyrocarbon product. We have the patient magical anode we have mixed reality. I mean there's just so many new products in shoulder. It's not exactly like we needed to drive high growth, but it will be, I think, very impactful. But it will -- because it involves change management, that one will probably go a little bit slower, but Spine, and especially the way we've designed it. The workflow is very, very seamless. It's very, very efficient. It's smooth. And again, it's not the first one. So I think Spine will probably be a faster uptick.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. And maybe, Glenn, one for you. The gross margin performance was pretty impressive in the quarter. When you look at the Q1 to Q3 sequential ramp here, is Q3 the right jump-off point because some of the elements you mentioned looks like they seem to be sustainable. I think free cash conversion related to that I think you had some inventory impact, should that go down for next year and see a more normalized conversion?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. No, as I said, you're right, Q3 was a very strong performance in gross margin for a lot of those reasons that I talked about. I do think you got to look at sort of first of all, seasonality relative to our gross margin, and we talked about that for the amount of MS&T that will flow through. So I do expect Q4 will moderate just a little just because of that mix issue. And then as we get into next year, we'll talk more about that at the analyst meeting.\nVijay Kumar: Great. Sorry. On free cash, would that normalize for next year?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I mean we've always targeted between 70% and 80% for free cash flow. And I don't expect that we would move away from that target.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Shagun Singh with RBC.\nShagun Chadha: Kevin, there's a lot of excitement about your super cycle of innovation and the products that you've already launched or you are yet to ramp. Could you help us better quantify the contribution in '23 and '24? Is it low hundreds of basis points in '24? I think this quarter alone, I think you beat our numbers by between 500 and 700 basis points for those segments. So it translates to about 130 basis points if you apply that to a number for '24. But just trying to do some math there. Any color would be helpful.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Shagun, thanks for the question. We really haven't been in the habit of providing breakouts of the impacts of new products. it really is why we drive at the high end of med tech, why we consistently outperform the market by roughly 300 basis points. That's the formula. Consistent cadence of new products combined with really great sales force execution through our decentralized business units. That's the Stryker model. What's interesting about this cycle is, as you point out, it's probably a little bit of a greater impact coming from organic innovation because so many really impactful products are all launching around the same time. I mean if you look at electronic extremities business, that double-digit growth performance is pretty impressive. And we don't really talk about trauma extremities nearly enough. And then we have this Pangea system, which we showed at the OTA conference recently, just in the last 2 weeks, and the feedback was incredibly positive. Now that won't impact our business until the second quarter of next year, but we are ramping up for the launch.  Feedback from surgeons was amazing. It's the biggest launch they've ever had, which is going to fuel even more growth on top of an already high-performing business. So I think the way to think about it is just we can count on Stryker to outperforming the market very consistently because of these new products and breaking out how much of that versus how much is price on new products and mix. And we're not going to get into parsing those elements. But rest assured that, that is the engine of growth for our company.\nShagun Chadha: Got it. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up. Can you just remind us how you define Stryker's performance at the high end of med tech. So how do you define that growth range?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Historically, we've said 200 to 300 basis points higher than the market, Shagun. I would say, right now, it's tracking more towards 300 basis points faster. The market has improved clearly versus where it was a few years ago. but we continue to outperform it at that kind of level.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: I want to dovetail on Shagun's Cajuns question and also Larry's earlier question on '24 and asking the way, I appreciate you guys have always been at the higher end of med tech. But Kevin, when you think about some of the puts and takes that you've outlined, be it robust orthopedic demand, offset by some of the staffing issues that we're seeing in hospitals. Do you anticipate '24 to be at a growth rate similar to kind of what we think of as historical net debt growth rates in that 4% to 5% range.\nJason Beach: Ryan, it's Jason. I'll just jump in here and then we'll open it up for your follow-up. But as we think about 2024, obviously, we will get into that more in January. I can give you a little bit more detail. But at this point, we won't comment any further in terms of how we're thinking about the top line.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay. I had to try it in a different way. So I appreciate it. All right. I'll turn -- I'll shift directions then. And just ask, your head of your knee business just gave an interview actually yesterday that I thought was really interesting. And you disclosed that there's about 300 robots from Mako that is in ASCs today. And I'm wondering where you see that market topping out at or where you see from a socket perspective? I mean if there's 12,000 ASCs in the U.S. today, I mean there's no way that all of them can own a robot, although that would be nice to think I guess I'm curious kind of as we thought -- as we've seen the ramp of Mako, I mean, initially, it was maybe 2,000 hospitals and then it was potentially all 5,000 hospitals in the U.S. it's early days in ASC, but where do you think that can go over time as you sit here today?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Listen, Mako is performing extremely well in the ASC. And just as a reminder, right now, at our hip and knees procedures roughly, call it, 12% of those are being done in ASCs. That number is growing dramatically and will continue to grow dramatically. And as surgeons move their business to the ASC, they do not want to suffer. They want the best technology, they want Mako. So I see tremendous upside in Makos in the ASC because they want to be able to do it, it lends itself very well. There's less instruments, which means less pressure on sterilization, which is a major bottleneck within ASCs. They don't have the same room for sterilization that hospitals do. So it's actually a very, very effective product to have in the ASC. And so as that percentage of 12% moves and based on different pundits, it's somewhere between 30%, 40%, as that goes higher, you're going to see more and more robots being installed in these ASCs.  So there is a significant upside in front of us here in the United States. And frankly, ASCs, now they're starting to talk about it in multiple countries in Europe. In Switzerland, they're talking about it in Germany, they're talking about and in the U.K. They're starting to figure out that this model is actually a good model for the delivery of health care. Good for surgeons, good for staff. Staff, frankly, nurses love going to ASCs. We're having less issues on staffing and surgery centers than we are in hospitals and good for the patients. Patients actually like going to a place where there aren't sick people and where there's easy parking and where you can go home the same day.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O’Brien: Kevin, that Mako line this quarter was pretty eye-popping. So I'm kind of wondering, J&J launched the system at WS this year. I'm not sure it's all that great. But -- but Zimmer was pushing as well. Did you see a pause in the market with some of those dynamics? And then that's kind of behind you now and you're winning a disproportionate share of Mako sales placements? And then specifically within there, are you getting more of those placements into competitive accounts that you have historically? Or is it still kind of a reasonable mix between existing shrinker accounts and then competitive.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. We're not really seeing much of a change in the mix between competitive and, let's call it, Stryker-friendly accounts. It's pretty similar as it's been, frankly, throughout the launch. There really hasn't -- it's really people who want technology, and are really looking for the best that they can get. And what we saw with the competitive products came on the market is we saw a little bit of a slowdown as they evaluated side-by-side different companies. But it was pretty modest. And I would say now, really, we're not concerned about comparison side by side. We frankly encourage that, that they look at the product side by side. We really believe we have the best solution for hip and knee replacement in the same robot. And then, of course, look forward to adding other applications, again, to the same robot with the spine and shoulder in the coming periods.\nMatthew O’Brien: It makes sense. And then Kevin, again, you touched on this at the beginning, but GLP is a dominated a conversation for all of us on this call. There's some Shanghai data out there about a big reduction in knee replacements in that study, although I'm not sure that study is all that robust. There's another OA study coming out fairly soon that we're all looking at. I'm just curious what Stryker looked at internally that gives you that comfort that you can tell investors confidently that this is not going to be an issue, not necessarily now, but in 2, 3, 5 years from now, and then I don't know if you can talk a little bit about some of these near-term benefits that you're seeing in terms of some patients that have lost weight that are now eligible get a knee or hip replacement.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks. Look, I'm not going to use today's call for this because we have an Analyst Day next week in Investor Day, and we're going to have a surgeon there, and we'll actually devote some time to the GLP discussion. What I would tell you is the study is saying that there's going to be a reduction, I think, our nonsense. And here at the August meeting in Dallas right now, spent the morning talking to multiple surgeons at massively credible teaching hospitals, world renowned teaching hospitals who have poured through the research and feel that there is no need for us to worry whatsoever about any slowdown in our knee procedures.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen.\nEric Anderson: This is Eric on for Josh. Looking at spine, there's been some consolidation in the last few quarters. And I was just wondering if you could share a little more detail on your observations in that market. Do you think you're benefiting from any share shifts? Are you making any competitive rev hires? Any detail there would be great.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, it's still early days, if you're thinking about the big consolidation that's occurring, and it's not the only one, right, that the last 4 or 5 years, we've seen quite a bit of consolidation. There's still more operators in spine than we see in some of our other specialties. But I think one of the drivers of the consolidation is enabling technologies. It really is sort of ticket to the dense to be successful long term is having really good enabling technologies. Our Q guidance system, we're delighted with the performance of that with the fastest camera in the market, which we developed internally at Stryker. And that QCard will then be paired with Mako in the future, which is really exciting and will provide an even smaller footprint than what you see with the other spine enabling technology ecosystem. So I think that's really the catalyst for the future is -- and that will probably provide even more consolidation going forward. But as it relates to sales force a little early days right now, not a lot of change. I think you're going to see more of that change as we roll into next year when they have to decide who's in which territory, in which person. They're sort of holding things constant for now. but that disruption will come, and we look forward to taking advantage of that however we can.\nEric Anderson: Understood. And then maybe on M&A, I was just curious to hear your latest thoughts on deals given the current market environment. And secondly, are there any areas of the portfolio organic growth?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. First of all, I would say today, every division has targets for inorganic growth. So the -- we have a decentralized business development model at Stryker. And every division has a list of companies, and they're just waiting for our cash position to improve such that we can start doing more deals. Obviously, we've done a couple of deals this year between the Cerus deal and the Palm deal within our Instruments division. But we are lining up targets. There are numerous opportunities. The landscape is pretty rich with targets. Valuations, in some cases, have come down, which is not a bad thing. But on the other hand, interest rates have gone up. So the hurdle rate to achieve the right level of financials is raised a little bit. But we're feeling good. We're paying down debt in line with what we had committed to the rating agencies. And Glenn, how do you feel about our willingness to start doing deals?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, I think we -- we will live up to our commitments and assertions relative to our debt position at the point we get to the end of this year. And so to Kevin's point, there's a long list from all of our divisions in terms of potential acquisitions. I wouldn't say that we really sort of sat on our hands during this period of time. We have engaged with several companies to look at the possibilities. So I do think that M&A is a big part of our growth strategy moving forward, and I'm certain that we'll pick up the pace in 2024.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Just a quick follow-up on the M&A question. Just curious if you'd put a little bit of framework around some of the size of deals you're willing to do or what we should kind of expect when you move into some of the larger deals you've commented on in '24.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, M&A is very fluid. We're not going to really comment on size of deals. Over time, obviously, the larger volume of our deals are going to be smaller tuck-ins, but our debt-to-equity ratio is getting right around close to that 2.5 level. That's a nice level to be -- to hit. And once we hit that level, then we have the freedom to be able to do what I call main course size deals. I think we've been on an appetizer diet towards the end of last year and into this year. And we have the capacity to be able to do $1 billion deals if they present themselves and if the returns are strong. So not going to predict exactly what will happen, but we're going to get back to kind of our normal offense in M&A that you saw for the last 10 years prior to the big spending on right Medical in Vocera.\nTravis Steed: Great. That's helpful. And then I know you're not going to give the answer, but just curious if you kind of level set what we should expect at the Analyst Day. Are you going to give some sort of revenue and margin long-range plan? It sounds like '24 guidance won't be until January. Just curious if we kind of level set what we should expect there.\nJason Beach: Yes, Trav, this is Jason. A couple of comments I would say. First off, to your point, as it relates to specifically 2024, we'll get into that more in January. As you think about Investor Day next week. It will be kind of the more of the long-range plan. We've certainly talked about sprinting back to 2019 margins. You'll hear more about that and when we'll get back there. And then also just how we think about growth over the next 3 years as well. So -- but again, we'll narrow in on 2024 in January.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter from Truth Bank.\nRichard Newitter: Just coming off at a couple of weeks ago, I figured that ask a question on the Spine robot. It sounds like you guys are still very optimistic on the timing for a launch, I guess, I think it's in half of next year. Just correct me if I'm wrong on that. we heard from Medtronic, they've already got and adapted the Mazor system to get to a bone-cutting capability. I'd love to just hear what kind of capability should we expect with your initial launch from an indication standpoint, should we expect you to be at a point where others second, third, fourth generations are -- or are you going to be starting off walk before you can run pedicle screws and stay tuned.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Listen, yes, we're targeting kind of, let's call it, Q3 for the spine robot on Mako. What I'd say is that we -- the Mako launch for spine will be for Pedicle group placement, but it is a fabulous workflow faster than what's on the market today. and smoother. So I'm really pleased with what I've seen with our Mako Spine robot. In addition, I keep mentioning we have this additional product that will be launched within the same ecosystem using the same navigation card that does bone cutting. It is not specifically the Mako product. It's a different product, but it operates within the same ecosystem. So I believe that we'll go from today being behind being ahead of the market with the launch of those two. And those two products are coming at the same time. So the other product, the bone cutting product will arrive at the same time as Mako and provide a really fabulous ecosystem.\nRichard Newitter: Okay. And then just on augmented reality, can we assume that the application you have in shoulder, I think, for right now, that's going to go to other orthopedic areas. Do you have any time lines for that? Or is that something we'll hear more about next week.\nKevin Lobo: Look, I'm not sure we're going to tell you a lot more about it next week, but we're big believers. And well, the term we use is mistreality so that we can actually sort of see through the rest of the room and also see the screens. We're big believers in mixed reality. It's going to be a big part of the future. So you don't have to look sideways when you're doing procedures, you look right into the into the surgical field. But I'm not sure we're ready to give you time lines on that. But that's something we believe is going to be powerful. We're already seeing some of the value with shoulder, and we have every intention of expanding that to other applications in the years ahead.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley.\nAndrew Ranieri: Kevin, for you, you were talking about your strong U.S. and OUS knees replacement growth. But you're also talking about change management when it comes to maybe the spine or the shoulder application. When you do think about OUS geographies for Mako, can you just talk about the utilization that you do see for hips and knees because there's a bit of a change management there. Robotics is fairly new OUS. But are you seeing any type of acceleration compared to what you saw in the early days of U.S. launch?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Listen, we're right now in Asia Pacific and even outside of, let's say, the U.K., the -- let's call it the rest of EMEA. We're kind of right now where we were 5, 6 years ago in the United States. So we're seeing an inflection point. We're seeing things really start to take off in -- not in Australia because that was a fast adopter. But in Japan, for sure, in India for sure, in some of the other European countries where it's really starting to take off. And it's kind of the inflection point. We saw this sort of terrific growth here in the U.S., started about 5, 6 years ago. That is now starting to happen in these other markets, really, really exciting. And you see that with the other ortho number, just kind of starting to pop. And you see that in the hip-and-knee business, the growth that we're seeing internationally, I think that's going to be a gift that will keep on giving for the next few years because it took us a while, honestly, to get going in some of these markets, and we're now starting to hit our stride and feeling very bullish about the future make on.  This is just with hips and knees forget about not even thinking about spine and shoulder, just -- it was -- it just took a little longer to get surgeons on board to figure out the model, to get the MPS training, to get the language translation, there's all these steps we had to sort of go through we've been through that, and now we're starting to really realize terrific growth. And I think that will continue in the years ahead.\nAndrew Ranieri: Maybe I'll save this one for next week, but just on GLP-1, just talking to a couple of ortho surgeons ourselves. I got the sense that they actually do heavier BMI patients still manually versus robotics. If you do actually see a near-term benefit as these patients do lose weight, would you expect to see more of a mix benefit on Mako or just kind of a rising tide lifts all ships for your knee business.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. To me, it's a rising tide lifts all ships. And whether they do manually or doing with Mako, that's really a surgeon choice. It's not really tied to how thin or how heavy somebody is, whether they choose to do it manure to robotically.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thank you so much. And I actually had a question, I'm sure you guys will talk about this more next week, so sorry if I'm front-running that. But international looks pretty strong this quarter. Just curious about what you can say, what's driving that growth and how sustainable is that? And then the second part of the question is on the orthopedic backlog and whether the magnitude of the backlog this quarter versus last and the quarter prior, has come down. Appreciate you believe it's going to continue to contribute into 2024. But I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of that contribution going forward, how we should think about that.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. Listen, I'm super excited about international. As you know, we've now hadfive consecutive years of international growing faster than U.S. This year, we're on pace to be the sixth consecutive year. And as I mentioned earlier on the call, Mako is only just starting to really gain steam in a lot of international markets. Our camera business is gaining steam in the international market. So I think we're really poised and next week, we -- as part of our agenda, we have an international panel that we're going to hold. We have a number of our leaders from our international markets will be there on the panel and even available in the walk around time to be able to chat with all of the investors and analysts. So we feel bullish about international. That has not always been the case. If you remember 10 years ago, that was a sore spot for us. it's still a source of tremendous upside. If you look at our business, over 70% of our sales are still in the United States. So we still have tremendous potential in international, and that should last for a long time to come. And then the second part, Jason.\nJason Beach: Yes, I'll take the second part here, Danielle. So as it relates to kind of procedural backlog, and similar to what I said in my prepared remarks, procedures are strong, right? And so as we think about kind of Q4 and into next year, I'm not going to try to quantify in terms of percentages of growth that comes with that. But we do think that we'll remain elevated kind of well into next year. And every quarter, we reassess that based on intelligence that we have, talking to surgeons, et cetera. But we do expect it will continue to be a moderate tailwind into next year.\nOperator: The last question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies.\nYang Li: This is Yang Li in for Matt. I guess to start, I was wondering price was positive this quarter, continuing the trend from early in the year. I guess I'm just wondering how sustainable do you think the positive price momentum can be going forward?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure. You're right. Q3 kind of continued our favorable pricing trend with sort of 0.3% coming off of Q2, that was 0.5%. And A couple of comments I would say. As we look at the full year, we think that will be positive for the full year. And we also have put in place kind of the incentive process as well as the contracting process to really make sure that we're considering price as we think about working with our customers on buying products. So I feel good that we have the sort of mechanism that is going to continue to look at price. That being said, you're absolutely right. We'll anniversary on product over product year-over-year, which may make things a little bit tougher.  One thing that I would keep in mind though, that Kevin talks about this product super cycle and a lot of next-gen products coming out. So if you think about our pricing calculation of statistic, it really doesn't include the impact of price increases that we get on those products because of the technologies that they're bringing to market. So I think that is actually an element of pricing that's going to help us as we think about next year. And I don't think it's something going to walk away from as long as inflation is having an impact, we'll continue to have those discussions with our customers about pricing.\nYang Li: All right. Great. And then, I guess, for the follow-up, I wanted to hear a little bit more on potentially hiring more robotic or capital reps ahead of the shoulder and in robotic launches. I wanted to maybe get a better sense of how you'd be entering the market. Is it more of a hybrid sales process with the clinical reps? I mean I would assume you would focus initially on the existing customers, but maybe how long before you start going on offense and try to convert surgeons with Mako?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Listen, we have a very dedicated sales force offense that we run. So even before you think about spine or shoulder, even within joint replacement, we had specialized capital salespeople. We have the same thing with power tools. We have specialized people that sell power tools. So we don't believe in this hybrid model, we're going to have dedicated capital reps, and they will go to the market and they will sell to competitive and new surgeons right out of the gate. That's what they do. And that's what we do at Stryker. So I wouldn't expect that we would just go to our friendlies. We're going to go to people that want technology, and we really don't care if they're existing customers or if they're competitive customers because the -- there really is -- we don't like to have implant reps also selling capital. It's just not our model. And so we think we can solve more and faster if we have these dedicated people, and we'll have that dedicated approach as we add additional applications to make.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Investor Day with you on November 8 and our fourth quarter and full year results with you in January 2024. Thank you.\nOperator: This call has concluded. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some other product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. Before I discuss the quarter, I would like to address the concerns around GLP-1 and what is being misunderstood. Our knee business is not at risk for a slowdown. There is an oversimplification taking place as it relates to the relationship between weight and knee replacements. This ignores the more important aspects of activity level and genetics. We are, in fact, optimistic about the positive impacts of these drugs in both the short term and the long term. In the short term, it will help to make ineligible people eligible for surgery sooner. And in the long term, it will likely lead to more surgery as people increase their activity levels. With that said, the rate and persistence of adoption of these medicines is still a large unknown as there are significant barriers to this taking place.  Lastly, as a reminder, we have a very diversified business, with knees representing about 10% of our sales. Now moving to our third quarter results. We delivered strong organic sales growth of 9.2% against last year's nearly 10% comparable despite one less selling day versus 2022. This performance included double-digit growth in MedSurg and Neurotechnology and high single-digit growth in Orthopedics and Spine, reflecting a sustained robust demand environment and our team's strong commercial execution. Our results were strong across the globe with high single-digit growth in both the U.S. and international markets. In addition, we remain focused on our pricing initiatives, once again realizing positive overall price. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.46, reflecting a 16% growth compared to the third quarter of 2022. This result was primarily driven from the strength of our sales but also demonstrates continued margin recovery.  Finally, we are narrowing our expectations for 2023 to the high end of our previously provided guidance ranges and now expect full year organic sales growth of 10% to 10.5% and earnings per share of $10.35 to $10.45 per share. Coming off full year 2022 organic sales growth of nearly 10%, a 10-plus percent organic sales growth in 2023 reflects the strength of our of innovation, and our team's sustained high performance, and we are encouraged by an important step in our margin improvement this year. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Yes, sure. I'll take this question. I would say we did see what I'll call the more normal seasonality after the last few years of turbulence, starting with the pandemic. And so what that means is we think Q4 is going to be strong, seasonally strong as it was going back to '17, '18, '19. We're already seeing that kind of with the month of October. So I think we're doing fine. Our business is -- did not surprise us in terms of the results that we had. And obviously, we had giant comps from last year. If you look at the growth we had in Q3 of last year, feel very good about our position in both hips and knees and expect to have a good fourth quarter. Yes. Look, the capital equipment environment overall is healthy. And you see that in Endoscopy and Instruments numbers, even medical. The full year medical is going to be double-digit growth. It will be our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth in medical. Obviously, Q3 was a little softer than Q2, which was huge. And large capital does -- will vary a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, the environment is healthy. You saw the OUS numbers for other ortho are very big. So Mako is really picking up in both Asia Pacific as well as EMEA. But what we are -- so overall, just tremendous momentum across our business on the capital side. Okay. Great. Thanks, Joanne. What we've always said about a 1-day impact, it's roughly 1% total company. It obviously has a higher impact on implants than it does on capital equipment. But approximately a 1% total company impact. And we benefited from a day earlier in the year, I think it was Q1. And then this quarter, we lost today. The full year will be the same number of days. What we said around the timing is we expect Mako spine kind of around the middle of the year next year. That's on track. We were able to show that to some surgeons at NASS and got very good feedback on that. And that product will obviously be -- there will be a Mako application, which I've gotten to see, which is terrific. But it will also include an additional product that's coming out of our insurance division that will be used by spine surgeons as well. So we'll have a pretty tremendous ecosystem. And then shoulder will be towards the end of the year. We'll have an initial launch of shoulder. So those are the time lines we communicated previously, and we are pacing on track on both of those products. Well, I wouldn't say there's much of a difference, to be honest with you. In the case of Spine, you have to remember, we were first, right? So Mako was first. And when you're first, the uptake tends to be a little slower, to be honest. Overcoming people's objections, having to have to change management. I think if we think about spine, there are already a couple of players in the market, and we already have a very large footprint of robots in the market. So to me, that should be a faster ramp than what we saw with hips and knees. Shoulder will be different. It will be a first-time application with including bone preparation. So I think that one will probably be slower in terms of its uptake, but our shoulder business doesn't really need it. It's growing. It's been strong double digits for a long time and will continue to have an amazing pipeline. They launched a pyrocarbon product. We have the patient magical anode we have mixed reality. I mean there's just so many new products in shoulder. It's not exactly like we needed to drive high growth, but it will be, I think, very impactful. But it will -- because it involves change management, that one will probably go a little bit slower, but Spine, and especially the way we've designed it. The workflow is very, very seamless. It's very, very efficient. It's smooth. And again, it's not the first one. So I think Spine will probably be a faster uptick. Yes. Shagun, thanks for the question. We really haven't been in the habit of providing breakouts of the impacts of new products. it really is why we drive at the high end of med tech, why we consistently outperform the market by roughly 300 basis points. That's the formula. Consistent cadence of new products combined with really great sales force execution through our decentralized business units. That's the Stryker model. What's interesting about this cycle is, as you point out, it's probably a little bit of a greater impact coming from organic innovation because so many really impactful products are all launching around the same time. I mean if you look at electronic extremities business, that double-digit growth performance is pretty impressive. And we don't really talk about trauma extremities nearly enough. And then we have this Pangea system, which we showed at the OTA conference recently, just in the last 2 weeks, and the feedback was incredibly positive. Now that won't impact our business until the second quarter of next year, but we are ramping up for the launch.  Feedback from surgeons was amazing. It's the biggest launch they've ever had, which is going to fuel even more growth on top of an already high-performing business. So I think the way to think about it is just we can count on Stryker to outperforming the market very consistently because of these new products and breaking out how much of that versus how much is price on new products and mix. And we're not going to get into parsing those elements. But rest assured that, that is the engine of growth for our company. Yes. Historically, we've said 200 to 300 basis points higher than the market, Shagun. I would say, right now, it's tracking more towards 300 basis points faster. The market has improved clearly versus where it was a few years ago. but we continue to outperform it at that kind of level. Yes. Listen, Mako is performing extremely well in the ASC. And just as a reminder, right now, at our hip and knees procedures roughly, call it, 12% of those are being done in ASCs. That number is growing dramatically and will continue to grow dramatically. And as surgeons move their business to the ASC, they do not want to suffer. They want the best technology, they want Mako. So I see tremendous upside in Makos in the ASC because they want to be able to do it, it lends itself very well. There's less instruments, which means less pressure on sterilization, which is a major bottleneck within ASCs. They don't have the same room for sterilization that hospitals do. So it's actually a very, very effective product to have in the ASC. And so as that percentage of 12% moves and based on different pundits, it's somewhere between 30%, 40%, as that goes higher, you're going to see more and more robots being installed in these ASCs.  So there is a significant upside in front of us here in the United States. And frankly, ASCs, now they're starting to talk about it in multiple countries in Europe. In Switzerland, they're talking about it in Germany, they're talking about and in the U.K. They're starting to figure out that this model is actually a good model for the delivery of health care. Good for surgeons, good for staff. Staff, frankly, nurses love going to ASCs. We're having less issues on staffing and surgery centers than we are in hospitals and good for the patients. Patients actually like going to a place where there aren't sick people and where there's easy parking and where you can go home the same day. Yes. We're not really seeing much of a change in the mix between competitive and, let's call it, Stryker-friendly accounts. It's pretty similar as it's been, frankly, throughout the launch. There really hasn't -- it's really people who want technology, and are really looking for the best that they can get. And what we saw with the competitive products came on the market is we saw a little bit of a slowdown as they evaluated side-by-side different companies. But it was pretty modest. And I would say now, really, we're not concerned about comparison side by side. We frankly encourage that, that they look at the product side by side. We really believe we have the best solution for hip and knee replacement in the same robot. And then, of course, look forward to adding other applications, again, to the same robot with the spine and shoulder in the coming periods. Yes. Thanks. Look, I'm not going to use today's call for this because we have an Analyst Day next week in Investor Day, and we're going to have a surgeon there, and we'll actually devote some time to the GLP discussion. What I would tell you is the study is saying that there's going to be a reduction, I think, our nonsense. And here at the August meeting in Dallas right now, spent the morning talking to multiple surgeons at massively credible teaching hospitals, world renowned teaching hospitals who have poured through the research and feel that there is no need for us to worry whatsoever about any slowdown in our knee procedures. Yes. Look, it's still early days, if you're thinking about the big consolidation that's occurring, and it's not the only one, right, that the last 4 or 5 years, we've seen quite a bit of consolidation. There's still more operators in spine than we see in some of our other specialties. But I think one of the drivers of the consolidation is enabling technologies. It really is sort of ticket to the dense to be successful long term is having really good enabling technologies. Our Q guidance system, we're delighted with the performance of that with the fastest camera in the market, which we developed internally at Stryker. And that QCard will then be paired with Mako in the future, which is really exciting and will provide an even smaller footprint than what you see with the other spine enabling technology ecosystem. So I think that's really the catalyst for the future is -- and that will probably provide even more consolidation going forward. But as it relates to sales force a little early days right now, not a lot of change. I think you're going to see more of that change as we roll into next year when they have to decide who's in which territory, in which person. They're sort of holding things constant for now. but that disruption will come, and we look forward to taking advantage of that however we can. Yes. First of all, I would say today, every division has targets for inorganic growth. So the -- we have a decentralized business development model at Stryker. And every division has a list of companies, and they're just waiting for our cash position to improve such that we can start doing more deals. Obviously, we've done a couple of deals this year between the Cerus deal and the Palm deal within our Instruments division. But we are lining up targets. There are numerous opportunities. The landscape is pretty rich with targets. Valuations, in some cases, have come down, which is not a bad thing. But on the other hand, interest rates have gone up. So the hurdle rate to achieve the right level of financials is raised a little bit. But we're feeling good. We're paying down debt in line with what we had committed to the rating agencies. And Glenn, how do you feel about our willingness to start doing deals? Yes. Look, M&A is very fluid. We're not going to really comment on size of deals. Over time, obviously, the larger volume of our deals are going to be smaller tuck-ins, but our debt-to-equity ratio is getting right around close to that 2.5 level. That's a nice level to be -- to hit. And once we hit that level, then we have the freedom to be able to do what I call main course size deals. I think we've been on an appetizer diet towards the end of last year and into this year. And we have the capacity to be able to do $1 billion deals if they present themselves and if the returns are strong. So not going to predict exactly what will happen, but we're going to get back to kind of our normal offense in M&A that you saw for the last 10 years prior to the big spending on right Medical in Vocera. Yes. Listen, yes, we're targeting kind of, let's call it, Q3 for the spine robot on Mako. What I'd say is that we -- the Mako launch for spine will be for Pedicle group placement, but it is a fabulous workflow faster than what's on the market today. and smoother. So I'm really pleased with what I've seen with our Mako Spine robot. In addition, I keep mentioning we have this additional product that will be launched within the same ecosystem using the same navigation card that does bone cutting. It is not specifically the Mako product. It's a different product, but it operates within the same ecosystem. So I believe that we'll go from today being behind being ahead of the market with the launch of those two. And those two products are coming at the same time. So the other product, the bone cutting product will arrive at the same time as Mako and provide a really fabulous ecosystem. Look, I'm not sure we're going to tell you a lot more about it next week, but we're big believers. And well, the term we use is mistreality so that we can actually sort of see through the rest of the room and also see the screens. We're big believers in mixed reality. It's going to be a big part of the future. So you don't have to look sideways when you're doing procedures, you look right into the into the surgical field. But I'm not sure we're ready to give you time lines on that. But that's something we believe is going to be powerful. We're already seeing some of the value with shoulder, and we have every intention of expanding that to other applications in the years ahead. Yes. Listen, we're right now in Asia Pacific and even outside of, let's say, the U.K., the -- let's call it the rest of EMEA. We're kind of right now where we were 5, 6 years ago in the United States. So we're seeing an inflection point. We're seeing things really start to take off in -- not in Australia because that was a fast adopter. But in Japan, for sure, in India for sure, in some of the other European countries where it's really starting to take off. And it's kind of the inflection point. We saw this sort of terrific growth here in the U.S., started about 5, 6 years ago. That is now starting to happen in these other markets, really, really exciting. And you see that with the other ortho number, just kind of starting to pop. And you see that in the hip-and-knee business, the growth that we're seeing internationally, I think that's going to be a gift that will keep on giving for the next few years because it took us a while, honestly, to get going in some of these markets, and we're now starting to hit our stride and feeling very bullish about the future make on.  This is just with hips and knees forget about not even thinking about spine and shoulder, just -- it was -- it just took a little longer to get surgeons on board to figure out the model, to get the MPS training, to get the language translation, there's all these steps we had to sort of go through we've been through that, and now we're starting to really realize terrific growth. And I think that will continue in the years ahead. Yes. To me, it's a rising tide lifts all ships. And whether they do manually or doing with Mako, that's really a surgeon choice. It's not really tied to how thin or how heavy somebody is, whether they choose to do it manure to robotically. Yes, sure. Listen, I'm super excited about international. As you know, we've now hadfive consecutive years of international growing faster than U.S. This year, we're on pace to be the sixth consecutive year. And as I mentioned earlier on the call, Mako is only just starting to really gain steam in a lot of international markets. Our camera business is gaining steam in the international market. So I think we're really poised and next week, we -- as part of our agenda, we have an international panel that we're going to hold. We have a number of our leaders from our international markets will be there on the panel and even available in the walk around time to be able to chat with all of the investors and analysts. So we feel bullish about international. That has not always been the case. If you remember 10 years ago, that was a sore spot for us. it's still a source of tremendous upside. If you look at our business, over 70% of our sales are still in the United States. So we still have tremendous potential in international, and that should last for a long time to come. And then the second part, Jason. Yes. Listen, we have a very dedicated sales force offense that we run. So even before you think about spine or shoulder, even within joint replacement, we had specialized capital salespeople. We have the same thing with power tools. We have specialized people that sell power tools. So we don't believe in this hybrid model, we're going to have dedicated capital reps, and they will go to the market and they will sell to competitive and new surgeons right out of the gate. That's what they do. And that's what we do at Stryker. So I wouldn't expect that we would just go to our friendlies. We're going to go to people that want technology, and we really don't care if they're existing customers or if they're competitive customers because the -- there really is -- we don't like to have implant reps also selling capital. It's just not our model. And so we think we can solve more and faster if we have these dedicated people, and we'll have that dedicated approach as we add additional applications to make. Thank you for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Investor Day with you on November 8 and our fourth quarter and full year results with you in January 2024. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 9.2% in the quarter, the third quarter of 2023 had one less selling day than 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.3%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, almost all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.3% favorable impact on sales. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 9.3%. International organic sales growth was 8.9% and impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Europe and emerging markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.46 in the quarter was up 16% from 2022 driven by higher sales, operating margin expansion and a lower adjusted income tax rate, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange, which was unfavorable $0.02.  Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 10.3% and organic sales growth of 10.1% which included 10.9% of U.S. organic growth and 7.4% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 17.3%, and with strong double-digit growth across both its Surgical Technologies and Orthopedic instruments businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by Power Tools, SteriShield Waste Management smoke evacuation and surg account. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.6% with strong double-digit growth in its communications and sustainability businesses. In September, the Endoscopy business continued its full launch of the 1788 camera system, which provided strong sales momentum at the end of the quarter. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 5.7%, led by performances in its emergency care and stage businesses and was impacted by a strong comparable -- growth comparable in 2022 of almost 14%.  Medical continues to have a large backlog of capital orders, and we expect a solid Q4 despite a huge Q4 comparable. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 8.7%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neurocranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 14.5% which included double-digit growth in all 3 business units, neurosurgical, CMF and ENT. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 7.4% and reflecting double-digit growth in our instruments, endoscopy and neurocranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Australia, Europe and most emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 8%, which included organic growth of 6.9% in the U.S. and 10.6% internationally. Our U.S. knee business grew 5.3% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures.  Our U.S. hip business grew 3% organically, reflecting solid primary HIF growth fueled by our insignia hip Sam. The growth for both our knee and hip businesses reflects one less selling day in the quarter and a very strong comparable in 2022 of 12.4% per hips and 14% for knees. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 11.5% organically with strong performances across all businesses, led by upper extremities and foot and ankle. Our U.S. Spine business grew 5.4%, led by the performance of our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses including the recently launched Q guidance navigation system. Our U.S. other ortho increased organically by 1.8% due to higher Mako placements in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopedics and Spine grew 10.6% organically, including strong performances in Australia, Canada and most emerging markets.  Now I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.7% was favorable, approximately 210 basis points from the third quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily driven by the easing of certain cost pressures that we experienced in 2022, decreases in spot by purchases and the benefit of price and mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales, which represents a 30 basis point decrease from the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to a higher comparable in 2022 related to the ramping of cost for product launches. Our adjusted SG&A was 34.5% of sales, which was 140 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2022 due to continued investments, including sales growth incentives and a more normalized cadence of travel and meetings. We expect our full year SG&A as a percent of sales to be in line with 2019 levels as we continue to invest for growth.  In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 23.4% of sales, which was approximately 110 basis points favorable to the third quarter of 2022. This performance is driven by the aforementioned easing of certain cost pressures, primarily on gross margin. Adjusted other income and expense of $61 million for the quarter was slightly higher than 2022, driven by increased interest expense partially offset by higher interest income. The third quarter of 2023 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.2%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we now expect the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 14%. Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $1.9 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. During the quarter, we paid down $100 million of debt. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $2.2 billion, this performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections.  Considering our year-to-date results, our robust backlog for capital equipment and continued positive procedure trends, we now expect full year 2023 organic sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 10.5%. We expect pricing to be slightly positive for the full year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.6% and adjusted EPS will be unfavorably impacted from $0.10 to $0.15 per share for the full year, both of which are included in our guidance. Based on our performance in the first 9 months of the year, together with our strong sales momentum, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $10.35 to $10.45 per share. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Larry, I'll start out here and then Kevin can pile on. First of all, we're super excited about 10% to 10.5% growth for the full year 2023. And stay tuned to January, and we'll guide on 2024. As I think about currency, it's -- it was a little bit of a headwind in Q3. It's a little bit of a headwind in Q4. We don't necessarily think that it's going to get worse, but it's probably going to stay right where it is. We'll assess that for 2024 when we get to January for that guidance. And then on tax, we just continue to have some favorability on some of our discrete items and also the way our sort of global mix of taxable income is rolling up, and that has helped us tax as it relates to Pillar 2, at this point, we're not projecting really anything negative next year, if you think about our overall tax position. But of course, we'll include that in our guidance early next year. Thinking ahead, I keep talking about the super cycle of innovation. And it is really in full swing. You've seen that with the camera launch. You saw that with the amazing instruments performance in Q3 on the backs of the Neptune S launch and the power tool launch, which is really gaining momentum. And then we've got a very exciting next-generation professional defibrillator launch starting early next year. So we feel very good about our momentum really driven behind innovation and strong commercial execution. Yes. That's a good question, Larry. And we will give you more color on it next week at the analyst meeting. What I can say for now, though, is that we have pretty good visibility to the sort of our supply chain our raw material purchases. To the extent possible, we enter fixed contracts related to the pricing of that, which certainly impacts our outlook for 2024. We're not seeing any more spot buys. They basically have gone away for Q3. And so we do feel pretty positive about that. We're also feeling better about our freight as things get a little more normalized, and we're seeing less expediting of raw materials or even products. So we're in a good position there. I would tell you that all of this has a backdrop of inflation that we know we have to offset as we move forward. And as we sprint back to 2019. So we are working on that. Part of the strategy around that has really been a lot of the positive momentum that we've seen in pricing, and we will continue to work on our pricing strategies as we enter next year. Yes. There's a couple of pieces here. Obviously, one of the pieces is where we were a year ago as you looked at Q3 and the impacts we were feeling pretty severely from spot buys. Fast forward to where we are now, we're not seeing any spot buys. A lot of that is flushed through the income statement already. So that's some given improvement right there. We're also seeing sort of a more normalization of supply chain management. So a lot of that means we can get back to things like ocean freight and not air freighting all the time. We can have regular manufacturing scheduling and cadence which means that we don't have people cycling in and out, which is really inefficient. And so I think that combined a little bit with sort of the mix that we saw within the quarter just really helped us give a lift to the gross margin. I mean we still expect gradual improvement. And I think that's what you'll see. Keep in mind for Q4, seasonally, it's a big MS&T quarter. And so we'll feel that mix impact in Q4 in the gross margin. Yes. No, as I said, you're right, Q3 was a very strong performance in gross margin for a lot of those reasons that I talked about. I do think you got to look at sort of first of all, seasonality relative to our gross margin, and we talked about that for the amount of MS&T that will flow through. So I do expect Q4 will moderate just a little just because of that mix issue. And then as we get into next year, we'll talk more about that at the analyst meeting. Yes. I mean we've always targeted between 70% and 80% for free cash flow. And I don't expect that we would move away from that target. Yes, I think we -- we will live up to our commitments and assertions relative to our debt position at the point we get to the end of this year. And so to Kevin's point, there's a long list from all of our divisions in terms of potential acquisitions. I wouldn't say that we really sort of sat on our hands during this period of time. We have engaged with several companies to look at the possibilities. So I do think that M&A is a big part of our growth strategy moving forward, and I'm certain that we'll pick up the pace in 2024. Sure. You're right. Q3 kind of continued our favorable pricing trend with sort of 0.3% coming off of Q2, that was 0.5%. And A couple of comments I would say. As we look at the full year, we think that will be positive for the full year. And we also have put in place kind of the incentive process as well as the contracting process to really make sure that we're considering price as we think about working with our customers on buying products. So I feel good that we have the sort of mechanism that is going to continue to look at price. That being said, you're absolutely right. We'll anniversary on product over product year-over-year, which may make things a little bit tougher.  One thing that I would keep in mind though, that Kevin talks about this product super cycle and a lot of next-gen products coming out. So if you think about our pricing calculation of statistic, it really doesn't include the impact of price increases that we get on those products because of the technologies that they're bringing to market. So I think that is actually an element of pricing that's going to help us as we think about next year. And I don't think it's something going to walk away from as long as inflation is having an impact, we'll continue to have those discussions with our customers about pricing."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as capital demand, including Mako and an update on product launches. Procedural volumes remain strong, and we continue to expect patient backlog will support elevated orthopedic procedural demand through 2024. And while hospital staffing pressures and supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe, these challenges are resolving gradually and will continue to be a tailwind through the end of the year and into 2024. Demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter with double-digit organic growth in our Endoscopy and Instruments divisions. Our capital order backlog remains consistent with Q2 and elevated well above normal levels. Also, demand for Mako remains robust with strong U.S. and international installations, which will continue to drive our hips and knees business. Next, our product super cycle continues to drive positive momentum. In Q3, our 1788 camera platform moved to its full launch, which is gaining traction in the market and driving strong order growth.  In addition, we received 510(k) approval for our Pangea plating system in our Trauma and Extremities division. Pangea will be the largest launch in trauma's history and is a very comprehensive system that will facilitate complete hospital conversions. We are gearing up for a full launch in the second quarter of 2024. We have also extended the capabilities of our Vocera platform to now be compatible with our newly approved Prime Connect stretchers, the first wireless stretcher on the market. This wireless feature can be added to existing and new stretchers and will help address patient safety in the emergency room setting. These launches will continue to support our growth for multiple years. Our Mako spine and shoulder applications are on track, and we've received positive feedback from surgeons who have been exposed to the technology.  As a reminder, on November 8, we are hosting our Investor Day with the theme: Delivering Leading Growth, which will be webcast live on the Investor Relations page at stryker.com. We will have prepared remarks from numerous leaders across Stryker, followed by a guided product tour for those attending live. We will showcase several of our exciting product launches with investors and analysts having the opportunity to interact with many members of our leadership. We're excited to provide our priorities and expectations for Stryker in the coming years. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Peter, it's Jason. I'll take this one. I think just to build on what Kevin said from a capital environment standpoint, it continues to be strong for us. And I think just to remind you, as you think about our capital, right, the large percentage of our capital is this revenue-generating capital that has to be replaced with procedures. And so that continues to be strong. And then, again, to Kevin's point on Medical, as you think about a double-digit year, the large capital continues to be strong. So really no change of tone for us as it relates to the capital environment. Ryan, it's Jason. I'll just jump in here and then we'll open it up for your follow-up. But as we think about 2024, obviously, we will get into that more in January. I can give you a little bit more detail. But at this point, we won't comment any further in terms of how we're thinking about the top line. Yes, Trav, this is Jason. A couple of comments I would say. First off, to your point, as it relates to specifically 2024, we'll get into that more in January. As you think about Investor Day next week. It will be kind of the more of the long-range plan. We've certainly talked about sprinting back to 2019 margins. You'll hear more about that and when we'll get back there. And then also just how we think about growth over the next 3 years as well. So -- but again, we'll narrow in on 2024 in January. Yes, I'll take the second part here, Danielle. So as it relates to kind of procedural backlog, and similar to what I said in my prepared remarks, procedures are strong, right? And so as we think about kind of Q4 and into next year, I'm not going to try to quantify in terms of percentages of growth that comes with that. But we do think that we'll remain elevated kind of well into next year. And every quarter, we reassess that based on intelligence that we have, talking to surgeons, et cetera. But we do expect it will continue to be a moderate tailwind into next year."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2023 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Todd and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company’s most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today’s press release that is an exhibit to Stryker’s current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker’s second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker’s CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today’s call, I’ll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some other updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. In the second quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 11.9% with double-digit growth in both MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and Orthopaedics and Spine. This comprehensive performance demonstrates the diverse and attractive markets that we play in and our ability to drive growth through strong commercial execution. We are also pleased with the continued positive outcomes of our globalization efforts. Our international business demonstrated strong performance with double-digit growth, complementing our strong and fast-growing U.S. business. In addition, we continue to see traction with our pricing initiatives, again delivering positive pricing in the second quarter. During the quarter, we continued to realize improvements in component availability, although disruptions remain in parts of our business. Our teams have demonstrated good agility in addressing these situations, proactively mitigating much of their impact. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.54 a share, reflecting 13% growth compared to the second quarter of 2022. This result was primarily driven from the strength of our sales but also marks the beginning of our margin recovery. We expect margins to continue to expand throughout the remainder of the year. Finally, with half the year behind us and our solid momentum, we have increased our expected full year organic sales growth to a range of 9.5% to 10.5% and increased our expected earnings per share to $10.25 to $10.45 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Beach: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as capital demand, including Mako, acquisitions and an update on product launches. Procedural volumes have largely recovered to pre-COVID levels in most countries. And while volumes are strong, patient backlog still remains, and we believe the elevated orthopedic procedural demand will continue well into 2024. While volumes have largely recovered, hospital staffing pressures and supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe. These challenges are resolving gradually as we expected and will continue to be a moderate tailwind as we move through the second half of 2023 and into 2024. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter as evidenced from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Instruments and Neuro Cranial divisions. Also, demand for Mako remains robust with strong U.S. and international performances, which is helping drive our continued growth in hips and knees. Next, capital order backlog remains elevated, well above normal levels. Also, during the quarter, we executed a small tuck-in deal and also closed on the Cerus Endovascular acquisition. Furthermore, our product super cycle continues to drive positive momentum. In late Q2, we successfully completed a limited launch of our 1788 camera platform and are poised for full launch in Q3. We also received FDA clearance for Cranial Guidance, our newest application under our Q Guidance platform. This empowers surgeons to quickly plan a safe surgical approach using multiple imaging modalities and then navigate instruments with specific surgical procedures. Finally, we remain on track for the launch of our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator outside of the U.S. in the fourth quarter of this year and in the U.S. in early 2024. These launches will continue to support growth over multiple years. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today’s press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.9% in the quarter. The second quarter’s average selling days were in line with 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.5%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.7% unfavorable impact on sales. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 12%, International organic sales growth was 11.4%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Canada, Europe and most of our emerging markets. Adjusted EPS of $2.54 in the quarter was up 12.9% from 2022, driven by higher sales and operating margin expansion, partially offset by a higher adjusted income tax rate and the impact of foreign currency exchange, which was unfavorable $0.03. Now, I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology has both constant currency and organic sales growth of 12.9%, which included 13.5% of U.S. organic growth and 10.9% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.9%, led by strong double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and surge account. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 3.5% against a strong comparable. This included strong growth in its ProCare sustainability and sports medicine businesses. The Endoscopy business completed its limited launch of the 1788 camera late in the second quarter. Consistent with prior camera launches and the related transition period between the legacy camera and the new camera, this also contributed to muted growth in Q2. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 27.2%, reflecting very strong performances in all three of its businesses, acute care, emergency care and Sage, and benefited from continued improvement in product supply during the quarter. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 9%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neuro Cranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.6%, which included double-digit growth in our Bone Mill, bipolar forceps and Max Space product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 10.9%, reflecting double-digit growth in our medical and Neuro Cranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia and Canada. Neurovascular’s growth continues to be negatively impacted by VBP in China. Orthopaedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 10.6%, which included organic growth of 10% in the U.S. and 12.1% internationally. Our U.S. Knee business grew 10.6% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Hip business grew 8.8% organically, reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia hip stem and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 14.3% organically with strong performances across all businesses led by very strong growth in upper extremities and foot and ankle. Our U.S. Spine business grew 5.2%, led by the performance of our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses, including the recently launched Q Guidance Navigation System. Our U.S. Other Ortho declined organically 1.6%, primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 12.1% organically, including strong performances in Australia, Canada and most emerging markets. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.9% was favorable, approximately 60 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and 70 basis points sequentially compared to Q1 2023. This change was primarily driven by the slight easing of certain cost pressures, decreases in spot buy purchases, improved productivity and the benefit of price, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.4% of sales, which represents an 80 basis points decrease from the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to a higher comparable in 2022 related to the ramping of costs for product launches. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.1% of sales, which was 70 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022, due to a disciplined ramp of spend and investment to support our growth. We expect our full year SG&A as a percent of sales to be in line with 2019 levels as we continue to invest for growth. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24.3% of sales which was approximately 60 basis points favorable to the second quarter of 2022. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned easing of certain cost pressures, primarily on gross margin. Adjusted other income and expense of $66 million for the quarter was slightly higher than 2022, driven by increased interest expense. The second quarter of 2023 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.2%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we reiterate our full year effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.9 billion. Approximately $100 million of the term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, reflecting year-to-date payments of $200 million and a remaining balance of $650 million. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $1.1 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections. Considering our year-to-date results, our strong backlog for capital equipment and continued positive procedural trends, we now expect full year 2023 organic sales growth to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% with pricing to be slightly positive for the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.3% and adjusted EPS will be unfavorably impacted from $0.05 to $0.10 per share for the full year, both of which are included in our guidance. Based on our performance in the first half of the year, together with our strong sales momentum, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $10.25 to $10.45 per share. And now I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Congrats on a great quarter here. Two for me. First, a great quarter. It looks like you’re raising more than the beat on both the top and bottom line. Looks like you’re taking a good amount of share still in Ortho across hips, knees and extremities, trauma. Just as we think about the balance of the year, you touched on some of them, but would love to get a sense of what gives you the confidence these elevated trends are going to continue. And any visibility on the margin side that gets you comfortable moving it up more than the beat?\nKevin Lobo: Hi Robbie, it’s Kevin. I’ll start off with sort of the confidence in the procedures. We’ve talked about this since the third quarter of last year, a good sense based on surgery backlogs, talking to physicians and seeing that there was pent-up demand through the pandemic. So, we expected elevated procedures coming into the year. That has certainly played out. You’ve heard even similar comments from some of the providers in the space. And these surgery backlogs are long -- they longer, probably a two-month surgery backlog is more like four months. And so that gives us confidence that through the end of this year and into next year that we’re going to continue to see elevated procedural growth. And we also see that in the demand for our small capital, which again, there’s equipment that’s used for ongoing procedures. And then, I’ll turn to Glenn for margins.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Hey Robbie. As we got through the quarter, as I mentioned, we really started to see some positive and easing of some of the cost pressures that we had felt in Q1 and certainly last year. I think we also are starting to feel some of the improvements in supply chain. That’s not to say that everything is rosy. We are still feeling inflationary pressures in transportation, some of our commodities, labor, certain electronics. But I will say that spot buys in Q1, spot buys in Q2 have not been material. And we’re getting near the amortization of the impact of spot buys from last year. So I feel like that gives me good confidence that I think we’ll see continued improvement in our gross margin as we move into Q3 and Q4. And so, we really will feel that gradual improvement, and we’ll feel it all the way down to the op margin line.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. And maybe just a follow-up for me for both of you or however you want to take it. People are really happy so far with the year, but unfortunately, we’re always focused on the future and looking out to next year already. You talked about, Kevin, these trends continuing. You have the super cycle in MedSurg. Just any kind of thoughts on how we should think about these elevated trends continuing and thoughts? I know you’re laser-focused on getting back to your 2016 -- or 2019 operating margin of 26.3%. How do we think about how far out that might be?\nKevin Lobo: Well, I think Jason’s comments in the openings say we do expect the procedural positive trends to continue well into next year. I don’t have a crystal ball exactly, will that be 100 basis points or 200 basis points more elevated than it was back through the pandemic in last year. So -- but we expect that to be elevated. The super cycle of products is widely exciting, something like -- look at Neptune S is off to a great start within instruments, the 1788 [ph] is only going to start kind of the latter part of this quarter. So, that’s going to b a big impact next year, got a new defibrillator coming that’s more next. So, these are launches, ProCuity is multiple year. We have the stair chair of the Xpedition. Amazing product that medical launch brand new and it’s new category altogether that launched Q1 of this year, that will continue into next year. So, a lot of continuation of really strong growth across our businesses. So, you should expect what -- going to continue to be a high-growth company going into next year. Yes. Let me just -- sorry, let me finish. I forgot it was a long question. So yes, we are absolutely committed to returning to pre-COVID margins and then growing our margins thereafter. This quarter marked a really important step, a very big first step in that evolution.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the question. And I’ll echo Robbie’s congratulations on a very impressive quarter here. So Kevin, I wanted to start on MedSurg, the new products. Just talk about how the new camera in endoscopy might have impacted Q2? And what you expect the impact to be from that in ‘23 and ‘24? And Medical growing 27% organically after Vocera anniversaried. What drove that? And how did Vocera do in the second quarter? And what’s the outlook? And I had one follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. You got a few in there already, and you got a follow-up. But okay, that’s fine. Listen, we’re really excited about the performance of our MedSurg business, continues to be really a great segment of our company. What I’d tell you on the endo side is the camera had really no impact. It was a limited launch, really just making sure that the product is performing as we thought. And the test cases have gone extremely well. And really, the full launch hasn’t started. That will start in the back half of the Q3. So you’ll start to see some impact in Q3, and that will accelerate in Q4 and that will even accelerate more next year. As you know, you’ve seen these launches in the past. So it really picks up year one, sometimes even year two, be even higher than year one. So, we’re going to see a lot of impact next year. There’ll be some impact in Q3, but -- in Q4, but really, it will start to ramp. So it’s really no impact in Q3 on endoscopy. And that’s why endoscopy is a little bit softer, had a big comp from last year, too, but at the end of these camera launches, you do see it start to slow down and then it really picks up with the new product. Medical had an absolutely stellar quarter, another 25-plus percent growth, and we had that in the fourth quarter, if you recall, as well. And Medical has really over the past six years, become a large, consistent high-growth division. It does move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, if you look at a rolling 4 quarters, rolling 8 quarters, this is a real high-growth business. Now I think it’s probably one of the most misunderstood businesses, honestly, or I would say, underestimated business in our portfolio. You’ve got the integration of Sage, Physio-Control, Vocera, which you referenced. But you’ve got new launches, Power-PRO 2 as a new ambulance cot at the beginning of last year. ProCuity bed frame still gaining steam. Sage has PrimoFit. You have Xpedition’s stair chair that I mentioned. And then there’s also a lot more awareness on safety. So our AED portfolio, there’s a lot more awareness. So I would say new demand for AEDs based on all the safety, the LUCAS automatic chest compression product and really a fantastic management team in Medical. So, will I expect 25% again next quarter? Probably not. But I do expect that Medical will continue to be a very high-growth business for a long time to come. And then specifically related to Vocera, it -- both sales and orders ramped in the quarter as we expected. So you remember, we sort of talked to you about Q3 -- Q3, Q4 and Q1 of this year kind of being flat after we sort of went through the integration and we said it’s going to pick up meaningfully, both picked up meaningfully in Q2, both sales as well as orders. And so they are also a contributor, but really strength across the entire portfolio.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you. And just I’ll keep my follow-up really brief. Glenn, the comps are very different in Q3 and Q4. Should we be thinking about stronger growth in Q3 relative to Q4? Just the cadence for the rest of the year? Thank you.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I mean, a couple of things. Q3 seasonally is usually not a super strong quarter, but I think if you focus on Q4 and you look at the comp that we’re up against, that probably plays into how much we’re going to grow against that comp. The big number last year, it was $5.2 billion in the quarter, which is a big number. So, I think what you’ll see is you’ll see slightly higher growth in Q3, and then that that will come down a little bit because of the comp, but I think we’ll end the year nicely, well within our guidance.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: Very nice quarter. A follow-up on the Medical. Can you talk about the CapEx environment? How much has changed in the last sort of 90 days or so and possible increase in CapEx as the revenues and costs are looking pretty good for hospitals? And on the backlog, did you guys reduce the backlog in the quarter? And was that a bolus for 2Q and should that be normalizing in the back half of the year? And then also on Microchips, is that should we view that getting better as a gross margin improvement from lower costs or increasing revenues as you reduce that backlog?\nJason Beach: It’s Jason. I’ll start here and then maybe some follow on. But as we think about the capital environment, we continue to see great strength from a capital environment standpoint. And even as you think about the backlog in our business, I think your question was, was there a bolus. But if you look at our backlog, it continues to be at very high levels, higher than what we came into the year with. So, still strength there on the capital side.\nPito Chickering: Okay. And then one more on gross margin. It sounds like a lot of tailwinds in 2Q were pretty much permanent in nature, and you said that the gross margin should improve in the back half of the year. Can you refresh us on how many months of inventory you guys have on the balance sheet? And when those -- these deflation pressures we’re seeing, start transferring to the P&L. Just wondering if that’s sort of the key driver of the gross margin improvement in the third and fourth quarter simply by duration by waiting for that to transfer.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think the big thing that really sits in inventory and worked its way through sort of in the first quarter and the second quarter was the impact of those spot buys. And generally, inventory turns depending on the product, anywhere from 6 to 9 months. So yes, we will generally see the impact of spot buys reduced for the rest of this year. Keep in mind that we still have this sort of inflationary headwind that we will be working against in Q3 and Q4. But just the mere fact that I feel like we’re getting to the end of the impact of spot buys, gives me confidence that we should see gradual gross margin improvement in the rest of this year.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Kevin, the guidance is pretty impressive, 10% organic. Are comps something that we should worry about from a fiscal ‘24 perspective? I know you mentioned certain product tailwinds. Just help us contextualize that 10%. And given that some of these procedure trends, it looks like it could sustain into ‘24.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Vijay. Remember, we grew 9.7% organically last year. So, we had a pretty good year last year as well and we’re growing on top of that. Again, this innovation cycle we have is tremendous. The procedure demands are strong. We’re -- as you see, we’re growing very fast even though the markets elevated, we’re growing above market in virtually every one of our businesses. So that gives us confidence that we’re going to continue to be able to grow at the high end of Medtech. And for this year, we’ve -- already half the year is already in the bag. And yes, the Q4 last year was abnormally fast, growing over 13%. So we -- in our guidance, we do reflect a little bit of a slowdown in the growth rate just related to those comps. But we do expect, based on backlog of surgery demand, aging population, more people playing pick a ball, you name it, right, activity, causing injuries. So this will continue to be a tailwind. And we think through much of next year -- that’s our current visibility. I mean obviously, that could change, but that’s how we see it. And we kind of called this, if you recall, Q3 of last year, we sort of called that this is what we were going to see. It’s actually materializing, frankly, a little better than we expected in terms of the flow-through in procedures and hospital staffing. They’re dealing with it much better than we expected. There are still flare-ups here and there, but it’s certainly gotten better, hospitals are better equipped and patients are anxious to get their procedures done.\nVijay Kumar: That’s helpful, Kevin. Glenn, maybe one for you. It looks like we’re on track, actually well north of 50 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal ‘23. Is this something that’s sustainable when you look at the operating model, assuming there’s nothing crazy on the inflation side for next year. I’m curious how we should be thinking about leverage.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. We -- you’re going to force me to divulge all the things we want to tell you in our investor meeting. But I would say, our old mantra of expanding 30 to 50 basis points every year was absolutely doable, and it’s absolutely something that we are planning on getting back to. We’re working through some of these higher costs through the P&L. There’s this ongoing inflation that we will solve for. But I don’t think that as we look forward over the longer term, the margin expansion is something that I think you’ll continue to see out of us. I don’t want to pinpoint a number just yet. But yes, it’s something we’ll continue to have.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. The one thing I would add, so Glenn wasn’t necessarily referring to ‘24, when you said 30 to 50. We’re on a ramp and on a major focus to get back to that 26.3%. And then thereafter kind of get into a normal rhythm. So, we’ll give you more clarity around that at the Analyst Day in November.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Matthew O’Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O’Brien: I really don’t want to make too much out of one quarter here. But when I look at the two-year stacked growth rate for you guys versus your biggest competitor in hips in knees, you had been outperforming them massively in the last several quarters. This quarter, it really tightened up the delta between you two, specifically in knees. So I’m just wondering if there’s anything you’re seeing competitively, maybe in cementless or on the robotics side, that you should call out or that we should think about as you go forward, just in terms of being able to significantly outperform the market in hips and knees over the next year or so?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, I’m actually pretty happy with double-digit growth in our Knee business. And look at OUS, we’re really starting to ramp the OUS. Mako is just getting going. It’s really getting started. So that massive outperformance you saw before was on the backs of Mako and cementless. And we’re probably going to see some of that outside the United States. And the U.S. performance is very strong. In one quarter, I’m not going to get overly excited. We’re still the fastest growing Hip and Knee company. And you remember from the past, you used to be -- grew well in one, you didn’t grow well in the other, and we covered both, hips and knees. It wasn’t hips or knees, hips and knees in Q2. So, no, we’re not seeing anything as really different. We focus on our own execution with our market-leading robotics and our strong portfolio continue the rollout in Insignia, which has been an absolute home run. We’re going to continue to perform very well.\nMatthew O’Brien: I appreciate that, Kevin. And then on the pricing side, I know it’s now flipped from kind of a headwind this year to a tailwind. But I’m assuming we’re working through some of those benefits. So, is pricing going to be another tailwind or positive for Stryker into ‘24 and even ‘25 as well as you’ve got these long-term contracts? Thanks.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think I’ll make some couple of comments around that without maybe providing exact guidance on 2024. But, if we look at the initiatives that we executed this year, we had a very targeted program that looked kind of product by product. And in general, what we’re seeing is MSNT is generally gaining positive price. And I would say Ortho is less negative and has much larger, longer-term contract negotiations. Keep in mind too that our price comparison that we report on includes sort of same product sales compared to prior year. So, if you think about increases that we gain on prices, say, on next-gen products that we’re going to launch, that’s not necessarily included in the number we say for price. But I would tell you that we generally see meaningful price increases on these next-gen products, especially when we bring newer technology to the market or a feature set that currently isn’t provided. So, I do think that we’ll continue to see price as a tailwind. It’s a muscle that we’ve certainly grown this year, and I think it’s going to be part of our game plan for sure.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Congrats on a really nice quarter, guys. I wanted to ask, Kevin, a little bit about the Cerus deal and Neurovascular. It was slower before, but 9% organic growth in the U.S. is really nice to see, especially in hemorrhagic. When we look at what Cerus has done in the UK, it’s been pretty impressive. And so, I’m curious kind of what your expectations are for the contribution in the U.S. and when we start to really see that in numbers, especially if you’re doing 9% U.S. organic growth in Neurovascular.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So the first thing I’d say is that Cerus has not yet approved in the United States. So, that 9% growth had no benefit from Cerus, right? So I think you know that. I just want to make that clear to everybody that the trials are ongoing right now. We look forward to that approval in the United States. We’ve launched two new products. We had a Tetra small coil as well as 46 catheter -- 46 size catheter, Vecta catheter. So two new products that helps in terms of driving the hemorrhagic growth. And the U.S. has been a little bit of a challenge for us more if you look back at the last few quarters, and really pleased to see that step up in this quarter, and we’re very excited that -- and we closed the deal. Obviously, it was during the quarter. It hasn’t had been a big impact at all. But a lot of excitement at the product we know performs extremely well based on what’s happening in OUS, and we can’t wait for the approval. It’s definitely going to be a shot in the arm when it does happen in the United States.\nRyan Zimmerman: Yes. No question. We saw that at SNIS this week. I wanted to ask a follow-up on robotics. We didn’t hear you say much on your Shoulder and Spine programs. And just given that there is some other commentary out there from competitors about kind of Shoulders and Spine. What’s your latest thinking about potential timing, launch cycles and so forth on Mako shoulder and/or spine.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Great. Nothing new to report. We’re kind of on schedule with what we had said before. Spine in the back half of next year and shoulder towards the end of next year. And frankly, we’re not really concerned about competitive activity in this space. We already know Globus and Medtronic have robots in spine. We are really excited about our overall enabling technology starting with Q Guidance. We have an additional product that we’ll be launching and Mako Spine. So, by the end of next year we’ll have a really compelling suite of enabling technology tools for Spine, which we’re really excited about. If someone else is first in shoulder it doesn’t concern me in the least. We have Blueprint already. We already have a very powerful enabling tech platform for shoulder, whether it’s patient matched ID, whether it’s using HoloLens to do the procedure with virtual reality, whether it’s the Blueprint technology, which is amazing. And we’re going to use that amazing Blueprint technology to feed Mako, and that will just be icing on the cake on an upper extremity business that is cooking on gas right now with amazing growth quarter after quarter after quarter.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Shagun Singh with RBC.\nShagun Singh: I was just wondering if you could refresh us on your capital allocation priorities and M&A just in terms of deal size valuation in areas of interest? And then on the product side, if you could just touch on trauma and what’s driving the strong growth there and the durability? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. So as we’ve said in the past, we -- our first focus on capital allocation right now is paying down debt, given the debt that we built up on Wright Medical as well as Vocera. That does not stop us from doing little deals. We did one small deal within instruments, and then we close on Cerus. So we’re still looking at tuck-ins primarily this year. But the deal teams are all very active. They’re having discussions. They’re out building their lists and they’re all really having nice pipelines. And so as our cash position gets strong, again, we’ll be back on offense. That will be the first use of our cash. I mean, we’ve had a really terrific track record of M&A, and we can’t wait to be able to get back on offense with M&A. But first priority is certainly paying down debt at the moment, and we’re doing that. So, what’s the second part?\nJason Beach: Trauma.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So trauma, I’ll tell you this Wright Medical acquisition has been spectacular. The upper extremities business growing very strong double-digit growth every quarter. Foot and Ankle really starting to pick up. So we’re really excited about the performance this quarter was terrific in Foot and Ankle with strong double-digit growth. And then core trauma has actually been a big beneficiary of Wright Medical. So in the past, our core trauma business was really diluted in its focus. It was focusing on Foot and Ankle, focusing more on extremities because they’re faster growing. And we were sort of not paying as much attention to core trauma. We have a great leadership team on core trauma with now dedicated focused R&D resources. And obviously, they launched Gamma4. We had the T2 Alpha product launch. We’re going to have PeriPRO products launch soon, excited about some other innovations we plan to show at OTA later in the fall. So, really refreshing the portfolio, great focus on core trauma and they had a really excellent quarter as well. So, all three business units performed very well in the quarter. And again, the Wright Medical deal, it’s not just benefiting our extremities business, it’s actually providing more focus core trauma, which is fueling terrific growth in core trauma. So trauma, we expect to continue to be a very high-growth business for a long time to come.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen.\nEric Anderson: This is Eric on for Josh. I was curious to hear your thoughts around smart implants. One of your competitors is moving closer to a full launch of a smart implant technology, and I was just curious to hear your updated thoughts there. And if there are any updates to share from your work around OrthoSensor, that would be great to hear as well.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Listen, I think smart implants is interesting. We obviously have MotionSense which is a wearable on the outside to measure basically similar dynamics that are going to be measured from the smart implant. So I think range of motion, all these factors, it’s interesting. We’re not quite sure yet what to do with that data. How compelling that will be, will that affect patient selection? Will it affect approaches to procedure? So I would call it something that is more investigational and more of a learning that we’re going to have. And -- but I do think it’s something that could be important in the future. So not discounting it. I don’t have anything more to share on OrthoSensor other than we are -- we have launched MotionSense, which is the wearable which attaches to both the femur as well as tibia to track mobility and a range of other metrics. And we’re going to learn a lot, we will and so others in the industry about what is it that really matters that you’re measuring in the post-surgery period, and really how does that affect the patient care, patient -- maybe patient selection, maybe what implants they should be using, is there a feedback loop that’s meaningful. We don’t know -- we don’t have answers. We have a lot of questions, and it’s going to give us new data that we can then learn from. So that’s how I’d characterize at the moment.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatt Miksic: I wanted to ask a question on Mako, one of the comments that you made, and I apologize if this came up already, hoping back and forth really, because a lot of folks tonight and different calls. But you mentioned an increase in deal mix, I guess, an increase in rental deal mix affecting the dollar revenues that came in from Mako in other -- this quarter. And that’s something we’ve heard from other folks as well as you’re I’m sure aware in terms of robots, more sort of hospitals taking a flexible option to leasing or as-you-go arrangements for robots. First, I’m wondering how tightly correlated that with sort of growth in the ASC? And the second, in the past, Kevin, I think you talked about like early on, well, some hospitals are capital rich, some hospitals are operating in commercial and have endowments or whatever, there’s different hospitals have a different preference on how they want to pay for -- that was sort of like how we used to think about this. I’m curious whether you’re seeing sort of hybridization of that? In other words, we want to know Mako, you could pay for it, but let’s scale into it, with a lease arrangement or something. I’m wondering if you’re seeing that kind of shift in the market. And I have one follow-up, if I could.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. Thanks. So what I would tell you is the ASC’s growth is obviously increasing in the ASCs with Mako and virtually all of the ASC deals are financed because physician ownership is part of the ASC scenario. They don’t have the capital budgets the hospitals do. So yes, as ASC penetration increases, more financing, rental type deals are automatically going to happen because they’re virtually all financed, the ASC. Your question around the hospital dynamic, I think it’s just if you have competitive systems that are not sort of being charged for, then the hospital says, well, maybe I don’t need to spend the capital, even if I have the capital and maybe I -- let me talk to you about what you do. And so, we offer them the full suite. And yes, some are opting to go for the financing route that maybe in the past would have purchased, but we have a healthy order book, and we’re not really agnostic to whether they want to buy cash or where they want to finance it. It really doesn’t matter to us because we get the value from that. Whether we get the value on cash on day one and get the cash over time doesn’t really concern us, and it certainly has been fuel for our strong implant growth.\nMatt Miksic: That’s great. And just quickly on -- you mentioned endoscopy later in the camera and not really having an effect yet, but quite differentiated and quite different this cycle with the sort of opportunity to test surgical margins around tumors and things that really represent kind of a new phase of sort of camera and imaging functionality. Any sense -- I know it’s early but -- of what that does to the shape of this product cycle versus what we’ve experienced in the past? I mean fluorescence imaging was pretty big for you in the last launch, this sort of takes that up a notch, just any color you can provide in terms of what your expectations are and the early interest, et cetera, on the camera side.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks. Look, it’s a little early still for me to get too ahead of myself, but the fluorescence imaging was a big deal, right, first in 1588 and then 1688 when you had the overlay from fluorescence where you didn’t have to toggle between black and white and fluorescence. That was pretty meaningful. So those are pretty big steps. But you’re right, this -- with the tumor margin ability -- the ability to use new dies beyond ICG, wildly exciting to get into lung, to get into bladder. This is really, really exciting with pharmacological agents. It’s also a camera that is extremely good in neuro and sports where historically, we weren’t as strong. We had -- it was fabulous for general surgery, but not quite as good. This camera addresses those issues. So, I’m really excited about it. But it’s a little early that the test cases have gone very well. I wouldn’t expect this to be any less performing than our prior launches, potentially could be even more. The feedback so far is pretty exciting. Yes, we have some really good features in this front.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: I apologize, there’s a lot going on tonight. But your operating margins were really impressive. And I’m curious how we should think about those for the back half of the year? And if you can give a full year guide on it, or even how we should think about this into next year, if you’re willing to waive that far? Thank you.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, Joanne, we -- yes. We really -- if you think about operating margins, especially our performance in Q2, we saw a really sort of good improvement, honestly, in gross margin just in terms of some easing of some of the cost pressures, as I’ve mentioned before, spot buys are not material. They weren’t material in Q1, and they’re not material in Q2. I think the other thing, too, that we’re feeling is just that now that we have more evening of supply, we’re also back to sort of better productivity gains. And so all of those things give us good confidence that we should see gross margins improve in the back half of this year, and they’ll gradually improve because we’re still feeling some of this inflation, but that kind of gives us the confidence. And obviously, some of that will roll into next year as you think about our performance for next year. But we -- at this point, we’re not going to guide on that other than to say that we do think we’ll see some gradual improvement for the rest of this year.\nJoanne Wuensch: Maybe this is an analyst question at the meeting or the next time you gather all together for an update. But how do you think about in a more normalized post-pandemic environment sort of operating margin expansion on a regular go-forward, maybe even year-over-year basis?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, Joanne, earlier in the call, I think this question was asked, I’ll just repeat that we are laser-focused on, I would say, trying to sprint back to the 26.3% that we had in 2019. And so we’re going to try to move margins on a more ambitious way to get back to that. And then once we get back to that kind of level, I think you’re going to see us wanting to expand margins in a kind of a more consistent way. I don’t know the exact number, something like 50 bps. We’ll get more specific as time passes. But more like an annual, more moderate, nice progression year after year after year, especially with this kind of high growth that we’re experiencing organically. You’re going to expect to see more normalized margin expansion. But in the meantime, we’re looking to move at a faster clip given the falloff that we’ve had since ‘19 and try to restore those margins.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Rick Wise with Stifel.\nRick Wise: Kevin, I was hoping you would just give us a little more color and perspective on really your very solid international performance double digits, obviously, almost the as strong as U.S. performance, but a little slower than the first quarter’s pace. You highlighted the strong emerging markets. How -- I’m just going to ask one question with a couple of parts. How sustainable is this? You talked about some of your key initiatives? And just maybe just your perspectives on the sustainability, what’s the drivers here? And maybe where we are in terms of procedure volume recovery back to normal in Europe just in a larger picture sense? Thanks so much. And great to see the excellent quarter.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thank you. Look, international has -- it took us a while, but the last five years, international growth has exceeded the U.S. growth. Now obviously, the U.S. growth this quarter was pretty spectacular. But we’re absolutely a believer and continue to have very good international growth in the years ahead, frankly, making up for lost time because our market shares are still below what we have in the U.S. in most of the international markets. And so we have significant upside in front of us. Procedure volumes are pretty much back to normal everywhere. They’re back normally in Europe. They’re back to normal in Australia. They’re back to normal pretty much in Japan. So, the market that hurt us, frankly, in the quarter was China. So that China continues to be a drag because of VBP both in neurovascular having an impact, also impacting our Spine business. So China continues to be a bit of a drag. But in spite of that, we had really terrific growth in international. And I’d say that Mako is really starting to pick up steam in Asia Pacific. So we already have a pretty good presence in Europe. But in Asia Pacific, it’s Japan, India, China, it’s really starting to pick up. And I think that’s a great leading indicator that will produce really terrific growth both in hips and knees for many quarters to come as that momentum continues. And then as well, the camera launches of 78, that’s also really exciting for the international market. So, we’re going to continue the progress. Even Europe had another strong quarter. That’s just kind of expected now. It’s steady and strong growth every quarter, and we’re still not where we’d like to be in Europe. So, this is just one of those things that takes time. But if you think about something like cameras, where when we started the Transatlantic model, we were number 5 or 6, and we expect to take over number 1 sometime this year. Our power tools share was in the low 30s, and it’s crossed 50%, but it’s still not where it is in the United States. It’s not where it is in Australia. So, international should be something that continues in a very steady way. Just as it has the last five years, it’s been kind of very consistent. And in emerging markets, that’s the area we have the most opportunity, where we’re still very, very small, growing nicely, but off a small base.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I’ll ask both of mine up upfront. Some of the payers and providers have talked about a slower July. I was just curious if you could kind of frame some of the summer seasonality, if you’re seeing more normal seasonality or how it kind of compares given some of those payer comments? And then a margin question for you, Glenn. Just curious if we should use the second half operating margin this year as kind of a new jumping off point since this is the more normal cost environment in the second half?\nKevin Lobo: Listen, sorry, your sound quality was a little hard hearing you. I think you’re asking about July if we saw something strange seasonality in July. And look -- we don’t normally comment on one month. And I would tell you -- you saw our raised guidance like we’re expecting a pretty good second half of the year. And I don’t really want to get into one month. And the -- sometimes you do have certain dynamics that happen. But there’s nothing really important that I want to call out for the month of July. And then I think the second part was margin.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Travis, can you repeat that in terms of the operating margin question?\nTravis Steed: Yes, sorry. I’m just curious if the second half of this year is kind of the new jumping off point for margins going forward, just given that this is a more normalized cost environment in the second half?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. No, I would say a couple of things. First of all, Q4 is always seasonally higher. It’s our highest op margin performing quarter. So, I wouldn’t necessarily say that that should be the jumping off. I think if you back up from where our guidance is, you could sort of figure out kind of where we’re angling to end the year at, and that would be the good jumping off point.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Danielle Antalffy with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Simon Hagan [ph] on for Danielle. Congrats on the strong quarter. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes to the underlying ortho market growth when you look at factors such as pricing, innovation and potential trend towards treating both much younger and older -- much older patients? And I have one follow-up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, the trends aren’t different than what we’ve seen in the past. It’s surgery demand backlogs of surgeons that people -- frankly, the older patients who’ve been -- now really want to get procedures done, there are more active people out there, as I kind of referenced earlier, who want to get their procedures done. So innovation wins the day, right? So the robotics continues to be a real terrific for us, and we continue to see increased utilization. Percent of Mako procedures done continues to rise. Percent of cementless continues to rise. Percent of hips being done on Mako continues to rise. So that’s not new. Those are a continuation of prior trends. And so there isn’t some kind of new dynamic. It’s just the pent-up demand of patients that we kept waiting for, they’re coming and they’re going to continue to come for some period of time. And the aging population, people every day, some 10,000 turn 65. And so there is demographics that are on our side. There is the hangover from COVID that’s on our side. And for Stryker, we have a portfolio that we’re really excited about. In addressing the Direct Anterior with our Insignia stem was critically important, and we’ve done that, and we’re seeing fantastic uptake of that hip stem, which is driving terrific growth in hips. So that’s kind of new for us as to -- if you look in the last year, our growth has really picked up, and that was really because of the product that we launched really addressing an important and growing segment of the procedures in hips.\nUnidentified Analyst: And just one follow-up, really off of what you were just talking about. Looking at the competitive position in large joints in the United States, how do you expect to continue driving share gains, and where do you see yourself given continued innovation?\nKevin Lobo: Look, we really like our chances. A huge demand for Mako hasn’t stopped. We know we have the best system on the market, which we’re really excited about. We’ve filled our gap with Insignia on the hip side. We have an awesome 3D-printed hip cup with Trident II. We have the cementless offering, which, of course, we’re way ahead, a huge head start on cementless. Terrific publications coming out with excellent five-year data on cementless, which will give surgeons even more confidence in that in the future. And so there’s other things the team are looking at. We have some really exciting products -- our hinge product that we’re going to come out with later this year to shore up revision. And that’s pretty exciting. We have plans to have revision on Mako as well in the not-too-distant future. So we’re not going to sort of sit tight on just everything we’ve already done. There are incremental additions. We just not so long ago launched that 2.0 software for -- to improve the user experience, improve the training of residents. And so, we think we have a winning hand, and we’re going to continue to play that hand.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.\nMike Matson: I want to ask one about the Q Guidance System in spine. It sounds like it’s doing well. I’m just wondering if you could maybe give us sort of an overview of it. I know you’ve had navigation systems time before. Is this something kind of different, or is it more just the latest version? And then how does it kind of fit in when you do bring Mako into spine?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. What I’d tell you is this has the fastest camera on the market. Homegrown, we didn’t use a third party to do this camera. It is lightning quick. And that camera will eventually be ported to the Mako as well. So that make will have that same terrific camera. It really -- the user experience is terrific in terms of being able to see and be able to do your procedure. So, the feedback we’ve gotten is outstanding. So, we’ve always been good at navigation, but this is sort of really putting our best foot forward. And this user experience that you’re going to have with Q will transfer to the Mako spine, and that we’re really excited about. So this is -- this even before Mako is already having an impact. And we think once Mako’s launched, it will really fill this important need in the market for us to have a robotic application. We also have another product in enabling technology coming out of our instruments vision that’s going to be used by the Spine group. A little early for me to give you details on what that is. But at the appropriate time, we’ll tell you about that. So that, combined with Mako is going to give us very compelling enabling technology platform for Spine.\nMike Matson: Okay. Got it. And then just given the guidance, I assume this is early, kind of material issue, but I thought I’d ask about it anyway because we’ve heard about it from some other companies. But can you just comment on any Russia exposure you have and whether or not there’s the latest sanctions are having any sort of impact on your business?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Obviously, we’re abiding by all the sanctions, as you would expect, and working in lockstep with the industry on industry-wide response to what should be humanitarian products and should be -- should they go through the approval process. That’s obviously very lengthy. It did have a negative impact. But honestly, our Russia business is so small that it’s kind of meaningless in the overall picture of Stryker. But yes, we are abiding by the sanctions. Yes, it did have a negative impact, but it was really -- it’s not a material business for Stryker.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.\nRichard Newitter: Congrats on the quarter. Kevin, I think a few months back in the first quarter, you were asked a question at an investor conference about what areas could be of interest to you? There’s so much going, right, across your existing businesses. So obviously, M&A, though, is still top of mind. So I’m just curious kind of where are the holes? And where do you think the investment could be most incremental for you?\nKevin Lobo: Look, it’s a good question. I think I’ve talked about the adjacencies that we’re interested in. First and foremost, there’s a lot of tuck-in demand. Each of our businesses are building their wish lists and sort of evaluating different targets. And I think that’s job one is looking at those near-term targets that tuck-in. Those create tremendous financial returns for Stryker. They don’t always move the needle for the overall growth, but they’re really terrific financials for us to do. And when you feed our existing sales force of Stryker, we know how to sell, and we’re able to really do that very, very well. I would tell you, in the adjacency space, no change to the adjacencies that we’re interested in. I think I’ve mentioned them before. What I would tell you is neuromodulation’s one I’ve talked about in the past. And within neuromodulation, obviously, there’s a lot of different parts to that. There’s spinal cord stimulation, there’s deep brain stimulation, there’s peripheral nerve stimulation, and stimulation as you know in sleep apnea. And I do believe electrical treatment is going to be a big part of the future. Over time, we’ve been a little hot cold on spinal cord stimulation. I would tell you right now, we’re probably a little bit more cold on it, just kind of a challenging market and -- so that’s the way the only thing maybe I haven’t said in the past. But otherwise, every other adjacency that I talked about in Q1 are still very much on our radar screen. And as our cash frees up, probably more into next year. If the tuck-ins aren’t of a significant size and we have cash starting to build up and our debt position better, hopefully, we’ll be able to make a move in one of those adjacencies that I’ve talked about in the past.\nRichard Newitter: Thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up on Spine. It’s one of the few businesses that’s not back in the high single digits or better yet but you obviously have pretty good line of sight to seemingly transformative technologies and product rollouts with Mako, but that’s 1 year, 1.5 years away. So I guess, do we just kind of think of spine as a grind from here higher or stabilization and then look out when ‘25 comes around?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I think the word stabilization, I’d probably prefer that than grind, but yes, it’s probably both, right? So Spine is a tough market, no question about it. But already with Q Guidance, we’re feeling good about that. We’ve bolstered our expandable portfolio a bit. We still have a couple of gaps that we’re looking at. Obviously, we would like to fill. But the enabling tech is really what gets us excited. And so I think the robotic platform will put us on a par at least with the competitors and then this other secret launch I talked about from coming out of instruments, which we’ve shown some surgeons kind of will put us ahead of the game on enabling technology. But yes, we have to wait. Unfortunately, it’s not ready yet. It’s coming. The instrument launch will probably come in before the Mako, and that will be able to be used with the Q Guidance. It will be compatible with Q. So that’s where -- you’ll hear about that probably earlier than you’ll hear about Mako. But yes, I wouldn’t assume we’re going to -- we’re going to try to kind of keep in line with market growth, which is kind of what we’re doing right now, hold our own until we get to that period of time, and then we could start to grow more like a typical business of Stryker.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some other updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. In the second quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 11.9% with double-digit growth in both MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and Orthopaedics and Spine. This comprehensive performance demonstrates the diverse and attractive markets that we play in and our ability to drive growth through strong commercial execution. We are also pleased with the continued positive outcomes of our globalization efforts. Our international business demonstrated strong performance with double-digit growth, complementing our strong and fast-growing U.S. business. In addition, we continue to see traction with our pricing initiatives, again delivering positive pricing in the second quarter. During the quarter, we continued to realize improvements in component availability, although disruptions remain in parts of our business. Our teams have demonstrated good agility in addressing these situations, proactively mitigating much of their impact. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.54 a share, reflecting 13% growth compared to the second quarter of 2022. This result was primarily driven from the strength of our sales but also marks the beginning of our margin recovery. We expect margins to continue to expand throughout the remainder of the year. Finally, with half the year behind us and our solid momentum, we have increased our expected full year organic sales growth to a range of 9.5% to 10.5% and increased our expected earnings per share to $10.25 to $10.45 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Hi Robbie, it's Kevin. I'll start off with sort of the confidence in the procedures. We've talked about this since the third quarter of last year, a good sense based on surgery backlogs, talking to physicians and seeing that there was pent-up demand through the pandemic. So, we expected elevated procedures coming into the year. That has certainly played out. You've heard even similar comments from some of the providers in the space. And these surgery backlogs are long -- they longer, probably a two-month surgery backlog is more like four months. And so that gives us confidence that through the end of this year and into next year that we're going to continue to see elevated procedural growth. And we also see that in the demand for our small capital, which again, there's equipment that's used for ongoing procedures. And then, I'll turn to Glenn for margins. Well, I think Jason's comments in the openings say we do expect the procedural positive trends to continue well into next year. I don't have a crystal ball exactly, will that be 100 basis points or 200 basis points more elevated than it was back through the pandemic in last year. So -- but we expect that to be elevated. The super cycle of products is widely exciting, something like -- look at Neptune S is off to a great start within instruments, the 1788 [ph] is only going to start kind of the latter part of this quarter. So, that's going to b a big impact next year, got a new defibrillator coming that's more next. So, these are launches, ProCuity is multiple year. We have the stair chair of the Xpedition. Amazing product that medical launch brand new and it's new category altogether that launched Q1 of this year, that will continue into next year. So, a lot of continuation of really strong growth across our businesses. So, you should expect what -- going to continue to be a high-growth company going into next year. Yes. Let me just -- sorry, let me finish. I forgot it was a long question. So yes, we are absolutely committed to returning to pre-COVID margins and then growing our margins thereafter. This quarter marked a really important step, a very big first step in that evolution. Okay. You got a few in there already, and you got a follow-up. But okay, that's fine. Listen, we're really excited about the performance of our MedSurg business, continues to be really a great segment of our company. What I'd tell you on the endo side is the camera had really no impact. It was a limited launch, really just making sure that the product is performing as we thought. And the test cases have gone extremely well. And really, the full launch hasn't started. That will start in the back half of the Q3. So you'll start to see some impact in Q3, and that will accelerate in Q4 and that will even accelerate more next year. As you know, you've seen these launches in the past. So it really picks up year one, sometimes even year two, be even higher than year one. So, we're going to see a lot of impact next year. There'll be some impact in Q3, but -- in Q4, but really, it will start to ramp. So it's really no impact in Q3 on endoscopy. And that's why endoscopy is a little bit softer, had a big comp from last year, too, but at the end of these camera launches, you do see it start to slow down and then it really picks up with the new product. Medical had an absolutely stellar quarter, another 25-plus percent growth, and we had that in the fourth quarter, if you recall, as well. And Medical has really over the past six years, become a large, consistent high-growth division. It does move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, if you look at a rolling 4 quarters, rolling 8 quarters, this is a real high-growth business. Now I think it's probably one of the most misunderstood businesses, honestly, or I would say, underestimated business in our portfolio. You've got the integration of Sage, Physio-Control, Vocera, which you referenced. But you've got new launches, Power-PRO 2 as a new ambulance cot at the beginning of last year. ProCuity bed frame still gaining steam. Sage has PrimoFit. You have Xpedition's stair chair that I mentioned. And then there's also a lot more awareness on safety. So our AED portfolio, there's a lot more awareness. So I would say new demand for AEDs based on all the safety, the LUCAS automatic chest compression product and really a fantastic management team in Medical. So, will I expect 25% again next quarter? Probably not. But I do expect that Medical will continue to be a very high-growth business for a long time to come. And then specifically related to Vocera, it -- both sales and orders ramped in the quarter as we expected. So you remember, we sort of talked to you about Q3 -- Q3, Q4 and Q1 of this year kind of being flat after we sort of went through the integration and we said it's going to pick up meaningfully, both picked up meaningfully in Q2, both sales as well as orders. And so they are also a contributor, but really strength across the entire portfolio. Yes. Thanks, Vijay. Remember, we grew 9.7% organically last year. So, we had a pretty good year last year as well and we're growing on top of that. Again, this innovation cycle we have is tremendous. The procedure demands are strong. We're -- as you see, we're growing very fast even though the markets elevated, we're growing above market in virtually every one of our businesses. So that gives us confidence that we're going to continue to be able to grow at the high end of Medtech. And for this year, we've -- already half the year is already in the bag. And yes, the Q4 last year was abnormally fast, growing over 13%. So we -- in our guidance, we do reflect a little bit of a slowdown in the growth rate just related to those comps. But we do expect, based on backlog of surgery demand, aging population, more people playing pick a ball, you name it, right, activity, causing injuries. So this will continue to be a tailwind. And we think through much of next year -- that's our current visibility. I mean obviously, that could change, but that's how we see it. And we kind of called this, if you recall, Q3 of last year, we sort of called that this is what we were going to see. It's actually materializing, frankly, a little better than we expected in terms of the flow-through in procedures and hospital staffing. They're dealing with it much better than we expected. There are still flare-ups here and there, but it's certainly gotten better, hospitals are better equipped and patients are anxious to get their procedures done. Yes. The one thing I would add, so Glenn wasn't necessarily referring to ‘24, when you said 30 to 50. We're on a ramp and on a major focus to get back to that 26.3%. And then thereafter kind of get into a normal rhythm. So, we'll give you more clarity around that at the Analyst Day in November. Yes. Look, I'm actually pretty happy with double-digit growth in our Knee business. And look at OUS, we're really starting to ramp the OUS. Mako is just getting going. It's really getting started. So that massive outperformance you saw before was on the backs of Mako and cementless. And we're probably going to see some of that outside the United States. And the U.S. performance is very strong. In one quarter, I'm not going to get overly excited. We're still the fastest growing Hip and Knee company. And you remember from the past, you used to be -- grew well in one, you didn't grow well in the other, and we covered both, hips and knees. It wasn't hips or knees, hips and knees in Q2. So, no, we're not seeing anything as really different. We focus on our own execution with our market-leading robotics and our strong portfolio continue the rollout in Insignia, which has been an absolute home run. We're going to continue to perform very well. Yes. So the first thing I'd say is that Cerus has not yet approved in the United States. So, that 9% growth had no benefit from Cerus, right? So I think you know that. I just want to make that clear to everybody that the trials are ongoing right now. We look forward to that approval in the United States. We've launched two new products. We had a Tetra small coil as well as 46 catheter -- 46 size catheter, Vecta catheter. So two new products that helps in terms of driving the hemorrhagic growth. And the U.S. has been a little bit of a challenge for us more if you look back at the last few quarters, and really pleased to see that step up in this quarter, and we're very excited that -- and we closed the deal. Obviously, it was during the quarter. It hasn't had been a big impact at all. But a lot of excitement at the product we know performs extremely well based on what's happening in OUS, and we can't wait for the approval. It's definitely going to be a shot in the arm when it does happen in the United States. Yes. Great. Nothing new to report. We're kind of on schedule with what we had said before. Spine in the back half of next year and shoulder towards the end of next year. And frankly, we're not really concerned about competitive activity in this space. We already know Globus and Medtronic have robots in spine. We are really excited about our overall enabling technology starting with Q Guidance. We have an additional product that we'll be launching and Mako Spine. So, by the end of next year we'll have a really compelling suite of enabling technology tools for Spine, which we're really excited about. If someone else is first in shoulder it doesn't concern me in the least. We have Blueprint already. We already have a very powerful enabling tech platform for shoulder, whether it's patient matched ID, whether it's using HoloLens to do the procedure with virtual reality, whether it's the Blueprint technology, which is amazing. And we're going to use that amazing Blueprint technology to feed Mako, and that will just be icing on the cake on an upper extremity business that is cooking on gas right now with amazing growth quarter after quarter after quarter. Yes, sure. So as we've said in the past, we -- our first focus on capital allocation right now is paying down debt, given the debt that we built up on Wright Medical as well as Vocera. That does not stop us from doing little deals. We did one small deal within instruments, and then we close on Cerus. So we're still looking at tuck-ins primarily this year. But the deal teams are all very active. They're having discussions. They're out building their lists and they're all really having nice pipelines. And so as our cash position gets strong, again, we'll be back on offense. That will be the first use of our cash. I mean, we've had a really terrific track record of M&A, and we can't wait to be able to get back on offense with M&A. But first priority is certainly paying down debt at the moment, and we're doing that. So, what's the second part? Yes. So trauma, I'll tell you this Wright Medical acquisition has been spectacular. The upper extremities business growing very strong double-digit growth every quarter. Foot and Ankle really starting to pick up. So we're really excited about the performance this quarter was terrific in Foot and Ankle with strong double-digit growth. And then core trauma has actually been a big beneficiary of Wright Medical. So in the past, our core trauma business was really diluted in its focus. It was focusing on Foot and Ankle, focusing more on extremities because they're faster growing. And we were sort of not paying as much attention to core trauma. We have a great leadership team on core trauma with now dedicated focused R&D resources. And obviously, they launched Gamma4. We had the T2 Alpha product launch. We're going to have PeriPRO products launch soon, excited about some other innovations we plan to show at OTA later in the fall. So, really refreshing the portfolio, great focus on core trauma and they had a really excellent quarter as well. So, all three business units performed very well in the quarter. And again, the Wright Medical deal, it's not just benefiting our extremities business, it's actually providing more focus core trauma, which is fueling terrific growth in core trauma. So trauma, we expect to continue to be a very high-growth business for a long time to come. Yes. Listen, I think smart implants is interesting. We obviously have MotionSense which is a wearable on the outside to measure basically similar dynamics that are going to be measured from the smart implant. So I think range of motion, all these factors, it's interesting. We're not quite sure yet what to do with that data. How compelling that will be, will that affect patient selection? Will it affect approaches to procedure? So I would call it something that is more investigational and more of a learning that we're going to have. And -- but I do think it's something that could be important in the future. So not discounting it. I don't have anything more to share on OrthoSensor other than we are -- we have launched MotionSense, which is the wearable which attaches to both the femur as well as tibia to track mobility and a range of other metrics. And we're going to learn a lot, we will and so others in the industry about what is it that really matters that you're measuring in the post-surgery period, and really how does that affect the patient care, patient -- maybe patient selection, maybe what implants they should be using, is there a feedback loop that's meaningful. We don't know -- we don't have answers. We have a lot of questions, and it's going to give us new data that we can then learn from. So that's how I'd characterize at the moment. Yes, sure. Thanks. So what I would tell you is the ASC's growth is obviously increasing in the ASCs with Mako and virtually all of the ASC deals are financed because physician ownership is part of the ASC scenario. They don't have the capital budgets the hospitals do. So yes, as ASC penetration increases, more financing, rental type deals are automatically going to happen because they're virtually all financed, the ASC. Your question around the hospital dynamic, I think it's just if you have competitive systems that are not sort of being charged for, then the hospital says, well, maybe I don't need to spend the capital, even if I have the capital and maybe I -- let me talk to you about what you do. And so, we offer them the full suite. And yes, some are opting to go for the financing route that maybe in the past would have purchased, but we have a healthy order book, and we're not really agnostic to whether they want to buy cash or where they want to finance it. It really doesn't matter to us because we get the value from that. Whether we get the value on cash on day one and get the cash over time doesn't really concern us, and it certainly has been fuel for our strong implant growth. Yes. Thanks. Look, it's a little early still for me to get too ahead of myself, but the fluorescence imaging was a big deal, right, first in 1588 and then 1688 when you had the overlay from fluorescence where you didn't have to toggle between black and white and fluorescence. That was pretty meaningful. So those are pretty big steps. But you're right, this -- with the tumor margin ability -- the ability to use new dies beyond ICG, wildly exciting to get into lung, to get into bladder. This is really, really exciting with pharmacological agents. It's also a camera that is extremely good in neuro and sports where historically, we weren't as strong. We had -- it was fabulous for general surgery, but not quite as good. This camera addresses those issues. So, I'm really excited about it. But it's a little early that the test cases have gone very well. I wouldn't expect this to be any less performing than our prior launches, potentially could be even more. The feedback so far is pretty exciting. Yes, we have some really good features in this front. Yes, Joanne, earlier in the call, I think this question was asked, I'll just repeat that we are laser-focused on, I would say, trying to sprint back to the 26.3% that we had in 2019. And so we're going to try to move margins on a more ambitious way to get back to that. And then once we get back to that kind of level, I think you're going to see us wanting to expand margins in a kind of a more consistent way. I don't know the exact number, something like 50 bps. We'll get more specific as time passes. But more like an annual, more moderate, nice progression year after year after year, especially with this kind of high growth that we're experiencing organically. You're going to expect to see more normalized margin expansion. But in the meantime, we're looking to move at a faster clip given the falloff that we've had since ‘19 and try to restore those margins. Yes. Thank you. Look, international has -- it took us a while, but the last five years, international growth has exceeded the U.S. growth. Now obviously, the U.S. growth this quarter was pretty spectacular. But we're absolutely a believer and continue to have very good international growth in the years ahead, frankly, making up for lost time because our market shares are still below what we have in the U.S. in most of the international markets. And so we have significant upside in front of us. Procedure volumes are pretty much back to normal everywhere. They're back normally in Europe. They're back to normal in Australia. They're back to normal pretty much in Japan. So, the market that hurt us, frankly, in the quarter was China. So that China continues to be a drag because of VBP both in neurovascular having an impact, also impacting our Spine business. So China continues to be a bit of a drag. But in spite of that, we had really terrific growth in international. And I'd say that Mako is really starting to pick up steam in Asia Pacific. So we already have a pretty good presence in Europe. But in Asia Pacific, it's Japan, India, China, it's really starting to pick up. And I think that's a great leading indicator that will produce really terrific growth both in hips and knees for many quarters to come as that momentum continues. And then as well, the camera launches of 78, that's also really exciting for the international market. So, we're going to continue the progress. Even Europe had another strong quarter. That's just kind of expected now. It's steady and strong growth every quarter, and we're still not where we'd like to be in Europe. So, this is just one of those things that takes time. But if you think about something like cameras, where when we started the Transatlantic model, we were number 5 or 6, and we expect to take over number 1 sometime this year. Our power tools share was in the low 30s, and it's crossed 50%, but it's still not where it is in the United States. It's not where it is in Australia. So, international should be something that continues in a very steady way. Just as it has the last five years, it's been kind of very consistent. And in emerging markets, that's the area we have the most opportunity, where we're still very, very small, growing nicely, but off a small base. Listen, sorry, your sound quality was a little hard hearing you. I think you're asking about July if we saw something strange seasonality in July. And look -- we don't normally comment on one month. And I would tell you -- you saw our raised guidance like we're expecting a pretty good second half of the year. And I don't really want to get into one month. And the -- sometimes you do have certain dynamics that happen. But there's nothing really important that I want to call out for the month of July. And then I think the second part was margin. Yes. Look, the trends aren't different than what we've seen in the past. It's surgery demand backlogs of surgeons that people -- frankly, the older patients who've been -- now really want to get procedures done, there are more active people out there, as I kind of referenced earlier, who want to get their procedures done. So innovation wins the day, right? So the robotics continues to be a real terrific for us, and we continue to see increased utilization. Percent of Mako procedures done continues to rise. Percent of cementless continues to rise. Percent of hips being done on Mako continues to rise. So that's not new. Those are a continuation of prior trends. And so there isn't some kind of new dynamic. It's just the pent-up demand of patients that we kept waiting for, they're coming and they're going to continue to come for some period of time. And the aging population, people every day, some 10,000 turn 65. And so there is demographics that are on our side. There is the hangover from COVID that's on our side. And for Stryker, we have a portfolio that we're really excited about. In addressing the Direct Anterior with our Insignia stem was critically important, and we've done that, and we're seeing fantastic uptake of that hip stem, which is driving terrific growth in hips. So that's kind of new for us as to -- if you look in the last year, our growth has really picked up, and that was really because of the product that we launched really addressing an important and growing segment of the procedures in hips. Look, we really like our chances. A huge demand for Mako hasn't stopped. We know we have the best system on the market, which we're really excited about. We've filled our gap with Insignia on the hip side. We have an awesome 3D-printed hip cup with Trident II. We have the cementless offering, which, of course, we're way ahead, a huge head start on cementless. Terrific publications coming out with excellent five-year data on cementless, which will give surgeons even more confidence in that in the future. And so there's other things the team are looking at. We have some really exciting products -- our hinge product that we're going to come out with later this year to shore up revision. And that's pretty exciting. We have plans to have revision on Mako as well in the not-too-distant future. So we're not going to sort of sit tight on just everything we've already done. There are incremental additions. We just not so long ago launched that 2.0 software for -- to improve the user experience, improve the training of residents. And so, we think we have a winning hand, and we're going to continue to play that hand. Yes. What I'd tell you is this has the fastest camera on the market. Homegrown, we didn't use a third party to do this camera. It is lightning quick. And that camera will eventually be ported to the Mako as well. So that make will have that same terrific camera. It really -- the user experience is terrific in terms of being able to see and be able to do your procedure. So, the feedback we've gotten is outstanding. So, we've always been good at navigation, but this is sort of really putting our best foot forward. And this user experience that you're going to have with Q will transfer to the Mako spine, and that we're really excited about. So this is -- this even before Mako is already having an impact. And we think once Mako's launched, it will really fill this important need in the market for us to have a robotic application. We also have another product in enabling technology coming out of our instruments vision that's going to be used by the Spine group. A little early for me to give you details on what that is. But at the appropriate time, we'll tell you about that. So that, combined with Mako is going to give us very compelling enabling technology platform for Spine. Yes. Obviously, we're abiding by all the sanctions, as you would expect, and working in lockstep with the industry on industry-wide response to what should be humanitarian products and should be -- should they go through the approval process. That's obviously very lengthy. It did have a negative impact. But honestly, our Russia business is so small that it's kind of meaningless in the overall picture of Stryker. But yes, we are abiding by the sanctions. Yes, it did have a negative impact, but it was really -- it's not a material business for Stryker. Look, it's a good question. I think I've talked about the adjacencies that we're interested in. First and foremost, there's a lot of tuck-in demand. Each of our businesses are building their wish lists and sort of evaluating different targets. And I think that's job one is looking at those near-term targets that tuck-in. Those create tremendous financial returns for Stryker. They don't always move the needle for the overall growth, but they're really terrific financials for us to do. And when you feed our existing sales force of Stryker, we know how to sell, and we're able to really do that very, very well. I would tell you, in the adjacency space, no change to the adjacencies that we're interested in. I think I've mentioned them before. What I would tell you is neuromodulation's one I've talked about in the past. And within neuromodulation, obviously, there's a lot of different parts to that. There's spinal cord stimulation, there's deep brain stimulation, there's peripheral nerve stimulation, and stimulation as you know in sleep apnea. And I do believe electrical treatment is going to be a big part of the future. Over time, we've been a little hot cold on spinal cord stimulation. I would tell you right now, we're probably a little bit more cold on it, just kind of a challenging market and -- so that's the way the only thing maybe I haven't said in the past. But otherwise, every other adjacency that I talked about in Q1 are still very much on our radar screen. And as our cash frees up, probably more into next year. If the tuck-ins aren't of a significant size and we have cash starting to build up and our debt position better, hopefully, we'll be able to make a move in one of those adjacencies that I've talked about in the past. Yes. I think the word stabilization, I'd probably prefer that than grind, but yes, it's probably both, right? So Spine is a tough market, no question about it. But already with Q Guidance, we're feeling good about that. We've bolstered our expandable portfolio a bit. We still have a couple of gaps that we're looking at. Obviously, we would like to fill. But the enabling tech is really what gets us excited. And so I think the robotic platform will put us on a par at least with the competitors and then this other secret launch I talked about from coming out of instruments, which we've shown some surgeons kind of will put us ahead of the game on enabling technology. But yes, we have to wait. Unfortunately, it's not ready yet. It's coming. The instrument launch will probably come in before the Mako, and that will be able to be used with the Q Guidance. It will be compatible with Q. So that's where -- you'll hear about that probably earlier than you'll hear about Mako. But yes, I wouldn't assume we're going to -- we're going to try to kind of keep in line with market growth, which is kind of what we're doing right now, hold our own until we get to that period of time, and then we could start to grow more like a typical business of Stryker. Thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in early November."

            "content": "Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.9% in the quarter. The second quarter's average selling days were in line with 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.5%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.7% unfavorable impact on sales. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 12%, International organic sales growth was 11.4%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Canada, Europe and most of our emerging markets. Adjusted EPS of $2.54 in the quarter was up 12.9% from 2022, driven by higher sales and operating margin expansion, partially offset by a higher adjusted income tax rate and the impact of foreign currency exchange, which was unfavorable $0.03. Now, I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology has both constant currency and organic sales growth of 12.9%, which included 13.5% of U.S. organic growth and 10.9% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.9%, led by strong double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and surge account. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 3.5% against a strong comparable. This included strong growth in its ProCare sustainability and sports medicine businesses. The Endoscopy business completed its limited launch of the 1788 camera late in the second quarter. Consistent with prior camera launches and the related transition period between the legacy camera and the new camera, this also contributed to muted growth in Q2. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 27.2%, reflecting very strong performances in all three of its businesses, acute care, emergency care and Sage, and benefited from continued improvement in product supply during the quarter. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 9%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neuro Cranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.6%, which included double-digit growth in our Bone Mill, bipolar forceps and Max Space product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 10.9%, reflecting double-digit growth in our medical and Neuro Cranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia and Canada. Neurovascular's growth continues to be negatively impacted by VBP in China. Orthopaedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 10.6%, which included organic growth of 10% in the U.S. and 12.1% internationally. Our U.S. Knee business grew 10.6% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Hip business grew 8.8% organically, reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia hip stem and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 14.3% organically with strong performances across all businesses led by very strong growth in upper extremities and foot and ankle. Our U.S. Spine business grew 5.2%, led by the performance of our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses, including the recently launched Q Guidance Navigation System. Our U.S. Other Ortho declined organically 1.6%, primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 12.1% organically, including strong performances in Australia, Canada and most emerging markets. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.9% was favorable, approximately 60 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and 70 basis points sequentially compared to Q1 2023. This change was primarily driven by the slight easing of certain cost pressures, decreases in spot buy purchases, improved productivity and the benefit of price, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.4% of sales, which represents an 80 basis points decrease from the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to a higher comparable in 2022 related to the ramping of costs for product launches. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.1% of sales, which was 70 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022, due to a disciplined ramp of spend and investment to support our growth. We expect our full year SG&A as a percent of sales to be in line with 2019 levels as we continue to invest for growth. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24.3% of sales which was approximately 60 basis points favorable to the second quarter of 2022. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned easing of certain cost pressures, primarily on gross margin. Adjusted other income and expense of $66 million for the quarter was slightly higher than 2022, driven by increased interest expense. The second quarter of 2023 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.2%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we reiterate our full year effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.9 billion. Approximately $100 million of the term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, reflecting year-to-date payments of $200 million and a remaining balance of $650 million. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $1.1 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections. Considering our year-to-date results, our strong backlog for capital equipment and continued positive procedural trends, we now expect full year 2023 organic sales growth to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% with pricing to be slightly positive for the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.3% and adjusted EPS will be unfavorably impacted from $0.05 to $0.10 per share for the full year, both of which are included in our guidance. Based on our performance in the first half of the year, together with our strong sales momentum, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $10.25 to $10.45 per share. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Yes. Hey Robbie. As we got through the quarter, as I mentioned, we really started to see some positive and easing of some of the cost pressures that we had felt in Q1 and certainly last year. I think we also are starting to feel some of the improvements in supply chain. That's not to say that everything is rosy. We are still feeling inflationary pressures in transportation, some of our commodities, labor, certain electronics. But I will say that spot buys in Q1, spot buys in Q2 have not been material. And we're getting near the amortization of the impact of spot buys from last year. So I feel like that gives me good confidence that I think we'll see continued improvement in our gross margin as we move into Q3 and Q4. And so, we really will feel that gradual improvement, and we'll feel it all the way down to the op margin line. Yes. I mean, a couple of things. Q3 seasonally is usually not a super strong quarter, but I think if you focus on Q4 and you look at the comp that we're up against, that probably plays into how much we're going to grow against that comp. The big number last year, it was $5.2 billion in the quarter, which is a big number. So, I think what you'll see is you'll see slightly higher growth in Q3, and then that that will come down a little bit because of the comp, but I think we'll end the year nicely, well within our guidance. Yes. I think the big thing that really sits in inventory and worked its way through sort of in the first quarter and the second quarter was the impact of those spot buys. And generally, inventory turns depending on the product, anywhere from 6 to 9 months. So yes, we will generally see the impact of spot buys reduced for the rest of this year. Keep in mind that we still have this sort of inflationary headwind that we will be working against in Q3 and Q4. But just the mere fact that I feel like we're getting to the end of the impact of spot buys, gives me confidence that we should see gradual gross margin improvement in the rest of this year. Yes. We -- you're going to force me to divulge all the things we want to tell you in our investor meeting. But I would say, our old mantra of expanding 30 to 50 basis points every year was absolutely doable, and it's absolutely something that we are planning on getting back to. We're working through some of these higher costs through the P&L. There's this ongoing inflation that we will solve for. But I don't think that as we look forward over the longer term, the margin expansion is something that I think you'll continue to see out of us. I don't want to pinpoint a number just yet. But yes, it's something we'll continue to have. Yes. I think I'll make some couple of comments around that without maybe providing exact guidance on 2024. But, if we look at the initiatives that we executed this year, we had a very targeted program that looked kind of product by product. And in general, what we're seeing is MSNT is generally gaining positive price. And I would say Ortho is less negative and has much larger, longer-term contract negotiations. Keep in mind too that our price comparison that we report on includes sort of same product sales compared to prior year. So, if you think about increases that we gain on prices, say, on next-gen products that we're going to launch, that's not necessarily included in the number we say for price. But I would tell you that we generally see meaningful price increases on these next-gen products, especially when we bring newer technology to the market or a feature set that currently isn't provided. So, I do think that we'll continue to see price as a tailwind. It's a muscle that we've certainly grown this year, and I think it's going to be part of our game plan for sure. Yes, Joanne, we -- yes. We really -- if you think about operating margins, especially our performance in Q2, we saw a really sort of good improvement, honestly, in gross margin just in terms of some easing of some of the cost pressures, as I've mentioned before, spot buys are not material. They weren't material in Q1, and they're not material in Q2. I think the other thing, too, that we're feeling is just that now that we have more evening of supply, we're also back to sort of better productivity gains. And so all of those things give us good confidence that we should see gross margins improve in the back half of this year, and they'll gradually improve because we're still feeling some of this inflation, but that kind of gives us the confidence. And obviously, some of that will roll into next year as you think about our performance for next year. But we -- at this point, we're not going to guide on that other than to say that we do think we'll see some gradual improvement for the rest of this year. Yes. Travis, can you repeat that in terms of the operating margin question? Yes. No, I would say a couple of things. First of all, Q4 is always seasonally higher. It's our highest op margin performing quarter. So, I wouldn't necessarily say that that should be the jumping off. I think if you back up from where our guidance is, you could sort of figure out kind of where we're angling to end the year at, and that would be the good jumping off point."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as capital demand, including Mako, acquisitions and an update on product launches. Procedural volumes have largely recovered to pre-COVID levels in most countries. And while volumes are strong, patient backlog still remains, and we believe the elevated orthopedic procedural demand will continue well into 2024. While volumes have largely recovered, hospital staffing pressures and supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe. These challenges are resolving gradually as we expected and will continue to be a moderate tailwind as we move through the second half of 2023 and into 2024. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter as evidenced from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Instruments and Neuro Cranial divisions. Also, demand for Mako remains robust with strong U.S. and international performances, which is helping drive our continued growth in hips and knees. Next, capital order backlog remains elevated, well above normal levels. Also, during the quarter, we executed a small tuck-in deal and also closed on the Cerus Endovascular acquisition. Furthermore, our product super cycle continues to drive positive momentum. In late Q2, we successfully completed a limited launch of our 1788 camera platform and are poised for full launch in Q3. We also received FDA clearance for Cranial Guidance, our newest application under our Q Guidance platform. This empowers surgeons to quickly plan a safe surgical approach using multiple imaging modalities and then navigate instruments with specific surgical procedures. Finally, we remain on track for the launch of our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator outside of the U.S. in the fourth quarter of this year and in the U.S. in early 2024. These launches will continue to support growth over multiple years. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. It's Jason. I'll start here and then maybe some follow on. But as we think about the capital environment, we continue to see great strength from a capital environment standpoint. And even as you think about the backlog in our business, I think your question was, was there a bolus. But if you look at our backlog, it continues to be at very high levels, higher than what we came into the year with. So, still strength there on the capital side. Trauma."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Todd and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release, that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before opening the call to Q&A. In the first quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 13.6% with double-digit growth in both MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Orthopaedics and Spine. Our international business continues to be a growth engine with strong results in all countries other than China, which had negative growth due to COVID and volume-based procurement. We are also seeing good traction with our pricing initiatives, delivering positive pricing overall in the first quarter. Importantly, we have begun to realize the gradual improvement of component availability and lessened supply chain constraints. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.14, reflecting 8.6% growth compared to the first quarter of 2022 driven by our strong sales performance. With one quarter behind us, we now expect an increased full year organic sales growth of 8% to 9%, coming off a year with almost 10% organic sales growth. This continued sales momentum is a testament to our team's strong execution. We are increasing our expected adjusted earnings per share to $10.5 a share to $10.25 a share. I remain pleased with our ongoing commitment to talent and culture, which is reflected in the recognition of Stryker for the 13th year in a row as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. I would like to thank our leaders for maintaining our positive culture through the significant growth that we have experienced over this period of time. In addition, we recently published our third annual comprehensive report, which captures our commitment and disclosures on our three pillars of corporate responsibility, stronger people, healthier planet, and good business. In July, we will share our virtual corporate responsibility roundtable with leaders from across the organization, bringing to life our progress and how these three pillars tied to our mission. Finally, we will be holding an Investor Day on November 8th in Mahwah, New Jersey. We will provide more details about this event in the coming months. I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Beach: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as capital demand, product launches, updates on Mako and acquisitions. Procedural volumes continue to recover throughout the first quarter in most countries. As a reminder, Q1 of 2022 had softer volumes in many markets because of COVID related impacts. While volumes are recovering, hospital staffing pressures continue in pockets around the globe and patient backlog remains. As mentioned on the Q4 call, these challenges will likely resolve gradually and we continue to expect this will be a moderate tailwind as we move through 2023. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter as seen from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Endoscopy, and Instruments divisions. Our capital order book remains strong as we head into Q2. Our product super cycle is underway and driving positive momentum. This began in late 2022 with the US launch of our System 9 power tools, which gained momentum in the quarter and is getting great customer feedback regarding ergonomics and quality. In mid-Q1, we launched the Neptune S waste management system. We've seen significant trialing already with positive customer feedback related to workflow advantages and environmental benefits. Also, some of our other launches this year, include the Xpedition powered stair chair, Mako 2.0 software for knees, Q Guidance for cranial procedures, and the Insignia Hip Stem pacing to be on track for 85% launched by year-end. Finally, we received 510(k) clearance on our 1788 Camera platform which will expand our Endoscopy's division addressable market in the new procedures, including the ability to visualize lung and other cancers. As a reminder, the launch of the 1788 Camera is set for late Q2. We continue to see steady progress with these launches and expect them to be a tailwind for growth in the coming quarters and years. Next, the progress of our Mako offense has resulted in continued growth of our installed base combined with high utilization rates. In the US, we realized strength in our rental contracts which resulted in lower upfront revenue for the quarter. We continue to be agnostic to the form these deals take and our offering flexible options for our customers to acquire capital equipment. Our Vocera integration continues to progress well, and as a reminder, is now included in our organic growth beginning in February of this year. Our expectation that sales will accelerate beginning in Q2 of this year remains unchanged. We will provide our next update on Vocera when we report our full year 2023 results. Lastly, we have obtained regulatory clearance regarding our acquisition of Cerus Endovascular and we expect the deal will close shortly. With that I'll now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 13.6% in the quarter. The first quarter of 2023 had one more selling day than 2022, which is approximately a 1% benefit. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.7%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our US MedSurg businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 2.2% unfavorable impact on sales. In the quarter, US organic sales growth was 12.6%. International organic sales growth was 16.6% impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.14 in the quarter was up 8.6% from 2022, driven by higher sales and a favorable adjusted income tax rate, partially offset by inflationary pressures and the impact of foreign currency exchange, which was unfavorable $0.06. Now, I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 13.1%, with organic sales growth of 12.4%, which included 12.1% of US organic growth and 13.3% of international organic growth. Instruments had US organic sales growth of 8.9% led by double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, Steri-Shield, waste management, and smoke evacuation. Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 16.2% driven by strong growth across most of its major businesses. The growth was highlighted by general surgery, sports medicine, sustainability, communications, and ProCare products. Medical had US organic sales growth of 13.2% reflecting solid performances across our acute care, emergency care, and Sage businesses and benefiting from improvement in product supply throughout the quarter. Our US Neurovascular business returned to growth with organic sales growth of 7.3%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business. The US Neurocranial business had organic sales growth of 9.1%, which included double-digit growth in our Sonopet iQ, Signature High Speed Drills, Bipolar Forceps and Max Space Neuro product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 13.3% reflecting double-digit growth in almost all businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 15.1% with organic sales growth of 15.2% which included organic growth of 13.3% in the US and 20.3% internationally. Our US Hip business grew 16.2% organically reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem and continued procedural growth. Our US Knee business grew 20.7% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in a robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our US Trauma and Extremities business grew 13.7% organically with strong performance across all three businesses. Our US Spine business grew 6.3% led by the performance in our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses, including the recently launched Q Guidance Navigation System. Our US Other Ortho declined organically by 14.8% primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 20.3% organically, which reflects strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.2% was unfavorable approximately 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2022, reflecting the impact of increased manufacturing and supply chain costs driven by inflationary pressures, somewhat offset by price and volume increases. Sequentially and compared to Q4 2022, we have improved our adjusted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points driven by mix, price decreases in spot prices and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.5% of sales, which represents a 70 basis point decrease from the first quarter of 2022 due primarily to higher comparable in 2022, which related to the ramping of costs for product launches. Our adjusted SG&A was 35.6% of sales, which was 50 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to normalization of sales force expansion and meetings. In summary for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 21.1% of sales, which was approximately 70 basis points unfavorable to the first quarter of 2022. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned inflationary pressures primarily on gross margin. Adjusted other income and expense of $65 million for the quarter was slightly higher than 2022 mainly driven by a one-time benefit in 2022. The first quarter of 2023 had an effective tax rate of 12.8%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items, including stock compensation. For 2023, we now expect full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.1 billion, approximately $100 million of term loan debt was paid down in the quarter. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $445 million. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections in the first quarter. Considering our first quarter results, our strong order book for capital equipment and continued positive procedural trends, we now expect full year 2023 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 9%, with pricing to be relatively neutral for the year. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipated sales and EPS will be modestly unfavorably impacted for the full year being more negative in the first half of the year. This is included in our guidance. Based on our performance in the first quarter together with our strong sales momentum and further progressive easing of supply chain disruptions throughout the year, we now expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.05 to $10.25. And now I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a really impressive start to the year here. Kevin, I guess, I would just love to start with the growth rates we saw in Q1 in some of your businesses like both in Ortho and MedSurge. What in your view is, was there anything here that was a one-time here and what do you see that sustainable?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah, thanks, Larry for the question. You saw we had a great fourth quarter of sales growth, another great quarter. This quarter of sales growth. We did benefit from some softer comparisons given that Omicron was present in a lot of markets last year. But I would tell you that the procedures are really ramping very nicely and they have been really since the second half of last year, that's continued, and the capital demand remains strong. So we really have strength kind of across the portfolio of our company and that's what gives us the optimism to raise our full year guide.\nLawrence Biegelsen: So let me just follow up maybe for Glenn. If I'm doing the math right here, you raised the guidance by about 70 basis points to 80 basis points at the midpoint. The Q2 to Q4 organic growth, Glenn, and please correct me if I'm wrong, it implies about 7% at the midpoint. Is that close and kind of how are you thinking about the why the deceleration I guess and how -- and any color on the quarterly cadence from here? Thanks for taking the questions.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah, Larry. I will trust your math. The one thing I will say is that, as Kevin mentioned, Q1 maybe had a little bit of a softer comparable. Moving forward, we're going to see stronger comparables. And right now, we're still in the first quarter. So we're anxious and excited about how the businesses are performing, but we're still mindful of the environment that we're in and so we feel like this is a strong guide and imply solid performance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Great. I'll also add my congratulations on a really impressive quarter here. Maybe I had to focus in Ortho. I was kind of blown away by how good the growth rates were in hip, knee, and extremity. Would love to get a little more color on exactly what you're seeing there, how much the anterior hip stem is helping you in hip? What's going on in knee and any color you could give on the Trauma and Extremities business and what's driving the trends there?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Robbie. I would tell you that the knee performance is just a continuation of what you've seen for the past three or four years where all the Mako growth, the cementless growth, continues to fuel market leading growth. So that's not a new story. Some of the numbers OUS were pretty breathtaking. But part of that was due to softer comparables and part of that's due to really picking up Mako installations OUS. It continue to be strong in the US, but OUS has a much longer runway and started much later as you know. And so Mako will fuel that OUS growth in the same way that it's fueled our US growth for many years. So that's the knee part. On Hip, it's really a combination of the Insignia stem as well as Mako. The 4.0 software was launched within two years, in the last two years, that combined with Insignia really positions us beautifully for direct anterior and we really like the momentum that we're seeing in hips and we expect that to continue. Trauma and extremities has been a -- just a great story. The Wright Medical deal has turned out spectacularly well. The upper extremities business is absolutely on fire, the market leading business and grew very strong double-digit growth. And as well foot and ankle is really starting to pick up steam and had a very strong performance. So really all three of those Trauma and Extremities businesses, including Core Trauma had strong performances and the outlook for those businesses continues to be very positive.\nRobert Marcus: Maybe as a follow-up, Medical came in another really good quarter there ProCuity launch continued strong. We heard one of your competitors, particularly in the Bed Market talk about a weaker capital environment. So is that something you're seeing in some of the less revenue generating capital equipment items and any color you could give specifically in Medical and how the Beds are going. Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah, so far, we're still seeing very strong orders for all of our capital equipment businesses, large capital, small capital. We still have healthy order books across the board. There is a bit of noise here now that you hear from some hospitals saying while they're starting to think about capital, but we're not seeing it in our order book at least not yet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good evening and thank you for taking the question and quite a nice quarter and I'm going to agree with some of the growth rate in hips and knees, particularly in the US were quite strong. I just want to take out picture a few things. Can you give us an update on where you think you are in the ASC and I'll throw in my follow-up now on updated thoughts on use of cash? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. The ASC joint continues its trend that we've been seeing for some time, continued progression in both hips and knees. We're now in double-digit penetration in both hips and knee little bit more knees, but both continuing I call it a steady progression and I don't think that will slow down. I think that will just continue over the next few years with the expansion into ASCs with construction projects with more and more procedures moving out and we're even starting to see some of the extremity procedures move out even some spine procedures. So it's a trend that will continue, but it's not something that's going to ramp exponentially because it's gated by construction and building out of new ORs. So it just takes time. And then the second question was on?\nJason Beach: Cash flow?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Use of cash.\nJoanne Wuensch: Well, use of call.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure, Joanne. I mean, it was honestly a strong quarter for cash flow for us, coming in at $445 million. I will tell you that we benefited from elevated receivable levels as we exited Q4 last year. As we think about sort of the priorities for cash flow, we really haven't changed, sort of how we think about first of all, we want to focus on paying down the term loan. We paid $100 million in Q1. The remaining balance of $750 million we will plan on paying-off during this year. We're also seeing. We're closing on Cerus Medical. That will happen fairly shortly here. And so we are allocating some cash to M&A. Teams are still working and we're still being fairly choosy in terms of looking at opportunities and making sure we're lining up things for when cash flow frees up a little.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a really strong start here. Kevin, maybe my first question here on the performance here on the Ortho side. I guess there's a lot of moving parts. Is this -- there some thoughts on perhaps we're seeing a pull-forward of demand and recessionary fears as against the counter to that is share gain, given the new product momentum versus perhaps some of the backlog being here. Can you just lay out the different pieces here and what is happening in Ortho markets from Stryker's perspective. And related to that I'm curious on smart implants where Stryker on smart implants, given we just had an NTAP in that space.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Well, there's a lot of questions in there, Vijay. So let me start first by saying that there really isn't a new story, right? The knee business continues its strong performance. The hip business, as we said, once we get into the Insignia Stem launch, we're going to start to be able to grow above market when you combine it with Mako and with the right combine it with Stryker, we have just an incredibly strong position in Trauma and Extremities. We just executed extremely well. The market is better and we said that there was going to be a tailwind. There's no new news there. There is a tailwind. I don't think it's pull forward. I think you're going to see that tailwind last we said six quarters was our estimate. So this is the first of six quarters where you're seeing that tailwind. Keep in mind. The comps are part of the story, not just for Stryker, for the entire market. The comps were affected by COVID in the prior year. And so you're going to see an elevated market growth this quarter. But I do believe the tailwind will continue into second quarter, third quarter, again, a moderate tailwind, but our ability to take advantage of our product flow and of course our sales force execution is something that I don't see changing. I think we'll continue to be able to perform very well relative to the market and the market is going to be a little bit more elevated. And then the smart implant. So, no, we don't have any current plans for smart implant. We do have the motion sense that we've launched, which is a wearable that measures both on the femur and the tibia. And so we're an unlimited launch on that. And that is a way to make sure that you can monitor post-operatively all the types of measures that you would be thinking about after the procedure. So that's our approach versus having it implanted in the body.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful commentary, Kevin. Maybe one for Glenn here on gross margins in the quarter up sequentially. Glenn, how much of this is volume leverage given revenues came in you know above. I'm just thinking about fiscal '24 here. And again I'm not asking for guidance, but my understanding was Stryker is still seeing a lot of inflationary pressures here in '23. Most of it is the inventory flowing through the P&L, given pricing was positive and as inflationary impact a bit, how should we think about margin progression? Should we directionally be thinking of maybe perhaps above normal margin years for Stryker going forward?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. I mean, you know, first of all, we're pleased and we've made some incremental progress. And that's kind of why I wanted to call out sequentially as being maybe a little bit more important as you look at margin year-over-year. If you look at just sort of in just for the quarter, some of the big things are really price. We did see reduced spot buys. But keep in mind, we're still amortizing those 2022 spot buys. So that's going to hit us on into third quarter. We also as supply evened out, it just allowed our manufacturing to be a little more consistent and drive better efficiencies. And so we kind of got back on driving better manufacturing efficiencies. The other thing we're seeing is that freight rates are monitoring and we're seeing improvement in those rates. The other the couple pieces, I would say, mix was a bit of a tailwind. Obviously, if you think about Ortho and Spine and the kind of gross margins they drive versus MedSurge, that was a little bit of a tailwind. I think that will continue to be a little bit of a tailwind as the year progresses. We are still tempered in this environment, this inflationary environment, though. And so that will keep a tamper. We're early in the year, Vijay, and we're not thinking that we want to guide on gross margin yet. I think we see some daylight and we feel good about that. But it will be a work in progress as the whole year pushes forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to follow up a little bit on Larry's question on guidance. I share his math. As I look at the numbers, I think, you beat by a couple hundred million on the top line and kind of carry that through for the full year. And I think, Kevin, at Academy, you said you thought there would be a little bit of headwind on pricing. That might have just been an Ortho comment. But also staffing is getting better. So staffing better pricing seems like it's getting better. I think given where the stock was trading, people are expecting you to guide a little bit higher if you did beat. So why not guide a little bit higher for the full year or incrementally higher than the beat given what we're seeing in your markets and the supercycle just about to start? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Thanks. So first of all, I'd tell you that we started the year with a pretty good guide and obviously had a very strong quarter. And we raised and it's only one quarter the supply chain, to Glenn's point, there are still, let's call them brushfires happening all the time that we're having to tamp out. And there we are not completely out of the woods on supply chain issues, which can cause uncertainty. Launches have to actually occur on time and be able to deliver what we hope they can deliver. That creates uncertainty. We had roughly almost 10% organic sales growth last year with a monster Q4. And so there's a lot of reasons why, you know, let's just temper our enthusiasm. It was a great quarter. I'm very happy with it. But we've moved it up. Let's see how things play out over the next quarter or two quarters before we get ahead of ourselves. And you've seen us in the past. We're not afraid. We don't have to raise once for the full year if things go well in the future, if the launch is hit on the right time, if we're able to sustain this kind of price performance then we can think about raising. But it's a little too premature to do that right now.\nMatthew O'Brien: Okay. Makes sense. As a follow-up, Kevin. On Mako, I know more rentals. It just is because I look at the rest of the business on the capital side of things. You're not having any problem selling things. I know Mako is more expensive, but you've got [RAS] (ph) out there, you've got VELYS from J&J and now you're doing more rental contracts. So I guess the interpretation from most of the investors would be that, hey, they're seeing more pressure in terms of the ability to sell Mako. Is that fair or are we just not able to see that you're still capturing your fair share of Mako sales and placements within the marketplace? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Just to be clear, we are very bullish on the future of Mako, and we have been. And if you look at our hip and knee number, that's a pretty good indicator that a lot of our growth comes from accounts that had Makos installed. If the competitors offer things for free, that obviously causes the customer to say, do I need to pay something upfront. And we've always had rentals and financing within the mix of offerings. In the past, they would be much more inclined to purchase. They're now leaning much more towards rentals. And honestly I don't -- it doesn't bother me at all. And then Jason, any comments on rentals?\nJason Beach: Yes. I think maybe just one additional comment relative to rentals. I think the thing to keep in mind is a large percentage of these rentals they'll flip to purchases, right? So it's not like they're going in and the units are coming back out. So, to Kevin's point, we feel really good about the Mako business.\nKevin Lobo: What I'd say competitive pressures have caused a little bit of a shift in customer behavior. That doesn't concern us. We are winning at a very high rate. And the Makos that are being installed are being used at a very high rate. And that's, to me, what's critical.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thanks for taking the questions. And let me add to everyone's sentiment. I want to ask the guidance. I think others are kind of getting that around the progression of quarters for the rest of the year. But if you look at the guidance on the top line relative to the growth in guidance on the bottom line, specifically for Glenn, I'm just curious. It's a little higher on the top line doesn't quite flow through. And if there's anything in there that maybe you're reinvesting in Glenn, that you want us to think about specific to the EPS growth at 8.6% relative to the top line.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. It's a good question, Ryan. I think first of all, if you look at sort of the midpoint of both guides, sales and EPS, we actually are starting to show leverage. So I think that's a positive direction. We're still very early in the year. And we are going to be mindful that we're still in, as Kevin referred to, somewhat volatile circumstances relative to supply chain, some other macroeconomic factors. And so that causes us to make sure that we're being smart about where we land in the guide. To that point, as we see the quarters play out over this year, if we see improvement, I think, we'll definitely feel compelled to take the guide up.\nKevin Lobo: And we did have a little bit of a lower tax rate as you saw this quarter based on some discretes and stock comp and that's going -- we think start to get elevated over the next three quarters. So overall we really feel like we -- the guide is an appropriate lift both on the top and the bottom line.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay. And then, Kevin, I'd love to get your perspective on the state of the spine market right now. There's obviously a lot of disruption, as you know. But NUVA Globus is progressing forward. As of right now, both parties voted to consummate that deal. Is there any disruption that you're able to capitalize on that we're seeing in your US spine numbers right now as they are starting to show some nice growth?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I think it's too early right now for us to have really seen much in the way of disruption. I think the disruption will come once they start to bring the organizations together and decide which salespeople are calling on which surgeons and which products they're going to keep, et cetera. So there really hasn't been much in the way of disruption from both of the mergers that are just starting to happen in the space. I'm pleased about our Spine business momentum and it's really because of our own innovations. Some of the licensing deals that we've done, getting the Q guidance out, which is really getting very favorable attraction in enabling technologies. We've started to show our Mako Spine, which is also getting very, very good feedback, although that won't be launched until next year. But customers are warming up to that. So I think it's more about us focusing on our own business. And if we can bring the types of innovations that we need to the market, I think, we're going to continue to do well in Spine.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shagun Singh with RBC Capital Markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi there. This is Ken [Long] (ph) for Shagun Singh. Congrats on a nice quarter. Quick question on M&A. Can you talk about your appetite for M&A and remind us of the deal size that you would be willing to go for? And what respect the valuations you would look for as in the like what do you think about valuation right now? And then just for Kevin, can you call out interest -- like you've called out interest in our -- in five different adjacencies over the last couple of weeks in M&A. Can you talk about urology and women's health, the call point in that area? And if that makes sense for Stryker to have?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. So let me start by saying that this year, to Glenn's previous remarks, we are focused on paying down debt and getting the term loan off the books. We are continuing to pursue what we call tuck-ins. And Cerus Endovascular is one of those tuck-ins, which we will close shortly. We have other tuck-ins that are in the works right now, and we'll see which ones of those happen this year. But this year is more of a year of tuck-in than it is doing billion type of deals. But as we get into next year, if we continue with the strong cash flow performance that we're currently experiencing, we will be back in the market for those larger size deals. The teams haven't slowed down their work. They're continuing to pursue discussions with many of our targets. Valuations are getting better, which is good. Interest rates are going up, which is bad. But on the overall basis, we think the market is still primed with many, many good targets. And we continue to believe that using our available cash for acquisitions as the first source of cash and the first use of our cash is the right strategy with Stryker is a key part of our growth formula. Specific to your question on women's health and urology, we do have a presence in urology with our Endoscopy division, and that is an interesting space that we'd like to build around over time. We do have some women's health presence also, a combination of part of the Instruments division as well as our Endoscopy division is present right now within breast care. So these are not markets where we're sort of absent, but we're already present to some degree. And if we could get a larger presence, that would be something that is one of many, as you mentioned, many adjacencies that we're looking at. And I think that's all I'll say for this earnings call.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks so much for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen.\nEric Anderson: Hi. This is Eric on for Josh. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on your Mako shoulder and spine applications. I know we're still a ways off from commercial launch there. But could you just talk about the next steps in terms of development and the regulatory processes there? Are there any milestones that we should have on our radar for those applications? And the follow-up would just be on, are you able to share what sort of submission those applications would be to get clearance? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Listen, we're not going to get into all the details of the launch or specific milestones. Suffice to say that we are still very much on track with the time lines that we laid out last quarter. No change and continued really positive feedback from customers that we are exposing to the technology. We feel the regulatory path has gotten more certain, which is why we never provided dates prior because we weren't as confident on the regulatory path. These are complex launches. If something changes, we'll let you know. But right now, everything remains on track as per the last discussion we had.\nEric Anderson: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatt Miksic: Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question and I have to say, I'm not sure that congrats on the quarter quite adequately covers these numbers. I mean they're really just out of balance, I guess, in terms of these end markets. So a couple of follow-ups, if I could. It looks -- just looking at US knees kind of as one line item. It looks like you accelerated on -- obviously, just year-over-year, but also on a two-year stack basis into the first quarter. And just thinking about the drivers there and how sustainable they are. You obviously had a big leading market in robotics. We all know how that has worked out. Wondering if you could talk about how you feel about the lead you have in ASPs, and whether this could shape up to be kind of a similar long-term driver? And then just also on that subject, rentals came up earlier. I'm wondering what -- to what degree this rentals are really showing up more in the ASPs? I know there's a couple of questions in there, but I do have one follow-up on MedSurg, if I could.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, sure. Thank you. Yes, we have a very significant lead in robotics. We have a significant lead in cementless, and we have a significant lead in the ASC. So we have all three of those factors are at play and contributing to strong performance. And you are right, in the ASC, they tend to shift much more towards rentals or let's call it, forms of financing that -- because there's always physician ownership as part of these deals, and they don't have the capital budget that hospitals do to make a purchase, so they do prefer financing. And so you'll continue to see that with ASCs much more of a shift towards rentals. And we're seeing with ASC's strong demand for Mako, which is really exciting for us. And so if there's a there OR orthopedic ASC, usually, at least one of those will have a Mako in them. And that our offense plays very well for that given all the other technology we can provide for the ASC. So those -- I would say all three of those factors are really at play having significant leads across those three tenants.\nMatt Miksic: That's super helpful. Thank you for the color. And then on MedSurg, just specifically, your back order, your order condition as they're sort of stable. I'm wondering, have you started to see some of the back orders specifically start to move or accelerate or thoughts and timing on that? And then the factors you mentioned still expecting Vocera to accelerate. Maybe just an update on some of the factors that you're expecting to drive that acceleration? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So back -- if you think about medical, medical is going to have another very strong year this year. Even though you saw a boomer in the fourth quarter, I did signal that medical will still have another strong year. They have the largest backlog of all the divisions of our company right now and that's across emergency care as well as acute care. The largest is within medical. And so we're still fighting the supply chain is getting better every month, but it's still not easy. Out there in the supply chain for medical, and then the other capital businesses follow behind medical. So still a very, very strong order book. And what was the second? And on Vocera, yes, we're really pleased. We predicted this, right? If you go back to second quarter of last year, we said -- we're going through some disruption or making changes to the way that we go to market and in the commercial model. We're pushing much more towards the cloud. So very intentional decisions and things have played out basically as we thought. Their orders are also -- have also picked up pretty meaningfully. And we do expect to see an acceleration starting in Q2 based on the orders we already have in the system. We know that, that's going to start to be a nice contributor. And then given how much we pay for Vocera, we will provide some more metrics on that at the end of the year, and we plan to probably do that on an annual basis as we do with Mako.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess and congrats on another quarter as well. I wanted to break down Q1 a bit more. A lot of companies have mentioned January was really the strong month where there was a comp benefit. So curious how you saw February and March shape up and even April. And I heard you say procedures were ramping over the quarter. So that implies April even kind of better in February and March. Just any kind of color you can give on the shape of the quarter and how things are trending across the different businesses would be helpful?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, I'd say January and February are both very strong versus prior year because they were -- those two months were more affected. Last year, March was a little bit, let's say, more muted than the first two months. And then I would say April has continued at good levels. So when I say ramping, it was really sort of over last year's fourth quarter into this year's first quarter, April continues to be strong. Just these elevated procedure levels are not that different between January, February, March or April. It's just more about what the comparators were in the prior period. But continue to expect good volumes overall.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thank you. And then -- and Glenn, maybe touch a bit more on the margins. If you can help quantify some of the supply chain purchasing improvements we've seen so far [Technical Difficulty] but just come from the higher costs rolling off. And then maybe longer term, the path back to the -- is there a path back to the 2019 gross and operating margins?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, sure. A couple of things. Like as we think about spot buys just in absolute dollar terms, we had a significantly less amount of purchases through that spot buy channel in Q1. And so we know that as we see 2022 impact amortize off, we're not really adding to that. So I do know that, that will give us a little bit of lift in the back half of the year. I also think mix is helpful as Ortho procedures continue to ramp, as Kevin mentioned. The other big thing will be these new product launches. We usually gain price on these sort of next-gen products that we put out there. And while that's not specifically in the price component that we quote, it definitely will help margin. In terms of the path back to 2019, that is a question that we get fairly frequently. I would tell you that we're hyper focused on regaining sort of our position on gross margin, obviously, going after that by being as aggressive as we can on price and putting in really good programs that will help on the price side. We're seeing improved manufacturing efficiencies in other areas, which also are going to drive. I don't foresee that, that would happen this year. But that, beyond this year, we definitely are focused on what the pathway would be back to that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Company.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Congratulations, guys. I guess, Kevin, tracking comps over the past three years, obviously, has been a challenge. I was wondering if you could give us your perspective on where you think underlying volume growth is for the joint recon market now.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. I think if you go back to 2019 and call that the last normal year that we've had. I would say we are fully backed to 2019 and actually growing from that. So you're right, it's very difficult to look at comps. You've got -- just look at last year, you have to look at how it was last year versus the year before. So it has been very tricky, to your point. But I think we're now in a kind of post-pandemic world. Even though we do have staffing shortages here and there, the surgeons are as busy as they've ever been. If they had sometimes some more stuff, I think you do even more. But I would say we're in a very good position in the market. There's healthy demand. Hospitals are learning how to get more procedures done. And so I would say we're fully back to the 2019 in most parts of the world. Maybe China is a little different. Outside of China, everything else is kind of fully back and building kind of what I'll call a normal growth rate off of being fully back. And of course there is pent-up demand.\nSteven Lichtman: Right. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up. You talked about the pricing actions last quarter, and obviously, those have kicked in, as you noted, particularly in Orthopedics, a nice step. What is the sustainability of that sort of level of pricing you're able to hold here this year, particularly in Orthopedics? Is this something that we could see sort of steadily fold in over the next few years? Is there some kind of catch-up this year that we maybe shouldn't count on as we look beyond? Any sort of color on that would be helpful.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure. I mean, first off, we're super excited that these pricing programs that we put in place last year are really starting to take hold and we're seeing an impact. MSNT continues to perform fairly positive. I would expect that they'll continue to perform at a positive or near positive level throughout the full year. Ortho is a little bit more complex. It's heavily driven by contracts. The impact of pricing can vary depending on the anniversary of those contracts. So really going after Ortho and just trying to manage that to be a little less negative. And then as you look at that price that we put out, it's impacted by mix. These product introductions are going to impact that. And I would say that all of these factors kind of go into where our forecast was that, yes, Q1 was great. But as we anniversary these pricing programs, as we see new products come out, we're going to see a little moderation of the impact of that price and that's where we're holding right now as the year progresses.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel.\nRick Wise: Good afternoon. Hi, Kevin. Hi, Glenn, I want to ask for a little more color, if we could, on SG&A. I know you're reluctant to get into forecasting or talking in too much detail about specific lines. But the SG&A was a lot higher than I expected this quarter. Yes, volumes were higher, so was it higher commissions? And as I look at last year, and I know there's a million moving pieces here, but you started out $1.5 billion in SG&A. And it was roughly approximately that in each quarter. So is this start to the year giving us some sense of how to think about SG&A in the second, third, fourth quarters as well? Thank you.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah, that was great question. I mean first and foremost, as you mentioned, the most variable item in SG&A really relates to sales commissions, and relates to these tiered programs that we have for our reps. And as they really perform and perform at quota, we pay them well. I think the second thing, some of the things that happened in first quarter, we invested in order to support these high-growth levels, and this means hiring sales reps. This means full on national sales meetings, and you're seeing the sort of quarter-over-quarter impact of those things. I think in the background, we definitely still have this inflationary environment that obviously impacts some of those things that flow through SG&A. We had merit increases that also hit in Q1. I think that SG&A should moderate -- moderate somewhat over the remainder of the year and Q1 is a little higher because of those factors I mentioned. But I also would say that we are sort of trending toward a more kind of normalized, pre-pandemic level of SG&A spend as it relates to a percent of sales.\nRick Wise: Great. And one other question to touch on sort of a side topic a little bit. But smoke evacuation, I know you've talked about a lot in the past, Kevin, and we've seen three states. I think if I'm remembering correctly, Oregon, New York, New Jersey, smoke bills going into effect this year, 10 additional states in the pipeline. I know it's not all driven by state legislation, but nurse associations, et cetera, continue to want to move in this direction. Any update there? Are you still excited about this? Is this still going to be an above-average growth area for Stryker? Thanks so much.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Rick. Definitely excited about smoke evacuation. We now are at 11 states that mandate smoke evacuation with another roughly 10 that have sort of legislation that's pending, that will likely pass. It will be a tailwind for growth, for sure. We have that business captured in both a little bit of endoscopy and also in instruments just based on our portfolio of products. Both grew well north of 20% in the first quarter and that will continue as more and more states adopt. So definitely bullish on smoke evacuation. We're still in the early stages. And absolutely with nursing shortages and nursing demands for safety, it plays very, very well.\nRick Wise: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nMatthew Mishan: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Not to harp on like the one outlier, but I guess on neurovascular. Could you comment on like on some of the weakness there? And how you expect that to progress through kind of 2023?\nJason Beach: Yeah, Matt, it's Jason. I'll take this one. And I'd say a couple of different things as you think about neurovascular. First off, in the US, you obviously saw in the first quarter, we returned back to growth. As we look at the rest of the year, we're pleased with the progress in the first quarter, and we think that will continue throughout the year in the US. As you think about international, right? As you all know, it's a dynamic environment in China with VBP. So that will be volatile. We did experience some VBP activity in the first quarter. You also know that China overall is a bit of material, so I won't get into the specifics of the impact in China, but it is included in our guidance.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. For NV, China was a pretty significant business. For overall Stryker not so much, but it was for NV. And so that negative you're seeing is really entirely driven by China in the international Neurovascular business.\nMatthew Mishan: Okay. Excellent. And then just on the other line where Mako is and I realize it's not all Mako in there. Just at what point do you expect to lap how customers are purchasing Mako and potentially start showing some growth in that line?\nJason Beach: Yes. I'll take this one. As you can imagine, when you think about deal mix and some of the things that go into that line, it will continue to move around as we go throughout this year. And as you start to get into next year, certainly, you would expect to see that line turn to positive. But it is going to be driven by deal mix as we go throughout this year.\nMatthew Mishan: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank.\nImron Zafar: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a great quarter. I wanted to ask about the 1788 Camera in Endoscopy. Can you just quantify first how TAM expensive that could be? And then how much potential there is for share gain with that camera? Once it sounds like it could be a little bit more needle moving than we've seen in prior launches for HD cameras? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks for the question. I wouldn't think so much about expansion of TAM, I would think much more about share gain. Because we're still basically in procedures that are using visualization. We're not creating new visualization for new procedures. But the reason I think it plays well for share gain is we have much better solutions for both sports medicine as well as neuro procedures. We were always fabulous with abdominal surgery, general surgery, but not quite as strong in those two specialties. And then being able to light up new fluoro force, new imaging agents to be able to detect cancer, that's game changing, right? We will be first to the market in being able to identify new forms of cancer. We will share that when those launches occur. We'll actually share that with you. But that will be a tremendous catalyst to drive share gain when you can identify critical parts of the anatomy much more precisely than the human eye can. And so we're very bullish on the long-term future for 1788.\nImron Zafar: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.\nRichard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. Kevin, just on Mako and ASCs, and forgive me if this is a naive question, just not the way things work. But just given that you're involved so early with so many instances where ASCs are getting resurrected or built out. I'm curious, does that give you an opportunity to feed or get a robotics conversation or consideration, capital placement conversation going very early? And I'm just wondering if that is kind of happening right now?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Being on the ground floor for ASCs is helpful for all of our capital equipment. And the fact that we can provide a lot of what they need really helps -- it puts us in a good position, because we're on the ground floor. And Mako speaks for itself. It's brand. It's very strong in the market. [The turns] [4:24]*13 are very well aware of Mako and they're asking for it. But I think it gives us an advantage, frankly, not just for Mako, but for all of our capital equipment businesses. Being so involved we're in the conversation, making it easy for the ASC to be able to not only design the ASCs, but actually be able to speed up the construction of the ASC if they partner with one company that can provide a lot of what they need.\nRichard Newitter: Yes. And kind of a similar tag-on question to that. You've been asked in the past about cross-selling or across service lines. You've said that just hospitals haven't moved as quickly along the path of being able to negotiate one product area for another and thinking along those lines. Is the ASC kind of further along on that negotiation process? And I'm just curious if you guys have an advantage there where if you start to tack on additional adjacencies, you might be able to actually facilitate cross-selling with your strong foothold with the procedures that you're already in now and you’re -- the capital equipment businesses? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Certainly, for the ASCs, within orthopedic ASCs, they are buying really across product lines. They're still within the service line, but yes, they are buying capital. They're buying disposables, they're buying implants. And versus hospitals, that tend to stick at the product category level. This has been a shift with ASC for sure. But they're not buying across into a new service line like orthopedics or general surgery, because these ASCs are either orthopedic ASCs or they are GI ASCs or general surgery ASCs. So they are quite specific. But within Orthopedics and the Orthopedic ASC, they are absolutely buying across product categories and that definitely plays to our advantage because we're very deep within these service line, service line of orthopedics and obviously, neuro.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really strong start to the year. Just one quick question for me and sorry to harp on this, it has come up a few times on the call. But -- just as we look at the margins, not a lot of margin upside in the quarter. I appreciate you still have inflationary pressures and inventory rolling off the balance sheet that's impacting that. But wondering if you could talk a little bit more about anything specific that happened in the quarter given such a strong sales beat and you're talking positive pricing commentary. So just sort of reconciling in line margins given the extent of the sales beat. Thanks so much.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, Danielle, good question. I hate to kind of be a broken record and reiterate some of the things that we did talk about. But I would tell you that -- you're absolutely right. We are feeling the higher product cost that came through towards the end of last year is now flowing through this quarter. And not a lot of upside is going to come from that. As I look at sort of upsides that we did see, this price is an upside that certainly helped us with margin. I would also say and I don't want to make light of it, but these improved manufacturing efficiencies and improved freight rates, although smaller, still incrementally helped us as well. And as the year goes on, as we feel the impact of those will become more significant. And so I think you'll see moderate improvements as the year goes on. Keep in mind, though, that mix is going to cause some fluctuation. And then we do have this underlying kind of inflationary environment that is a little bit of a headwind.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeffrey Johnson: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Two quick Mako questions here. Just, Glenn, first, what are the margin implications on kind of this leasing, this pickup in leasing on Mako? Is there anything good or bad that, that does the margin line? And when these contracts convert over to a sale, let's say, in six or 12 months, any margin implications then?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Honestly, rentals have been part of our plan. And so as we look at sort of how we're attacking the market, we're focused on placements. And to Jason's point, if customers prefer rentals or if they are less inclined to put the upfront money forward just because maybe competitors are placing products for free or things like that, we're more than willing to spread out this purchase price over any period of time that they're interested in. I mean oftentimes these rentals convert within a one year or two year to a purchase, and then we'll gain back the purchase price. I would tell you that in the context of our entire sales portfolio, it's just not a material number in terms of how it could move. So we are very happy to do rentals. Honestly, we want to just increase the Mako footprint.\nJeffrey Johnson: All right. Fair enough. And then discussion here on competition and if competitors are going to offer no cost rentals or whatever no upfront, but then you guys as well, when you're happy with that as well. I guess the other thing I keep hearing out in the field, and we just want to cross check this with you. I mean the hospitals are kind of allocating more capital towards procedural tools, things that take care of the patients that are coming back in the hospital, less towards nonrevenue generating CapEx. I would assume that's another kind of thing that's impacting Mako at this point, too, right? I mean the hospital can put more towards your power tools in your Endo camera and get the rental upfront, it's a good allocation for them to go that direction and get kind of the best of both worlds. So I assume it's not just competition. There's a little bit here of just hospitals reallocating the procedural tools right now in the current cycle we're in.\nJason Beach: Yes, Jeff, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. I mean what I would say is, to your point, there's different buckets of money that a hospital has to defense here, right? And so if they have operational expense, if you will, that they can use to place a Mako or something like that, and they may be a little tighter on the CapEx side, it certainly is a lever that they have. And to Glenn's point, we're super happy to help them with that. So it is an option for them. And again, one that we're certainly happy to partner with them on.\nJeffrey Johnson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I realize we're getting a little late here. But I wanted to get back to the Ortho strength, but maybe come at it from an international angle. The growth in the quarter was quite strong, admittedly off a lower base. But are there similar factors relative to the US driving the growth, meaning a better staffing environment, backlog capture? Or is there another kind of more dominant factor driving the international Ortho growth?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, I'd say it's really the same factors. So the nursing situation has gotten better. Just dealing with COVID, that did affect us in the first two months of last year, in Australia, in Europe, in many of these markets. And I would say that Mako is now really starting to pick up steam in many of these markets. It took a little longer than it has in the United States, but that's a contributor. Cementless is also growing pretty rapidly in certain markets around the world, some slower than others. But I would say it's the same factors at play. Not ASCs so much. I know in the UK, they're looking at potentially starting to have some ASCs. That's a very small factor outside the United States. But the other two factors of really getting procedures back up and running, doing a better job dealing with nursing, there are still issues here and there. But getting those back patients or as a patient backlog like there is here in the United States, so people who have been putting off their procedures now wanting to get their procedures done. So I would say it's a very similar dynamic in other parts of the world. But again, our head starting robotics, our head start in cementless does position us well, and we are extremely pleased with the performance internationally in the first quarter.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a quick one for Glenn. You kind of touched on this earlier, but pricing, it was what, 70 basis point good guy in 1Q, the annual guidance calls for a relatively neutral pricing for the year. Is it primarily a mix dynamic, acting as the biggest potential weight on price over the next few quarters? I'm just kind of wondering what would pressure price over the next three quarters?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I mean it's -- mix is one factor. I think some of the other things are -- these pricing programs are going to anniversary in Q3 when we kick them off. So year-over-year, it just won't show up as a big a difference. The other thing I would say is on this product super cycle, those products are launched. They're not included in the pricing calculation because they're next-gen models of the previous old models. And we really only compare like-for-like. So that's a little bit of a factor that, honestly, will help us on the top line because those products generally go out at much higher prices than the predicate product. And so I think if you take all that together, we just believe right now that we anticipate landing prices neutral for the full year, which honestly we'll still take as a win.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: Hey, thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to ask overall on the capital side. I mean, obviously, you've talked about the capital super cycle that you have. I'm just wondering if you could compare and contrast some of the maybe new build out demand versus replacement demand? I think if I remember correctly, Kevin, last year, there were staffing shortages on things like the construction side of things. So just if you could help us understand what the new build out demand looks like. And then overall split between small and large capital would be very helpful. Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So sure, most of our demand comes from replacement, certainly on small capital by far. On large capital, there's -- it does tilt quite a bit more towards construction. There are still a lot of construction activities that are still underway. Some of them got delayed because they just couldn't get supplies, because they had staffing challenges. So there was a bit of push in some cases. But we have a really healthy order book, whether it's Mako, whether it's Beds, whether it's our booms and lights, pretty healthy order book. And those businesses have been performing very well. So -- and those tend to be kind of a six month, we have a forward look for about six months. And so right now, we're seeing pretty healthy demand across all of our small capital as well as large capital businesses. And we'll see how that plays out in the future. But at least we have pretty good visibility, at least for the next six months, that things are good, and we're going to expect continued strong performance in all of our capital business.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Lobo for any additional or closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: So thank you all for joining our call. As you can see, we had a very strong first quarter. We've raised our guidance and we look forward to showing our Q2 results with you in August. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before opening the call to Q&A. In the first quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 13.6% with double-digit growth in both MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Orthopaedics and Spine. Our international business continues to be a growth engine with strong results in all countries other than China, which had negative growth due to COVID and volume-based procurement. We are also seeing good traction with our pricing initiatives, delivering positive pricing overall in the first quarter. Importantly, we have begun to realize the gradual improvement of component availability and lessened supply chain constraints. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.14, reflecting 8.6% growth compared to the first quarter of 2022 driven by our strong sales performance. With one quarter behind us, we now expect an increased full year organic sales growth of 8% to 9%, coming off a year with almost 10% organic sales growth. This continued sales momentum is a testament to our team's strong execution. We are increasing our expected adjusted earnings per share to $10.5 a share to $10.25 a share. I remain pleased with our ongoing commitment to talent and culture, which is reflected in the recognition of Stryker for the 13th year in a row as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. I would like to thank our leaders for maintaining our positive culture through the significant growth that we have experienced over this period of time. In addition, we recently published our third annual comprehensive report, which captures our commitment and disclosures on our three pillars of corporate responsibility, stronger people, healthier planet, and good business. In July, we will share our virtual corporate responsibility roundtable with leaders from across the organization, bringing to life our progress and how these three pillars tied to our mission. Finally, we will be holding an Investor Day on November 8th in Mahwah, New Jersey. We will provide more details about this event in the coming months. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Yeah, thanks, Larry for the question. You saw we had a great fourth quarter of sales growth, another great quarter. This quarter of sales growth. We did benefit from some softer comparisons given that Omicron was present in a lot of markets last year. But I would tell you that the procedures are really ramping very nicely and they have been really since the second half of last year, that's continued, and the capital demand remains strong. So we really have strength kind of across the portfolio of our company and that's what gives us the optimism to raise our full year guide. Yeah, sure. Thanks, Robbie. I would tell you that the knee performance is just a continuation of what you've seen for the past three or four years where all the Mako growth, the cementless growth, continues to fuel market leading growth. So that's not a new story. Some of the numbers OUS were pretty breathtaking. But part of that was due to softer comparables and part of that's due to really picking up Mako installations OUS. It continue to be strong in the US, but OUS has a much longer runway and started much later as you know. And so Mako will fuel that OUS growth in the same way that it's fueled our US growth for many years. So that's the knee part. On Hip, it's really a combination of the Insignia stem as well as Mako. The 4.0 software was launched within two years, in the last two years, that combined with Insignia really positions us beautifully for direct anterior and we really like the momentum that we're seeing in hips and we expect that to continue. Trauma and extremities has been a -- just a great story. The Wright Medical deal has turned out spectacularly well. The upper extremities business is absolutely on fire, the market leading business and grew very strong double-digit growth. And as well foot and ankle is really starting to pick up steam and had a very strong performance. So really all three of those Trauma and Extremities businesses, including Core Trauma had strong performances and the outlook for those businesses continues to be very positive. Yeah, so far, we're still seeing very strong orders for all of our capital equipment businesses, large capital, small capital. We still have healthy order books across the board. There is a bit of noise here now that you hear from some hospitals saying while they're starting to think about capital, but we're not seeing it in our order book at least not yet. Yeah. The ASC joint continues its trend that we've been seeing for some time, continued progression in both hips and knees. We're now in double-digit penetration in both hips and knee little bit more knees, but both continuing I call it a steady progression and I don't think that will slow down. I think that will just continue over the next few years with the expansion into ASCs with construction projects with more and more procedures moving out and we're even starting to see some of the extremity procedures move out even some spine procedures. So it's a trend that will continue, but it's not something that's going to ramp exponentially because it's gated by construction and building out of new ORs. So it just takes time. And then the second question was on? Okay. Well, there's a lot of questions in there, Vijay. So let me start first by saying that there really isn't a new story, right? The knee business continues its strong performance. The hip business, as we said, once we get into the Insignia Stem launch, we're going to start to be able to grow above market when you combine it with Mako and with the right combine it with Stryker, we have just an incredibly strong position in Trauma and Extremities. We just executed extremely well. The market is better and we said that there was going to be a tailwind. There's no new news there. There is a tailwind. I don't think it's pull forward. I think you're going to see that tailwind last we said six quarters was our estimate. So this is the first of six quarters where you're seeing that tailwind. Keep in mind. The comps are part of the story, not just for Stryker, for the entire market. The comps were affected by COVID in the prior year. And so you're going to see an elevated market growth this quarter. But I do believe the tailwind will continue into second quarter, third quarter, again, a moderate tailwind, but our ability to take advantage of our product flow and of course our sales force execution is something that I don't see changing. I think we'll continue to be able to perform very well relative to the market and the market is going to be a little bit more elevated. And then the smart implant. So, no, we don't have any current plans for smart implant. We do have the motion sense that we've launched, which is a wearable that measures both on the femur and the tibia. And so we're an unlimited launch on that. And that is a way to make sure that you can monitor post-operatively all the types of measures that you would be thinking about after the procedure. So that's our approach versus having it implanted in the body. Yeah. Thanks. So first of all, I'd tell you that we started the year with a pretty good guide and obviously had a very strong quarter. And we raised and it's only one quarter the supply chain, to Glenn's point, there are still, let's call them brushfires happening all the time that we're having to tamp out. And there we are not completely out of the woods on supply chain issues, which can cause uncertainty. Launches have to actually occur on time and be able to deliver what we hope they can deliver. That creates uncertainty. We had roughly almost 10% organic sales growth last year with a monster Q4. And so there's a lot of reasons why, you know, let's just temper our enthusiasm. It was a great quarter. I'm very happy with it. But we've moved it up. Let's see how things play out over the next quarter or two quarters before we get ahead of ourselves. And you've seen us in the past. We're not afraid. We don't have to raise once for the full year if things go well in the future, if the launch is hit on the right time, if we're able to sustain this kind of price performance then we can think about raising. But it's a little too premature to do that right now. Yes. Just to be clear, we are very bullish on the future of Mako, and we have been. And if you look at our hip and knee number, that's a pretty good indicator that a lot of our growth comes from accounts that had Makos installed. If the competitors offer things for free, that obviously causes the customer to say, do I need to pay something upfront. And we've always had rentals and financing within the mix of offerings. In the past, they would be much more inclined to purchase. They're now leaning much more towards rentals. And honestly I don't -- it doesn't bother me at all. And then Jason, any comments on rentals? What I'd say competitive pressures have caused a little bit of a shift in customer behavior. That doesn't concern us. We are winning at a very high rate. And the Makos that are being installed are being used at a very high rate. And that's, to me, what's critical. And we did have a little bit of a lower tax rate as you saw this quarter based on some discretes and stock comp and that's going -- we think start to get elevated over the next three quarters. So overall we really feel like we -- the guide is an appropriate lift both on the top and the bottom line. Yes. I think it's too early right now for us to have really seen much in the way of disruption. I think the disruption will come once they start to bring the organizations together and decide which salespeople are calling on which surgeons and which products they're going to keep, et cetera. So there really hasn't been much in the way of disruption from both of the mergers that are just starting to happen in the space. I'm pleased about our Spine business momentum and it's really because of our own innovations. Some of the licensing deals that we've done, getting the Q guidance out, which is really getting very favorable attraction in enabling technologies. We've started to show our Mako Spine, which is also getting very, very good feedback, although that won't be launched until next year. But customers are warming up to that. So I think it's more about us focusing on our own business. And if we can bring the types of innovations that we need to the market, I think, we're going to continue to do well in Spine. Yes, sure. So let me start by saying that this year, to Glenn's previous remarks, we are focused on paying down debt and getting the term loan off the books. We are continuing to pursue what we call tuck-ins. And Cerus Endovascular is one of those tuck-ins, which we will close shortly. We have other tuck-ins that are in the works right now, and we'll see which ones of those happen this year. But this year is more of a year of tuck-in than it is doing billion type of deals. But as we get into next year, if we continue with the strong cash flow performance that we're currently experiencing, we will be back in the market for those larger size deals. The teams haven't slowed down their work. They're continuing to pursue discussions with many of our targets. Valuations are getting better, which is good. Interest rates are going up, which is bad. But on the overall basis, we think the market is still primed with many, many good targets. And we continue to believe that using our available cash for acquisitions as the first source of cash and the first use of our cash is the right strategy with Stryker is a key part of our growth formula. Specific to your question on women's health and urology, we do have a presence in urology with our Endoscopy division, and that is an interesting space that we'd like to build around over time. We do have some women's health presence also, a combination of part of the Instruments division as well as our Endoscopy division is present right now within breast care. So these are not markets where we're sort of absent, but we're already present to some degree. And if we could get a larger presence, that would be something that is one of many, as you mentioned, many adjacencies that we're looking at. And I think that's all I'll say for this earnings call. Yes. Listen, we're not going to get into all the details of the launch or specific milestones. Suffice to say that we are still very much on track with the time lines that we laid out last quarter. No change and continued really positive feedback from customers that we are exposing to the technology. We feel the regulatory path has gotten more certain, which is why we never provided dates prior because we weren't as confident on the regulatory path. These are complex launches. If something changes, we'll let you know. But right now, everything remains on track as per the last discussion we had. Yes, sure. Thank you. Yes, we have a very significant lead in robotics. We have a significant lead in cementless, and we have a significant lead in the ASC. So we have all three of those factors are at play and contributing to strong performance. And you are right, in the ASC, they tend to shift much more towards rentals or let's call it, forms of financing that -- because there's always physician ownership as part of these deals, and they don't have the capital budget that hospitals do to make a purchase, so they do prefer financing. And so you'll continue to see that with ASCs much more of a shift towards rentals. And we're seeing with ASC's strong demand for Mako, which is really exciting for us. And so if there's a there OR orthopedic ASC, usually, at least one of those will have a Mako in them. And that our offense plays very well for that given all the other technology we can provide for the ASC. So those -- I would say all three of those factors are really at play having significant leads across those three tenants. Yes. So back -- if you think about medical, medical is going to have another very strong year this year. Even though you saw a boomer in the fourth quarter, I did signal that medical will still have another strong year. They have the largest backlog of all the divisions of our company right now and that's across emergency care as well as acute care. The largest is within medical. And so we're still fighting the supply chain is getting better every month, but it's still not easy. Out there in the supply chain for medical, and then the other capital businesses follow behind medical. So still a very, very strong order book. And what was the second? And on Vocera, yes, we're really pleased. We predicted this, right? If you go back to second quarter of last year, we said -- we're going through some disruption or making changes to the way that we go to market and in the commercial model. We're pushing much more towards the cloud. So very intentional decisions and things have played out basically as we thought. Their orders are also -- have also picked up pretty meaningfully. And we do expect to see an acceleration starting in Q2 based on the orders we already have in the system. We know that, that's going to start to be a nice contributor. And then given how much we pay for Vocera, we will provide some more metrics on that at the end of the year, and we plan to probably do that on an annual basis as we do with Mako. Yes, I'd say January and February are both very strong versus prior year because they were -- those two months were more affected. Last year, March was a little bit, let's say, more muted than the first two months. And then I would say April has continued at good levels. So when I say ramping, it was really sort of over last year's fourth quarter into this year's first quarter, April continues to be strong. Just these elevated procedure levels are not that different between January, February, March or April. It's just more about what the comparators were in the prior period. But continue to expect good volumes overall. Yes. I think if you go back to 2019 and call that the last normal year that we've had. I would say we are fully backed to 2019 and actually growing from that. So you're right, it's very difficult to look at comps. You've got -- just look at last year, you have to look at how it was last year versus the year before. So it has been very tricky, to your point. But I think we're now in a kind of post-pandemic world. Even though we do have staffing shortages here and there, the surgeons are as busy as they've ever been. If they had sometimes some more stuff, I think you do even more. But I would say we're in a very good position in the market. There's healthy demand. Hospitals are learning how to get more procedures done. And so I would say we're fully back to the 2019 in most parts of the world. Maybe China is a little different. Outside of China, everything else is kind of fully back and building kind of what I'll call a normal growth rate off of being fully back. And of course there is pent-up demand. Yes. Thanks, Rick. Definitely excited about smoke evacuation. We now are at 11 states that mandate smoke evacuation with another roughly 10 that have sort of legislation that's pending, that will likely pass. It will be a tailwind for growth, for sure. We have that business captured in both a little bit of endoscopy and also in instruments just based on our portfolio of products. Both grew well north of 20% in the first quarter and that will continue as more and more states adopt. So definitely bullish on smoke evacuation. We're still in the early stages. And absolutely with nursing shortages and nursing demands for safety, it plays very, very well. Yeah. For NV, China was a pretty significant business. For overall Stryker not so much, but it was for NV. And so that negative you're seeing is really entirely driven by China in the international Neurovascular business. Yes. Thanks for the question. I wouldn't think so much about expansion of TAM, I would think much more about share gain. Because we're still basically in procedures that are using visualization. We're not creating new visualization for new procedures. But the reason I think it plays well for share gain is we have much better solutions for both sports medicine as well as neuro procedures. We were always fabulous with abdominal surgery, general surgery, but not quite as strong in those two specialties. And then being able to light up new fluoro force, new imaging agents to be able to detect cancer, that's game changing, right? We will be first to the market in being able to identify new forms of cancer. We will share that when those launches occur. We'll actually share that with you. But that will be a tremendous catalyst to drive share gain when you can identify critical parts of the anatomy much more precisely than the human eye can. And so we're very bullish on the long-term future for 1788. Yes. Being on the ground floor for ASCs is helpful for all of our capital equipment. And the fact that we can provide a lot of what they need really helps -- it puts us in a good position, because we're on the ground floor. And Mako speaks for itself. It's brand. It's very strong in the market. [The turns] [4:24]*13 are very well aware of Mako and they're asking for it. But I think it gives us an advantage, frankly, not just for Mako, but for all of our capital equipment businesses. Being so involved we're in the conversation, making it easy for the ASC to be able to not only design the ASCs, but actually be able to speed up the construction of the ASC if they partner with one company that can provide a lot of what they need. Yes. Certainly, for the ASCs, within orthopedic ASCs, they are buying really across product lines. They're still within the service line, but yes, they are buying capital. They're buying disposables, they're buying implants. And versus hospitals, that tend to stick at the product category level. This has been a shift with ASC for sure. But they're not buying across into a new service line like orthopedics or general surgery, because these ASCs are either orthopedic ASCs or they are GI ASCs or general surgery ASCs. So they are quite specific. But within Orthopedics and the Orthopedic ASC, they are absolutely buying across product categories and that definitely plays to our advantage because we're very deep within these service line, service line of orthopedics and obviously, neuro. Yes, I'd say it's really the same factors. So the nursing situation has gotten better. Just dealing with COVID, that did affect us in the first two months of last year, in Australia, in Europe, in many of these markets. And I would say that Mako is now really starting to pick up steam in many of these markets. It took a little longer than it has in the United States, but that's a contributor. Cementless is also growing pretty rapidly in certain markets around the world, some slower than others. But I would say it's the same factors at play. Not ASCs so much. I know in the UK, they're looking at potentially starting to have some ASCs. That's a very small factor outside the United States. But the other two factors of really getting procedures back up and running, doing a better job dealing with nursing, there are still issues here and there. But getting those back patients or as a patient backlog like there is here in the United States, so people who have been putting off their procedures now wanting to get their procedures done. So I would say it's a very similar dynamic in other parts of the world. But again, our head starting robotics, our head start in cementless does position us well, and we are extremely pleased with the performance internationally in the first quarter. Yes. So sure, most of our demand comes from replacement, certainly on small capital by far. On large capital, there's -- it does tilt quite a bit more towards construction. There are still a lot of construction activities that are still underway. Some of them got delayed because they just couldn't get supplies, because they had staffing challenges. So there was a bit of push in some cases. But we have a really healthy order book, whether it's Mako, whether it's Beds, whether it's our booms and lights, pretty healthy order book. And those businesses have been performing very well. So -- and those tend to be kind of a six month, we have a forward look for about six months. And so right now, we're seeing pretty healthy demand across all of our small capital as well as large capital businesses. And we'll see how that plays out in the future. But at least we have pretty good visibility, at least for the next six months, that things are good, and we're going to expect continued strong performance in all of our capital business. So thank you all for joining our call. As you can see, we had a very strong first quarter. We've raised our guidance and we look forward to showing our Q2 results with you in August. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 13.6% in the quarter. The first quarter of 2023 had one more selling day than 2022, which is approximately a 1% benefit. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.7%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our US MedSurg businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 2.2% unfavorable impact on sales. In the quarter, US organic sales growth was 12.6%. International organic sales growth was 16.6% impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.14 in the quarter was up 8.6% from 2022, driven by higher sales and a favorable adjusted income tax rate, partially offset by inflationary pressures and the impact of foreign currency exchange, which was unfavorable $0.06. Now, I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 13.1%, with organic sales growth of 12.4%, which included 12.1% of US organic growth and 13.3% of international organic growth. Instruments had US organic sales growth of 8.9% led by double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, Steri-Shield, waste management, and smoke evacuation. Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 16.2% driven by strong growth across most of its major businesses. The growth was highlighted by general surgery, sports medicine, sustainability, communications, and ProCare products. Medical had US organic sales growth of 13.2% reflecting solid performances across our acute care, emergency care, and Sage businesses and benefiting from improvement in product supply throughout the quarter. Our US Neurovascular business returned to growth with organic sales growth of 7.3%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business. The US Neurocranial business had organic sales growth of 9.1%, which included double-digit growth in our Sonopet iQ, Signature High Speed Drills, Bipolar Forceps and Max Space Neuro product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 13.3% reflecting double-digit growth in almost all businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 15.1% with organic sales growth of 15.2% which included organic growth of 13.3% in the US and 20.3% internationally. Our US Hip business grew 16.2% organically reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem and continued procedural growth. Our US Knee business grew 20.7% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in a robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our US Trauma and Extremities business grew 13.7% organically with strong performance across all three businesses. Our US Spine business grew 6.3% led by the performance in our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses, including the recently launched Q Guidance Navigation System. Our US Other Ortho declined organically by 14.8% primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 20.3% organically, which reflects strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.2% was unfavorable approximately 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2022, reflecting the impact of increased manufacturing and supply chain costs driven by inflationary pressures, somewhat offset by price and volume increases. Sequentially and compared to Q4 2022, we have improved our adjusted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points driven by mix, price decreases in spot prices and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.5% of sales, which represents a 70 basis point decrease from the first quarter of 2022 due primarily to higher comparable in 2022, which related to the ramping of costs for product launches. Our adjusted SG&A was 35.6% of sales, which was 50 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to normalization of sales force expansion and meetings. In summary for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 21.1% of sales, which was approximately 70 basis points unfavorable to the first quarter of 2022. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned inflationary pressures primarily on gross margin. Adjusted other income and expense of $65 million for the quarter was slightly higher than 2022 mainly driven by a one-time benefit in 2022. The first quarter of 2023 had an effective tax rate of 12.8%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items, including stock compensation. For 2023, we now expect full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.1 billion, approximately $100 million of term loan debt was paid down in the quarter. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $445 million. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections in the first quarter. Considering our first quarter results, our strong order book for capital equipment and continued positive procedural trends, we now expect full year 2023 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 9%, with pricing to be relatively neutral for the year. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipated sales and EPS will be modestly unfavorably impacted for the full year being more negative in the first half of the year. This is included in our guidance. Based on our performance in the first quarter together with our strong sales momentum and further progressive easing of supply chain disruptions throughout the year, we now expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.05 to $10.25. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Yeah, Larry. I will trust your math. The one thing I will say is that, as Kevin mentioned, Q1 maybe had a little bit of a softer comparable. Moving forward, we're going to see stronger comparables. And right now, we're still in the first quarter. So we're anxious and excited about how the businesses are performing, but we're still mindful of the environment that we're in and so we feel like this is a strong guide and imply solid performance. Use of cash. Sure, Joanne. I mean, it was honestly a strong quarter for cash flow for us, coming in at $445 million. I will tell you that we benefited from elevated receivable levels as we exited Q4 last year. As we think about sort of the priorities for cash flow, we really haven't changed, sort of how we think about first of all, we want to focus on paying down the term loan. We paid $100 million in Q1. The remaining balance of $750 million we will plan on paying-off during this year. We're also seeing. We're closing on Cerus Medical. That will happen fairly shortly here. And so we are allocating some cash to M&A. Teams are still working and we're still being fairly choosy in terms of looking at opportunities and making sure we're lining up things for when cash flow frees up a little. Yeah. I mean, you know, first of all, we're pleased and we've made some incremental progress. And that's kind of why I wanted to call out sequentially as being maybe a little bit more important as you look at margin year-over-year. If you look at just sort of in just for the quarter, some of the big things are really price. We did see reduced spot buys. But keep in mind, we're still amortizing those 2022 spot buys. So that's going to hit us on into third quarter. We also as supply evened out, it just allowed our manufacturing to be a little more consistent and drive better efficiencies. And so we kind of got back on driving better manufacturing efficiencies. The other thing we're seeing is that freight rates are monitoring and we're seeing improvement in those rates. The other the couple pieces, I would say, mix was a bit of a tailwind. Obviously, if you think about Ortho and Spine and the kind of gross margins they drive versus MedSurge, that was a little bit of a tailwind. I think that will continue to be a little bit of a tailwind as the year progresses. We are still tempered in this environment, this inflationary environment, though. And so that will keep a tamper. We're early in the year, Vijay, and we're not thinking that we want to guide on gross margin yet. I think we see some daylight and we feel good about that. But it will be a work in progress as the whole year pushes forward. Yes. It's a good question, Ryan. I think first of all, if you look at sort of the midpoint of both guides, sales and EPS, we actually are starting to show leverage. So I think that's a positive direction. We're still very early in the year. And we are going to be mindful that we're still in, as Kevin referred to, somewhat volatile circumstances relative to supply chain, some other macroeconomic factors. And so that causes us to make sure that we're being smart about where we land in the guide. To that point, as we see the quarters play out over this year, if we see improvement, I think, we'll definitely feel compelled to take the guide up. Yes, sure. A couple of things. Like as we think about spot buys just in absolute dollar terms, we had a significantly less amount of purchases through that spot buy channel in Q1. And so we know that as we see 2022 impact amortize off, we're not really adding to that. So I do know that, that will give us a little bit of lift in the back half of the year. I also think mix is helpful as Ortho procedures continue to ramp, as Kevin mentioned. The other big thing will be these new product launches. We usually gain price on these sort of next-gen products that we put out there. And while that's not specifically in the price component that we quote, it definitely will help margin. In terms of the path back to 2019, that is a question that we get fairly frequently. I would tell you that we're hyper focused on regaining sort of our position on gross margin, obviously, going after that by being as aggressive as we can on price and putting in really good programs that will help on the price side. We're seeing improved manufacturing efficiencies in other areas, which also are going to drive. I don't foresee that, that would happen this year. But that, beyond this year, we definitely are focused on what the pathway would be back to that. Sure. I mean, first off, we're super excited that these pricing programs that we put in place last year are really starting to take hold and we're seeing an impact. MSNT continues to perform fairly positive. I would expect that they'll continue to perform at a positive or near positive level throughout the full year. Ortho is a little bit more complex. It's heavily driven by contracts. The impact of pricing can vary depending on the anniversary of those contracts. So really going after Ortho and just trying to manage that to be a little less negative. And then as you look at that price that we put out, it's impacted by mix. These product introductions are going to impact that. And I would say that all of these factors kind of go into where our forecast was that, yes, Q1 was great. But as we anniversary these pricing programs, as we see new products come out, we're going to see a little moderation of the impact of that price and that's where we're holding right now as the year progresses. Yeah, that was great question. I mean first and foremost, as you mentioned, the most variable item in SG&A really relates to sales commissions, and relates to these tiered programs that we have for our reps. And as they really perform and perform at quota, we pay them well. I think the second thing, some of the things that happened in first quarter, we invested in order to support these high-growth levels, and this means hiring sales reps. This means full on national sales meetings, and you're seeing the sort of quarter-over-quarter impact of those things. I think in the background, we definitely still have this inflationary environment that obviously impacts some of those things that flow through SG&A. We had merit increases that also hit in Q1. I think that SG&A should moderate -- moderate somewhat over the remainder of the year and Q1 is a little higher because of those factors I mentioned. But I also would say that we are sort of trending toward a more kind of normalized, pre-pandemic level of SG&A spend as it relates to a percent of sales. Yes, Danielle, good question. I hate to kind of be a broken record and reiterate some of the things that we did talk about. But I would tell you that -- you're absolutely right. We are feeling the higher product cost that came through towards the end of last year is now flowing through this quarter. And not a lot of upside is going to come from that. As I look at sort of upsides that we did see, this price is an upside that certainly helped us with margin. I would also say and I don't want to make light of it, but these improved manufacturing efficiencies and improved freight rates, although smaller, still incrementally helped us as well. And as the year goes on, as we feel the impact of those will become more significant. And so I think you'll see moderate improvements as the year goes on. Keep in mind, though, that mix is going to cause some fluctuation. And then we do have this underlying kind of inflationary environment that is a little bit of a headwind. Yes. Honestly, rentals have been part of our plan. And so as we look at sort of how we're attacking the market, we're focused on placements. And to Jason's point, if customers prefer rentals or if they are less inclined to put the upfront money forward just because maybe competitors are placing products for free or things like that, we're more than willing to spread out this purchase price over any period of time that they're interested in. I mean oftentimes these rentals convert within a one year or two year to a purchase, and then we'll gain back the purchase price. I would tell you that in the context of our entire sales portfolio, it's just not a material number in terms of how it could move. So we are very happy to do rentals. Honestly, we want to just increase the Mako footprint. Yes. I mean it's -- mix is one factor. I think some of the other things are -- these pricing programs are going to anniversary in Q3 when we kick them off. So year-over-year, it just won't show up as a big a difference. The other thing I would say is on this product super cycle, those products are launched. They're not included in the pricing calculation because they're next-gen models of the previous old models. And we really only compare like-for-like. So that's a little bit of a factor that, honestly, will help us on the top line because those products generally go out at much higher prices than the predicate product. And so I think if you take all that together, we just believe right now that we anticipate landing prices neutral for the full year, which honestly we'll still take as a win."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as capital demand, product launches, updates on Mako and acquisitions. Procedural volumes continue to recover throughout the first quarter in most countries. As a reminder, Q1 of 2022 had softer volumes in many markets because of COVID related impacts. While volumes are recovering, hospital staffing pressures continue in pockets around the globe and patient backlog remains. As mentioned on the Q4 call, these challenges will likely resolve gradually and we continue to expect this will be a moderate tailwind as we move through 2023. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter as seen from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Endoscopy, and Instruments divisions. Our capital order book remains strong as we head into Q2. Our product super cycle is underway and driving positive momentum. This began in late 2022 with the US launch of our System 9 power tools, which gained momentum in the quarter and is getting great customer feedback regarding ergonomics and quality. In mid-Q1, we launched the Neptune S waste management system. We've seen significant trialing already with positive customer feedback related to workflow advantages and environmental benefits. Also, some of our other launches this year, include the Xpedition powered stair chair, Mako 2.0 software for knees, Q Guidance for cranial procedures, and the Insignia Hip Stem pacing to be on track for 85% launched by year-end. Finally, we received 510(k) clearance on our 1788 Camera platform which will expand our Endoscopy's division addressable market in the new procedures, including the ability to visualize lung and other cancers. As a reminder, the launch of the 1788 Camera is set for late Q2. We continue to see steady progress with these launches and expect them to be a tailwind for growth in the coming quarters and years. Next, the progress of our Mako offense has resulted in continued growth of our installed base combined with high utilization rates. In the US, we realized strength in our rental contracts which resulted in lower upfront revenue for the quarter. We continue to be agnostic to the form these deals take and our offering flexible options for our customers to acquire capital equipment. Our Vocera integration continues to progress well, and as a reminder, is now included in our organic growth beginning in February of this year. Our expectation that sales will accelerate beginning in Q2 of this year remains unchanged. We will provide our next update on Vocera when we report our full year 2023 results. Lastly, we have obtained regulatory clearance regarding our acquisition of Cerus Endovascular and we expect the deal will close shortly. With that I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Cash flow? Yes. I think maybe just one additional comment relative to rentals. I think the thing to keep in mind is a large percentage of these rentals they'll flip to purchases, right? So it's not like they're going in and the units are coming back out. So, to Kevin's point, we feel really good about the Mako business. Yeah, Matt, it's Jason. I'll take this one. And I'd say a couple of different things as you think about neurovascular. First off, in the US, you obviously saw in the first quarter, we returned back to growth. As we look at the rest of the year, we're pleased with the progress in the first quarter, and we think that will continue throughout the year in the US. As you think about international, right? As you all know, it's a dynamic environment in China with VBP. So that will be volatile. We did experience some VBP activity in the first quarter. You also know that China overall is a bit of material, so I won't get into the specifics of the impact in China, but it is included in our guidance. Yes. I'll take this one. As you can imagine, when you think about deal mix and some of the things that go into that line, it will continue to move around as we go throughout this year. And as you start to get into next year, certainly, you would expect to see that line turn to positive. But it is going to be driven by deal mix as we go throughout this year. Yes, Jeff, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. I mean what I would say is, to your point, there's different buckets of money that a hospital has to defense here, right? And so if they have operational expense, if you will, that they can use to place a Mako or something like that, and they may be a little tighter on the CapEx side, it certainly is a lever that they have. And to Glenn's point, we're super happy to help them with that. So it is an option for them. And again, one that we're certainly happy to partner with them on."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 Stryker Earning Call. My name is Luke, and I'm your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker’s CFO, and Jason Beach, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. In the third quarter we delivered robust organic sales growth of 11.5%. Our performance included strong double-digit growth within MedSurg and Neurotechnology and nearly 10% growth in Orthopedics and Spine. This broad performance reflects healthy demand across our diverse product portfolio and our team's steadfast commercial execution. Our strong results reflect double-digit organic growth from our medical, neuro cranial endoscopy, trauma and extremities, hips and knees businesses. Our growth was well balanced between the U.S. and International with both rising double digits organically. All international regions showed strength in the quarter and we continue to see international markets as key catalysts for our long-term growth. We stayed active on the M&A front, completing several deals in the quarter. In September we acquired Care.ai, which strengthens our healthcare, IT and wirelessly connected offerings. We also acquired NICO Corporation which enables minimally invasive surgery for tumor and intracerebral hemorrhage procedures. Lastly, we acquired Vertos Medical which provides minimally invasive solution for treating chronic lower back pain caused by spinal stenosis and enhances our pain management portfolio. We remain committed to complementing our growth through acquisitions and have a strong deal pipeline and healthy financial capacity. We delivered adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.87 reflecting 16.7% growth compared to the third quarter of 2023. Finally, we are narrowing our expectations for 2024 to the high end of our previously provided guidance ranges and now anticipate full year organic sales growth of 9.5% to 10% and adjusted EPS of $12 to $12.10. Our updated guidance reflects the continued momentum from product innovation, healthy procedure volumes and terrific commercial execution across the globe. We are on track and remain committed to our goal of 200 basis points of margin expansion by the end of 2025. This includes 100 basis points of margin expansion this year while offsetting dilution from an M&A. I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Beach: Thanks Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, capital demand and recent acquisitions. Procedural volumes remained healthy in the third quarter, in line with our expectations and underscored by continued adoption of robotic assisted surgery. We continue to expect strength in procedural demand through the end of the year. Demand for our capital products was strong in the quarter with an elevated backlog across our capital businesses. Patient and customer interest in Mako was highlighted by record Q3 installations both worldwide and in the U.S. with high utilization rates across the globe. We expect the sustained momentum from installations and utilization will continue to drive growth in our hips and knees businesses. Our latest platform launches continue to experience success in the marketplace. Our Pangea Plating system is progressing well with a full launch expected in the U.S. by the second half of 2025. Our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator and monitor has a strong order book and sales have begun to ramp. Additionally, robust adoption of our 1788 visualization platform continues to contribute to the growth we are seeing in our endoscopy business. Lastly, we've begun early cases with both our Spine Guidance 5 software featuring Copilot and our Mako Spine Robot. As with prior product launches, these spine offerings will be on a limited market release for some time as we refine training protocols. Mako Shoulder is on track to launch at the end of the year. We continue to receive positive feedback from surgeons who have seen these products. From an inorganic perspective, our 2024 acquisitions reinforce our dedication to improving outcomes across the continuum-of-care and are commitment to meeting our customers’ needs. Year-to-date we have closed seven acquisitions while investing approximately 1.6 billion to complete. In 2025, we expect these acquisitions will contribute approximately 300 million to sales. With that I will turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks Jason. Today I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.5% in the quarter compared to 9.2% in the third quarter of 2023. This quarter had one more selling day than 2023. We had a 1.2% favorable impact from pricing. We continue to see a positive trend in our pricing initiatives both in the U.S. and international markets and both with our MedSurg and Neurotech and Orthopedic and Spine segment each contributing positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign Currency had a 0.1% unfavorable impact on sales. In the U.S. organic sales growth was 11.4%. International organic sales growth was 11.7% driven by positive sales momentum across our international markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.87 in the quarter was up 16.7% from 2023 driven by strong sales growth and continued margin expansion. Foreign currency exchange translation had minimal impact on our adjusted EPS for the quarter. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12.9% and organic sales growth of 12.7% which included 13.2% of U.S. organic growth and 11.2% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.9% led by strong double-digit growth in the surgical technologies business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by Waste Management, Smoke Evacuation, Tourniquet cuffs, Steri-Shield and Power tools. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.9% with strong growth across all businesses. Growth in the quarter was fueled by robust demand for our OR infrastructure and renovations and the continued success of the 1788 platform and sports medicine shoulder products. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 18.5% driven by strong performances across all of its businesses, acute care, sage and emergency care. From a product perspective the medical business was led by strong sales growth in beds and stretchers, sage products, transport capital and defibrillators. The order pipeline for LIFEPAK 35 is robust and continues to drive excitement in the market. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 1.5% which reflects solid performance in our core hemorrhagic products offset by recovering performance in our flow diverting stent products due to supply chain issues earlier in the year and competitive pressures in our ischemic business. And finally, Neurocranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 16.1% led by strong growth in our bone mill, high speed drills, bipolar forceps and cranial maxillofacial products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 11.2% led by double-digit organic growth in our endoscopy and medical businesses. Geographically this included strong performances in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and most of our emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 10.8% and organic sales growth of 9.7% which included organic growth of 8.6% in the U.S. and 12.3% internationally. Our U.S. knee business grew 8.4% organically reflecting our market leading position in robotic assisted knee procedures and the continued strength of our installed Mako base as well as continued momentum in new Mako installations. Our U.S. Hip business grew 10.9% organically driven by the continued success of our insignia, hip stem and momentum from our Mako robotic hip platform. Our U.S. trauma and extremities business grew 11.8% organically with double-digit sales growth across our core trauma, upper extremities and biologics businesses. Our U.S. spine business grew 2.4% organically, led by performance in our interventional spine business. Our U.S. other Ortho business had a slight decline organically of 0.6% driven by seasonal Mako deal mix and a decline in bone cement. Internationally, orthopedics and spine grew 12.3% organically, including strong performances in South Korea, Japan, Canada, Europe and most of our emerging markets. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.5% was 20 basis points unfavorable from third quarter of 2023. This variance resulted primarily from mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.6% of sales, which was 20 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2023. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.2% of sales, which was 130 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to natural expense leverage combined with spending discipline somewhat offset by investments to support growth. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24.7% of sales, which was 130 basis points favorable to third quarter of 2023. Net adjusted other income and expense of $42 million for the quarter was $19 million lower than 2023, driven by favorable interest income on our invested cash balances. We expect our full year net adjusted income and expense to be in the range of $230 million to $240 million. The third quarter of 2024 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.8%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be at the high end of our previously communicated range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with approximately $4.7 billion of cash marketable securities and short term investments. Total debt was approximately $15.5 billion. This debt includes approximately $3 billion from our bond offerings in September 2024, a portion of which will be used to pay down upcoming debt maturities in the fourth quarter. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations is $2.3 billion, an increase of $120 million from 2023 driven mainly by higher earnings and improvements in inventory and accounts payable, partially offset by higher accounts receivable from sales timing and other expense timing. Based on our year-to-date performance, sustained demand for our capital products, and healthy procedural volumes, we now expect full year 2024 organic sales growth to be in the range of 9.5% to 10%. This includes a favorable pricing impact of 0.5% to 1%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate full year sales will be slightly unfavorably impacted and adjusted EPS will be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10, both of which are reflected in our guidance. With a strong first nine months of the year, strong Q4 sales and operating margin momentum, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $12 to $12.10. And now I will open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robby Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRobert Marcus: Oh, great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great third quarter here. Kevin, I wanted to ask Medical really stands out. 60% is now of sales is now in that MedSurg, Neurotech and Medical grew closer to 20% this quarter. You called out the LIFEPAK had really good orders but also beds and stretchers as well. There's a lot in that medical line item so just wanted to see what's going on there, how much is one time versus sustainable? And then I have a follow up. Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks Robby. We love our medical business. If you look over the past five years, it's probably been our highest growing division pretty consistently. Now from quarter-to-quarter it does move around a little bit given the capital equipment nature of the business, but it's not unusual for us to post an 18% growth. If you just look back over the past, let's say 8 quarters to 12 quarters. Why? Because we have tremendous innovation and momentum behind ProCuity, Wireless Stretchers, LIFEPAK 35. The Sage business is just on fire and has been performing extremely well. You have Vocera in the mix and more recently we've acquired care.ai, ofcourse nothing really showing for that this quarter, but all of this is just feeding an engine of momentum. Great leadership team, great talent and culture and so I don't see medical slowing down anytime soon. Will we have 18s every quarter? Probably not, but you can expect double digit growth through the medical division for a long time to come.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Maybe just to follow up, fourth quarter implied guide with the updated guidance is still a really good number, but it looks to be just a bit below trend at least on sales versus year-to-date. Is there, is there any impact that we're seeing from the hurricanes or any other disruptions we should be thinking about in fourth quarter? Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, no, we don't, we're not really counting on any disruption from the hurricanes. Sure there was a little bit here or there, but we expect those procedures to be made up in the quarter. So no effect whatsoever to do with weather. I think it's a reasonable guide. We moved it up, but clearly we are hoping and aiming to finish at the high end of that guide, closer to the 10% which you've seen us do in the past couple of years. So that's where we're aiming. But we have big comps. Right. Last year's fourth quarter was 11.5%. So we're running against big numbers. But, but certainly we don't, we don't have anything negative in terms of the vibes that we're feeling on the business. The momentum is good, just running against big numbers and, and we've moved it up what we feel is a reasonable amount and we're going to shoot for the high end. So it's certainly possible that we'll have a 10% organic growth quarter in Q4\nRobert Marcus: Understood. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Okay, our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. And I'll echo Robbie's congratulations on a really nice quarter here. So, Kevin, I wanted to ask a little bit of about 2025. You're guiding to 9.5% to 10% this year. How sustainable is the momentum in the top line growth we're seeing? And what are the drivers of the 100 basis points of margin expansion that you called out on the call? And Glenn, given the recent refinement, I think should we be thinking about below the line for interest expense differently next year? And I have one follow-up. Thanks.\nJason Beach: Hey, Larry, it's Jason. I'll jump in here and handle the 2025 piece and then maybe Glenn can speak to the 100 basis points of OP margin expansion as we land this year. As we think about next year, we'll talk more obviously about that in January. The one thing I would say, we're certainly happy with the momentum in the business. We stand very committed to the 100 basis points of op margin expansion again next year. But beyond that we'll certainly get into in January.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. And then just as it relates to op margin.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Go ahead. Sorry. No, no, no. My apologies. Please go ahead.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. Yes, I just wanted to give you some comments and color around the sort of 100 basis point op margin expansion that we're fully expecting to deliver on this year and the 100 basis point op margin expansion that will carry over into next year as well. First of all, if you look at our results for Q3, we had great momentum and we feel like that momentum definitely will carry forward into Q4. Just as a reminder, during the year, and honestly, even last year, we started several initiatives to drive this improved leverage. These included, looking at low cost manufacturing sites, looking at vendors to offset a lot of the inflationary increases that came across post pandemic. Moving down to operating expenses, our shared services footprint continues to expand. We continue to push more transactional work into those shared services. We are also seeing good results from sort of IT system rationalization and that means we're putting more and more of our businesses on similar systems and it's just a lot inexpensive to operate that way. And then of course, coming off of sort of this hybrid work environment, we also are focusing on office space rationalization. So I have all of that that is ongoing and in process and starting to really deliver. I also am seeing strong price performance like you just heard. And there's an ongoing focus there. And then lastly, Q4 is our biggest sales quarter of the year. And the amount of natural leverage that will drive because sales are going to go up and our fixed costs are not growing, we'll create a lot of natural leverage that will benefit from. And then the last point I would make, and we talk about this internally in Stryker all the time, the target that we're reaching for is not something we haven't seen before. We've been there. We know what that kind of leverage looks like. So nobody at Stryker doesn't know how that feels or how do you deliver on that. And so there's a lot of confidence and you heard it from Kevin that we'll deliver the 100 basis points this year and we'll deliver it next year.\nLawrence Biegelsen: That's super helpful. Just for my follow up, the hip growth was really strong in Q3, especially outside of the U.S. what drove that and how should we think about the sustainability? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks, Larry. We're super excited with the hip performance. It's not just a one quarter thing. Of course. This quarter did pop a little bit more, but the Insignia launch is now starting to spread around the world. We were kind of constrained on supply and had to delay some of the international markets. They are now starting to receive that product and driving that. In addition, we have Mako Hip really starting to take off. We've got a bit of additional reimbursement in Japan. And then if you look down organically, obviously the growth was double digits. It looks even bigger because of the SERF acquisition. So there is an inorganic component to the hip business in Europe. That acquisition is off to a great start ahead of the deal model. So we're really excited about that European acquisition, primarily in France, but also in other European markets. But overall, we're delighted with the progress of our hip business, not just internationally, but also in the U.S. I think we posted a very strong number in the U.S. as well. So our hip business has tremendous momentum.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Hi, can you hear me okay?\nKevin Lobo: Yes, we can. Yes.\nJoanne Wuensch: Excellent. Very nice quarter. One of the things that I think that investors struggle with is when they see this kind of growth in ortho, an impression that this is not sustainable and either at some level of pent up demand and volume or pricing that is moved positively, that may not remain positively. Can you please address that? Tell me why it's right or wrong? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Thanks. Joanne, I don't know how many quarters it takes for you to start to believe that it's going to be a good market. This has been going on for some time now, I think obviously potentially long memories. But we've called the market up more than a year ago. We said that we expected this to be an elevated market just based on looking at surgery schedules and the level of activity and the aging demographics and the great outcomes from these procedures. So I said this, I think one or two quarters ago that this feels like we're kind of in a bit of a new normal. And of course no one has a crystal ball. We can't predict exactly how the market will evolve. But all signs and signals are pointing to this being kind of like a new normal, at least for the market growth being no longer low single kind of a mid-single digit growth. And of course we're achieving a higher growth rate just based on our innovation and our sales execution. So to me, I'm not surprised to see these kind of numbers. We're excited about these numbers and maybe I'll ask Glenn to comment a little bit about pricing.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. And Joanne, I think, one of the things that you've seen us deliver on quarter-over-quarter and I think even with orthopedics is just we have a very big focus on these contracts as they're coming up and the negotiations related to those contracts. And we're seeing the results. We're seeing that, okay we're not always getting into positive territory on orthopedics, but we are seeing less negative than we had seen before. And so I don't see that focus going away anytime soon.\nJoanne Wuensch: Well, as my follow up, can you comment on early feedback for Mako Spine? And thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks Joanne. It's very early, so so far so good. That's all I can say. We just started the cases literally just, in the last week or so. So it is a little bit early to give you more color. Certainly on the next call we'll be able to provide a lot more feedback. But so far in the early stages, it is performing kind of as we expected. We're also excited about Copilot, which is part of that same ecosystem. We've had actually a bit more experience with Copilot, so that launched a little bit ahead of Mako Spine. So what's exciting for me is that, robotics launches typically tend to be delayed. Right. If you just look at the industry at large, it's not always easy to launch a robotic application on time. And, and these two came right on time, right on schedule. And so far we're getting very good feedback. But it's early and it's not going to have a big impact on our sales for a little while because we do want to make sure everything is going as it should. We get the training right, not just for the surgeon, but also for their staff. As we've learned with previous launches, it pays to go a little bit slow at the beginning to make sure you get everything nailed before you really start to scale. But all signs and signals are pointing to this, to these two products being really successful for our spine business.\nJoanne Wuensch: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you. And congrats on the quarter. Kevin, we have the chance to see the Vocera acquisition, really be integrated into your beds, your stretchers, even some extent, the LIFEPAK 35 products. And I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about kind of where Stryker's headed from a software versus hardware standpoint. How to think about maybe some of this recurring revenue that you expect to get as you create this ecosystem with Vocera and now maybe carry to some extent and other products and kind of where you're driving the business to versus what we've historically thought of as more traditional Medtech, if you will. I'm just curious your thoughts on that focus.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks. Listen, we focus on solving customer problems. That's fundamentally how we think about it. We know our customers, customers very intimately. And we have been evolving as a company. We moved into 3D printing, we moved into robotics, we've moved into digital. We're now moving into workflow and software as a service. So this is not something that's sort of new. It's been a gradual progression over a number of years. But I do see us getting more and more involved in connected services for our customers. And these are all high growth spaces with very good margin profiles. And I think Care.ai is incredibly exciting getting into virtual nursing, which solves a lot of the problems that hospital customers are having around staffing and being able to integrate that with Vocera. So we're not done. I would say we're going to continue to expand both organically with follow on software upgrades because these things you have to have continual upgrade cycles. But also looking at other acquisitions to continue to bolt on to the Vocera and Care.ai solution. We're looking at expanding Vocera into areas like the emergency department of hospitals. So there's a lot more footprint that we can actually extend these technologies into. So to me it's an incredibly exciting platform opportunity for us in the future, these wireless and digital solutions. But just think about it as us continuing to, to look for ways to get into high growth spaces that solve customer problems. And we'll just continue to extend it and expand it. But it's not a shift. We're still very focused on hips and knees and neuro and our other businesses are also, as you see from our results today, are also high growth. And we do that with sometimes traditional methods of producing our products and sometimes getting into new technologies like 3D printing. So do expect more of the same. And this diversification towards MedSurg, it's been going on for a decade and they do have a lot more opportunities for new innovations than you would see in the traditional implant business. So I would expect this diversification story to probably continue going forward.\nRyan Zimmerman: Fair enough. And Jason, you made the comment, that you expect procedures to be healthy through year end. You've historically made those comments in kind of a three to six month window. And I know this is trivial and it's kind of a follow up to Joanne's question, but any reason why, early thoughts on in, early 25, we wouldn't result in any type of, similar procedure environment? I mean it seems like it would suggest, even into first quarter 2025 that there wouldn't be some type of slowdown. And again, I know, it's a more near term question.\nJason Beach: Yes, no, Ryan, I think what I would say is we don't have any indication that would suggest there's any level of slowdown. And I tell you as a reminder, Kevin made this point as well. If you go back to as far back as our investor day, right. We said we kind of see these markets as mid-single digit growing markets. I think that's how you're going to see kind of this year play out and we're going to perform 200 to 300 basis points above. I don't have any reason to believe as we, as we turn the page and go to January that there'll be some material slowdown. So we, we feel good about how we think we'll end the year and then start off 2025.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Another question I wanted to ask one on LIFEPAK. Any sense for if you could comment on the order backlog compared to kind of typical product backlogs, some of the early feedback. Do you think this is enough for Medical to grow and accelerate the growth rate of Medical next year? And then just wanted to make sure on the installed base, the 100,000 plus, is that a installed base of the market or is that an installed base for Stryker? There's some confusing comments out there. So I wanted to clarify that here.\nJason Beach: Hey Travis, it's Jason. First off on the, on the backlog. I'm not going to try to quantify it for LP 35 specifically, but I'll say it's healthy. Right. And there is a ton of excitement in the marketplace here and we certainly think it'll be one of the pieces. As Kevin talks about Medical being a double digit grower. LP 35 is certainly going to play into that. In terms of install base, yes the 100,000 that you reference, that's a good worldwide number for us as we think about that Stryker specifically.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So that just to be clear, that's. That's our installed base. That's right. That's the life back installed base which I think was the root of your question. And given the replacement cycle, you should think of this as a multi-year tailwind for Medical. It's just, it's not a one year, two years. This is going to be three, four, five year tailwind just given the lengthy life cycle of these problems.\nTravis Steed: Great. And I had a follow up, kind of a two part one for you, Kevin, just how you're thinking about the overall M&A environment and sizable deals later this year, early next year. And Jason, the 300 million you called out on M&A contribution, is that all in organic revenue? Is there any of that flow into organic and curious how fast that piece of revenue is growing.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. So thanks. First of all on the question on the organic or inorganic, obviously these deals happened over the course of this year, the seven deals. Right. So we're going to give our guidance for organic sales growth in January and you should assume that roughly half of the sales that were, that we talked about, roughly half of the 300 million, will end up being inorganic next year. The other roughly half will appear in our organic guide for the year. But we wanted to give you a sort of a sense for all of these. They're small tuck-ins for the most part, but actually very exciting for each one of those individual businesses. So that was the first part. M&A environment continues to be great. So we have a very healthy pipeline of deals. We've been active with a large number of deals. We're going to continue to stay active on the M&A front. We do have still significant financial capacity having only spent 1.6 billion and continue to generate strong cash. So that will be the number one use of, of our cash going forward, just as it has been in the past. And we look forward to staying active on the M&A front.\nTravis Steed: Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O’Brien with Piper Sandler Companies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O’Brien: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe, maybe. I don't know if this is for you, Kevin or Glenn, but just help reconcile the commentary on. I think you said record new Mako installations, but then, but then the other line was essentially flat this quarter. So, and I think you said there was some international pressure that you saw this quarter. So that would imply, I think you're saying that the domestic Mako number was, I want to say bananas, but very, very strong. Is that the case? Are you starting to see a lot of interest build in the multi-platform capability of Mako or is there something else, just going on where you're seeing such strong domestic demand for Mako?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, just to, just to clarify, in that other line the two biggest components are revenue from Mako installations and then bone cement. The revenue from Mako installations comes from outright cash sales, finance deals through capital and rentals. And as the year progresses, what we typically see in the back half of the year is that more of our customers choose rental agreements which ultimately, usually end up in purchase agreements a year later. And so even though we have a large number of installations, we're only booking rental income on a monthly basis. And so that's what you feel revenue wise in that line. Then the other thing is that I mentioned is that bone cement, continues to decline, and that really is primarily just a factor of growth we're seeing in our cementless business. And so those are the two pieces that make that up.\nMatthew O’Brien: Okay. So I guess just specifically then, I mean, did the domestic Mako number surprised to the upside in the quarter in terms of the installation.\nKevin Lobo: It didn't surprise to the upside, it continued to be strong. So we've had continued strength in installations, both in the U.S. as well as international. Sometimes the revenue number, it looks volatile because of deal mix primarily. Where you have a lot of cash sales versus a lot of finance deals, but steady, I would call it, steady good growth in installations, both internationally and in the U.S.\nMatthew O’Brien: Okay. And then, you know, as I look at the ortho business and I know Medical's got a ton of growth in front of it. But the ortho business and your three biggest buckets continues to be well above market averages in terms of growth. And I think trauma extremity actually accelerated here in Q3. So just the confidence that you can continue to take this much market share. I don't know if you benefited from your competitor issues in large joints here in Q3 or not, but just the confidence and the ability to unnecessarily [ph] put up this level of growth, but to grow so much faster than the market in 2025 and even in 2026. Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: I'll start with Trauma Extremities because if you look, they had a very big comp from last year, it still posted a very significant number. And we're very confident in the Future of Trauma to extremities, Shoulder, as you know, has been a very strong grower double digits pretty consistently. Last week, I had a chance to go to the Orthopedic Trauma Association, which is our core trauma business unit, the biggest of the three business units within Trauma Extremities. And I would say I got to see the full force of our trauma team at that meeting with the Pangea launch with the VOLAR Plating launch for distal radius fractures, they are absolutely on fire. And I see core trauma continuing to be a very strong grower. Pangea is just getting started, and they're already posting tremendous growth, fantastic management team, very engaged. I'll tell you, it was a very exhilarating conference to see that last week and that momentum will continue. And then Foot and Ankle and Biologics. Biologics was very strong double-digit growth. Foot and ankle used to be kind of a high single-digit grower, a little bit lower than that this year. So in spite of that, you're still seeing these very, very big growth rates. And we're actually bullish that the angle will start to pick up a little bit and that will contribute to future growth. So I would say Trauma Extremities is a big business and a double-digit kind of overall grower at least for the foreseeable future. And then getting back to hips and knees, we just continue to grow the makeup sort of percent of procedures done in knees, percent of procedures done in hips. Cementless continues to grow quarter after quarter after quarter. Insignia was obviously a massively important launch for our hip business. We launched the Hinge product for revisions for knees that is going extremely well. So tremendous product momentum across the board from quarter-to-quarter, how much market share will we take hard to predict exactly. But we've said for quite some time now, we're going to grow above the market. What level above the market, let's see how that plays out. But we're in a very good position with our portfolio, with our talent, with our culture across all of these orthopedic businesses.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice sprint here. Kevin, maybe my first one on Mako here. I think in the past you mentioned about a certain percentage of hips being performed robotically in the U.S. I think that number was maybe 25%, 30%. Where are we on Mako utilization? Any qualitative numbers and is it up mid singles up double digits? How should we think about utilization? What percentage of hips are being done robotically right now?\nJason Beach: Hey Vijay, it’s Jason. I'll dial that number in for you a bit more precisely in January. But what I would tell you is, those numbers continue to progress in a positive direction quarter-after-quarter. And with the offense that we're playing, we certainly think that will continue that pace in the fourth quarter and beyond.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. We moved -- Vijay, we moved to a once a year disclosure of that given that our competitors don't disclose their percentage that are done on their robotic platforms.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And Kevin, one on the macro environment here. I know you've said procedure environment remains healthy. I think in the past, you've spoken about wait times as sort of being a leading indicator. When you look at the wait times, where are we right now from procedure scheduling perspective? And I think on the capital side backlog, does it still remain robust did it grow sequentially? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: It's just on scheduled times. The reason we sort of say we still think the market is healthy as wait times are about -- this is again not super scientific, just given the data we have, but it's roughly double the wait times that we're pre-pended. So average wait times were kind of two months or so. Scheduled -- surgery schedules were booked out about two months now they're booked out more like four months. There are some surgeons that are booked out an entire year. And so we're just not seeing that go back. It's staying at that kind of normalized level which gives us -- it doesn't give us a full year visibility, but it gives us visibility out of at least probably four to six months because it's a good idea. You'd start to see things slowing down on the intake ahead of time. So that's why we feel pretty good about it. But again, every quarter, we get a chance to talk to you if we see something change, we'll let you know, but we're not seeing any change whatsoever, at least not now.\nVijay Kumar: That’s helpful. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Miksic: Hey thanks so much for letting me in. A couple clarifying questions on Mako. So one, there was a last [ph] question on some color around that product line and ways of purchasing and so on. So just a quick one, I think, is the mix on leasing in the U.S. versus the mix on leasing OUS more cash purchases in one geography and other that kind of that kind of color might be helpful. And then I had just one quick follow-up.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Matt, in terms of our leasing business relative to Mako, we see more leasing and financing in the U.S. versus OUS. And I would agree that we also see more rentals in the U.S. than OUS.\nMatthew Miksic: Okay. That's super helpful. And then kind of mix question, given the strength in that business and frankly, in ortho general is, can you give us any color on the maybe the change in the percentage of new robot installations going into ASCs as a site of care versus more traditional acute care centers or centers that would be super helpful if you're willing to share any color. Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks. Just like we said before on the previous question, we're going to, once a year, kind of give you those kind of metrics rather than doing it every single quarter just for competitive reasons. But suffice to say that the percentage of Mako is going into ASCs is going up with the increase in the number of ASCs. We love our ASC offense. And typically, as we win our ASC deals, at least one of those operating groups tends to have a Mako in it. And so we'll share that more of that at the end of the year.\nMatthew Miksic: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you, hi guys. Just on Spine. You are obviously increasing your presence on the enabling technologies here. Do you see your platform there, obviously, led by Mako as sort of the driver for accelerated growth as you look ahead? Or are there other pipeline products or M&A areas that you think could help bolster growth in that segment as well?\nKevin Lobo: Well, in the short term, I would say the enabling tech is really the engine for growth, both Mako spine as well as Copilot. Of course, like every business, we have a number of products that the teams are working on. And as those products launch, they'll also be contributors. But for us, the robot was a major gap in the portfolio and Copilot is -- gives us a bit of a leap forward and spine surgeons are more than ever interested in enabling technologies. And we know what that's done to hips and knees and are hopeful that, that will really put us back on offense. We've been kind of playing defense for spine for quite some time. So I would say that's our immediate focus. The team, of course, are working on other innovative products. But this is the biggest area of opportunity for us, at least in the short term.\nSteven Lichtman: Got it. Thanks. And then, Glenn, just I think following up on Larry's question from earlier, looking at below-the-line expenses next year, any direction you can provide on sort of interest expense compared to 2024 based on what you guys have do and a refinancing?\nJason Beach: Steven, it's Jason. We'll get into more of that certainly in January. But at this point, we won't provide any more guidance relative to 2025.\nSteven Lichtman: Okay, understood. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Roman: Thank you and good afternoon. I wanted just to dive a little bit more deeply on the international side. And I appreciate, Kevin, this is something that you've been focused on for several years. As we look across the portfolio now, you're still ending up in the 25-ish percent of sales being OUS. Can you give us a sense of which businesses perhaps don't lend themselves to significant OUS expansion versus those that do. And then a number of your competitors have talked about exiting markets OUS. And does that provide an opportunity to accelerate your penetration into those geographies?\nKevin Lobo: Yes. The biggest opportunity to have isn't really taking advantage of competitors exiting. It's really taking our technologies to these markets and earning our fair share. And by far, the biggest opportunities are in the MedSurg portion of our portfolio. Neurovascular is already very well penetrated internationally. But actually, it's the reverse of the rest of Stryker, where the majority of their sales are actually outside the United States. And then we have some other business like hips that are quite strong internationally. Traumas are strong internationally. But basically, all the other divisions of our company, especially in the MedSurg, we have massive opportunities. The business that are a little less likely to be great internationally, something like a Sage those products are terrific, but they involve extra cost to prevent infections, and there are certain markets that are just not as interested in those businesses. But I would call them more of one-off types of businesses, but the vast majority of our MedSurg portfolio lends itself very well to international deployments. Not something like Vocera will take time. We have to do translation. So these things just take time. The reason -- one of the biggest reasons why we have such a high percentage of U.S. sales is because we keep buying companies that have only U.S. revenue. And then it takes us time to then take those products to international markets. But the way you should think about it is this is a multiyear 10, 15-year tailwind for our company just given our starting position if you think of something like power tools, where we had 33% market share 5, 6 years ago, we've now crossed 50%. We're far from the market share we have in the United States. And it's just not something that spikes dramatically in one year. It takes the steady drumbeat of adding sales forces and penetrating and providing training and education. And so it's a very nice to push to our revenue and being able to grow double digits organically as we have the last couple of years, we're going to continue to do that for many years to come. So that for Stryker provides tremendous upside versus other companies that are already well penetrated in international markets.\nDavid Roman: That's very helpful. And maybe on the Mako expanded application in shoulder and spine, as you think about what makes us be able to accomplish on the hip and knee side, really consolidating a lot of market share around robotics as that's become increasingly so standard-of-care. What should we expect to see something similar on the shoulder and spine side where the application of robotics ends up being a significant share driver overall? And is this the path to catalyzing your Spine business, maybe more specifically to the number one or number two position?\nKevin Lobo: Well, if I -- I'll start with Spine. So in the case of Spine, our Mako robotic solution, I wouldn't say is materially different than the other offerings. So it's a very competitive offering. It's a good offering, but we're not first, and it's not incredibly differentiated. The Copilot product is fat. So our ecosystem I'm delighted with. If you take the Q guidance and incredibly fast camera plus Copilot plus Mako spine together as a system, very exciting. A robot by itself isn't not as differentiating as it is in hips and knees. When I think about shoulder, I'm wildly excited about potential. Now we don't necessarily need it. Our shoulder business is absolutely humming and growing extremely well with great implants. We already have the Blueprint software, which is fabulous for surgical preplanning. That Blueprint will feed Mako, and we will do bone preparation, and so it will make a very hard procedure much more easy to accomplish. So I'm extremely bullish on its potential and shoulder, I would say, as much as I am in the knee business. So shoulder should be great spine. I think it will make us very competitive, and it will be good, but not as transformational as the potential is in shoulder.\nDavid Roman: Great. I appreciate you taking the questions.\nKevin Lobo: No problem.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Pasquale: Thanks. I wanted to ask about the Vertos acquisition. Pain is a therapeutic area that you had is interest in for some time. You're there now. They're now in a bigger way with Vertos. You talk about your plans for that mild procedure? And do you see that as a platform that you can build on to add other solutions in interventional pain, or do you view that as more of a one-off tuck-in?\nKevin Lobo: It's definitely not a one-off. We're really excited. We have an amazing IBS business. It's been high performing for quite some time. It's not the first deal we've done. We did the Spine Jack acquisition. We did the curved balloons that we bought from CareFusion during the BD acquisition of CareFusion. We picked up the curve balloons. We've had our own internal innovation as well. We launched OptoBlades, so we have both the pain as well as the oncology business within our IBS business, but it is a fabulous business. This is solving real problems that patients have in deep box, the ligament and then the pain subsides and then that obviously all beats the need for more serious surgery. So we're very excited. We want to fill back up. We have an amazing leadership team there in sales force that knows how to win. And I wouldn't say we're going to stop. I think we do have another internal innovation that's planned. We haven't communicated yet. We'll probably communicate that in the first quarter, which we're very excited about. And so that business will continue to be a high grower for Stryker in the future. And I wouldn't say we're done.\nChristopher Pasquale: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Roth MKM. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJason Wittes: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So clearly, one of the biggest trends in knee is the move towards cementless knees. But if you look at the data, it's almost entirely driven by Mako. At least the numbers I've seen are well above or -- 75% or so. So just looking at the competition, is there any other commercial rollout out there that's even capable of making the appropriate cuts to put in a cementless knee, or is that kind of what's driving sort of this dominance here?\nKevin Lobo: Well, let's start just sort of we wanted to take. We've been 10 years in the market with cementless. So we launched cementless prior to Mako. And we have incredible long-term data that shows that our cementless offering provides fantastic results. We have good long-term data, 5-year industry data that's 99% success rate. So this is a huge advantage for us. When a surgeon is thinking of moving to cementless, knowing they have a proven implant is big. You're right that the cut and the precision of our cut lends itself to really doing a press fit knee or cementless need. And our percentage of cementless with Mako is much higher than our percentage of cementless with standard instruments. But we do have quite a lot of surgeons doing standard knee replacement with cementless offering. And the competition is much later in providing their offering. Some of them are just launching a cementless now. It takes -- it took time. Surgeons aren't going to switch right away. They're going to want to make sure that there's no aseptic loosening. They're going to follow their patients very carefully for the first six months, 1 year. Some of the prior versions of cementless hasn't gone well. So some of them are scarred from that. So I think for the competition, it's just going to take time, just like it did for us. It took us time early on. We just have a massive head start in the timing. And now we have long-term data, which proves that this is a terrific solution. So we love our position. That was our bet. We bet on cementless and robotics and did not launch our new knee system, and we're in a good position right now because of it.\nJason Wittes: Yes, agreed. And if I think about hips, I mean same game plan. I mean, obviously, different flow different approach, but you're obviously a first mover in terms of just the implant or just the technology. Do you see sort of those things position you better in hips right now than everybody else? Or how should we think about how that's going to sort of work its way through because you obviously knees were kind of the first focus and obviously hips have -- not that they're new, but they're kind of followed knees.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, look the knee and knee is more obvious because there's a lot more dissatisfied patients in knees. And hips has a much higher satisfaction rate. So sometimes it's not as obvious the need for hips. And that's why we try to get it in front of surgeons so they can see them. The power of Mako with pelvic tilt information. We also have of course the insignia stem which is doing great. I forgot to mention that Tridenti hipcup. So we have a 3D printed hipcup which the surgeons absolutely love. That's actually our first I'd call it replacement product. Most of the 3D printing products we've done across our business including CMF as well as our hips and knees business. I've mostly been innovation around 3D printing to enable cementless as an example. But we actually have replaced our hipcup with a 3D printed hipcup which provides fantastic fixation. And with Mako you actually don't need to have fluoroscopy during the direct anterior procedure. So getting lead out of the operating room is a big deal and we're only just starting to market that. And as surgeons realize that initially they'll reduce the number of shots because it gives them comfort and security doing the direct anterior method of procedure. But we're starting to see more and more surgeons reduce the number of shots and then actually get it out of. Get radiation out of the operating room, which not only makes the surgeon happy and makes all the surgical staff very happy. And you can do that with make go over hips. So that is one of the compelling advantages that our system has that we're going to continue to start to push so that that should over time increased the uptake of Mako hips. And of course outside the United States that there's a lot more hip procedures done. It it's not nearly as weighted to knees other than India. The rest of the world has much more balance between hips and knees and they're seeing the benefit of the hip application. Japan is a good example where the hip business is doing extremely well on Mako. So yes, there's a lot more upside. It takes a little longer because it's not as obvious that you're going to get these benefits until you actually try it. And that's. We're trying to educate our customers on these benefits.\nJason Wittes: Great. Thanks for all the detail, Kevin. I’ll jump back in queue.\nKevin Lobo: No problem.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Matson: Yes, thanks. I just have another one on Mako. I guess with spine and shoulder coming you're kind of a different position as a company that you have such a huge installed base already of systems that are out there. So is it safe to assume that your existing installed base will provide an advantage in that you could potentially upgrade some of those to either do spine and/or shoulder? Or do you catch most of those or about doing those procedures to be sort of more greenfield placements?\nKevin Lobo: I think the answer is probably a bit of both. But what we most benefit from is the brand of Mako. Mako is a brand that is trusted that is known that they have success and experience buying already. And so having another application on a proven robot, I think, is a massive advantage, whether they add the application to existing robots other they purchase a stand-alone robot for their spine surgeon. In either case, they have experience with the robot. They have trust with the robot. They have trust with the brand of Mako. I think that gives us a massive advantage, absolutely.\nMichael Matson: Okay, got it. And then just the pricing looks good this year. I know you're not giving guidance for next year, but maybe you can just talk about what you're seeing there, kind of the areas where you're seeing better or worse pricing and just the -- your expectation of the sustainability.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, Mike, I think, the year's unfolded. If you think about Q1, we had positive 0.7% Q2 positive 1.1%, and now Q3, positive 1.2%. So we're seeing good results from the programs that we put in place. And keep in mind, too, the programs sort of span the outlet from working with large health care systems contractually, but even working on smaller scale individual hospitals or even ASCs drive better pricing and an understanding of why we are driving that kind of pricing. And so I do think that we've exercised this muscle across our business, both in the U.S. and international that now has just become systemic in our business. And so it is something that will get attention in every deal that we do. Moving forward, I don't expect that to change. I'm sure things could get more competitive, and we'll provide that kind of guidance when we hit January. But right now, we're very bullish on this year and where we're going to get to pricing.\nMichael Matson: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS Equities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter here. Clearly, a lot of momentum here. I was wondering if I could focus the conversation on the Orthopedics business, large joint orthopedics. And I appreciate your position, your competitive position with Mako and things like that. But I thought I'm just curious at a high level, I mean, you guys continue to it seems like you continue to gain share here. And I'm curious what is the leading driver there? I mean is it led by the robot? Is it led by the product offering and Stryker ability to provide a broad swath of product offerings to the ASC? And then follow-up, now the follow-up is on ASC specifically, and where we are in the transition of procedures, large joint orthopedic procedures to the ASC? Thanks so much.\nJason Beach: Hey Danielle, it's Jason. I would say in terms of our ability to win here, it's a combination of probably all the things that you just listed, frankly. But I would say we've been very consistent here in terms of the messaging of how we're going to win in the market, how the market is going to play out for several quarters now, right? If you look and just start with our Mako installed base, and we've had a number of quarters now of record installations. If you think about how that translates into growth in our hips and knees business, that's certainly a positive. And then when you think about from a utilization standpoint, obviously, I commented that we'll add a bit more color in January. But that continues to go up. So again, just a variety of positive factors. Glenn talked about price that certainly is a piece of what we see as well. But certainly, several factors. Your question on the ASC environment, Kevin commented on this earlier as well, where we continue to see the Mako footprint built out in the ASC environment, again, helping the hips and knees business. I can, I'll provide in January. We typically view this once a year in terms of percentage of large joints down in the ASC, but that continues to go up as well. So it's certainly a variety of factors that are attributing to our growth over time.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. The last thing I'd add is when you see sustained performance over time, that's one of the things we really value at Stryker. If you look at our -- if you go to our national sales meetings, and we have numerous awards for performance over time. To sustain something requires -- yes, you need the portfolio, but people catch up and sometimes someone jumps ahead of you. And so the portfolio by itself is not ever going to be enough to have sustained high performance. It's also the culture and the sales force, the way we hire our sales force, how engaged our sales forces are, how well they execute. I mean that has been a hallmark of Stryker and it spans the entire corporation. The way we add sales forces and split territories and split divisions and we are an incredibly sales driven organization and our teams are highly engaged and they're very high performing and sometimes not always with the leading product in some cases, but they know how to sell and that' been a strength for a long, long time at Stryker and that is still very alive today.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRichard Newitter: Hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really strong third quarter performance. So my first question. Can you guys put any quantification around the amount of dilution or earnings dilution from the roughly $300 million of deals you did in 2024 that you need to overcome? And is all of that going to be absorbed in 2024. Is there going to be any kind of impact from a dilution standpoint in 2025? And can you quantify either?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Hi, Richard, we -- the only thing we've really commented on, and I think Kevin said this, is that we will cover the dilution, and it's contemplated in the guidance that we have provided for this full year. And it's anticipated that, that dilution will be covered next year as well.\nRichard Newitter: Okay, thanks. And if you could actually -- I'll take another one in, just what divisions, the key acquisitions go into, if you could just remind us for modeling? And then my second question, a real second question, ischemic stroke, Kevin, what do you think it's going to take to turn that business around? Is that a product fix? Is that a sales organization fixed? How can you reaccelerate the momentum in that franchise? Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, thanks. Look, the assuming segment has been more demanding and challenging. We had some supply challenges on our flow avering [ph] spend portfolio. So that is being rectified. So we're feeling better about that as we end this year and go into next year. On the aspiration side, there's just a large number of competitors. We do have -- we've launched the Vecta 46, a really good catheter and aspiration cap is doing well. But we are looking at some sales force changes perhaps because in some cases, the competitors that only sell that and our sales force has to sell a broad suite of products. And so we have had a little bit of experimentation on some dedicated sales reps that are only selling a shoe mix. So we're looking at a number of different options to try to short that business. But I would say we still love the neurovascular space. It's just that the segment has become very competitive with a lot of new entrants. And we're looking at different options to be able to improve that. So we do have a good portfolio. So the portfolio isn't the biggest part of the problem. We did have a supply chain issue as getting down.\nRichard Newitter: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about sustainability of the pricing trends, which have been better over time in the 2025? And then also, if you have to think about an upside scenario for 2025. What will be the source of that? Is it better ortho growth or MedSurg outperformance? Where do you think you could surprise?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, Matt. On pricing, I think we've told you everything we can on 2024 to be honest. And in January, we'll provide full guidance on where we think pricing will come out for 2025.\nJason Beach: Yes. Matt, I would just say also, as it relates to kind of sustainability of growth, probably the same answer there that as we think about the different areas of the business, we'll certainly get into more in January as we think about areas of growth.\nMatthew Taylor: Okay, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird & Co. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon guys. I'll try to be quick here at the end. So Glenn, I know you said you've said about everything you can on price. But can I just confirm, I think this is your first quarter of positive orthopedic pricing, at least as far back as my model goes in 2012, and if memory serves, I bet it acted like 2006 or 2007 when orthopedic pricing first really started to slip across the industry? And how much of that is Stryker flexing its muscle the way you kind of qualified it earlier in your comments versus just hospitals have realized they kind of cut the bone and in an inflationary environment, if they want innovation out of all of your manufacturers, you need to start -- they need to maybe stop asking for those bigger price cuts every year and things like that. Thanks.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think, first of all, you're correct. This is the first quarter for positive orthopedic pricing growth. Keep in mind, a lot of that was driven in international markets and then especially in international markets where we saw more extreme FX and inflationary pressures, which we obviously adjust our pricing in those markets to match that. I would say in the U.S. orthopedic market, we're seeing good performance, but we're not necessarily seeing positive performance on pricing in the U.S. orthopedic's market.\nJeffrey Johnson: All right. That's helpful. And then Kevin, just last one. Just I think way back many years ago, we used to think about like medical, endo and instruments. One would be going through a new cycle double-digit, strong double-digit growth. One would be coming up against tough comps from a cycle, maybe 18, 24 months earlier, it was in the mid-single digits and then one of the other segments kind of in between. Your double digits in all those segments year-to-date. Are we -- is there just so much diversity now diversification in those three units, and they're so big that you can just kind of keep up product cycles across all three, and we don't really have to think about at least the valley part of that in any of these segments and given years down to 5% growth or something like that? Just think about conceptually the balance between medical endo and instruments. Thanks.\nKevin Lobo: Listen, I think that was extremely well said. But what you just described is exactly what the strategy has been to diversify away from purely capital businesses to get into high-growth segments to make these bigger, stronger businesses that's underneath the noise of the business. You can have some parts of the business may be slowing a little bit, but other parts accelerating. And overall, living in the double-digit growth for the overall division. So that is very well said. And frankly, that's what we've experienced, if you look at the last three years. You're not seeing the peaks and troughs you used to see in those businesses, if you go back 6, 7, 8, 9 years ago, and you should expect going forward that you're going to have much more sort of sustainable, consistent growth at those divisional levels, so well said.\nJeffrey Johnson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nCaitlin Cronin: Hi, congrats on a great quarter. And thanks for taking the question. I guess just turning back to M&A. I think you've been focused on top line growth through acquisitions, but I've also noted that the margin expansion expectations is really inclusive of the recent acquisitions. I guess just stepping back, how do you think about the margins of potential acquisitions? Is there a floor? Or is it more fluid if you're able to see how you can drive efficiencies.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes, Caitlin, I think as we look at our modeling for M&A, obviously, we're looking for fast-growing markets. We're looking for things that are accretive to Stryker. And sometimes that accretion is over a longer period of time and some of it's over a shorter period of time. I mean, ultimately, we're going to drive all these acquisitions to be accretive and accretive to the op margin line, and especially accretive with the EPS line. But the modeling and the timing of that can extend over a period of time. For product tuck-ins, those are fairly immediate for close adjacencies, those maybe take a little bit longer.\nKevin Lobo: But being a high-growth acquirer, we're not going to look at a dilution as something that scares us off, and as we said the deals, we're going to just absorb the early dilution, and we know that that's going to then become accretive to come over time.\nCaitlin Cronin: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nEric Anderson: Great. Thank you. This is Eric on for Josh. Thanks for taking the question. On Ortho, congrats on a really strong quarter and results there. One of your competitors has shared that they're going through a restructuring of their ortho business. I was just curious if you've seen any impact from that and to what extent it may have been a benefit this quarter? Thank you.\nJason Beach: Eric, it's Jason. I would say typically, we don't comment on competitor comments. And continue to rely on the offense that we're playing. So we'll certainly continue to do that as we move forward.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks.\nKevin Lobo: Thank you all for joining our call. We are excited about the business momentum that we have going forward and look forward to sharing the fourth quarter and full year results with you in January. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the third quarter 2024 Stryker Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Lobo",
            "content": "Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO, and Jason Beach, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. In the third quarter we delivered robust organic sales growth of 11.5%. Our performance included strong double-digit growth within MedSurg and Neurotechnology and nearly 10% growth in Orthopedics and Spine. This broad performance reflects healthy demand across our diverse product portfolio and our team's steadfast commercial execution. Our strong results reflect double-digit organic growth from our medical, neuro cranial endoscopy, trauma and extremities, hips and knees businesses. Our growth was well balanced between the U.S. and International with both rising double digits organically. All international regions showed strength in the quarter and we continue to see international markets as key catalysts for our long-term growth. We stayed active on the M&A front, completing several deals in the quarter. In September we acquired Care.ai, which strengthens our healthcare, IT and wirelessly connected offerings. We also acquired NICO Corporation which enables minimally invasive surgery for tumor and intracerebral hemorrhage procedures. Lastly, we acquired Vertos Medical which provides minimally invasive solution for treating chronic lower back pain caused by spinal stenosis and enhances our pain management portfolio. We remain committed to complementing our growth through acquisitions and have a strong deal pipeline and healthy financial capacity. We delivered adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.87 reflecting 16.7% growth compared to the third quarter of 2023. Finally, we are narrowing our expectations for 2024 to the high end of our previously provided guidance ranges and now anticipate full year organic sales growth of 9.5% to 10% and adjusted EPS of $12 to $12.10. Our updated guidance reflects the continued momentum from product innovation, healthy procedure volumes and terrific commercial execution across the globe. We are on track and remain committed to our goal of 200 basis points of margin expansion by the end of 2025. This includes 100 basis points of margin expansion this year while offsetting dilution from an M&A. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Yes, thanks Robby. We love our medical business. If you look over the past five years, it's probably been our highest growing division pretty consistently. Now from quarter-to-quarter it does move around a little bit given the capital equipment nature of the business, but it's not unusual for us to post an 18% growth. If you just look back over the past, let's say 8 quarters to 12 quarters. Why? Because we have tremendous innovation and momentum behind ProCuity, Wireless Stretchers, LIFEPAK 35. The Sage business is just on fire and has been performing extremely well. You have Vocera in the mix and more recently we've acquired care.ai, ofcourse nothing really showing for that this quarter, but all of this is just feeding an engine of momentum. Great leadership team, great talent and culture and so I don't see medical slowing down anytime soon. Will we have 18s every quarter? Probably not, but you can expect double digit growth through the medical division for a long time to come. Yes, no, we don't, we're not really counting on any disruption from the hurricanes. Sure there was a little bit here or there, but we expect those procedures to be made up in the quarter. So no effect whatsoever to do with weather. I think it's a reasonable guide. We moved it up, but clearly we are hoping and aiming to finish at the high end of that guide, closer to the 10% which you've seen us do in the past couple of years. So that's where we're aiming. But we have big comps. Right. Last year's fourth quarter was 11.5%. So we're running against big numbers. But, but certainly we don't, we don't have anything negative in terms of the vibes that we're feeling on the business. The momentum is good, just running against big numbers and, and we've moved it up what we feel is a reasonable amount and we're going to shoot for the high end. So it's certainly possible that we'll have a 10% organic growth quarter in Q4 Yes. And then just as it relates to op margin. Okay. Yes, I just wanted to give you some comments and color around the sort of 100 basis point op margin expansion that we're fully expecting to deliver on this year and the 100 basis point op margin expansion that will carry over into next year as well. First of all, if you look at our results for Q3, we had great momentum and we feel like that momentum definitely will carry forward into Q4. Just as a reminder, during the year, and honestly, even last year, we started several initiatives to drive this improved leverage. These included, looking at low cost manufacturing sites, looking at vendors to offset a lot of the inflationary increases that came across post pandemic. Moving down to operating expenses, our shared services footprint continues to expand. We continue to push more transactional work into those shared services. We are also seeing good results from sort of IT system rationalization and that means we're putting more and more of our businesses on similar systems and it's just a lot inexpensive to operate that way. And then of course, coming off of sort of this hybrid work environment, we also are focusing on office space rationalization. So I have all of that that is ongoing and in process and starting to really deliver. I also am seeing strong price performance like you just heard. And there's an ongoing focus there. And then lastly, Q4 is our biggest sales quarter of the year. And the amount of natural leverage that will drive because sales are going to go up and our fixed costs are not growing, we'll create a lot of natural leverage that will benefit from. And then the last point I would make, and we talk about this internally in Stryker all the time, the target that we're reaching for is not something we haven't seen before. We've been there. We know what that kind of leverage looks like. So nobody at Stryker doesn't know how that feels or how do you deliver on that. And so there's a lot of confidence and you heard it from Kevin that we'll deliver the 100 basis points this year and we'll deliver it next year. Yes, thanks, Larry. We're super excited with the hip performance. It's not just a one quarter thing. Of course. This quarter did pop a little bit more, but the Insignia launch is now starting to spread around the world. We were kind of constrained on supply and had to delay some of the international markets. They are now starting to receive that product and driving that. In addition, we have Mako Hip really starting to take off. We've got a bit of additional reimbursement in Japan. And then if you look down organically, obviously the growth was double digits. It looks even bigger because of the SERF acquisition. So there is an inorganic component to the hip business in Europe. That acquisition is off to a great start ahead of the deal model. So we're really excited about that European acquisition, primarily in France, but also in other European markets. But overall, we're delighted with the progress of our hip business, not just internationally, but also in the U.S. I think we posted a very strong number in the U.S. as well. So our hip business has tremendous momentum. Yes, we can. Yes. Thanks. Joanne, I don't know how many quarters it takes for you to start to believe that it's going to be a good market. This has been going on for some time now, I think obviously potentially long memories. But we've called the market up more than a year ago. We said that we expected this to be an elevated market just based on looking at surgery schedules and the level of activity and the aging demographics and the great outcomes from these procedures. So I said this, I think one or two quarters ago that this feels like we're kind of in a bit of a new normal. And of course no one has a crystal ball. We can't predict exactly how the market will evolve. But all signs and signals are pointing to this being kind of like a new normal, at least for the market growth being no longer low single kind of a mid-single digit growth. And of course we're achieving a higher growth rate just based on our innovation and our sales execution. So to me, I'm not surprised to see these kind of numbers. We're excited about these numbers and maybe I'll ask Glenn to comment a little bit about pricing. Yes, thanks Joanne. It's very early, so so far so good. That's all I can say. We just started the cases literally just, in the last week or so. So it is a little bit early to give you more color. Certainly on the next call we'll be able to provide a lot more feedback. But so far in the early stages, it is performing kind of as we expected. We're also excited about Copilot, which is part of that same ecosystem. We've had actually a bit more experience with Copilot, so that launched a little bit ahead of Mako Spine. So what's exciting for me is that, robotics launches typically tend to be delayed. Right. If you just look at the industry at large, it's not always easy to launch a robotic application on time. And, and these two came right on time, right on schedule. And so far we're getting very good feedback. But it's early and it's not going to have a big impact on our sales for a little while because we do want to make sure everything is going as it should. We get the training right, not just for the surgeon, but also for their staff. As we've learned with previous launches, it pays to go a little bit slow at the beginning to make sure you get everything nailed before you really start to scale. But all signs and signals are pointing to this, to these two products being really successful for our spine business. Yes, thanks. Listen, we focus on solving customer problems. That's fundamentally how we think about it. We know our customers, customers very intimately. And we have been evolving as a company. We moved into 3D printing, we moved into robotics, we've moved into digital. We're now moving into workflow and software as a service. So this is not something that's sort of new. It's been a gradual progression over a number of years. But I do see us getting more and more involved in connected services for our customers. And these are all high growth spaces with very good margin profiles. And I think Care.ai is incredibly exciting getting into virtual nursing, which solves a lot of the problems that hospital customers are having around staffing and being able to integrate that with Vocera. So we're not done. I would say we're going to continue to expand both organically with follow on software upgrades because these things you have to have continual upgrade cycles. But also looking at other acquisitions to continue to bolt on to the Vocera and Care.ai solution. We're looking at expanding Vocera into areas like the emergency department of hospitals. So there's a lot more footprint that we can actually extend these technologies into. So to me it's an incredibly exciting platform opportunity for us in the future, these wireless and digital solutions. But just think about it as us continuing to, to look for ways to get into high growth spaces that solve customer problems. And we'll just continue to extend it and expand it. But it's not a shift. We're still very focused on hips and knees and neuro and our other businesses are also, as you see from our results today, are also high growth. And we do that with sometimes traditional methods of producing our products and sometimes getting into new technologies like 3D printing. So do expect more of the same. And this diversification towards MedSurg, it's been going on for a decade and they do have a lot more opportunities for new innovations than you would see in the traditional implant business. So I would expect this diversification story to probably continue going forward. Yes. So that just to be clear, that's. That's our installed base. That's right. That's the life back installed base which I think was the root of your question. And given the replacement cycle, you should think of this as a multi-year tailwind for Medical. It's just, it's not a one year, two years. This is going to be three, four, five year tailwind just given the lengthy life cycle of these problems. Yes. So thanks. First of all on the question on the organic or inorganic, obviously these deals happened over the course of this year, the seven deals. Right. So we're going to give our guidance for organic sales growth in January and you should assume that roughly half of the sales that were, that we talked about, roughly half of the 300 million, will end up being inorganic next year. The other roughly half will appear in our organic guide for the year. But we wanted to give you a sort of a sense for all of these. They're small tuck-ins for the most part, but actually very exciting for each one of those individual businesses. So that was the first part. M&A environment continues to be great. So we have a very healthy pipeline of deals. We've been active with a large number of deals. We're going to continue to stay active on the M&A front. We do have still significant financial capacity having only spent 1.6 billion and continue to generate strong cash. So that will be the number one use of, of our cash going forward, just as it has been in the past. And we look forward to staying active on the M&A front. It didn't surprise to the upside, it continued to be strong. So we've had continued strength in installations, both in the U.S. as well as international. Sometimes the revenue number, it looks volatile because of deal mix primarily. Where you have a lot of cash sales versus a lot of finance deals, but steady, I would call it, steady good growth in installations, both internationally and in the U.S. I'll start with Trauma Extremities because if you look, they had a very big comp from last year, it still posted a very significant number. And we're very confident in the Future of Trauma to extremities, Shoulder, as you know, has been a very strong grower double digits pretty consistently. Last week, I had a chance to go to the Orthopedic Trauma Association, which is our core trauma business unit, the biggest of the three business units within Trauma Extremities. And I would say I got to see the full force of our trauma team at that meeting with the Pangea launch with the VOLAR Plating launch for distal radius fractures, they are absolutely on fire. And I see core trauma continuing to be a very strong grower. Pangea is just getting started, and they're already posting tremendous growth, fantastic management team, very engaged. I'll tell you, it was a very exhilarating conference to see that last week and that momentum will continue. And then Foot and Ankle and Biologics. Biologics was very strong double-digit growth. Foot and ankle used to be kind of a high single-digit grower, a little bit lower than that this year. So in spite of that, you're still seeing these very, very big growth rates. And we're actually bullish that the angle will start to pick up a little bit and that will contribute to future growth. So I would say Trauma Extremities is a big business and a double-digit kind of overall grower at least for the foreseeable future. And then getting back to hips and knees, we just continue to grow the makeup sort of percent of procedures done in knees, percent of procedures done in hips. Cementless continues to grow quarter after quarter after quarter. Insignia was obviously a massively important launch for our hip business. We launched the Hinge product for revisions for knees that is going extremely well. So tremendous product momentum across the board from quarter-to-quarter, how much market share will we take hard to predict exactly. But we've said for quite some time now, we're going to grow above the market. What level above the market, let's see how that plays out. But we're in a very good position with our portfolio, with our talent, with our culture across all of these orthopedic businesses. Yes. We moved -- Vijay, we moved to a once a year disclosure of that given that our competitors don't disclose their percentage that are done on their robotic platforms. It's just on scheduled times. The reason we sort of say we still think the market is healthy as wait times are about -- this is again not super scientific, just given the data we have, but it's roughly double the wait times that we're pre-pended. So average wait times were kind of two months or so. Scheduled -- surgery schedules were booked out about two months now they're booked out more like four months. There are some surgeons that are booked out an entire year. And so we're just not seeing that go back. It's staying at that kind of normalized level which gives us -- it doesn't give us a full year visibility, but it gives us visibility out of at least probably four to six months because it's a good idea. You'd start to see things slowing down on the intake ahead of time. So that's why we feel pretty good about it. But again, every quarter, we get a chance to talk to you if we see something change, we'll let you know, but we're not seeing any change whatsoever, at least not now. Yes. Thanks. Just like we said before on the previous question, we're going to, once a year, kind of give you those kind of metrics rather than doing it every single quarter just for competitive reasons. But suffice to say that the percentage of Mako is going into ASCs is going up with the increase in the number of ASCs. We love our ASC offense. And typically, as we win our ASC deals, at least one of those operating groups tends to have a Mako in it. And so we'll share that more of that at the end of the year. Well, in the short term, I would say the enabling tech is really the engine for growth, both Mako spine as well as Copilot. Of course, like every business, we have a number of products that the teams are working on. And as those products launch, they'll also be contributors. But for us, the robot was a major gap in the portfolio and Copilot is -- gives us a bit of a leap forward and spine surgeons are more than ever interested in enabling technologies. And we know what that's done to hips and knees and are hopeful that, that will really put us back on offense. We've been kind of playing defense for spine for quite some time. So I would say that's our immediate focus. The team, of course, are working on other innovative products. But this is the biggest area of opportunity for us, at least in the short term. Yes. The biggest opportunity to have isn't really taking advantage of competitors exiting. It's really taking our technologies to these markets and earning our fair share. And by far, the biggest opportunities are in the MedSurg portion of our portfolio. Neurovascular is already very well penetrated internationally. But actually, it's the reverse of the rest of Stryker, where the majority of their sales are actually outside the United States. And then we have some other business like hips that are quite strong internationally. Traumas are strong internationally. But basically, all the other divisions of our company, especially in the MedSurg, we have massive opportunities. The business that are a little less likely to be great internationally, something like a Sage those products are terrific, but they involve extra cost to prevent infections, and there are certain markets that are just not as interested in those businesses. But I would call them more of one-off types of businesses, but the vast majority of our MedSurg portfolio lends itself very well to international deployments. Not something like Vocera will take time. We have to do translation. So these things just take time. The reason -- one of the biggest reasons why we have such a high percentage of U.S. sales is because we keep buying companies that have only U.S. revenue. And then it takes us time to then take those products to international markets. But the way you should think about it is this is a multiyear 10, 15-year tailwind for our company just given our starting position if you think of something like power tools, where we had 33% market share 5, 6 years ago, we've now crossed 50%. We're far from the market share we have in the United States. And it's just not something that spikes dramatically in one year. It takes the steady drumbeat of adding sales forces and penetrating and providing training and education. And so it's a very nice to push to our revenue and being able to grow double digits organically as we have the last couple of years, we're going to continue to do that for many years to come. So that for Stryker provides tremendous upside versus other companies that are already well penetrated in international markets. Well, if I -- I'll start with Spine. So in the case of Spine, our Mako robotic solution, I wouldn't say is materially different than the other offerings. So it's a very competitive offering. It's a good offering, but we're not first, and it's not incredibly differentiated. The Copilot product is fat. So our ecosystem I'm delighted with. If you take the Q guidance and incredibly fast camera plus Copilot plus Mako spine together as a system, very exciting. A robot by itself isn't not as differentiating as it is in hips and knees. When I think about shoulder, I'm wildly excited about potential. Now we don't necessarily need it. Our shoulder business is absolutely humming and growing extremely well with great implants. We already have the Blueprint software, which is fabulous for surgical preplanning. That Blueprint will feed Mako, and we will do bone preparation, and so it will make a very hard procedure much more easy to accomplish. So I'm extremely bullish on its potential and shoulder, I would say, as much as I am in the knee business. So shoulder should be great spine. I think it will make us very competitive, and it will be good, but not as transformational as the potential is in shoulder. No problem. It's definitely not a one-off. We're really excited. We have an amazing IBS business. It's been high performing for quite some time. It's not the first deal we've done. We did the Spine Jack acquisition. We did the curved balloons that we bought from CareFusion during the BD acquisition of CareFusion. We picked up the curve balloons. We've had our own internal innovation as well. We launched OptoBlades, so we have both the pain as well as the oncology business within our IBS business, but it is a fabulous business. This is solving real problems that patients have in deep box, the ligament and then the pain subsides and then that obviously all beats the need for more serious surgery. So we're very excited. We want to fill back up. We have an amazing leadership team there in sales force that knows how to win. And I wouldn't say we're going to stop. I think we do have another internal innovation that's planned. We haven't communicated yet. We'll probably communicate that in the first quarter, which we're very excited about. And so that business will continue to be a high grower for Stryker in the future. And I wouldn't say we're done. Well, let's start just sort of we wanted to take. We've been 10 years in the market with cementless. So we launched cementless prior to Mako. And we have incredible long-term data that shows that our cementless offering provides fantastic results. We have good long-term data, 5-year industry data that's 99% success rate. So this is a huge advantage for us. When a surgeon is thinking of moving to cementless, knowing they have a proven implant is big. You're right that the cut and the precision of our cut lends itself to really doing a press fit knee or cementless need. And our percentage of cementless with Mako is much higher than our percentage of cementless with standard instruments. But we do have quite a lot of surgeons doing standard knee replacement with cementless offering. And the competition is much later in providing their offering. Some of them are just launching a cementless now. It takes -- it took time. Surgeons aren't going to switch right away. They're going to want to make sure that there's no aseptic loosening. They're going to follow their patients very carefully for the first six months, 1 year. Some of the prior versions of cementless hasn't gone well. So some of them are scarred from that. So I think for the competition, it's just going to take time, just like it did for us. It took us time early on. We just have a massive head start in the timing. And now we have long-term data, which proves that this is a terrific solution. So we love our position. That was our bet. We bet on cementless and robotics and did not launch our new knee system, and we're in a good position right now because of it. Yes, look the knee and knee is more obvious because there's a lot more dissatisfied patients in knees. And hips has a much higher satisfaction rate. So sometimes it's not as obvious the need for hips. And that's why we try to get it in front of surgeons so they can see them. The power of Mako with pelvic tilt information. We also have of course the insignia stem which is doing great. I forgot to mention that Tridenti hipcup. So we have a 3D printed hipcup which the surgeons absolutely love. That's actually our first I'd call it replacement product. Most of the 3D printing products we've done across our business including CMF as well as our hips and knees business. I've mostly been innovation around 3D printing to enable cementless as an example. But we actually have replaced our hipcup with a 3D printed hipcup which provides fantastic fixation. And with Mako you actually don't need to have fluoroscopy during the direct anterior procedure. So getting lead out of the operating room is a big deal and we're only just starting to market that. And as surgeons realize that initially they'll reduce the number of shots because it gives them comfort and security doing the direct anterior method of procedure. But we're starting to see more and more surgeons reduce the number of shots and then actually get it out of. Get radiation out of the operating room, which not only makes the surgeon happy and makes all the surgical staff very happy. And you can do that with make go over hips. So that is one of the compelling advantages that our system has that we're going to continue to start to push so that that should over time increased the uptake of Mako hips. And of course outside the United States that there's a lot more hip procedures done. It it's not nearly as weighted to knees other than India. The rest of the world has much more balance between hips and knees and they're seeing the benefit of the hip application. Japan is a good example where the hip business is doing extremely well on Mako. So yes, there's a lot more upside. It takes a little longer because it's not as obvious that you're going to get these benefits until you actually try it. And that's. We're trying to educate our customers on these benefits. No problem. I think the answer is probably a bit of both. But what we most benefit from is the brand of Mako. Mako is a brand that is trusted that is known that they have success and experience buying already. And so having another application on a proven robot, I think, is a massive advantage, whether they add the application to existing robots other they purchase a stand-alone robot for their spine surgeon. In either case, they have experience with the robot. They have trust with the robot. They have trust with the brand of Mako. I think that gives us a massive advantage, absolutely. Yes. The last thing I'd add is when you see sustained performance over time, that's one of the things we really value at Stryker. If you look at our -- if you go to our national sales meetings, and we have numerous awards for performance over time. To sustain something requires -- yes, you need the portfolio, but people catch up and sometimes someone jumps ahead of you. And so the portfolio by itself is not ever going to be enough to have sustained high performance. It's also the culture and the sales force, the way we hire our sales force, how engaged our sales forces are, how well they execute. I mean that has been a hallmark of Stryker and it spans the entire corporation. The way we add sales forces and split territories and split divisions and we are an incredibly sales driven organization and our teams are highly engaged and they're very high performing and sometimes not always with the leading product in some cases, but they know how to sell and that' been a strength for a long, long time at Stryker and that is still very alive today. Yes, thanks. Look, the assuming segment has been more demanding and challenging. We had some supply challenges on our flow avering [ph] spend portfolio. So that is being rectified. So we're feeling better about that as we end this year and go into next year. On the aspiration side, there's just a large number of competitors. We do have -- we've launched the Vecta 46, a really good catheter and aspiration cap is doing well. But we are looking at some sales force changes perhaps because in some cases, the competitors that only sell that and our sales force has to sell a broad suite of products. And so we have had a little bit of experimentation on some dedicated sales reps that are only selling a shoe mix. So we're looking at a number of different options to try to short that business. But I would say we still love the neurovascular space. It's just that the segment has become very competitive with a lot of new entrants. And we're looking at different options to be able to improve that. So we do have a good portfolio. So the portfolio isn't the biggest part of the problem. We did have a supply chain issue as getting down. Listen, I think that was extremely well said. But what you just described is exactly what the strategy has been to diversify away from purely capital businesses to get into high-growth segments to make these bigger, stronger businesses that's underneath the noise of the business. You can have some parts of the business may be slowing a little bit, but other parts accelerating. And overall, living in the double-digit growth for the overall division. So that is very well said. And frankly, that's what we've experienced, if you look at the last three years. You're not seeing the peaks and troughs you used to see in those businesses, if you go back 6, 7, 8, 9 years ago, and you should expect going forward that you're going to have much more sort of sustainable, consistent growth at those divisional levels, so well said. But being a high-growth acquirer, we're not going to look at a dilution as something that scares us off, and as we said the deals, we're going to just absorb the early dilution, and we know that that's going to then become accretive to come over time. Thank you all for joining our call. We are excited about the business momentum that we have going forward and look forward to sharing the fourth quarter and full year results with you in January. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks Jason. Today I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.5% in the quarter compared to 9.2% in the third quarter of 2023. This quarter had one more selling day than 2023. We had a 1.2% favorable impact from pricing. We continue to see a positive trend in our pricing initiatives both in the U.S. and international markets and both with our MedSurg and Neurotech and Orthopedic and Spine segment each contributing positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign Currency had a 0.1% unfavorable impact on sales. In the U.S. organic sales growth was 11.4%. International organic sales growth was 11.7% driven by positive sales momentum across our international markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.87 in the quarter was up 16.7% from 2023 driven by strong sales growth and continued margin expansion. Foreign currency exchange translation had minimal impact on our adjusted EPS for the quarter. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12.9% and organic sales growth of 12.7% which included 13.2% of U.S. organic growth and 11.2% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.9% led by strong double-digit growth in the surgical technologies business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by Waste Management, Smoke Evacuation, Tourniquet cuffs, Steri-Shield and Power tools. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.9% with strong growth across all businesses. Growth in the quarter was fueled by robust demand for our OR infrastructure and renovations and the continued success of the 1788 platform and sports medicine shoulder products. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 18.5% driven by strong performances across all of its businesses, acute care, sage and emergency care. From a product perspective the medical business was led by strong sales growth in beds and stretchers, sage products, transport capital and defibrillators. The order pipeline for LIFEPAK 35 is robust and continues to drive excitement in the market. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 1.5% which reflects solid performance in our core hemorrhagic products offset by recovering performance in our flow diverting stent products due to supply chain issues earlier in the year and competitive pressures in our ischemic business. And finally, Neurocranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 16.1% led by strong growth in our bone mill, high speed drills, bipolar forceps and cranial maxillofacial products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 11.2% led by double-digit organic growth in our endoscopy and medical businesses. Geographically this included strong performances in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and most of our emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 10.8% and organic sales growth of 9.7% which included organic growth of 8.6% in the U.S. and 12.3% internationally. Our U.S. knee business grew 8.4% organically reflecting our market leading position in robotic assisted knee procedures and the continued strength of our installed Mako base as well as continued momentum in new Mako installations. Our U.S. Hip business grew 10.9% organically driven by the continued success of our insignia, hip stem and momentum from our Mako robotic hip platform. Our U.S. trauma and extremities business grew 11.8% organically with double-digit sales growth across our core trauma, upper extremities and biologics businesses. Our U.S. spine business grew 2.4% organically, led by performance in our interventional spine business. Our U.S. other Ortho business had a slight decline organically of 0.6% driven by seasonal Mako deal mix and a decline in bone cement. Internationally, orthopedics and spine grew 12.3% organically, including strong performances in South Korea, Japan, Canada, Europe and most of our emerging markets. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.5% was 20 basis points unfavorable from third quarter of 2023. This variance resulted primarily from mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.6% of sales, which was 20 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2023. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.2% of sales, which was 130 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to natural expense leverage combined with spending discipline somewhat offset by investments to support growth. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24.7% of sales, which was 130 basis points favorable to third quarter of 2023. Net adjusted other income and expense of $42 million for the quarter was $19 million lower than 2023, driven by favorable interest income on our invested cash balances. We expect our full year net adjusted income and expense to be in the range of $230 million to $240 million. The third quarter of 2024 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.8%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be at the high end of our previously communicated range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with approximately $4.7 billion of cash marketable securities and short term investments. Total debt was approximately $15.5 billion. This debt includes approximately $3 billion from our bond offerings in September 2024, a portion of which will be used to pay down upcoming debt maturities in the fourth quarter. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations is $2.3 billion, an increase of $120 million from 2023 driven mainly by higher earnings and improvements in inventory and accounts payable, partially offset by higher accounts receivable from sales timing and other expense timing. Based on our year-to-date performance, sustained demand for our capital products, and healthy procedural volumes, we now expect full year 2024 organic sales growth to be in the range of 9.5% to 10%. This includes a favorable pricing impact of 0.5% to 1%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate full year sales will be slightly unfavorably impacted and adjusted EPS will be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10, both of which are reflected in our guidance. With a strong first nine months of the year, strong Q4 sales and operating margin momentum, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $12 to $12.10. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Yes. And Joanne, I think, one of the things that you've seen us deliver on quarter-over-quarter and I think even with orthopedics is just we have a very big focus on these contracts as they're coming up and the negotiations related to those contracts. And we're seeing the results. We're seeing that, okay we're not always getting into positive territory on orthopedics, but we are seeing less negative than we had seen before. And so I don't see that focus going away anytime soon. Yes, just to, just to clarify, in that other line the two biggest components are revenue from Mako installations and then bone cement. The revenue from Mako installations comes from outright cash sales, finance deals through capital and rentals. And as the year progresses, what we typically see in the back half of the year is that more of our customers choose rental agreements which ultimately, usually end up in purchase agreements a year later. And so even though we have a large number of installations, we're only booking rental income on a monthly basis. And so that's what you feel revenue wise in that line. Then the other thing is that I mentioned is that bone cement, continues to decline, and that really is primarily just a factor of growth we're seeing in our cementless business. And so those are the two pieces that make that up. Matt, in terms of our leasing business relative to Mako, we see more leasing and financing in the U.S. versus OUS. And I would agree that we also see more rentals in the U.S. than OUS. Yes, Mike, I think, the year's unfolded. If you think about Q1, we had positive 0.7% Q2 positive 1.1%, and now Q3, positive 1.2%. So we're seeing good results from the programs that we put in place. And keep in mind, too, the programs sort of span the outlet from working with large health care systems contractually, but even working on smaller scale individual hospitals or even ASCs drive better pricing and an understanding of why we are driving that kind of pricing. And so I do think that we've exercised this muscle across our business, both in the U.S. and international that now has just become systemic in our business. And so it is something that will get attention in every deal that we do. Moving forward, I don't expect that to change. I'm sure things could get more competitive, and we'll provide that kind of guidance when we hit January. But right now, we're very bullish on this year and where we're going to get to pricing. Yes. Hi, Richard, we -- the only thing we've really commented on, and I think Kevin said this, is that we will cover the dilution, and it's contemplated in the guidance that we have provided for this full year. And it's anticipated that, that dilution will be covered next year as well. Yes, Matt. On pricing, I think we've told you everything we can on 2024 to be honest. And in January, we'll provide full guidance on where we think pricing will come out for 2025. Yes. I think, first of all, you're correct. This is the first quarter for positive orthopedic pricing growth. Keep in mind, a lot of that was driven in international markets and then especially in international markets where we saw more extreme FX and inflationary pressures, which we obviously adjust our pricing in those markets to match that. I would say in the U.S. orthopedic market, we're seeing good performance, but we're not necessarily seeing positive performance on pricing in the U.S. orthopedic's market. Yes, Caitlin, I think as we look at our modeling for M&A, obviously, we're looking for fast-growing markets. We're looking for things that are accretive to Stryker. And sometimes that accretion is over a longer period of time and some of it's over a shorter period of time. I mean, ultimately, we're going to drive all these acquisitions to be accretive and accretive to the op margin line, and especially accretive with the EPS line. But the modeling and the timing of that can extend over a period of time. For product tuck-ins, those are fairly immediate for close adjacencies, those maybe take a little bit longer."

            "content": "Thanks Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, capital demand and recent acquisitions. Procedural volumes remained healthy in the third quarter, in line with our expectations and underscored by continued adoption of robotic assisted surgery. We continue to expect strength in procedural demand through the end of the year. Demand for our capital products was strong in the quarter with an elevated backlog across our capital businesses. Patient and customer interest in Mako was highlighted by record Q3 installations both worldwide and in the U.S. with high utilization rates across the globe. We expect the sustained momentum from installations and utilization will continue to drive growth in our hips and knees businesses. Our latest platform launches continue to experience success in the marketplace. Our Pangea Plating system is progressing well with a full launch expected in the U.S. by the second half of 2025. Our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator and monitor has a strong order book and sales have begun to ramp. Additionally, robust adoption of our 1788 visualization platform continues to contribute to the growth we are seeing in our endoscopy business. Lastly, we've begun early cases with both our Spine Guidance 5 software featuring Copilot and our Mako Spine Robot. As with prior product launches, these spine offerings will be on a limited market release for some time as we refine training protocols. Mako Shoulder is on track to launch at the end of the year. We continue to receive positive feedback from surgeons who have seen these products. From an inorganic perspective, our 2024 acquisitions reinforce our dedication to improving outcomes across the continuum-of-care and are commitment to meeting our customers' needs. Year-to-date we have closed seven acquisitions while investing approximately 1.6 billion to complete. In 2025, we expect these acquisitions will contribute approximately 300 million to sales. With that I will turn the call over to Glenn. Hey, Larry, it's Jason. I'll jump in here and handle the 2025 piece and then maybe Glenn can speak to the 100 basis points of OP margin expansion as we land this year. As we think about next year, we'll talk more obviously about that in January. The one thing I would say, we're certainly happy with the momentum in the business. We stand very committed to the 100 basis points of op margin expansion again next year. But beyond that we'll certainly get into in January. Yes, no, Ryan, I think what I would say is we don't have any indication that would suggest there's any level of slowdown. And I tell you as a reminder, Kevin made this point as well. If you go back to as far back as our investor day, right. We said we kind of see these markets as mid-single digit growing markets. I think that's how you're going to see kind of this year play out and we're going to perform 200 to 300 basis points above. I don't have any reason to believe as we, as we turn the page and go to January that there'll be some material slowdown. So we, we feel good about how we think we'll end the year and then start off 2025. Hey Travis, it's Jason. First off on the, on the backlog. I'm not going to try to quantify it for LP 35 specifically, but I'll say it's healthy. Right. And there is a ton of excitement in the marketplace here and we certainly think it'll be one of the pieces. As Kevin talks about Medical being a double digit grower. LP 35 is certainly going to play into that. In terms of install base, yes the 100,000 that you reference, that's a good worldwide number for us as we think about that Stryker specifically. Hey Vijay, it's Jason. I'll dial that number in for you a bit more precisely in January. But what I would tell you is, those numbers continue to progress in a positive direction quarter-after-quarter. And with the offense that we're playing, we certainly think that will continue that pace in the fourth quarter and beyond. Steven, it's Jason. We'll get into more of that certainly in January. But at this point, we won't provide any more guidance relative to 2025. Hey Danielle, it's Jason. I would say in terms of our ability to win here, it's a combination of probably all the things that you just listed, frankly. But I would say we've been very consistent here in terms of the messaging of how we're going to win in the market, how the market is going to play out for several quarters now, right? If you look and just start with our Mako installed base, and we've had a number of quarters now of record installations. If you think about how that translates into growth in our hips and knees business, that's certainly a positive. And then when you think about from a utilization standpoint, obviously, I commented that we'll add a bit more color in January. But that continues to go up. So again, just a variety of positive factors. Glenn talked about price that certainly is a piece of what we see as well. But certainly, several factors. Your question on the ASC environment, Kevin commented on this earlier as well, where we continue to see the Mako footprint built out in the ASC environment, again, helping the hips and knees business. I can, I'll provide in January. We typically view this once a year in terms of percentage of large joints down in the ASC, but that continues to go up as well. So it's certainly a variety of factors that are attributing to our growth over time. Yes. Matt, I would just say also, as it relates to kind of sustainability of growth, probably the same answer there that as we think about the different areas of the business, we'll certainly get into more in January as we think about areas of growth. Eric, it's Jason. I would say typically, we don't comment on competitor comments. And continue to rely on the offense that we're playing. So we'll certainly continue to do that as we move forward."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.\nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. In the second quarter, we delivered strong organic growth sales of 9% against last year's nearly 12% comparable. Our performance included high single digit growth across both MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Orthopaedics and Spine. This broad performance reflects our diverse business model, sustained demand for our products and our team's strong commercial execution. Our organic growth was well balanced between the US and international with both growing roughly 9%. Our strong results were led by double-digit organic growth in instruments, neuro cranial and Mako and high single digit growth in our medical, endoscopy, neurovascular, trauma and extremities and knee businesses. Internationally, our organic sales growth accelerated from the first quarter with strength in Europe, emerging markets, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. As we expand our global share, we continue to see international markets as a key catalyst for our long-term growth. On the M&A front, we continue to execute on our offense. In July, we completed the acquisition of Artelon, which specializes in innovative soft tissue fixation products for foot and ankle and sports medicine procedures. Also yesterday, we closed our acquisition of MOLLI Surgical. MOLLI offers wire free soft tissue localization technology that allows surgeons to precisely mark the location of lesions for removal during breast cancer surgeries. MOLLI's differentiated technology enhances our endoscopy portfolio. We remain bullish about our deal pipeline and we expect continued activity as we move into the back half of the year. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.81, reflecting 10.6% growth compared to the second quarter of 2023. This performance was primarily driven by the strength of our sales as well as continued expansion of our margins. Finally, we are raising our expectations for 2024 and now anticipate full year organic sales growth of 9% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share of. Coming off full year organic sales growth of 11.5% in 2023, our updated guidance reflects the strength of our capital backlog, innovative product portfolio, healthy procedure volumes and passionate commercial execution across the globe. I will now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Beach: Thanks Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, capital demand and select product highlights. Procedural volumes remained robust in the second quarter driven by strong fundamentals, increased adoption of robotic assisted surgery and healthy patient activities with surgeons. We continue to expect strength in procedural demand as we move into the second half of the year. Demand for our capital products also remained healthy in the quarter with continued elevated backlog across our endoscopy and medical divisions. Continued patient interest in Mako contributed to our best ever second quarter for installations worldwide and in the US with high utilization rates across the globe. Also in the quarter, we reached over 1 million robotic total knee procedures performed to date with Mako and Triathlon. We expect the growing momentum in installations and utilization will continue to drive sustained growth in our hips and knees businesses. Our recent product introductions highlight our commitment to innovation and the durability of our innovation cycle. Pangea's comprehensive plating system complements our market leading nailing portfolio and will enable sustained above market growth in our core trauma business. We expect Pangea availability to continue to ramp and reach full launch in the US by the second half of 2025. Next, our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator and monitor continues to drive significant excitement in the marketplace. This flagship product within our emergency care business unit was launched near the end of the second quarter with a strong order book, and we believe it will have a multiyear benefit to our medical division. Lastly, we announced this morning that we received FDA clearance for our Spine Guidance 5 Software featuring Copilot, which introduces smart powered instruments to our Q guidance ecosystem. This innovative technology is designed to support surgeon precision by providing auditory and sensory alerts when approaching anatomical boundaries during spinal procedures and enhanced patient safety and outcomes. Copilot is an important step on our development pipeline which also includes Mako Spine. Mako Spine with Copilot is on track to launch in Q4 and Mako's Shoulder is on track to launch at the end of the year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks Jason. Today I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 9% in the second quarter compared to 11.9% in the same quarter of 2023. Average selling days are in line with 2023. We had a 1.1% favorable impact from pricing. We continue to see positive trends in our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.9% unfavorable impact on sales. In the US, organic sales growth was 9%. International organic sales growth was 8.9%, driven by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.81 in the quarter was up 10.6% from 2023, driven by higher sales and partially offset by foreign currency exchange translation which had an unfavorable impact of $0.03. Now we'll provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 9.8% and organic sales growth of 9.7% which included 10.1% of US organic growth and 8.2% of international organic growth. Instruments had US organic sales growth of 11.9% led by strong double-digit growth in the surgical technologies business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield. Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 8% with strong growth in its core endoscopy business and its sports medicine business. This growth was led by the continued success of the 1788 platform and sports medicine shoulder and knee products. This was somewhat offset by slower communication sales due to the timing of installations which will recover in the second half of this year. Medical had US organic sales growth of 11.9%, driven by strong sales performances in its emergency care and sage businesses with growth in transport capital, defibrillators and sage products. Neurovascular had US organic sales growth of 2.3% which reflects some US supply disruption related to flow diversion products. And finally, Neuro Cranial had US organic sales growth of 10.6%, led by double-digit growth in our bone mill, bipolar forceps and cranial maxillofacial products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 8.2%, led by double-digit organic growth in our instruments, neurovascular and neuro cranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in China, Australia and Japan. Orthopaedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 8.9% and organic sales growth of 8%, which included organic growth of 7.3% in the US and 9.8% internationally. Our US knee business grew 6.6% organically, reflecting our market leading position in robotic assisted knee procedures and the continued strength of our installed Mako base. Our US hip business grew 4.3% organically, fueled by our insignia hip stem. Our US trauma and extremities business grew 9.1% organically, with strong performances across our upper extremities, biologics and core trauma businesses. Our US spine business grew 4.4% organically, led by the performance in our interventional spine business. Our US other ortho business grew 15.4% organically, particularly driven by robust continued momentum of Mako installations. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 9.8% organically, including strong performances in Canada, Europe and most emerging markets. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.2% represents approximately 30 basis points of favorability against the second quarter of 2023 and 60 basis points sequentially as compared to the first quarter of this year. This favorability primarily reflects positive pricing trends and improved material cost and manufacturing efficiencies. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.5% of sales, which was approximately 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.1% of sales, which was consistent with the second quarter of 2023. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24.6% of sales, which was approximately 30 basis points favorable to the second quarter of 2023. Net adjusted other income and expense of $54 million for the quarter was $12 million lower than 2023, driven by favorable interest income in our invested cash balances. The second quarter of 2024 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.2%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete items. For 2024, we still expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of approximately $12.2 billion. During the quarter, we repaid $600 million of debt that came due in May. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $837 million, reflecting the results of net earnings somewhat offset by working capital changes. Based on our year-to-date performance and our positive outlook related to sustained procedural volumes and a healthy demand for our capital products, we now expect full year 2024 organic sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 10%, with favorable pricing impacting of approximately 0.5%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate a moderately unfavorable impact on the full year sales and now expect EPS will be negatively impacted in the range of $0.10 to $0.15. This is reflected in our guidance. Given our sales momentum, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.90 to $12.10 per share. And now I will open the call up for questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter here. So, Kevin, it's hard to not notice the quote in the press release about you're being excited about the product and M&A pipeline. So I'd love to hear your updated thoughts on M&A in 2024. You've talked about smaller deals in the first half and potentially larger deals in the second half. Is there any change to your view, and how should we think about the impact of larger deals on the margin targets you have for '24 and '25? And I had one follow up.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Listen, we're still committed to our margin targets of 200 basis points, roughly 100 basis points this year, another 100 basis points next year. And that is inclusive of M&A. We do have a very active deal pipeline. Most of them are in the tuck-in variety and most of them are not very large. But you continue to see us be active, as you've seen in the first two quarters of the year, much more active than we were last year. And we will be very active in the second half of the year. It's always hard to predict exactly which deals will land, as you know. But we have a very strong balance sheet now, given the debt that we paid down after Wright and Vocera, and we're going to put our balance sheet to work.\nLawrence Biegelsen: That's helpful. And Glenn, in order to hit the margin goal for this year, it requires a pretty big step up in the margins in the second half. What are the drivers? Is it gross margin or OpEx? And what's your visibility? Thank you.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. Larry, really good question. I think if you looked at our performance historically, you would always see that op margin leverage in the second half of the year just really, really takes off. And so I don't think this year is really going to be different from performances in past years. I would tell you that we're seeing, like you saw here in the first half of this year, kind of a good balance, honestly between gross margin and SG&A. I think moving forward in the back half of the year, just given sort of how we spend in SG&A our variable comp models, we'll probably see more leverage come out of SG&A than gross margin in the back half of the year. And we're very bullish on, like Kevin said, still holding to our 100 basis points of op margin expansion for this year.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan. Your line is not open. Please go ahead.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two for me. I'll just ask them upfront. Kevin, you guys don't guide quarter to quarter and I saw you during the quarter -- I know you've made a bunch of public comments and the quarter came just in line versus the Street. Again, you don't guide quarterly. I understand that. But you did raise guidance for the year. So I was hoping you can reconcile inline versus the Street 2Q with the confidence to raise the guide both on the top and bottom. And then the second question, I imagine part of that is also. What you're seeing and the visibility you have into the capital equipment and procedure volume complex? Just maybe you could touch on that as well. Thanks a lot.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah, sure. Thanks Robbie. And thanks for remembering that we don't guide to quarters. We were actually very pleased with the way the quarter played out. We can see our seasonality and how things are going to flow from quarter to quarter. We had a big Q2 last year, big comp. If you look at the back half of the year, we're very bullish on capital. We have a big backlog, particularly in endoscopy and in medical. We're also seeing very strong demand. As you've seen, quarter after quarter, our Mako installations are very high. That leads to future strong demand for hips and knees. And July is off to a really strong start in joint replacement. We've also been able to achieve more price than we thought at the beginning of the year, and we expect that that price tailwind will continue into the back half of the year. And lastly, I'd say the new products, the two big products we've talked about, Pangea and LIFEPAK 35, are both receiving tremendous positive feedback and really both had very negligible impact in Q2. But you're going to see those in a big way in Q3, Q4, and into next year. So a lot of tailwinds that are going to push our growth up in Q3. Certainly in Q3 is going to be a big one and also in Q4. So we're very confident of raising the guide. Love the fact that we have 10% at the high end of our growth coming off a year of 11.5% last year and 9.7% the year before. So we are growing off big numbers and we're feeling very good about the top line.\nRobert Marcus: Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the nice quarter here. I want to kind of dovetail on Robbie's question a little bit and appreciate that there's some product drivers in the back half of the year. Kevin, there's some easier comps. Can you just comment maybe on seasonal dynamics a little bit, and expectations around the health of the orthopedic market, the ability to see kind of that sustained growth rate through the back half of the year and then potentially into 2025? And then I have one question for Glenn on pricing.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Listen, we're not changing our story on the market. So we've been saying for many quarters now that we see this, the hip and knee market as kind of a mid single digit market and our ability to outpace that market largely on the backs of Mako, as well as insignia for hips. But that's the same story we've been telling. And frankly, we're seeing that. And we're seeing that in July. As we talk to surgeons and see their surgery schedules, we see a healthy and sustained good market for hips and knees elevated from pre-pandemic and something that we see through the end of this year and potentially into next year.\nRyan Zimmerman: Very helpful. And then, just the second question for me around pricing, Glenn, I mean, it's really nice to see the tailwind that you're getting from pricing. As you think about pricing as an opportunity, I mean, do you see an upper bound on pricing where you can't go beyond that? I mean, how long can you sustainably push pricing as you think about both this year and then potentially into 2025.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. Maybe I'll limit my comments really just to 2024. So I would tell you that if you just look at our pricing teams and what they've accomplished, first of all, we've seen really great positive outcome on the MSNT side and related to the MSNT products. And I would tell you that if you think about their product cycle and how they introduce new innovations, we'll constantly gain price on those innovations. I would tell you that on the ortho side, I'm equally pleased. We're addressing this in contracts as they come up. And frankly, we're less negative. We are just less negative than we used to be on ortho, which honestly is a win. I would tell you that this carries over not just to the people at our enterprise level that are working on this, but it's down in the field with our salespeople. So the divisions have put in various programs that drive certain incentives related to positive pricing or improvements in margins. And so my money's on our salesforce in terms of keeping this going. That's what I would say. I would tell you that if you just look at our performance year-to-date in Q1, 0.7%, 1.1% in Q2, in the back half of the year, we're going to see some anniversary of products and contracts. And so there may be a little bit of moderation. But I do think that to Kevin's point, there's a lot of newer products that are going to be out there that are going to drive price that maybe isn't necessarily captured in here, but I'm bullish on it. I think we'll continue to see really good price performance this year, and I'll hold my comments till we guide 2025.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much, and very nice quarter. I'm trying to figure out where to go here because there's so much. I'm going to pause on Mako. It sounds like when I look at my notes, the fourth quarter '23 was record Mako, first quarter '24 was record Mako, second quarter the same. What is going on that each quarter you're placing record Mako robots. Thank you.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Thanks. I'll take that question. So, first of all, a big contributor is international. Joanne. We are really picking up the pace in international, particularly in countries like Japan, some of the emerging markets, India, and even Europe. So international is really where the US was four or five years ago. That is a new -- I would say a new tailwind. Obviously, we are very well penetrated in Australia, but the rest of international has lagged. That is now coming on and coming on strong. And that on top of the US organization, that's really done a terrific job continuing to promote Mako and the use of Mako. And every quarter, the percent of hips and knees on the robot is actually increasing. And the demand, as more offerings came on the market, people got a chance to look at that and they clearly are preferring our technology and we're winning in the marketplace, and people are putting in their fifth system and their 6th system and their seventh system. And so there are a lot of ours that still don't have Makos in them. And our teams are out there hunting, so we're super excited. I think the software changes we made with the 4.0 software for hip, the 2.0 software for knee with functional alignment, these have been really sort of quiet successes that have fueled growth. And then, of course, we're going to add spine and then shoulder to Mako. So it's an engine that still has a lot, a lot of juice in the tank.\nJoanne Wuensch: Just as a follow up to that, with spine and shoulder coming on, how do you anticipate rolling those out? Are there software and hardware upgrades? Just walk us through that. Thank you and have a great night.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thank you. Yes. In both cases, there are attachments. So it's the same robot that you can use, but there are attachments that would be specifically for spine as well as software. So it comes with both software and hardware, just as the knee application did when we launched the total knee back in 2017.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is not open. Please go ahead.\nKevin Lobo: Vijay? Hello, Vijay, we can't hear you.\nOperator: We'll go to the next question. We'll go to Travis Steed with BofA Global Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. First, start with. So, Stryker, typically 9% to 10% growth this year, kind of well above the historical growth rate for Stryker. So a question I get a lot is how sustainable is this level of growth? And kind of look at some of the growth drivers this year. What are these drivers going to sustainable next year? Anything getting better, getting worse over the next one to two years? Just kind of curious, your confidence of kind of sustaining this kind of above normal Stryker growth rate going forward.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Let me start by two years ago we grew 9.7% organically. Last year we grew 11.5% organically. This year we're growing 9% to 10% organically. So I think we are showing that we can sustain high growth over multiple years. If I think about next year, these two big flagship launches in trauma and in medical are really only going to take much more of an impact next year. They'll have some impact obviously in the back half, but a bigger impact next year. Our camera launch is still gaining steam. Our ProCurity launch still has years ahead of it. Our power tool launch still has plenty of opportunity. Mako is going to continue to expand as it has been actually both internationally, which is a giant opportunity, as well as in the United States. Our international growth has been high single digit, double-digit for the last few years. That's going to continue. We still have huge opportunities in international. And then as we get back to our M&A offense, recall that we tend to buy fast growing assets. Thats part of our formula. And after one year that then rolls into organic growth. So I'm bullish on the future of our ability to sustain high organic growth. If you think about this year, a lot of the organic growth is actually not M&A related. It's really product cycle, innovation cycle and all of our innovation teams as I travel around and meet our different divisions, they have tremendous innovation. Mako Spine hasn't had any impact yet, nor has Copilot, nor has Mako Shoulder. So there is plenty of room for high growth in this company. And the expectations have changed. If you go back 10 years ago, we were growing 4%, 5%, 6% organically and that has clearly changed. And there are new expectations and we continue to split business units and split salesforces and play offense. And it's a formula that's working and I don't see it slowing down anytime soon.\nTravis Steed: Super helpful. And another question I'm getting more lately is kind of your interest in soft tissue surgical robotics, if that's going to change at all or how you're thinking about that market. I know it's a market you guys have looked at closely for many years now.\nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, it's an area that we like as a space. It's complicated, and there is room for more than one big player, if you think about all the types of procedures that are done that are not done robotically. But we're going to be cautious and careful about how we choose to enter. Fortunately for us, we're not defending any business in this case. This would be all playing offense if we decide to move into that space. So we do like it. There are a lot of startups, as you know, that are in the space. We've looked at many. We haven't pulled the trigger. I'm not going to predict if we will or if we won't. We don't need to get into it. But it's an attractive space and there are still a very small fraction of general surgery procedures that are done robotically. And so there is that opportunity. We're going to continue to explore it, but we explore multiple adjacencies. That's not the only one that we like, and I can't predict which one we're going to enter first or second or third.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks a lot, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Matthew O’Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O’Brien: All right. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to start with, Glenn, as I look at the stock, it's down about 5% in the aftermarkets. And I think it's related to this margin concern that Larry surfaced in the back half. If I go back several years for Stryker, you put up this type of growth in operating margins in the back half of the year, but typically off the easy comps, you have tougher comps this time around. So can you be a little more specific in terms of where you can see some of these improvements on the margin side, especially in SG&A? And then how do you do that without potentially impacting strength areas on the top line and impacting the top line in next year or even in '26?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure. I think, first of all, a couple of things. If you look at getting margin out of gross profit or getting margin out of SG&A, I mean, a lot of the drivers are honestly in our control. You look at hiring, that's completely in our control. You look at travel and meetings completely in our control. And so a lot of these just come down to say good budgeting, let's say, in terms of how we plan it and how we know that we have the confidence that we're going to be able to drive that margin. The other thing is if we look at when we grow with these sort of lofty rates across a lot of our businesses, those are growing off of fixed cost basis where it just drives natural leverage that will drive in our business. So we won't be spending at a comparable level. And if you look at Q4 time in and time out, that honestly has been what's happening. We also have a lot of exciting things that are going on. And if you look at what we're doing in supply chain and changes that we're making there in terms of working with vendors, working down some of those inflation charges that we took over the last two years. We also look at low-cost manufacturing. We have facilities now in Poland and also in Mexico, where we're sourcing product in those. And then lastly, sort of back into operating expenses. We continue to push more and more of that day to day transactional work into these shared service centers, which are at a third of the cost of what we see in sort of our developed areas, US and Europe, primarily. So honestly, I think we have a very good pathway to deliver that 100 basis points. And we wouldn't have talked about it so loudly if we weren't confident that we did have a plan that is going to get us there.\nMatthew O’Brien: Got it. I appreciate that. And then just on the -- across the portfolio, everything's doing well, with a couple of modest exceptions. I mean, neurovascular is doing pretty well. I think there's a little hiccup in the quarter. I don't -- Kevin, I didn't really hear you talk about lower extremities. So you've got these new products, Pangea, LIFEPAK, tons of runway there. Are there things coming down the pike on the organic side in those categories that we should maybe start thinking about? I know you don't like to show your cards too early, but are there things coming down the pike there that can help those big markets? Or do you need to go inorganic to be more successful there? Thanks.\nJason Beach: Hey, Matt, this is Jason. I'll start with maybe make a quick comment on neurovascular and then I'll turn it over to Kevin for foot and ankle. But to your point on neurovascular, I'll tell you, globally, we were pleased with the business overall. I think Glenn made a comment in the prepared remarks around a little bit of a supply hiccup, I'll say, as it relates to business in the US. July is actually off to a really nice start. So we feel much better about that. I think you also know that the ischemic business, specifically in the US, continues to be quite competitive. We are making adjustments in the salesforce to address that and better serve our customers. But overall, still feel good about the market.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. And as you talk about foot and ankle, if you recall, since we did the Wright Medical acquisition, foot and ankle has been a really good grower for us. Growing kind of high single digits, low double-digits. I would tell you this year, the foot and ankle market has been softer. You saw that in the first quarter, not just with us, but with the standalone foot and ankle companies that continued in the second quarter, where we're seeing the market being softer than we have seen in the past. So the big trauma number that we put up was really driven by upper extremities, which continues to be a freight train of growth, and now core trauma, which had a fabulous second quarter. But in foot and ankle, it's not that we need any kind of inorganic products. We have great product pipeline that's organic, including Footprint, which is pre planning software for total ankle replacement. And we've launched a number of products for forefoot procedures at the end of last year and into this year. So it's really more about the market. The market's gone a bit quiet. This has happened in the past in foot and ankle. We've been in the business a long time where you've had a quarter to where the market slows down. The patients haven't gone anywhere. They'll come back. And so it is kind of a little bit more semi elective. So we're going to watch the market closely. We'll give you an update next quarter on that. But overall, the trauma and extremities business is a terrific business for our company. And we have a slight slowdown in the foot and ankle area now for two quarters. But the overall growth of the business is still terrific.\nMatthew O’Brien: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Shagun Singh with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nShagun Singh Chadha: Great. Thank you so much. So, Kevin, you have a new robotic platform in the US market with OR integration capabilities. I was just wondering, what are you seeing or hearing in the market currently? What impact do you expect it to have? And I guess, more importantly, I'm just trying to understand what efforts you have in place to better drive OR integration with your products longer term. And then I have a follow up.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Listen, if you look at our portfolio, the new entrants that we're seeing, whether it's OR integration, whether it's new robots, we're really not seeing it having much of an impact at all on our business. We have great technology that's meeting the needs of what our customers want. And if you can see the type of growth we continue to post and the guidance that we're providing and what we see for future growth, we're not really concerned about what we're seeing. We like our chances. We believe we're on the right path with our technologies. There really isn't anything out there, at least right now, that is a cause for major concern for us to maintain our strong and high growth organic profile.\nShagun Singh Chadha: Got it. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on one of the adjacencies you previously called out that is of interest to you, which is neuromodulation. And you said including sleep apnea as an adjacency. So could you just share your thoughts there? And is that something that makes sense for you to have in house, given the ENT call point? Thank you for taking the questions.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. This kind of relates back to the soft tissue question, right, which is, do we need to be in this phase? No, we don't need to be in neuromodulation. There are a lot of electrical treatments that I think are fascinating, whether it's deep brain stem, peripheral nerve stem, spinal cord stem, and obviously related to sleep apnea. So I do believe that's going to be part of the future. I do believe Stryker one day will be in the neuromodulation space. I really can't predict which, where will enter first and how we'll grow from there. But it is a space that's appealing to us. But again, we have to make sure that we can win in the market if we're going to spend money and buy a company that we can deliver strong value for our investors with those acquisitions. And so we're going to be careful and thoughtful like we always are. But that is a space that continues to be of interest. And we're -- stay tuned.\nShagun Singh Chadha: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Miksic: Hey, great. Thanks so much for taking the question. So first, congrats, obviously. And I, Kevin, love the bullish posture on sort of sustainability of growth in some of your end markets like orthopaedics. And I think the perception was maybe the first quarter, maybe the first half wasn't as strong as folks maybe came into the year thinking. And I mean, when you talk about mid single digits, is it as simple as saying, look at last year's comps and you start seeing that mid single digit number play out? Or what gives you the confidence that whether it's backlog or something else, that you're going to be able to sustain this, as you said, into sometime early next year and I have one follow up.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. It's really our insight in the market, right? Talking to surgeons, looking at their surgery schedules and seeing how far they're booked out, that is a very good indicator for us. And over the years we've built sort of our internal models that can kind of project that. Now it's hard to go out past six, seven, eight, nine months, then it gets a little murkier. But we have pretty good visibility and right now, we see the market as robust and healthy. And, of course, we love our position. And as you have seen, the demand for Mako would not be this strong if you didn't have surgeons that are really excited about doing all of these procedures. And I think I mentioned earlier, July is off to a very strong start. It's obviously only one month, but strong month of volume. And then looking at the surgery schedules that we survey and talk to surgeons and actually gather data on, we're feeling bullish about the market.\nMatthew Miksic: That's super helpful and a great point on Mako. And thinking internationally, your comments on Mako and the fact that you're starting to get traction, you're starting to -- I guess it sounds like taking share the same way in intermediate years of Mako launch in the US. If you could talk about other areas of strength internationally, because it was sort of a notable lift some of your core markets. And is there a pull through effect? Any other drivers you can see that might be sustainable there on the international side? And thanks so much for taking the question.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Great question there on international. What we're seeing, Matt, is there are two tips of the spear in international. One is Mako and the other is our cameras, the 1788. So whenever we sell cameras and towers and when we sell Mako, it does create a pull through of other Stryker business. And we're seeing that in multiple countries. And Mako took a little longer to move, but now it's really starting to take off. Because our market shares are actually a little bit lower internationally, as we get Makos placed more of that business actually is coming from competitive accounts than they were in the United States. But we have discovered that those are the two really important platforms. And as we sell more cameras and as we sell more Makos, it lifts the entire Stryker portfolio. And so were laser focused on those two businesses as the tips of the spear. But we've also really done a good job. It took us a while, as you know, to really get great leadership and better connection between our divisions and international, getting international financials into the bonus plans of our US division leaders. That's been a series of, I'll call them small steps that have really made us a much more global company. And so we've had, I think five years now in a row where international growth has been at or above the US growth. I know the first half of the year international is a little bit behind, but we expect international to accelerate in the second half of the year and will be at or above the US for the full year once again. And that should continue for another many five, 10 years just to make up for lost time as we gain the same kind of market shares that we enjoy in the US, in many other countries around the world.\nMatthew Miksic: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSteve Lichtman: Thank you. Evening, guys. Kevin, I wanted to ask you about China. Some mixed commentary during the quarter so far. You mentioned it as a positive. Can you talk about the environment overall from where you guys sit, from a macro perspective and just an operating environment perspective?\nJason Beach: Yeah. Steve, it's Jason. I'll take a swing at this and Kevin can jump in if he wants anything additional. But I would tell you, as you think about China in the quarter, good growth for us in China. I would say less impact from VBP than maybe we originally anticipated. So I think from a VBP standpoint, that environment is starting to stabilize and turning to growth for us.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. And just as a reminder, it's a pretty small portion of Stryker's overall business. Just so keep that in mind. When you see the growth rates, they can be a little bit more volatile, both positive and negative. Just given that it's small, the base is very small for us. Look, it's an important market with a large population. We're not going to move away from China. But it's been a challenge the last couple of years and I think the worst is over. And now hopefully we'll get into a more sustained positive profile like we saw last quarter.\nSteve Lichtman: Appreciate it. And then just a follow up on free cash flow. So it's trailed a bit here, first half of this year versus last. You mentioned some working capital movement. Any thoughts you could provide on sort of full year free cash flow outlook or improvements on that working capital moving parts that you talked about?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure. I think, first of all, we still have that target out there, 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion. We don't think any differently about that, given our performance year-to-date this year. I think kind of what you're seeing in the first half of this year are some working capital differences year-over-year from last year. Some of those having to do with. We picked back up M&A, so we're seeing a little bit more of integration flow through. We also are seeing inventory changes just related to higher sales. That naturally happens. Same thing with accounts receivable. And then lastly, we have timing of some transition tax payments that fell into this first half of the year that are, say, larger payments than what we normally would expect. And so that also impacted our cash flow in the first half of this year. For the back half of this year, I feel like we'll see what we normally see seasonally. A lot of pick up in our free cash flow conversion in Q3 and then, honestly on into Q4. And a lot of that has to do with just the flow of earnings is much higher in Q3, Q4. So that really impacts our cash flow performance. It also brings down inventory. And then we'll work to keep AR in line. So we'll still target between 70% and 80% free cash flow and we haven't backed away from that.\nSteve Lichtman: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Apologies for the audio issues in our end. Kevin, maybe one on LP 35, maybe talk about the launch. I think in the past it mentioned some capacity constraints. Did it contribute in 2Q, are we at full launch mode right now?\nKevin Lobo: Well, we've already started taking orders. Let me put it to you that way. And we have the ability to ramp production pretty fast. So this is not like a implant launch. Like, if you think about Pangea, you have to make sets of implants, you have to make sets of instruments. This is an assembly operation, so we'll be able to scale this pretty quickly. And so I wouldn't look at this as being capacity constraint. The only constraint is obviously getting out there, having customers see it, putting it in their budgets, ordering it, and then our ability to meet the demand will be faster out of the gates with LP 35 than we would be for any kind of an implant launch. So don't think about capacity as a major concern.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And maybe one on guidance here. The overall organic dollar revenues, it seemed in line versus Street, but guidance was raised. Just talk about. I think you mentioned about July being strong. Looks like there were some one-off items impacting in 2Q. So talk about the visibility and the confidence in the guide raise for back half.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Listen, we don't raise guidance without having pretty good confidence. And you saw we raised after Q1, we raised again after Q2. We have very good visibility into our capital, and we have a very significant backlog of capital which we know we're going to ship. So that gives us a lot of confidence, and then how you feel about the procedures. And that's the other part of it. And again, we have pretty good visibility into the procedure. So at least for six months, we've tended to be pretty good at predicting six months. Predicting beyond six months, that's a little harder. But we feel very confident that we're going to deliver this raised guidance. And don't be afraid if we scare 10% again, that'll be the third year in a row of being hovering around that number or being above that number. And so we have a lot of headwinds. I think I enumerated those earlier in the call, and those tailwinds are really going to help us.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Taylor: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to follow on. I think it was Travis's question before asking about some of the growth drivers next year. You called out Pangea and the Defib as being big incremental drivers. Could you help us think about the shape of those launches or the contributions in 2025, any guideposts that you would give us in thinking about how they could roll in and contribute the opportunity sets? And I guess how long you view those as growth drivers in '25 and beyond?\nKevin Lobo: Listen, they're both very significant contributors to future growth. I would say LP 35 will be more rapid. So you'll see a pickup in the second half of this year, a big year next year, a big year the year after. But these products last a long time, and so some people who are buying these defibs will hold them for seven, eight years. So it'll have a long sort of tailwind, but it'll be spiky in the first sort of two years, two to three years, you'll see pretty meaningful growth out of LIFEPAK 35. Pangea is a little different, so it won't be fully launched until the second half of next year. It takes multiple quarters to be able to build all of the instrument sets and the implant sets, but these implant launches will last a long, long, long time. It'll provide a more -- let's say a little bit more moderate but sustained and consistent tailwind to our core trauma business and makes us comprehensive with a fabulous nailing systems as well as plating. So we will be an absolute leader in the trauma and extremities business and super excited. But that doesn't also -- it doesn't stop at those two products, right? You still have the Mako Spine coming the Copilot coming, the Mako Shoulder coming. 1788 is still -- I mean we're still getting new indications with new fluorophores to be able to light up cancer. We have that for lung, but were going to get that for bladder and as well as ovarian cancer. That opens up new markets and new opportunities as well. So this new product cadence that were in right now, these products are multiyear. They don't just provide a small one year benefit. And many of these products haven't yet been launched internationally. So we've launched these in the US and maybe in some markets Europe because of UMDR. These products we're going to be talking about as new products a year or two from now. They haven't even been launched, right? So that's going to provide that international tailwind for many years to come. So there's a lot to be excited about in terms of the product innovation cycle and we're hitting the mark. That's another reason for the raise, right? So you launch a new product, you see the customer feedback, you realize you have a winner and Pangea is a winner and LIFEPAK 35 is a winner. And then you can lean forward and we already know with the orders that are coming in already that these are going to be winners and they're going to be multiyear winners.\nMatthew Taylor: Thanks, Kevin. Could I ask a follow up on just the margins? We talked a lot about the margin phasing this year, Glenn, and these contributions in the second half. And I guess, I was just wondering if you could make some high-level comments on how the shape of the margin progression would look in 2025. You think it's going to be similar where there's more expansion in the second half than the first half? Or would it be different because of the progress you're making this year?\nJason Beach: Hey Matt, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. As we think about 2025, obviously we'll talk more about that in January. Certainly, you can expect us to deliver on the 100 basis point of op margin expansion next year, but in terms of how that shape will look, we'll give you more information when we get to January.\nMatthew Taylor: All right. Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJoshuaJennings: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on organic revenue growth being raised quarter. We're looking for just some commentary. Kevin and team on just on inventory surgical center channel in the United States. Our understanding is that just the infrastructure, the number of ortho, ASCs or the bottleneck in terms of the pace of migration for total joints into that setting. Anything you can share just in the first half in terms of infrastructure build out, was it impacted by interest rates and any change in the outlook in this migration pace over the next couple of years for total joints? And then lastly, sorry for the three-part question, just the pricing commentary for the company. Should we hold that for the ASC business as well? Or was there more pricing pressure or less pricing pressure, or more pricing improvement or less pricing improvement in that ASC channel? Thanks for taking the question.\nKevin Lobo: Okay. I hope I get all parts of this question in my answer, but let me start by saying that the pricing that we're seeing, ASC versus hospital, there really isn't any difference. Our pricing is very consistent across the different channels where we sell. So that's the first part. The second part is, I'd say the ASC continues to be a positive trend that you're going to see and it's not going to slow down anytime soon. Even with interest rates being high, hospitals are finding a ways to get to get their ASCs built and constructed and we've seen continued, I would call it steady growth. This second quarter finished with the highest percent of knees and hips done in ambulatory surgery centers. We're not going to give the exact number. Perhaps at the end of the year we'll give you the exact percentage, but it continues to climb. Our percent of hips and knees done in the ASC every quarter continues to move up. And that happened in the first quarter. It happened again in the second quarter. And if we look at our ASC, our growth in ASCs, it is accretive to Stryker's overall growth. So we are growing at a high rate in ASCs. This trend we believe favors us given the breadth of our offering in orthopedic ASCs. And so we welcome this shift and so far so good.\nJoshuaJennings: Great. Thanks for that. And then just a follow up. I know you've kind of given in Stryker's outlook for multiple ortho categories or segments. I was hoping you could do the same for the US spine industry. And just your outlook there. Health of the market and you got Q Guidance and Copilot update of approval today. We're launching Mako's Spine. Do you think Stryker Spine is kind of maintaining share in the first half of 2024 and can gain share with these enabling technology ads? Where is Stryker Spine gaining share currently in the US market? Thanks a lot.\nJason Beach: Yeah. Josh, this is Jason. I'll take this one. I would say just as you think about specifically the second quarter, we'd say we have had a solid quarter in spine led by interventional spine. And as we think to the future, we've certainly talked about Copilot and Mako Spine and how that will help us in the spine market. And so really nothing additional to add there in terms of how we think about the future.\nJoshuaJennings: Appreciate it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter. Just a follow up question on the ASC dynamic. Kevin, just curious about how you're seeing -- if there's any difference you're seeing from a market share perspective in the ASC versus outside the ASC for your, both the robot and the hip and knee implant. And I asked this question, because I think one of the advantages of Stryker is just the breast of the product offering in the ASC. So just want to sanity check that with you.\nKevin Lobo: Yes, Danielle, what I'd say is that if there is a big renovation or new construction, we do extremely well. So I don't want to speak on behalf of all ASCs, right? If it's already an ASC, that's an orthopedic ASC, and there's entrenched surgeons that are using competitive products, that's a little harder for us to displace. But if they're doing a big renovation or if they're doing new construction, we have a fantastic offense that wins at very, very high rates. And that's been one of the engines that's caused this tremendous growth for us in the ASC and why we continue to believe that that's the area where we're going to be laser focused. That's the area where we are winning today, and that's the area we're going to continue to win in the future. So it's not necessarily all ASCs.\nDanielle Antalffy: Got it.\nKevin Lobo: Definitely that segment. And there's continued -- there's new construction going on all the time.\nDanielle Antalffy: Yeah. Got it. Understood. Thank you so much for that. And then just to follow up on that, if we fast forward, so the shift has been happening over the last few years now. I mean, where do you think this settles out? If you're talking about hips, knees and extremities and percentage of procedures being done at the ASC versus in the hospital in, say, five years. Thanks so much.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Look, I don't have a crystal ball. It's going to go higher. There's just -- this is an undeniable trend. Surgeons love it. They get a piece of the action in terms of their ownership interest. Patients love it because they don't have to worry about parking. It's close to their home. Everybody's happy. There are no sick people. So it's just good for the healthcare system. And so it's just going to continue to increase. What's the upper limit? I don't know, but I would tell you I feel differently about this than I did five years ago. I thought it would grow. It is growing at a faster rate than I thought. We are even seeing total ankles done in ASCs, obviously, shoulder replacements done in ASCs, even lumbar spine, which I didn't think. I thought cervical, sure, didn't think I'd see lumbar. So you're just going to see more and more procedures being done. Obviously, you're not going to see revisions and very high acuity scoliosis, those types of procedures. But I think it's frankly exceeded our expectations internally, and I think that's going to continue. The rate limiting factor is just being able to construct these ASCs and obviously have the financing and the capital and the ownership structure sorted out between the hospital and the surgeons. That's the rate limiting factor. But I just see this continuing to grow and I don't really see sort of where this stops. It's just going to keep growing. Five years from now, what will it be? It's in the 10% to 15% range now. It'll cross 15% next year and then it could go to 30%, 40%. It could.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Matson: Yeah, thanks. So good to hear about the momentum in the international business. I wanted to ask about what that would mean to your margins. If you see that business continue to outpace the US, how does it compare from the gross and operating margin perspective? Is this something that could be a headwind to your margins?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. Hi, Mike. As we look at international, a couple of things. Keep in mind, we don't have R&D expense in our international sort of numbers as we look at sort of performance of their margins. So you have that performance. We also -- it can vary market by market. I mean, I think in some of these more developed markets, we see good price performance and good operating margins. Sometimes in more sort of emerging markets, we will see a slight headwind relative to sort of what we're realizing from a pricing standpoint in those markets. I would tell you that. I think that as we look out over the long-term, though, we obviously are cognizant of the fact of what international sales and how that will contribute to our overall margin profile. And so we have planned for the kind of infrastructure needs and the kind of other saving needs that we need to do to make sure that we drive this consistent margin and drive a consistent 30 basis points plus margin performance once we get past this 200 basis points increase that we're looking at. So there will be some. But overall, I think that as we look at it, we're not seeing that it's going to be a headwind that we will not overcome.\nMichael Matson: Okay. Got it. And then just, I think you did do one small acquisition, the Artelon company, I believe is in the extremities area. Can you just comment on that and kind of how it fits or what it brings to the table?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Listen, this is a gap filler for us in soft tissue fixation that's used in foot and ankle procedures by sports medicine doctors, as well as foot and ankle doctors. It's an elegant, terrific product. We're really excited about it. Both of our sports business unit and foot and ankle business units, both teams are going to be selling this product based on the surgeon call point that they have. So really, really terrific product. We've been tracking the company for quite some time, and we're not going to get into details of how much. It's not a big product, but it's a really great gap filler that, again, our sports business has, as you know, been growing at very high rates for many years now, and this fits in with them. It also fits in with our foot and ankle business.\nMichael Matson: Okay. Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nCaitlin Cronin: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just jumping off of the spine question earlier. The interventional spine business had a good quarter this quarter and last quarter as well. Can you talk about what makes up that business for you and why you think you're seeing strength there? Is this more of a market tailwind that you're capitalizing on or specifically Stryker.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Listen, this IVS business of ours has been a really terrific business, if you think about what is in that business. We bought these curved balloons from the CareFusion a while back. We acquired the spine jack product. We've also developed some terrific internal products. We launched the OptaBlate Blade product. So we have the pain docs and we have the oncology. So two different call points within our IVS business, and a pretty robust portfolio. And just outstanding commercial execution has been really a terrific engine of growth for us. And it's an area we like. And we continue to believe we're going to expand in this area at some point in the future. We're certainly going to be adding salespeople, as we have been doing, because we have the product portfolio, partially organic and partially inorganic.\nCaitlin Cronin: Great. And you maintained expectations to launch Mako Shoulder later this year. What are you seeing in the market with Zimmer's early launch of its shoulder robotic application? And any updates you're seeing in the use case of shoulder robotics?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. No, no feedback yet competitively, so it's not really had any impact thus far. It's early, so there really isn't anything to share right now. We'll -- once we learn something, we'll let you know. But we like our chances. We like our chances with our Mako Shoulder.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me and I'll be quick. Just a neurovas. I thought I heard you mention a supply issue within flow diverters. I'm just wondering, when will this resolve? And maybe you can just give us a broader view on the health of the supply chain, whether it be input costs, freight costs, et cetera.\nJason Beach: Hey, Jason. It's Jason. I would say just overall, Stryker, I would say supply's in quite good shape. Do we see spotty issues like I mentioned, relative to neurovascular? Yes. We saw a little bit of a supply disruption as it relates to our medical business outside of the United States as well. But these things are resolving themselves. July for neurovascular, off to a good start. And as it relates to medical, I think you should expect robust growth in the second half as well. So nothing from a supply standpoint is a concern for us as we move forward.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. That's helpful. And just quickly, I wanted to follow up on the foot and ankle commentary. I'm just wondering why you think the market is soft and just historically, what drives the rebound out of these lulls.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Look, there's a lot of different dynamics, and one of the dynamics is OR time, it's getting prioritized for other procedures. So you have surgeons that actually are getting squeezed out of operating because the ORs are being used for, let's call them more higher value, higher revenue producing procedures. That's one part. You've got these copays that people have to pay. And sometimes they're just a little bit squeezed and that can cause a bit of a delay. So there are multiple factors at play. And like I say, we've seen this happen in the past. I don't know how long it'll last. It caught us a little bit by surprise, to be honest. But we've liked the business that we have. We like the portfolio that we have. And these patients aren't -- they're going to -- these bunions don't heal themselves, so they're going to come back to the market, and I think we're going to be well-positioned when that happens. But yes, it has been two quarters in a row. We'll let you know how Q3 goes. But again, it's not going to be a problem for our trauma and extremities business. It will continue to have very high growth regardless of what happens in this market.\nJayson Bedford: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Ranieri: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one for Kevin, but I think you also mentioned that you did another small acquisition of MOLLI. But just curious if you can kind of detail a bit more about that deal. And I'd imagine it would be fairly small, but I'm kind of curious to hear about how this kind of informs your overall breast strategy in the market, how you might be able to bundle this with 1788 and some of the other maybe prior deals you've done in the breast space. Thanks for taking the question.\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. Thanks. Women's health and urology has been an area of interest for us. And the endoscopy division is pretty excited about MOLLI to be able to localize the lesions that need to be removed in surgery. And for surgery, as you mentioned, we have NOVADAQ the Exoscope from the Invuity acquisition, we have the PhotonBlade. We can do single stage procedures because you can assess the health of the tissue and then having the localization. And we already have the rep there. They're already -- so this is a perfect, classic tuck-in for Stryker. The reps are there, they're in the procedure. And this product, even though it's not a big revenue producer, at least now. It is elegant, it is easy to use, it is a terrific product. And so we've watched all the other products in this space. This is the one we've. We've had our eye on and we are really excited to have that as part of Stryker. And it will enable us to be a bigger force in breast care.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Roman: Thanks, and good afternoon. Kevin, I wanted to follow up on a comment you just made about capacity in the hospital and the prioritization around certainly whether it's acuity cases or other dynamics influencing how hospitals are managing capacity constraints in their surgical suites. How should we think about that as a potential long-term or even intermediate term tailwind to your MedSurg business?\nKevin Lobo: Yeah. It's a good question. And certainly, the demand for capital is very high. There is construction, as you know, if hospitals are being constructed, ASCs are being constructed, patients are getting great outcomes. I think the ASC is a contributor. People -- they go home the same day, they can't believe they can get back to playing their sport of choice so quickly. Word is spreading. And so I think this is one of those reasons where you're seeing the demand increasing. And as the operating room spill up, they're looking for outlets to be able to do more and more procedures. So I do believe that that's contributing to this elevated procedures. And for our MedSurg business, a lot of our small capital that has to be replaced. And that's probably why we're experiencing the kind of high growth. You look at instruments, you look at power tools, very, very high growth and a promising outlook going forward. I hope this continues. We see it continuing at least through the end of this year and obviously, we'll let you know what we think about guidance for next year in January.\nDavid Roman: Got it. And then maybe just a follow up for Glenn and maybe Jason. Just on the P&L, I think on the last call, you had laid out a path that more of the gross margin on a go forward basis would come -- sorry -- more the operating margin expansion would come from gross margins versus OpEx. I think you're pointing to the back half of the year, reflecting more SG&A leverage. How should we think about just the interplay between different line items of the P&L with MedSurg becoming a larger percentage of total and how we think about in the context of the different drivers for operating margin expansion?\nGlenn Boehnlein: Yeah. Hi, David. I think, though, as I think back to how we have characterized it, if you think about what we did in 2023 that had more gross margin expansion and op margin. And we've always said that 2024 would lean more to sort of SG&A and leverage of op expenses. So I don't think we've really sort of changed sort of how we think about how the year is going to play out for op margin expansion. So I do think that we are bullish on opportunities in gross margin, but a lot of those are things you do this year that are going to benefit us in 2025. On SG&A, that's more near-term things that we have that we budgeted for and planned for that I think actually will allow us to give us a lot of confidence to say that we will get to that 100 basis points of op margin expansion.\nDavid Roman: Got it. Okay. Thank you for the clarification.\nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'll turn the call over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nKevin Lobo: Thank you for all your questions and for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in October. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the second quarter 2024 Stryker earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. In the second quarter, we delivered strong organic growth sales of 9% against last year's nearly 12% comparable. Our performance included high single digit growth across both MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Orthopaedics and Spine. This broad performance reflects our diverse business model, sustained demand for our products and our team's strong commercial execution. Our organic growth was well balanced between the US and international with both growing roughly 9%. Our strong results were led by double-digit organic growth in instruments, neuro cranial and Mako and high single digit growth in our medical, endoscopy, neurovascular, trauma and extremities and knee businesses. Internationally, our organic sales growth accelerated from the first quarter with strength in Europe, emerging markets, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. As we expand our global share, we continue to see international markets as a key catalyst for our long-term growth. On the M&A front, we continue to execute on our offense. In July, we completed the acquisition of Artelon, which specializes in innovative soft tissue fixation products for foot and ankle and sports medicine procedures. Also yesterday, we closed our acquisition of MOLLI Surgical. MOLLI offers wire free soft tissue localization technology that allows surgeons to precisely mark the location of lesions for removal during breast cancer surgeries. MOLLI's differentiated technology enhances our endoscopy portfolio. We remain bullish about our deal pipeline and we expect continued activity as we move into the back half of the year. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.81, reflecting 10.6% growth compared to the second quarter of 2023. This performance was primarily driven by the strength of our sales as well as continued expansion of our margins. Finally, we are raising our expectations for 2024 and now anticipate full year organic sales growth of 9% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share of. Coming off full year organic sales growth of 11.5% in 2023, our updated guidance reflects the strength of our capital backlog, innovative product portfolio, healthy procedure volumes and passionate commercial execution across the globe. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Yes. Listen, we're still committed to our margin targets of 200 basis points, roughly 100 basis points this year, another 100 basis points next year. And that is inclusive of M&A. We do have a very active deal pipeline. Most of them are in the tuck-in variety and most of them are not very large. But you continue to see us be active, as you've seen in the first two quarters of the year, much more active than we were last year. And we will be very active in the second half of the year. It's always hard to predict exactly which deals will land, as you know. But we have a very strong balance sheet now, given the debt that we paid down after Wright and Vocera, and we're going to put our balance sheet to work. Yeah, sure. Thanks Robbie. And thanks for remembering that we don't guide to quarters. We were actually very pleased with the way the quarter played out. We can see our seasonality and how things are going to flow from quarter to quarter. We had a big Q2 last year, big comp. If you look at the back half of the year, we're very bullish on capital. We have a big backlog, particularly in endoscopy and in medical. We're also seeing very strong demand. As you've seen, quarter after quarter, our Mako installations are very high. That leads to future strong demand for hips and knees. And July is off to a really strong start in joint replacement. We've also been able to achieve more price than we thought at the beginning of the year, and we expect that that price tailwind will continue into the back half of the year. And lastly, I'd say the new products, the two big products we've talked about, Pangea and LIFEPAK 35, are both receiving tremendous positive feedback and really both had very negligible impact in Q2. But you're going to see those in a big way in Q3, Q4, and into next year. So a lot of tailwinds that are going to push our growth up in Q3. Certainly in Q3 is going to be a big one and also in Q4. So we're very confident of raising the guide. Love the fact that we have 10% at the high end of our growth coming off a year of 11.5% last year and 9.7% the year before. So we are growing off big numbers and we're feeling very good about the top line. Yeah. Listen, we're not changing our story on the market. So we've been saying for many quarters now that we see this, the hip and knee market as kind of a mid single digit market and our ability to outpace that market largely on the backs of Mako, as well as insignia for hips. But that's the same story we've been telling. And frankly, we're seeing that. And we're seeing that in July. As we talk to surgeons and see their surgery schedules, we see a healthy and sustained good market for hips and knees elevated from pre-pandemic and something that we see through the end of this year and potentially into next year. Yeah. Thanks. I'll take that question. So, first of all, a big contributor is international. Joanne. We are really picking up the pace in international, particularly in countries like Japan, some of the emerging markets, India, and even Europe. So international is really where the US was four or five years ago. That is a new -- I would say a new tailwind. Obviously, we are very well penetrated in Australia, but the rest of international has lagged. That is now coming on and coming on strong. And that on top of the US organization, that's really done a terrific job continuing to promote Mako and the use of Mako. And every quarter, the percent of hips and knees on the robot is actually increasing. And the demand, as more offerings came on the market, people got a chance to look at that and they clearly are preferring our technology and we're winning in the marketplace, and people are putting in their fifth system and their 6th system and their seventh system. And so there are a lot of ours that still don't have Makos in them. And our teams are out there hunting, so we're super excited. I think the software changes we made with the 4.0 software for hip, the 2.0 software for knee with functional alignment, these have been really sort of quiet successes that have fueled growth. And then, of course, we're going to add spine and then shoulder to Mako. So it's an engine that still has a lot, a lot of juice in the tank. Yes. Thank you. Yes. In both cases, there are attachments. So it's the same robot that you can use, but there are attachments that would be specifically for spine as well as software. So it comes with both software and hardware, just as the knee application did when we launched the total knee back in 2017. Vijay? Hello, Vijay, we can't hear you. Yeah. Let me start by two years ago we grew 9.7% organically. Last year we grew 11.5% organically. This year we're growing 9% to 10% organically. So I think we are showing that we can sustain high growth over multiple years. If I think about next year, these two big flagship launches in trauma and in medical are really only going to take much more of an impact next year. They'll have some impact obviously in the back half, but a bigger impact next year. Our camera launch is still gaining steam. Our ProCurity launch still has years ahead of it. Our power tool launch still has plenty of opportunity. Mako is going to continue to expand as it has been actually both internationally, which is a giant opportunity, as well as in the United States. Our international growth has been high single digit, double-digit for the last few years. That's going to continue. We still have huge opportunities in international. And then as we get back to our M&A offense, recall that we tend to buy fast growing assets. Thats part of our formula. And after one year that then rolls into organic growth. So I'm bullish on the future of our ability to sustain high organic growth. If you think about this year, a lot of the organic growth is actually not M&A related. It's really product cycle, innovation cycle and all of our innovation teams as I travel around and meet our different divisions, they have tremendous innovation. Mako Spine hasn't had any impact yet, nor has Copilot, nor has Mako Shoulder. So there is plenty of room for high growth in this company. And the expectations have changed. If you go back 10 years ago, we were growing 4%, 5%, 6% organically and that has clearly changed. And there are new expectations and we continue to split business units and split salesforces and play offense. And it's a formula that's working and I don't see it slowing down anytime soon. Yes. Look, it's an area that we like as a space. It's complicated, and there is room for more than one big player, if you think about all the types of procedures that are done that are not done robotically. But we're going to be cautious and careful about how we choose to enter. Fortunately for us, we're not defending any business in this case. This would be all playing offense if we decide to move into that space. So we do like it. There are a lot of startups, as you know, that are in the space. We've looked at many. We haven't pulled the trigger. I'm not going to predict if we will or if we won't. We don't need to get into it. But it's an attractive space and there are still a very small fraction of general surgery procedures that are done robotically. And so there is that opportunity. We're going to continue to explore it, but we explore multiple adjacencies. That's not the only one that we like, and I can't predict which one we're going to enter first or second or third. Yeah. And as you talk about foot and ankle, if you recall, since we did the Wright Medical acquisition, foot and ankle has been a really good grower for us. Growing kind of high single digits, low double-digits. I would tell you this year, the foot and ankle market has been softer. You saw that in the first quarter, not just with us, but with the standalone foot and ankle companies that continued in the second quarter, where we're seeing the market being softer than we have seen in the past. So the big trauma number that we put up was really driven by upper extremities, which continues to be a freight train of growth, and now core trauma, which had a fabulous second quarter. But in foot and ankle, it's not that we need any kind of inorganic products. We have great product pipeline that's organic, including Footprint, which is pre planning software for total ankle replacement. And we've launched a number of products for forefoot procedures at the end of last year and into this year. So it's really more about the market. The market's gone a bit quiet. This has happened in the past in foot and ankle. We've been in the business a long time where you've had a quarter to where the market slows down. The patients haven't gone anywhere. They'll come back. And so it is kind of a little bit more semi elective. So we're going to watch the market closely. We'll give you an update next quarter on that. But overall, the trauma and extremities business is a terrific business for our company. And we have a slight slowdown in the foot and ankle area now for two quarters. But the overall growth of the business is still terrific. Yeah. Listen, if you look at our portfolio, the new entrants that we're seeing, whether it's OR integration, whether it's new robots, we're really not seeing it having much of an impact at all on our business. We have great technology that's meeting the needs of what our customers want. And if you can see the type of growth we continue to post and the guidance that we're providing and what we see for future growth, we're not really concerned about what we're seeing. We like our chances. We believe we're on the right path with our technologies. There really isn't anything out there, at least right now, that is a cause for major concern for us to maintain our strong and high growth organic profile. Yeah. This kind of relates back to the soft tissue question, right, which is, do we need to be in this phase? No, we don't need to be in neuromodulation. There are a lot of electrical treatments that I think are fascinating, whether it's deep brain stem, peripheral nerve stem, spinal cord stem, and obviously related to sleep apnea. So I do believe that's going to be part of the future. I do believe Stryker one day will be in the neuromodulation space. I really can't predict which, where will enter first and how we'll grow from there. But it is a space that's appealing to us. But again, we have to make sure that we can win in the market if we're going to spend money and buy a company that we can deliver strong value for our investors with those acquisitions. And so we're going to be careful and thoughtful like we always are. But that is a space that continues to be of interest. And we're -- stay tuned. Yeah. It's really our insight in the market, right? Talking to surgeons, looking at their surgery schedules and seeing how far they're booked out, that is a very good indicator for us. And over the years we've built sort of our internal models that can kind of project that. Now it's hard to go out past six, seven, eight, nine months, then it gets a little murkier. But we have pretty good visibility and right now, we see the market as robust and healthy. And, of course, we love our position. And as you have seen, the demand for Mako would not be this strong if you didn't have surgeons that are really excited about doing all of these procedures. And I think I mentioned earlier, July is off to a very strong start. It's obviously only one month, but strong month of volume. And then looking at the surgery schedules that we survey and talk to surgeons and actually gather data on, we're feeling bullish about the market. Yeah. Great question there on international. What we're seeing, Matt, is there are two tips of the spear in international. One is Mako and the other is our cameras, the 1788. So whenever we sell cameras and towers and when we sell Mako, it does create a pull through of other Stryker business. And we're seeing that in multiple countries. And Mako took a little longer to move, but now it's really starting to take off. Because our market shares are actually a little bit lower internationally, as we get Makos placed more of that business actually is coming from competitive accounts than they were in the United States. But we have discovered that those are the two really important platforms. And as we sell more cameras and as we sell more Makos, it lifts the entire Stryker portfolio. And so were laser focused on those two businesses as the tips of the spear. But we've also really done a good job. It took us a while, as you know, to really get great leadership and better connection between our divisions and international, getting international financials into the bonus plans of our US division leaders. That's been a series of, I'll call them small steps that have really made us a much more global company. And so we've had, I think five years now in a row where international growth has been at or above the US growth. I know the first half of the year international is a little bit behind, but we expect international to accelerate in the second half of the year and will be at or above the US for the full year once again. And that should continue for another many five, 10 years just to make up for lost time as we gain the same kind of market shares that we enjoy in the US, in many other countries around the world. Yeah. And just as a reminder, it's a pretty small portion of Stryker's overall business. Just so keep that in mind. When you see the growth rates, they can be a little bit more volatile, both positive and negative. Just given that it's small, the base is very small for us. Look, it's an important market with a large population. We're not going to move away from China. But it's been a challenge the last couple of years and I think the worst is over. And now hopefully we'll get into a more sustained positive profile like we saw last quarter. Well, we've already started taking orders. Let me put it to you that way. And we have the ability to ramp production pretty fast. So this is not like a implant launch. Like, if you think about Pangea, you have to make sets of implants, you have to make sets of instruments. This is an assembly operation, so we'll be able to scale this pretty quickly. And so I wouldn't look at this as being capacity constraint. The only constraint is obviously getting out there, having customers see it, putting it in their budgets, ordering it, and then our ability to meet the demand will be faster out of the gates with LP 35 than we would be for any kind of an implant launch. So don't think about capacity as a major concern. Yeah. Listen, we don't raise guidance without having pretty good confidence. And you saw we raised after Q1, we raised again after Q2. We have very good visibility into our capital, and we have a very significant backlog of capital which we know we're going to ship. So that gives us a lot of confidence, and then how you feel about the procedures. And that's the other part of it. And again, we have pretty good visibility into the procedure. So at least for six months, we've tended to be pretty good at predicting six months. Predicting beyond six months, that's a little harder. But we feel very confident that we're going to deliver this raised guidance. And don't be afraid if we scare 10% again, that'll be the third year in a row of being hovering around that number or being above that number. And so we have a lot of headwinds. I think I enumerated those earlier in the call, and those tailwinds are really going to help us. Listen, they're both very significant contributors to future growth. I would say LP 35 will be more rapid. So you'll see a pickup in the second half of this year, a big year next year, a big year the year after. But these products last a long time, and so some people who are buying these defibs will hold them for seven, eight years. So it'll have a long sort of tailwind, but it'll be spiky in the first sort of two years, two to three years, you'll see pretty meaningful growth out of LIFEPAK 35. Pangea is a little different, so it won't be fully launched until the second half of next year. It takes multiple quarters to be able to build all of the instrument sets and the implant sets, but these implant launches will last a long, long, long time. It'll provide a more -- let's say a little bit more moderate but sustained and consistent tailwind to our core trauma business and makes us comprehensive with a fabulous nailing systems as well as plating. So we will be an absolute leader in the trauma and extremities business and super excited. But that doesn't also -- it doesn't stop at those two products, right? You still have the Mako Spine coming the Copilot coming, the Mako Shoulder coming. 1788 is still -- I mean we're still getting new indications with new fluorophores to be able to light up cancer. We have that for lung, but were going to get that for bladder and as well as ovarian cancer. That opens up new markets and new opportunities as well. So this new product cadence that were in right now, these products are multiyear. They don't just provide a small one year benefit. And many of these products haven't yet been launched internationally. So we've launched these in the US and maybe in some markets Europe because of UMDR. These products we're going to be talking about as new products a year or two from now. They haven't even been launched, right? So that's going to provide that international tailwind for many years to come. So there's a lot to be excited about in terms of the product innovation cycle and we're hitting the mark. That's another reason for the raise, right? So you launch a new product, you see the customer feedback, you realize you have a winner and Pangea is a winner and LIFEPAK 35 is a winner. And then you can lean forward and we already know with the orders that are coming in already that these are going to be winners and they're going to be multiyear winners. Okay. I hope I get all parts of this question in my answer, but let me start by saying that the pricing that we're seeing, ASC versus hospital, there really isn't any difference. Our pricing is very consistent across the different channels where we sell. So that's the first part. The second part is, I'd say the ASC continues to be a positive trend that you're going to see and it's not going to slow down anytime soon. Even with interest rates being high, hospitals are finding a ways to get to get their ASCs built and constructed and we've seen continued, I would call it steady growth. This second quarter finished with the highest percent of knees and hips done in ambulatory surgery centers. We're not going to give the exact number. Perhaps at the end of the year we'll give you the exact percentage, but it continues to climb. Our percent of hips and knees done in the ASC every quarter continues to move up. And that happened in the first quarter. It happened again in the second quarter. And if we look at our ASC, our growth in ASCs, it is accretive to Stryker's overall growth. So we are growing at a high rate in ASCs. This trend we believe favors us given the breadth of our offering in orthopedic ASCs. And so we welcome this shift and so far so good. Yes, Danielle, what I'd say is that if there is a big renovation or new construction, we do extremely well. So I don't want to speak on behalf of all ASCs, right? If it's already an ASC, that's an orthopedic ASC, and there's entrenched surgeons that are using competitive products, that's a little harder for us to displace. But if they're doing a big renovation or if they're doing new construction, we have a fantastic offense that wins at very, very high rates. And that's been one of the engines that's caused this tremendous growth for us in the ASC and why we continue to believe that that's the area where we're going to be laser focused. That's the area where we are winning today, and that's the area we're going to continue to win in the future. So it's not necessarily all ASCs. Definitely that segment. And there's continued -- there's new construction going on all the time. Yeah. Look, I don't have a crystal ball. It's going to go higher. There's just -- this is an undeniable trend. Surgeons love it. They get a piece of the action in terms of their ownership interest. Patients love it because they don't have to worry about parking. It's close to their home. Everybody's happy. There are no sick people. So it's just good for the healthcare system. And so it's just going to continue to increase. What's the upper limit? I don't know, but I would tell you I feel differently about this than I did five years ago. I thought it would grow. It is growing at a faster rate than I thought. We are even seeing total ankles done in ASCs, obviously, shoulder replacements done in ASCs, even lumbar spine, which I didn't think. I thought cervical, sure, didn't think I'd see lumbar. So you're just going to see more and more procedures being done. Obviously, you're not going to see revisions and very high acuity scoliosis, those types of procedures. But I think it's frankly exceeded our expectations internally, and I think that's going to continue. The rate limiting factor is just being able to construct these ASCs and obviously have the financing and the capital and the ownership structure sorted out between the hospital and the surgeons. That's the rate limiting factor. But I just see this continuing to grow and I don't really see sort of where this stops. It's just going to keep growing. Five years from now, what will it be? It's in the 10% to 15% range now. It'll cross 15% next year and then it could go to 30%, 40%. It could. Yeah. Listen, this is a gap filler for us in soft tissue fixation that's used in foot and ankle procedures by sports medicine doctors, as well as foot and ankle doctors. It's an elegant, terrific product. We're really excited about it. Both of our sports business unit and foot and ankle business units, both teams are going to be selling this product based on the surgeon call point that they have. So really, really terrific product. We've been tracking the company for quite some time, and we're not going to get into details of how much. It's not a big product, but it's a really great gap filler that, again, our sports business has, as you know, been growing at very high rates for many years now, and this fits in with them. It also fits in with our foot and ankle business. Yeah. Listen, this IVS business of ours has been a really terrific business, if you think about what is in that business. We bought these curved balloons from the CareFusion a while back. We acquired the spine jack product. We've also developed some terrific internal products. We launched the OptaBlate Blade product. So we have the pain docs and we have the oncology. So two different call points within our IVS business, and a pretty robust portfolio. And just outstanding commercial execution has been really a terrific engine of growth for us. And it's an area we like. And we continue to believe we're going to expand in this area at some point in the future. We're certainly going to be adding salespeople, as we have been doing, because we have the product portfolio, partially organic and partially inorganic. Yeah. No, no feedback yet competitively, so it's not really had any impact thus far. It's early, so there really isn't anything to share right now. We'll -- once we learn something, we'll let you know. But we like our chances. We like our chances with our Mako Shoulder. Yeah. Look, there's a lot of different dynamics, and one of the dynamics is OR time, it's getting prioritized for other procedures. So you have surgeons that actually are getting squeezed out of operating because the ORs are being used for, let's call them more higher value, higher revenue producing procedures. That's one part. You've got these copays that people have to pay. And sometimes they're just a little bit squeezed and that can cause a bit of a delay. So there are multiple factors at play. And like I say, we've seen this happen in the past. I don't know how long it'll last. It caught us a little bit by surprise, to be honest. But we've liked the business that we have. We like the portfolio that we have. And these patients aren't -- they're going to -- these bunions don't heal themselves, so they're going to come back to the market, and I think we're going to be well-positioned when that happens. But yes, it has been two quarters in a row. We'll let you know how Q3 goes. But again, it's not going to be a problem for our trauma and extremities business. It will continue to have very high growth regardless of what happens in this market. Yeah. Thanks. Women's health and urology has been an area of interest for us. And the endoscopy division is pretty excited about MOLLI to be able to localize the lesions that need to be removed in surgery. And for surgery, as you mentioned, we have NOVADAQ the Exoscope from the Invuity acquisition, we have the PhotonBlade. We can do single stage procedures because you can assess the health of the tissue and then having the localization. And we already have the rep there. They're already -- so this is a perfect, classic tuck-in for Stryker. The reps are there, they're in the procedure. And this product, even though it's not a big revenue producer, at least now. It is elegant, it is easy to use, it is a terrific product. And so we've watched all the other products in this space. This is the one we've. We've had our eye on and we are really excited to have that as part of Stryker. And it will enable us to be a bigger force in breast care. Yeah. It's a good question. And certainly, the demand for capital is very high. There is construction, as you know, if hospitals are being constructed, ASCs are being constructed, patients are getting great outcomes. I think the ASC is a contributor. People -- they go home the same day, they can't believe they can get back to playing their sport of choice so quickly. Word is spreading. And so I think this is one of those reasons where you're seeing the demand increasing. And as the operating room spill up, they're looking for outlets to be able to do more and more procedures. So I do believe that that's contributing to this elevated procedures. And for our MedSurg business, a lot of our small capital that has to be replaced. And that's probably why we're experiencing the kind of high growth. You look at instruments, you look at power tools, very, very high growth and a promising outlook going forward. I hope this continues. We see it continuing at least through the end of this year and obviously, we'll let you know what we think about guidance for next year in January."

            "name": "Glenn Boehnlein",
            "content": "Thanks Jason. Today I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 9% in the second quarter compared to 11.9% in the same quarter of 2023. Average selling days are in line with 2023. We had a 1.1% favorable impact from pricing. We continue to see positive trends in our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.9% unfavorable impact on sales. In the US, organic sales growth was 9%. International organic sales growth was 8.9%, driven by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.81 in the quarter was up 10.6% from 2023, driven by higher sales and partially offset by foreign currency exchange translation which had an unfavorable impact of $0.03. Now we'll provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 9.8% and organic sales growth of 9.7% which included 10.1% of US organic growth and 8.2% of international organic growth. Instruments had US organic sales growth of 11.9% led by strong double-digit growth in the surgical technologies business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield. Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 8% with strong growth in its core endoscopy business and its sports medicine business. This growth was led by the continued success of the 1788 platform and sports medicine shoulder and knee products. This was somewhat offset by slower communication sales due to the timing of installations which will recover in the second half of this year. Medical had US organic sales growth of 11.9%, driven by strong sales performances in its emergency care and sage businesses with growth in transport capital, defibrillators and sage products. Neurovascular had US organic sales growth of 2.3% which reflects some US supply disruption related to flow diversion products. And finally, Neuro Cranial had US organic sales growth of 10.6%, led by double-digit growth in our bone mill, bipolar forceps and cranial maxillofacial products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 8.2%, led by double-digit organic growth in our instruments, neurovascular and neuro cranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in China, Australia and Japan. Orthopaedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 8.9% and organic sales growth of 8%, which included organic growth of 7.3% in the US and 9.8% internationally. Our US knee business grew 6.6% organically, reflecting our market leading position in robotic assisted knee procedures and the continued strength of our installed Mako base. Our US hip business grew 4.3% organically, fueled by our insignia hip stem. Our US trauma and extremities business grew 9.1% organically, with strong performances across our upper extremities, biologics and core trauma businesses. Our US spine business grew 4.4% organically, led by the performance in our interventional spine business. Our US other ortho business grew 15.4% organically, particularly driven by robust continued momentum of Mako installations. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 9.8% organically, including strong performances in Canada, Europe and most emerging markets. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.2% represents approximately 30 basis points of favorability against the second quarter of 2023 and 60 basis points sequentially as compared to the first quarter of this year. This favorability primarily reflects positive pricing trends and improved material cost and manufacturing efficiencies. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.5% of sales, which was approximately 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.1% of sales, which was consistent with the second quarter of 2023. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24.6% of sales, which was approximately 30 basis points favorable to the second quarter of 2023. Net adjusted other income and expense of $54 million for the quarter was $12 million lower than 2023, driven by favorable interest income in our invested cash balances. The second quarter of 2024 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.2%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete items. For 2024, we still expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of approximately $12.2 billion. During the quarter, we repaid $600 million of debt that came due in May. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $837 million, reflecting the results of net earnings somewhat offset by working capital changes. Based on our year-to-date performance and our positive outlook related to sustained procedural volumes and a healthy demand for our capital products, we now expect full year 2024 organic sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 10%, with favorable pricing impacting of approximately 0.5%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate a moderately unfavorable impact on the full year sales and now expect EPS will be negatively impacted in the range of $0.10 to $0.15. This is reflected in our guidance. Given our sales momentum, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.90 to $12.10 per share. And now I will open the call up for questions. Yeah. Larry, really good question. I think if you looked at our performance historically, you would always see that op margin leverage in the second half of the year just really, really takes off. And so I don't think this year is really going to be different from performances in past years. I would tell you that we're seeing, like you saw here in the first half of this year, kind of a good balance, honestly between gross margin and SG&A. I think moving forward in the back half of the year, just given sort of how we spend in SG&A our variable comp models, we'll probably see more leverage come out of SG&A than gross margin in the back half of the year. And we're very bullish on, like Kevin said, still holding to our 100 basis points of op margin expansion for this year. Yeah. Maybe I'll limit my comments really just to 2024. So I would tell you that if you just look at our pricing teams and what they've accomplished, first of all, we've seen really great positive outcome on the MSNT side and related to the MSNT products. And I would tell you that if you think about their product cycle and how they introduce new innovations, we'll constantly gain price on those innovations. I would tell you that on the ortho side, I'm equally pleased. We're addressing this in contracts as they come up. And frankly, we're less negative. We are just less negative than we used to be on ortho, which honestly is a win. I would tell you that this carries over not just to the people at our enterprise level that are working on this, but it's down in the field with our salespeople. So the divisions have put in various programs that drive certain incentives related to positive pricing or improvements in margins. And so my money's on our salesforce in terms of keeping this going. That's what I would say. I would tell you that if you just look at our performance year-to-date in Q1, 0.7%, 1.1% in Q2, in the back half of the year, we're going to see some anniversary of products and contracts. And so there may be a little bit of moderation. But I do think that to Kevin's point, there's a lot of newer products that are going to be out there that are going to drive price that maybe isn't necessarily captured in here, but I'm bullish on it. I think we'll continue to see really good price performance this year, and I'll hold my comments till we guide 2025. Sure. I think, first of all, a couple of things. If you look at getting margin out of gross profit or getting margin out of SG&A, I mean, a lot of the drivers are honestly in our control. You look at hiring, that's completely in our control. You look at travel and meetings completely in our control. And so a lot of these just come down to say good budgeting, let's say, in terms of how we plan it and how we know that we have the confidence that we're going to be able to drive that margin. The other thing is if we look at when we grow with these sort of lofty rates across a lot of our businesses, those are growing off of fixed cost basis where it just drives natural leverage that will drive in our business. So we won't be spending at a comparable level. And if you look at Q4 time in and time out, that honestly has been what's happening. We also have a lot of exciting things that are going on. And if you look at what we're doing in supply chain and changes that we're making there in terms of working with vendors, working down some of those inflation charges that we took over the last two years. We also look at low-cost manufacturing. We have facilities now in Poland and also in Mexico, where we're sourcing product in those. And then lastly, sort of back into operating expenses. We continue to push more and more of that day to day transactional work into these shared service centers, which are at a third of the cost of what we see in sort of our developed areas, US and Europe, primarily. So honestly, I think we have a very good pathway to deliver that 100 basis points. And we wouldn't have talked about it so loudly if we weren't confident that we did have a plan that is going to get us there. Sure. I think, first of all, we still have that target out there, 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion. We don't think any differently about that, given our performance year-to-date this year. I think kind of what you're seeing in the first half of this year are some working capital differences year-over-year from last year. Some of those having to do with. We picked back up M&A, so we're seeing a little bit more of integration flow through. We also are seeing inventory changes just related to higher sales. That naturally happens. Same thing with accounts receivable. And then lastly, we have timing of some transition tax payments that fell into this first half of the year that are, say, larger payments than what we normally would expect. And so that also impacted our cash flow in the first half of this year. For the back half of this year, I feel like we'll see what we normally see seasonally. A lot of pick up in our free cash flow conversion in Q3 and then, honestly on into Q4. And a lot of that has to do with just the flow of earnings is much higher in Q3, Q4. So that really impacts our cash flow performance. It also brings down inventory. And then we'll work to keep AR in line. So we'll still target between 70% and 80% free cash flow and we haven't backed away from that. Yeah. Hi, Mike. As we look at international, a couple of things. Keep in mind, we don't have R&D expense in our international sort of numbers as we look at sort of performance of their margins. So you have that performance. We also -- it can vary market by market. I mean, I think in some of these more developed markets, we see good price performance and good operating margins. Sometimes in more sort of emerging markets, we will see a slight headwind relative to sort of what we're realizing from a pricing standpoint in those markets. I would tell you that. I think that as we look out over the long-term, though, we obviously are cognizant of the fact of what international sales and how that will contribute to our overall margin profile. And so we have planned for the kind of infrastructure needs and the kind of other saving needs that we need to do to make sure that we drive this consistent margin and drive a consistent 30 basis points plus margin performance once we get past this 200 basis points increase that we're looking at. So there will be some. But overall, I think that as we look at it, we're not seeing that it's going to be a headwind that we will not overcome. Yeah. Hi, David. I think, though, as I think back to how we have characterized it, if you think about what we did in 2023 that had more gross margin expansion and op margin. And we've always said that 2024 would lean more to sort of SG&A and leverage of op expenses. So I don't think we've really sort of changed sort of how we think about how the year is going to play out for op margin expansion. So I do think that we are bullish on opportunities in gross margin, but a lot of those are things you do this year that are going to benefit us in 2025. On SG&A, that's more near-term things that we have that we budgeted for and planned for that I think actually will allow us to give us a lot of confidence to say that we will get to that 100 basis points of op margin expansion. Sure."

            "content": "Thanks Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, capital demand and select product highlights. Procedural volumes remained robust in the second quarter driven by strong fundamentals, increased adoption of robotic assisted surgery and healthy patient activities with surgeons. We continue to expect strength in procedural demand as we move into the second half of the year. Demand for our capital products also remained healthy in the quarter with continued elevated backlog across our endoscopy and medical divisions. Continued patient interest in Mako contributed to our best ever second quarter for installations worldwide and in the US with high utilization rates across the globe. Also in the quarter, we reached over 1 million robotic total knee procedures performed to date with Mako and Triathlon. We expect the growing momentum in installations and utilization will continue to drive sustained growth in our hips and knees businesses. Our recent product introductions highlight our commitment to innovation and the durability of our innovation cycle. Pangea's comprehensive plating system complements our market leading nailing portfolio and will enable sustained above market growth in our core trauma business. We expect Pangea availability to continue to ramp and reach full launch in the US by the second half of 2025. Next, our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator and monitor continues to drive significant excitement in the marketplace. This flagship product within our emergency care business unit was launched near the end of the second quarter with a strong order book, and we believe it will have a multiyear benefit to our medical division. Lastly, we announced this morning that we received FDA clearance for our Spine Guidance 5 Software featuring Copilot, which introduces smart powered instruments to our Q guidance ecosystem. This innovative technology is designed to support surgeon precision by providing auditory and sensory alerts when approaching anatomical boundaries during spinal procedures and enhanced patient safety and outcomes. Copilot is an important step on our development pipeline which also includes Mako Spine. Mako Spine with Copilot is on track to launch in Q4 and Mako's Shoulder is on track to launch at the end of the year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Hey, Matt, this is Jason. I'll start with maybe make a quick comment on neurovascular and then I'll turn it over to Kevin for foot and ankle. But to your point on neurovascular, I'll tell you, globally, we were pleased with the business overall. I think Glenn made a comment in the prepared remarks around a little bit of a supply hiccup, I'll say, as it relates to business in the US. July is actually off to a really nice start. So we feel much better about that. I think you also know that the ischemic business, specifically in the US, continues to be quite competitive. We are making adjustments in the salesforce to address that and better serve our customers. But overall, still feel good about the market. Yeah. Steve, it's Jason. I'll take a swing at this and Kevin can jump in if he wants anything additional. But I would tell you, as you think about China in the quarter, good growth for us in China. I would say less impact from VBP than maybe we originally anticipated. So I think from a VBP standpoint, that environment is starting to stabilize and turning to growth for us. Hey Matt, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. As we think about 2025, obviously we'll talk more about that in January. Certainly, you can expect us to deliver on the 100 basis point of op margin expansion next year, but in terms of how that shape will look, we'll give you more information when we get to January. Yeah. Josh, this is Jason. I'll take this one. I would say just as you think about specifically the second quarter, we'd say we have had a solid quarter in spine led by interventional spine. And as we think to the future, we've certainly talked about Copilot and Mako Spine and how that will help us in the spine market. And so really nothing additional to add there in terms of how we think about the future. Hey, Jason. It's Jason. I would say just overall, Stryker, I would say supply's in quite good shape. Do we see spotty issues like I mentioned, relative to neurovascular? Yes. We saw a little bit of a supply disruption as it relates to our medical business outside of the United States as well. But these things are resolving themselves. July for neurovascular, off to a good start. And as it relates to medical, I think you should expect robust growth in the second half as well. So nothing from a supply standpoint is a concern for us as we move forward."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I'm your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. \n Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. \n I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. \nKevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter as well as some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. \n In the first quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 10% with double-digit growth in MedSurg and Neurotechnology and high single-digit growth in Orthopaedics and Spine despite one less selling day and tough comparables from a year ago. This reflects our team's continued strong commercial execution. Our results were led by very strong U.S. performance, notably in Instruments, Medical, Endoscopy, Trauma and Extremities and Mako. Internationally, growth momentum continued against strong double-digit growth organic sales comparables from the first quarter of last year. We expect this growth rate to accelerate for the remainder of the year as international remains a significant opportunity for us.\n We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.50, reflecting 16.8% growth compared to the first quarter of 2023, driven by our strong sales performance and margin expansion. As anticipated, we began to accelerate our M&A activity. We just completed the acquisition of mfPHD, a leading provider of modular stainless steel wall systems. This further enhances our communications business unit portfolio within Endoscopy and helps us meet our customers' needs for turnkey operating room design and construction. At the end of the quarter, we also closed on our acquisition of SERF within our Hip business. Our deal pipeline is strong, and we expect to be active over the course of the year. \n With one quarter behind us, we now expect an increased full year organic sales growth of 8.5% to 9.5%, and we are increasing our adjusted EPS range to $11.85 to $12.05 a share. Coming off organic sales growth of 9.7% in 2022 and 11.5% in 2023, this guidance demonstrates the durability of our high growth and is a testament to our commercial strength and extensive pipeline of innovation across the company. Also, it reinforces our ability to meet our target of 200 basis points of operating margin expansion by 2025. \n Next, I want to thank our teams for their ongoing commitment to talent and culture, which is reflected in the recognition of Stryker for the 14th year in a row as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. Our operating model, talent and culture are true differentiators for us. In addition, we recently published our fourth annual comprehensive report, which captures our commitments and disclosures on corporate responsibility. \n I will now turn the call over to Jason. \nJason Beach: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, capital demand and select product highlights. \n Procedural volumes remained strong in the first quarter, in line with our expectations, driven by continued adoption in robotic-assisted surgery, demographics, a stable pricing environment and healthy patient activity with surgeons. And while pockets of supply constraints remain, our supply continues to be stable overall. Demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter with continued elevated backlog across our Endoscopy and Medical divisions. \n Our Mako direct-to-patient campaign continues to perform well, which contributed to our very strong Mako growth with record first quarter installations in both the U.S. and internationally. This will continue to drive our Hips and Knees businesses. In April, we performed our first cases using the Pangea plating system in our Trauma and Extremities division and are gearing up for a full launch. Pangea is the largest launch in trauma's history as it offers a comprehensive system that will enable larger hospital conversions. \n Next, we received approval from the FDA for our new LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator and monitor. This is a flagship product within our emergency care business unit and was one of the catalysts for our acquisition of Physio-Control. LIFEPAK 35 is a modern platform with a touchscreen interface that brings advanced connected capabilities to improve workflow. We will launch this product at the end of Q2, and it will have a multiyear benefit to our Medical division.\n Lastly, Mako, Spine and CoPilot are pacing to launch in Q4, followed by the shoulder application at the end of the year. We continue to receive positive feedback from surgeons who have been exposed to these technologies. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. \nGlenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. \n Our organic sales growth was 10% in the quarter compared to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2023. This quarter, we had one less selling day than 2023. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.7%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, almost all of which again contributed positive pricing for the quarter. \n Foreign currency had a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales in the quarter. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 11.3%. International organic sales growth was 6.6% against a very strong comparable growth of over 16% in 2023. This performance included positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly in the United Kingdom and Canada and most of our emerging markets. \n Our adjusted EPS of $2.50 in the quarter was up 16.8% from 2023, driven by strong sales growth and operating margin expansion. Foreign currency exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of $0.05. \n Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12% and organic sales growth of 11.6%, which included 13.5% of U.S. organic growth and 6% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic growth of 19% with strong double-digit growth across the Orthopaedic Instruments and Surgical Technologies businesses. \n From a product perspective, sales growth was led by almost 50% growth in smoke evacuation and strong performances in power tools, Steri-Shield, waste management and SurgiCount. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.1% with double-digit growth in its communications and Endo BU businesses. And from a product perspective, standout growth included cameras, light sources, insufflators, booms and sports medicine implants.\n Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 16.8%, led by the solid sales performances in all 3 businesses. This included strong growth in stretchers, cots, Vocera and Sage products. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 2.9%, highlighted by solid performances in our hemorrhagic stents and guidewires. Neuro Cranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 7%, driven by strong performance in our CMF business. \n Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 6%, which included strong performances in our emerging markets. Orthopaedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 8%, which included organic growth of 8.3% in the U.S. and 7.4% internationally. \n Our U.S. Hip business grew 6.8% organically against a very strong comparable of 16.2% in the same quarter last year. This growth reflects continued strong primary hip performance fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem. Our U.S. Knee business grew 3.1% organically against another very strong comparable of 20.7% in the first quarter of 2023. Our Knee growth reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures and the continued strength of our installed base. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 10.3% organic with strong performances across our upper extremities, biologics and core trauma businesses. \n Our U.S. Spine business grew 3.9% organically, led by the performance in our Interventional Spine business. Our U.S. other ortho business grew 45.6% organically, driven by strong Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 7.4% organically, including strong performances in Canada and most emerging markets, particularly driven by strong Mako installations. \n Now I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.6% represents approximately 50 basis points favorability against the first quarter of 2023. This improvement reflects positive pricing trends as well as continued easing of certain cost pressures that we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales, which was 30 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2023. Our adjusted SG&A was 35% of sales, which was 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to continued discipline in our spending and investments to support our growth. \n In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 21.9% of sales, which was approximately 80 basis points favorable to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted other income and expense of $49 million for the quarter was $16 million lower than 2023, driven by favorability in interest rates and a higher level of invested cash resulting in higher interest income. \n The first quarter of 2024 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 12.3%, reflecting the impact of our geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2024, we still expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. \n Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $2.4 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of approximately $13 billion. Our total debt includes $600 million of debt that is due to be repaid in May and has been prefunded. \n Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $204 million, reflecting the results of net earnings and normal first quarter seasonal cash outflows. Considering our first quarter results, strong procedural volumes and healthy demand for our capital products, we now expect our full year 2024 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.5% with the pricing impact to be roughly flat. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be moderately unfavorable impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year. EPS will be negatively impacted at the higher end of our previously guided range of $0.05 to $0.10. With our momentum heading into the rest of the year and our commitment to expanding operating margins, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.85 to $12.05. \n And now I will open up the call for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a really nice quarter. A lot to ask about, but maybe 2 for me on financials. First, Kevin, it sounds like procedure volumes remain really healthy across the globe, and capital equipment, same. Would love to hear if you're seeing any changes, either up or down, in the environment for capital and procedure volume growth. \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Yes, we're really pleased with the performance in the first quarter, and really nothing has changed. So the good level of volumes that we're seeing in procedures that we saw through 2024 has continued into 2025. And our capital order book remains very strong. So capital equipment, whether it's large capital or small capital, remains very robust. We have a nice healthy backlog, and that gives us the confidence to raise our organic sales growth guide for the full year. \nRobert Marcus: And maybe one, probably hasn't been asked on in a while, but your Spine business had a really nice quarter. I wanted to see. Is that more fundamentals and the improvements in technology you've brought to market? Is that gaining some share from disruption of the competitor merger? And is that giving you a foothold ahead of the Spine Mako launch and discussions and how hospitals are open to that? \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Not a major change. I would tell you the Interventional Spine business had a terrific quarter. That was really high growth. Our enabling technologies within Spine, the Q Guidance System has really picked up good momentum as well. The Mako Spine and the CoPilot won't be launched until the fourth quarter. So that's not really having much of an impact. And I wouldn't say that the competitive disruption or the competitive merger is really having much of an impact yet. It's still very early days. So nothing too remarkable, but overall, a good number and a good solid number for our Spine business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. \nLarry Biegelsen: Congrats on a nice quarter here. One for Glenn, one for, I think, Kevin. Glenn, just maybe on the EPS raise of about $0.10 at the midpoint. Can you help us bridge kind of how much of that was operational? How much of that is coming from kind of below the line, other income being a little lower? And obviously, FX is a greater headwind. So just kind of the pieces that led to the $0.10 raise, and I had one follow-up, please. \nGlenn Boehnlein: Yes. Sure. Thanks, Larry. I think if you look at sort of what happened in OI&E and also what happened with our tax rate, obviously, we had some favorability just for this quarter. I think fundamentally, we're still targeting $250 million roughly in OI&E and attach rate that really is still between 14% and 15%. So we're still sort of holding to the below the op margin line sort of guidance that we had built into our initial guidance that we provided back in January. \n I think, honestly, if you look at the raise in terms of how we think about it, the robustness of the top line, obviously, the earnings that we're able to kick off of that. And then lastly, we're just -- we're feeling that we're seeing good momentum and positivity around the programs that we put in place to drive leverage to get back to that 2019 number. And so all of that really combines to really give us the confidence to give us that $0.10 raise from the midpoint in EPS. \nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And Kevin, I'm sure you know investors are concerned about the potential impact of da Vinci 5 on your Endoscopy business. Obviously, it's not having any impact right now. Really strong growth here. I'd love to hear from you kind of if you're willing to share kind of what the potential exposure is and what you can do to help protect your lap tower business long term. \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks. I'm a little bit mystified by this concern, to be honest with you. If you attended the Sage's meeting, you could clearly see that we have a very differentiated solution that will frankly enable -- they can grow at whatever rates they're growing with their new product, and we're going to continue to have a very strong performance in endoscopy, both this year and for years to come. The overlap in our businesses is minor. We are multi-specialty. We play -- and most of our procedures, frankly, aren't being done robotically today. We also are the clear leader in fluorescence imaging. \n Just most recently, we had the American Association of Thoracic Surgery, where we partner with CYTALUX, this new fluorophore, to be able to light up lung cancer for lobectomy procedures, which we're the only company that can do that, that can light up that fluorophore. So surgeons are going to demand this for safer surgery, but that doesn't mean that Intuitive can't grow with their robot. We are really playing in spaces with very little overlap, and both of us can continue to have very strong performance for many, many years to come. So to me, this concern is, frankly, mystifying and not at all for me a concern for our Endoscopy division. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. \nRyan Zimmerman: I want to ask about the organic growth and the guidance. If you look at the 10% organic growth this quarter versus the comps and kind of where you're guiding that 9% at the midpoint, the comps essentially do get easier through the balance of the year. And so I'm wondering. Kevin or Glenn, whoever wants to take this, just talk about your guidance view or philosophy for the top line, specifically given the performance and what you think could be better performance for the remainder of the year. \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Great. So certainly, if you look at our fourth quarter last year, I wouldn't think that, that was -- those were easy comps. We had a pretty monstrous fourth quarter last year. And so comps is probably the biggest concern that we have, and we do pick up an extra selling day in Q3 and extra selling day in Q4. It's only one quarter, right? There's a lot of uncertainties out there in the marketplace. We feel very good about our business. And I think this is an appropriate raise at this time. Let's see how things go at the end of the second quarter, and we can update you further on the outlook for the year. \nRyan Zimmerman: Fair enough. And Kevin, your comments on M&A were pretty pointed. You've highlighted a number of areas previously. I think there was 5 that you specifically called out before. Are you reinforcing those same areas today? Because if I look at just some of the tuck-ins that you've done, it's actually been outside those 4 or 5 areas as of late. And so just curious kind of how you're thinking about the targets for the areas for M&A today. \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Certainly, when I talk about those 5 areas, those are adjacencies. So we have our core basically supplementing our existing businesses with new technology. That's always going to be the majority of the deals we do. And beyond that, as we think about adjacencies, those are what I'm calling my sort of top 5 priority adjacencies. And what I'd tell you right now is we have an incredibly healthy pipeline of deals. \n Now of course, pipeline doesn't always get realized, right? There's always a washout rate as you go through these processes. But I'm feeling really excited about the pipeline. They are mostly in the tuck-in variety. And so they're just like the one I mentioned for our communications business or our Hip business. You're going to see most of those occur at least for the next couple of quarters. Beyond that, if we do decide to branch out, those other areas I talked about are still of high interest. Nothing has really changed on that front. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. \nJoanne Wuensch: Very nice quarter. Could you unpack 2 particular areas? One is the Instrument sales up 18%. And then the other is other, up 44.2%. Both of those are real bright, shining stars. I'd love to hear what went behind that. \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Sure. I can start on the Instruments, and I'll let Jason talk about the other ortho. And you're right, these are bright, shining stars. The Instruments division had a fantastic quarter, and it was really, really across both Surgical Technologies as well as Orthopaedic Instruments. Really across the board. \n And if you look at smoke evacuation, we just continued to have tremendous momentum. Obviously, the market has been growing very robustly. But we have a terrific commercial execution, growing almost 50%, which is really awesome. And that was great growth in the U.S. and also really great growth internationally. And we see that continuing, maybe not at 50%, but we see that very high double-digit growth through the rest of this year and into next year, especially as more states decide to mandate smoke evacuation. So that was really a big push. \n We also have the SurgiCount, plus we've launched a new product that combines the Gauss Surgical quantification of blood loss as well as the sponge counting. So it's all combined into one solution, which is really elegant and really being well received by our customers. So those are probably the 2 biggest catalysts within Surgical Technologies. Neptune waste management continues to roll, but that's not new information. \n And then if you flip over to Orthopaedic Instruments, we have the Steri-Shield doing extremely well. Our power tools, obviously, you know about the new launch that's still, let's call it, just a little -- about 1.5 years in. That's continuing to do very well as well as pulsed lavage and all the other products and just really great commercial execution by the Instruments team. It's really been a flagship division of Stryker, if you go back the last 10-plus years. It delivers very, very consistently, and it did so again in the first quarter. \nJason Beach: Yes. Joanne, it's Jason. I'll take the other ortho here. So just a couple of additional comments, I guess, to my prepared remarks would be, like I said, we had a record quarter of installation in the first quarter this year. If you remember, we had a record quarter in the fourth quarter of last year. So the momentum is going really well on the Mako front. I commented on the direct-to-patient campaign. We've seen really good results out of that. So we feel good about it, and we like what this will translate in terms of the Hips and Knees business as we move forward as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. \nPito Chickering: Looking at the international growth, can you talk about what you're seeing in Europe versus the higher growth markets like Japan and China? And how should we think about the growth internationally if we're using the 6.8% seen this quarter on a constant currency basis? \nKevin Lobo: Yes. So certainly, Europe continues to be a growth engine for Stryker. I would tell you in the first quarter, it was a little bit softer than it has been, and that was really because we had a big quarter last year. So really more comp related. I do expect Europe is going to continue to pick up in Q2, Q3, Q4. So the overall run rates are really healthy in Europe. And we -- the U.K. was a bit of a standout in the first quarter, but the other regions are all going to be fine. We had a really big, big sales in Germany and Southern Europe last year and so -- in the first quarter. So to me, it's just a comp issue. I'm not at all concerned about our international. We're going to have another strong year in international. So you talked about Europe. What else did you say, sorry? [ Was it all ] Europe? \nPito Chickering: Great. And then the second question was strong utilization across the country for hospitals and good margins. We're seeing hospitals want to increase their CapEx spending. I guess what areas of your portfolio do you think sort of has the most upside for hospitals increase in the CapEx dollars? \nJason Beach: Yes. Pito, I guess what I would say here, as we look at the overall capital environment, and you can see in our results in the first quarter in our capital business is very strong. So we see opportunities here across the board. I think we mentioned that our backlog continues to be elevated here. So we expect strong capital as we go throughout the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Shagun Singh Chadha with RBC Capital. \nShagun Singh Chadha: Kevin, you've talked extensively about the super cycle of innovation, and we are seeing strong results here in Q1. Are you able to quantify contribution from new products in Q1? Perhaps talk to us about what's factored into your guidance for 2024. And I guess the key question is, how should investors think about growth drivers for Stryker beyond the current super cycle of innovation? I think you've indicated year 2 and 3 are the peak years. And I think you'd get there in '24 and '25. So how should we think about growth drivers beyond that? \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks for the question. What I would tell you is we're in this constant rhythm of innovation. And we just had a number of products sort of collide at the same time, but they're constantly being refreshed. So I wouldn't think about this as a fleeting moment. If you think about 9.7% in '22, 11.5% in '23, another potentially double digit, we'll see. We're not guiding to that just yet, but we have a chance certainly to get to another double-digit growth this year, and next year, you're going to have the impact. We're just launching LIFEPAK 35. It's not going to have as much of an impact this year as next year. Pangea not as much impact this year as next year. The Mako applications have really no impact this year. It's really more next year. And then we'll just keep rolling other innovations on top of that. \n So I would just think we were in a rhythm. Assuming the market conditions stay similar, we're in a rhythm where this kind of high growth is what you should come to expect from us with no end in sight as long as we continue to invest as we are, roughly 7% of our growing top line in new product innovation, and we continue to be active with acquisitions because as you know, we acquire high-growth assets. And then after the first year that rolls into organic growth, we had a bit of a pause last year as we're going to refill that tank this year, and that will contribute to organic growth in the years ahead. So I would not look at this as some kind of we reached a peak, and we're starting -- we're going to come down on the other side. Absent some kind of market adjustment, this is -- we're in kind of a new normal, at least for a while. \nShagun Singh Chadha: That's really helpful. And then just a couple of follow-ups on the ortho side. Just any updates on Mako for spine and shoulder robot? Are you still on track for 2024 and a year-end '24 launch for both of those? \nJason Beach: Shagun, it's Jason. Just -- I'll go back to my prepared remarks, right? As we think about Mako Spine and CoPilot, we're looking at a Q4 launch there. And for Mako shoulder, it will be the end of this year from a launch standpoint. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. \nVijay Kumar: Kevin, I had one for you on the backlog comments here, both on the procedures and the capital side, right? On procedures, [indiscernible], can you comment on any scheduling? I think historically, scheduling was taking time. It was elongated. Have you seen any shortening of that scheduling still elongated? How have cancellations sort of trended? I think on the capital side, you mentioned LIFEPAK. Did that contribute in the backlog? Or is that something that's supposed to come in the coming quarters? \nKevin Lobo: Look, I'd just call it a stable market. It really hasn't changed much, if you think about waiting lists. If you think about staffing, it's continually gotten better over the course of '24. So I would just say it's very stable in terms of the overall market. I don't see shortening at all. I don't see it elongating. It's just as we saw through '24 -- '23, sorry, it's a continuation into '24 of that kind of stable marketplace. \n And the new defibrillator just got approved. So that's not really been a big contributor to our backlog. Our backlog is just a healthy order book of all of our existing products across medical, across even some of the Instruments businesses and Endoscopy. So it really -- there wasn't any kind of new spike, but we've had a healthy backlog. We had it going into '23. We have it going into '24. We continue to get good orders. \n So yes, we're shipping out at a nice rate, but the orders are still coming in at a very healthy rate. So we're really not burning through any kind of meaningful backlog, and that gives us confidence for at least through the rest of this year if -- and as orders continue, and it obviously could potentially spike with some of these new products. That's only going to give us more tailwind for growth. \nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Kevin. And Glenn, maybe one for you. Free cash in the quarter looks like there was some timing element. Can you just remind us what kind of free cash conversion should we be expecting for fiscal '24? \nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure. Yes. I think in Q1, what you saw was just timing between working capital in Q4 and Q1. And then just sort of seasonally in Q1, we have higher cash outflows that occur. So that's the impact of that. On an overall basis, there's no change to the targets that we discussed back at the analyst meeting in November, and that would be the 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion number. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: Congrats on a good quarter. On the Mako installations, curious -- big insulation number, but curious how many of those are going into competitive accounts. And is that a leading indicator for share gains in ortho? \nJason Beach: Travis, it's Jason. I mean for competitive reasons, we won't necessarily disclose the number in terms of the amount going into competitive accounts. But I will say that number is big for us and continues to be a winner for us in terms of going into competitive accounts. \nTravis Steed: Great. And then the 50% growth in smoke evacuation, was that a big step change versus where it's been running at? And I'm just curious if there was something that drove that acceleration in smoke evacuation, if it's kind of better bundling across the portfolio or more reps pushing that product. \nJason Beach: Yes, Travis, it's Jason. I'd say a couple of different things here. The smoke evac business has continued to be, I think, high teens, 20% grower. In smoke-free states, it's higher than that and similar to kind of what we said today in the prepared remarks. So it's been a great tailwind for us, and we think it will be into the future. \nKevin Lobo: Yes. We've also had our supply chain has really improved in terms of being able to meet the tremendous demand that we've had, and that was also a contributor. So we've had tremendous growth, tremendous demand. And our supply chain has really kicked in, in a strong way, and that puts us in a good position not only to deliver in the first quarter but also to deliver in the quarters ahead. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. \nMatthew O'Brien: Just real quick, it sounds like Mako is getting -- Mako Spine is being pushed out. Just I don't know if it's 3 to 6 months. Is that about right? And then is it a software issue, hardware issue, something else you're going to incorporate into it that's causing this modest push? \nJason Beach: Matt, it's Jason. I mean keep in mind, right, from a regulatory standpoint, there's time lines as it relates to the FDA that can shift things by week, sometimes a couple of months. We've always been targeting a back half launch here. So I wouldn't consider this as a significant change in the time line. As you think about the guidance that we have for this year, there was certainly nothing assumed in terms of our guide relative to the spine or shoulder launch. So no impact there as we think about that. \nMatthew O'Brien: Got it. And then on the MedSurg side of things, I think, Kevin, you've said double-digit growth is what you expect for the next 5 years there. Is that needing to have the backlog? And I mean is there any way to quantify how significant that backlog is right now and how much of a tailwind it is versus all these new products that you got coming like defibrillators, et cetera? Because the Street is nowhere near double-digit growth for the MedSurg business over the next couple of years. \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Look, I don't think I said that. I have to double check the transcript, but I didn't give a precise number of double-digit growth for all that time. What I did say is we are in this high-growth environment based on our innovation cycle, and we're going to continue to have these new products fuel growth. It does depend on the market, right? So if the market stays at this kind of level, could we stay in that kind of double-digit range? Sure, we could. But I -- there's no guarantee that the market will stay this elevated both in terms of procedures as well as the healthy capital environment. \n So it does depend on the market. And obviously, you know we outperformed the market, and you can -- depending on the year, it's 300 basis points or whatever that number is. But we're not going to defy gravity. If the market falls down to a certain level, then obviously, our growth would be similarly impacted. So I don't believe I was that precise with double-digit over 5 years. But I do feel bullish about the ability for us to continue to be a very high-growth business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. \nMatthew Miksic: Congrats on a really strong quarter, which looks to me like and a lot of the feedback I'm getting is that it really is just all about comps. I mean double-digit organic growth against low teens -- low to mid-teens organic growth last year is -- that is at least impressive to us. So congrats on the continued momentum. I had one follow-up, if I could, on the Mako robot and maybe just the nature of the launch. If you could walk us through, is that you're expecting a limited launch and then sort of picking up momentum in 2025? And then, Kevin, if you could maybe talk about some of the either new aspects of that platform or some of the other products that you're kind of excited about in the next couple of quarters that they will start coming to market and adding to growth in the back half in '25. I appreciate it. \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Sure. Thanks. Jason, every quarter, we'll talk to you about new products. And we highlighted a couple this quarter with the LIFEPAK 35 and Pangea in our trauma business, both of which are really super exciting products that are going to contribute to growth for at least a few years to come. As it relates to Mako, so the new spine robot will be 2 parts. One part is the actual robot with a different attachment that will enable the pedicle screw guidance. The second part is the Q Guidance trade that's already being sold today. So that is used for first-line procedures. It's a very lightning fast camera. You saw it at NASS. It's being sold today to do navigated spine procedures. So those 2 components will make up the Mako Spine system. \n And then in addition to that, the CoPilot product will be able to do diskectomies and bone preparation with haptic feedback to be able to protect you from getting close to vital structures, spinal cord, et cetera. So that -- and that, again, is going to be compatible with the Q camera in the same screen. So it's a comprehensive ecosystem that will be launched. And we're already seeding the market with 1/2 of the system with the Q Guidance, and then the second half is really whether you're doing makeover pedicle screw placement or using Q Guidance to do the bone preparation. So those are the 3 pieces of our enabling technology solution, part of which we're already selling today. So every time we're selling Q, which is contributing to our spine growth, it's part of the solution that will then be able to be used both with CoPilot as well as with Mako. So hopefully, that clarifies things for you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. \nDanielle Antalffy: Congrats on a really strong start to the year. I guess, Glenn, this is probably a question for you on that 150 bps target for operating margin expansion. I mean just based -- I know it's early. You guys just [ gave ] this about 6 months ago. So not trying to be too greedy, but 80 bps year-over-year in Q1, it sounds like things are actually only getting better from here as it relates to super cycle of product. Inflation presumably starts to continue to ease, hopefully. So I guess just any comments you can make about that 150 bps target based on what you guys did here in Q1. And that's it for me. \nGlenn Boehnlein: Okay. Yes. First, just so we're clear, the target is 200 basis points over the next 2 years, '24 and '25. And that's what we presented back at Analyst Day back in November. It's also the kind of the guidance we brought out in January. I think if you do the rough math, just based on our guidance, you'll see that we're in the realm of 100 basis points or 100 basis points plus in this first year. .\n And you're correct, 80 basis points is a great start to the year. Seasonally, as we think about how this plays out for this year, we expect sort of second half margin expansion to be stronger than first half just given the seasonality of earnings that we see as the year plays out. No change in sort of our overall approach. If you think about what we did in 2023, you saw margin expansion coming through gross margin. 2024, we think and we expect that we'll see op expenses will lead more of the margin expansion. And then our goals in 2025 will likely be more balanced between gross margin and operating expenses. \n There are lots of programs we have in place. I mean you've seen the results that we've had in price. We also have low-cost greenfield site, strategic in-sourcing. We'll continue to push shared services efficiencies, IT harmonization. And then honestly, if you just look at the natural leverage that we drive when we're growing at the high levels, that also is a piece of this equation. So we're excited about the Q1 performance. We will still continue to be working on it through the remainder of this year and into next year, and we'll update you quarterly as the earnings calls play forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. \nMatthew Taylor: I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Pangea and LIFEPAK as 2 upcoming catalysts and maybe frame any acceleration or pickup we could see from those products. How material could they be? \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Well, I'd say -- if you look at our trauma business, core trauma, so excluding upper extremities and lower extremities, if you look at core trauma, we've been historically the leading nailing company in the marketplace. But we haven't been the leading plating company. Now we have some terrific places, whether it's our clavicle platters, our pelvic products. But we didn't have a comprehensive system of variable angle plating. This is an amazing product launch, very comprehensive and will really be a shot in the arm for plating, which, by the way, is more than half of the procedures in trauma are plating versus nailing. \n And so we are wildly excited about this launch. We already have an incredibly high-performing core trauma business, fabulous leadership in our core trauma. And now we have a fabulous comprehensive plating solution. We've done roughly 40 cases so far. Feedback has been excellent from the surgeons. We -- it will take us time. We have to build out the sets, and these kind of launches take time to sort of fully roll out. But you're going to start to see the impact as early as Q3. We're going to have some procedures obviously done in Q2. It won't be too big of an impact, but it will start to have more of an impact in Q3, Q4 and beyond. \n And as it relates to LIFEPAK, we are bringing in our sales force for a full sort of launch preparation in May, and we'll start to have our first shipments sometime in June. So there won't be much of an impact at all in Q2, but certainly going into Q3, Q4. We did show the product that a recent fire display conference -- firehouses, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. People were 7 and 8 rows deep looking at the product. It is -- we're really getting fantastic feedback. \n And so we're building the product right now and getting ready for a launch. And these kind of launches, because of the price point, you're not going to see probably as big an impact this year as you would see -- you'll see some, obviously. Medical is already performing incredibly well. But you'll see some impact this year, but you're going to see a lot more in the next 2 to 3 years after that. These are long-cycle products. They last a long time, and we know how to replace capital equipment at Stryker, and we're going to be doing that. It's incredibly exciting. The last sort of big defibrillator that we launched was almost 20 years ago. So there is a huge replacement market for this modern and really fully featured product. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord. \nCaitlin Cronin: Congrats on the strong performance this quarter. Just turning to upper extremity, you noted strong performance there. Any changing dynamics with the CMS ruling and ASC's hospital patient earlier this year? And can we also get a refresher on the new products coming in your Shoulder portfolio and the timing of those? \nJason Beach: Caitlin, it's Jason. As we think about upper extremities, this continues to be a fast grower for us. As we think about kind of transition and the opportunity in the ASC, no change from that perspective. And we expect this will continue to be a fast-growing business for us. \nKevin Lobo: Yes. And as it relates to product launches, I think we talked about this on the last call, but we have about 5 products that are either going into full launch that we're in partial launch or are being launched. We have a perform fracture system, which is really exciting, a reverse stemless product. We have the pyrocarbon, which is hemiarthroplasty product. We have the hollow lens, which is -- you can visualize the surgery in the operating room. That was a limited launch last year. That's going to move to full launch. And I think it's the fifth one, Jason, the number? \nJason Beach: Those were the -- those were the big... \nKevin Lobo: Those are the main 4 ones. But there's a fifth one. I can't remember right now. But if you look -- go back to the last call, I think we did highlight all of those products. So this is a business that's been growing roughly 20% every single quarter. That continued. We have a very strong first quarter. And we expect that to continue not seeing any real change in the market dynamics at all where we have tremendous momentum, and we expect that momentum to continue. \nCaitlin Cronin: Great. And then just a question [indiscernible] given it's post close now what the strengths do you really see that bringing to your Hip portfolio going forward? \nKevin Lobo: Yes. Well, firstly, if you look at our business in Europe, it gives us tremendous market share in France. And the dual-mobility, they were the originators of dual-mobility, and they have a terrific portfolio of products not just for France, but certainly, they're well known throughout Europe. And then eventually even some of those products, we'll be looking to bring those to the United States. So it really gives us a shot in the arm in Europe where, as you know, we've historically had lower market shares than other parts of the world. So we're very excited about this product. The feedback so far from surgeons has been excellent. They're very differentiated products that are -- that have a lot of history behind them and are really well received in the marketplace. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist. \nSamuel Brodovsky: This is actually Sam on for Rich. I appreciate the commentary you guys gave earlier on margins being stronger or expansion being stronger in the second half. But just as we think about the 80 basis points of expansion this quarter, is that reasonable to think about as a floor on a quarterly basis this year? Or maybe should we think about a step back in 2Q? \nJason Beach: Sam, it's Jason. I'll take this one, and Glenn can pile on anything additional here. But again, to Glenn's comments, as you think about the margin expansion getting to 100 bps on a full year basis being second half weighted, it certainly would imply that you could have a quarter less than that from a margin expansion standpoint. Certainly, margin expansion in every quarter, but I wouldn't necessarily say it'd be to the levels of what you saw in Q1 every quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Jennings with TD Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: I was hoping to just dig into the 20 bps of pricing pressure experienced by the Orthopaedics and Spine units. Any chance you can help us think more -- provide more details on the pricing headwind experienced by the total joint franchise Knees and Hips? And then at AAOS, it seems like there's -- and still with your guidance that there's optimism that the macro device industry may be in a new kind of era of pricing. Any updated thoughts there? And then just one follow-up. \nGlenn Boehnlein: Sure. I mean if you think about pricing, we do sort of -- there are sort of a tale of 2 cities. On the MedSurg side, we generally are able to gain pricing. There's certainly a premium placed on technology, and we work through contracts that provide bands of pricing that allow us to approach customers. On the ortho side, you're right. Traditionally, it's been a market that has had price declines. \n I would say that as we think about our ortho business 5 years ago or even 6 years ago, we were looking at price declines that were in the 3% to 5% range. And I would say now what we're feeling and based on the contract sort of discipline that we have put in place with customers as well as sort of maybe a little bit of the impact of Mako being a closed system, we're feeling that we see sort of less negative price performance on the ortho side of our business. But we don't necessarily anticipate that ortho will ever get to positive, but we are feeling confident about less negative. \nJoshua Jennings: And maybe just a follow-up. I was hoping you could share your outlook on the knee and hip markets. I think at AOS, our interpretation of some comments from your team and other orthopedic management teams was that we could see a higher level of growth in those markets relative to the pre-pandemic era. Just wanted to follow up. Any updated thoughts there? And also, there's been concerns about just the utilization headwind after a strong second half last year, broadly in the macro devices industry. And any thoughts on whether we should be thinking about a slowdown in utilization or procedure volumes in orthopedics in the second half here this year? \nJason Beach: Josh, it's Jason. I'll take this one. I'd say a couple of different things here. As we think about the market, our view has really not changed at all here. Even if you go back to Investor Day in November of last year, we said the ortho markets would grow, call that mid-single digit area. And we would outperform that 200 to 300 bps above that. So as we think about the full year this year, that's kind of how we're looking at the markets, and we feel as good as ever about that. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Andrew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. \nAndrew Ranieri: Kevin, just 2 for you. Would you mind just talking about the trends you're seeing internationally in Mako? Any plans for geographic expansion in 2024? And really kind of like what utilization levels you're seeing with the Mako system outside the U.S.? And then second, just with the Gauss Surgical product, you touched on that. But can you also give us any more color on where you think you can take the product next within your MedSurg portfolio? \nKevin Lobo: Okay. Great. So firstly, on international, what we're seeing is kind of the same dynamic we saw in the U.S. about 5 or 6 years ago. We are installing a large number of robots, and those tend to be leading indicators. And as you install those, then they start to do the procedures, and you see growth in the implants. So there, where we were 5, 6 years ago, it's really picking up in India, Japan, for sure. Even parts of Europe are picking up. \n We already had strength in the U.K., but we're picking up in other parts of Europe. China is still a bit small but starting to pick up as well. Korea is on fire for us with Mako. We're still a bit sluggish in Latin America. I'd say that's still a big opportunity for us, and there are hospitals that are demanding it. And we have to kind of -- we've made some changes in our own structure to really be able to address that opportunity. \n But overall, it's target rich. It's later in the market cycle than it has been in the U.S. and in Australia. Even Canada is starting to really pick up, and that's a very new dynamic. They were very, very late to the Mako story. And so we're very excited not just with the number of installations. You've seen multiple quarters of international really humming on installations. But that is a gift that will keep on giving. We've seen this in every market where you have large installations. It is a precursor for significant high-growth quarter after quarter. \n So very excited about the international opportunity. And it's still early days in many of these markets. So, so far so good. We're excited in the reception. Frankly, the most important thing is utilization. And so as we make sure these robots are being installed, are they being used at a high rate. And frankly, today, the country with the highest utilization for robot is India, the highest in the world. But it's picking up in other markets as well.\n The second part of your question was on Gauss. So yes, we're really excited about Gauss. Obviously, this was an AI solution that we acquired to quantify hemoglobin for delivery as well as other general surgery procedures, and they had sort of a different kind of interface for the health care worker. We've improved that interface to make it a lot easier to use and combined that with our SurgiCount product -- I'm sorry, the, yes, SurgiCount, so the sponge counting. But this is also -- so measuring the blood in the sponge and the canister but also counting the sponges to make sure those sponges are left in the body. \n There's ideas that we have about how we can connect to this tablet and have other devices tied to the tablet. It's a common tablet being used for both solutions. I'm not ready yet to talk about what that will be. There's a lot of other connectivity discussions going on inside Stryker, particularly with Vocera. At Vocera, obviously, we have the bed now connected to the Vocera badges in that system, and there are a lot of other discussions about what else can we connect with Vocera. It's just a little premature for us to talk to you about what those are. I think I'd rather have those products ready for launch and then talk about it. \n But clearly, we are looking at workflow and bringing better IT solutions for our customers, really looking at that across the portfolio. How can we improve workflow in the hospitals? How can we reduce errors for hospital acquired conditions? Safety and outcomes is a big focus of many of our MedSurg divisions. And I think we're on a really good track. Did I ever think we'd buy an app on an iPhone, which is really what Gauss is? No. But that's the future. And that's going to be our focus. And Vocera, obviously, was a bigger foray into the digital solution world, but don't expect that this will be the end. And I can see within our deal pipeline, HIT is going to feature and don't be surprised if we continue to do both organic innovation as well as acquisitions to bolster our presence within HIT. \nOperator: There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. \nKevin Lobo: Thank you for joining our call. As you can see, 2024 is shaping up to be another strong year for Stryker. We look forward to sharing our Q2 results with you in July. Thank you.",

For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter as well as some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. \n In the first quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 10% with double-digit growth in MedSurg and Neurotechnology and high single-digit growth in Orthopaedics and Spine despite one less selling day and tough comparables from a year ago. This reflects our team's continued strong commercial execution. Our results were led by very strong U.S. performance, notably in Instruments, Medical, Endoscopy, Trauma and Extremities and Mako. Internationally, growth momentum continued against strong double-digit growth organic sales comparables from the first quarter of last year. We expect this growth rate to accelerate for the remainder of the year as international remains a significant opportunity for us.\n We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.50, reflecting 16.8% growth compared to the first quarter of 2023, driven by our strong sales performance and margin expansion. As anticipated, we began to accelerate our M&A activity. We just completed the acquisition of mfPHD, a leading provider of modular stainless steel wall systems. This further enhances our communications business unit portfolio within Endoscopy and helps us meet our customers' needs for turnkey operating room design and construction. At the end of the quarter, we also closed on our acquisition of SERF within our Hip business. Our deal pipeline is strong, and we expect to be active over the course of the year. \n With one quarter behind us, we now expect an increased full year organic sales growth of 8.5% to 9.5%, and we are increasing our adjusted EPS range to $11.85 to $12.05 a share. Coming off organic sales growth of 9.7% in 2022 and 11.5% in 2023, this guidance demonstrates the durability of our high growth and is a testament to our commercial strength and extensive pipeline of innovation across the company. Also, it reinforces our ability to meet our target of 200 basis points of operating margin expansion by 2025. \n Next, I want to thank our teams for their ongoing commitment to talent and culture, which is reflected in the recognition of Stryker for the 14th year in a row as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. Our operating model, talent and culture are true differentiators for us. In addition, we recently published our fourth annual comprehensive report, which captures our commitments and disclosures on corporate responsibility. \n I will now turn the call over to Jason. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Yes, we're really pleased with the performance in the first quarter, and really nothing has changed. So the good level of volumes that we're seeing in procedures that we saw through 2024 has continued into 2025. And our capital order book remains very strong. So capital equipment, whether it's large capital or small capital, remains very robust. We have a nice healthy backlog, and that gives us the confidence to raise our organic sales growth guide for the full year. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Not a major change. I would tell you the Interventional Spine business had a terrific quarter. That was really high growth. Our enabling technologies within Spine, the Q Guidance System has really picked up good momentum as well. The Mako Spine and the CoPilot won't be launched until the fourth quarter. So that's not really having much of an impact. And I wouldn't say that the competitive disruption or the competitive merger is really having much of an impact yet. It's still very early days. So nothing too remarkable, but overall, a good number and a good solid number for our Spine business. Yes. Thanks. I'm a little bit mystified by this concern, to be honest with you. If you attended the Sage's meeting, you could clearly see that we have a very differentiated solution that will frankly enable -- they can grow at whatever rates they're growing with their new product, and we're going to continue to have a very strong performance in endoscopy, both this year and for years to come. The overlap in our businesses is minor. We are multi-specialty. We play -- and most of our procedures, frankly, aren't being done robotically today. We also are the clear leader in fluorescence imaging. \n Just most recently, we had the American Association of Thoracic Surgery, where we partner with CYTALUX, this new fluorophore, to be able to light up lung cancer for lobectomy procedures, which we're the only company that can do that, that can light up that fluorophore. So surgeons are going to demand this for safer surgery, but that doesn't mean that Intuitive can't grow with their robot. We are really playing in spaces with very little overlap, and both of us can continue to have very strong performance for many, many years to come. So to me, this concern is, frankly, mystifying and not at all for me a concern for our Endoscopy division. Yes. Great. So certainly, if you look at our fourth quarter last year, I wouldn't think that, that was -- those were easy comps. We had a pretty monstrous fourth quarter last year. And so comps is probably the biggest concern that we have, and we do pick up an extra selling day in Q3 and extra selling day in Q4. It's only one quarter, right? There's a lot of uncertainties out there in the marketplace. We feel very good about our business. And I think this is an appropriate raise at this time. Let's see how things go at the end of the second quarter, and we can update you further on the outlook for the year. Yes. Certainly, when I talk about those 5 areas, those are adjacencies. So we have our core basically supplementing our existing businesses with new technology. That's always going to be the majority of the deals we do. And beyond that, as we think about adjacencies, those are what I'm calling my sort of top 5 priority adjacencies. And what I'd tell you right now is we have an incredibly healthy pipeline of deals. \n Now of course, pipeline doesn't always get realized, right? There's always a washout rate as you go through these processes. But I'm feeling really excited about the pipeline. They are mostly in the tuck-in variety. And so they're just like the one I mentioned for our communications business or our Hip business. You're going to see most of those occur at least for the next couple of quarters. Beyond that, if we do decide to branch out, those other areas I talked about are still of high interest. Nothing has really changed on that front. Yes. Sure. I can start on the Instruments, and I'll let Jason talk about the other ortho. And you're right, these are bright, shining stars. The Instruments division had a fantastic quarter, and it was really, really across both Surgical Technologies as well as Orthopaedic Instruments. Really across the board. \n And if you look at smoke evacuation, we just continued to have tremendous momentum. Obviously, the market has been growing very robustly. But we have a terrific commercial execution, growing almost 50%, which is really awesome. And that was great growth in the U.S. and also really great growth internationally. And we see that continuing, maybe not at 50%, but we see that very high double-digit growth through the rest of this year and into next year, especially as more states decide to mandate smoke evacuation. So that was really a big push. \n We also have the SurgiCount, plus we've launched a new product that combines the Gauss Surgical quantification of blood loss as well as the sponge counting. So it's all combined into one solution, which is really elegant and really being well received by our customers. So those are probably the 2 biggest catalysts within Surgical Technologies. Neptune waste management continues to roll, but that's not new information. \n And then if you flip over to Orthopaedic Instruments, we have the Steri-Shield doing extremely well. Our power tools, obviously, you know about the new launch that's still, let's call it, just a little -- about 1.5 years in. That's continuing to do very well as well as pulsed lavage and all the other products and just really great commercial execution by the Instruments team. It's really been a flagship division of Stryker, if you go back the last 10-plus years. It delivers very, very consistently, and it did so again in the first quarter. Yes. So certainly, Europe continues to be a growth engine for Stryker. I would tell you in the first quarter, it was a little bit softer than it has been, and that was really because we had a big quarter last year. So really more comp related. I do expect Europe is going to continue to pick up in Q2, Q3, Q4. So the overall run rates are really healthy in Europe. And we -- the U.K. was a bit of a standout in the first quarter, but the other regions are all going to be fine. We had a really big, big sales in Germany and Southern Europe last year and so -- in the first quarter. So to me, it's just a comp issue. I'm not at all concerned about our international. We're going to have another strong year in international. So you talked about Europe. What else did you say, sorry? [ Was it all ] Europe? Yes. Thanks for the question. What I would tell you is we're in this constant rhythm of innovation. And we just had a number of products sort of collide at the same time, but they're constantly being refreshed. So I wouldn't think about this as a fleeting moment. If you think about 9.7% in '22, 11.5% in '23, another potentially double digit, we'll see. We're not guiding to that just yet, but we have a chance certainly to get to another double-digit growth this year, and next year, you're going to have the impact. We're just launching LIFEPAK 35. It's not going to have as much of an impact this year as next year. Pangea not as much impact this year as next year. The Mako applications have really no impact this year. It's really more next year. And then we'll just keep rolling other innovations on top of that. \n So I would just think we were in a rhythm. Assuming the market conditions stay similar, we're in a rhythm where this kind of high growth is what you should come to expect from us with no end in sight as long as we continue to invest as we are, roughly 7% of our growing top line in new product innovation, and we continue to be active with acquisitions because as you know, we acquire high-growth assets. And then after the first year that rolls into organic growth, we had a bit of a pause last year as we're going to refill that tank this year, and that will contribute to organic growth in the years ahead. So I would not look at this as some kind of we reached a peak, and we're starting -- we're going to come down on the other side. Absent some kind of market adjustment, this is -- we're in kind of a new normal, at least for a while. Look, I'd just call it a stable market. It really hasn't changed much, if you think about waiting lists. If you think about staffing, it's continually gotten better over the course of '24. So I would just say it's very stable in terms of the overall market. I don't see shortening at all. I don't see it elongating. It's just as we saw through '24 -- '23, sorry, it's a continuation into '24 of that kind of stable marketplace. \n And the new defibrillator just got approved. So that's not really been a big contributor to our backlog. Our backlog is just a healthy order book of all of our existing products across medical, across even some of the Instruments businesses and Endoscopy. So it really -- there wasn't any kind of new spike, but we've had a healthy backlog. We had it going into '23. We have it going into '24. We continue to get good orders. \n So yes, we're shipping out at a nice rate, but the orders are still coming in at a very healthy rate. So we're really not burning through any kind of meaningful backlog, and that gives us confidence for at least through the rest of this year if -- and as orders continue, and it obviously could potentially spike with some of these new products. That's only going to give us more tailwind for growth. Yes. We've also had our supply chain has really improved in terms of being able to meet the tremendous demand that we've had, and that was also a contributor. So we've had tremendous growth, tremendous demand. And our supply chain has really kicked in, in a strong way, and that puts us in a good position not only to deliver in the first quarter but also to deliver in the quarters ahead. Yes. Look, I don't think I said that. I have to double check the transcript, but I didn't give a precise number of double-digit growth for all that time. What I did say is we are in this high-growth environment based on our innovation cycle, and we're going to continue to have these new products fuel growth. It does depend on the market, right? So if the market stays at this kind of level, could we stay in that kind of double-digit range? Sure, we could. But I -- there's no guarantee that the market will stay this elevated both in terms of procedures as well as the healthy capital environment. \n So it does depend on the market. And obviously, you know we outperformed the market, and you can -- depending on the year, it's 300 basis points or whatever that number is. But we're not going to defy gravity. If the market falls down to a certain level, then obviously, our growth would be similarly impacted. So I don't believe I was that precise with double-digit over 5 years. But I do feel bullish about the ability for us to continue to be a very high-growth business. Yes. Sure. Thanks. Jason, every quarter, we'll talk to you about new products. And we highlighted a couple this quarter with the LIFEPAK 35 and Pangea in our trauma business, both of which are really super exciting products that are going to contribute to growth for at least a few years to come. As it relates to Mako, so the new spine robot will be 2 parts. One part is the actual robot with a different attachment that will enable the pedicle screw guidance. The second part is the Q Guidance trade that's already being sold today. So that is used for first-line procedures. It's a very lightning fast camera. You saw it at NASS. It's being sold today to do navigated spine procedures. So those 2 components will make up the Mako Spine system. \n And then in addition to that, the CoPilot product will be able to do diskectomies and bone preparation with haptic feedback to be able to protect you from getting close to vital structures, spinal cord, et cetera. So that -- and that, again, is going to be compatible with the Q camera in the same screen. So it's a comprehensive ecosystem that will be launched. And we're already seeding the market with 1/2 of the system with the Q Guidance, and then the second half is really whether you're doing makeover pedicle screw placement or using Q Guidance to do the bone preparation. So those are the 3 pieces of our enabling technology solution, part of which we're already selling today. So every time we're selling Q, which is contributing to our spine growth, it's part of the solution that will then be able to be used both with CoPilot as well as with Mako. So hopefully, that clarifies things for you. Yes. Well, I'd say -- if you look at our trauma business, core trauma, so excluding upper extremities and lower extremities, if you look at core trauma, we've been historically the leading nailing company in the marketplace. But we haven't been the leading plating company. Now we have some terrific places, whether it's our clavicle platters, our pelvic products. But we didn't have a comprehensive system of variable angle plating. This is an amazing product launch, very comprehensive and will really be a shot in the arm for plating, which, by the way, is more than half of the procedures in trauma are plating versus nailing. \n And so we are wildly excited about this launch. We already have an incredibly high-performing core trauma business, fabulous leadership in our core trauma. And now we have a fabulous comprehensive plating solution. We've done roughly 40 cases so far. Feedback has been excellent from the surgeons. We -- it will take us time. We have to build out the sets, and these kind of launches take time to sort of fully roll out. But you're going to start to see the impact as early as Q3. We're going to have some procedures obviously done in Q2. It won't be too big of an impact, but it will start to have more of an impact in Q3, Q4 and beyond. \n And as it relates to LIFEPAK, we are bringing in our sales force for a full sort of launch preparation in May, and we'll start to have our first shipments sometime in June. So there won't be much of an impact at all in Q2, but certainly going into Q3, Q4. We did show the product that a recent fire display conference -- firehouses, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. People were 7 and 8 rows deep looking at the product. It is -- we're really getting fantastic feedback. \n And so we're building the product right now and getting ready for a launch. And these kind of launches, because of the price point, you're not going to see probably as big an impact this year as you would see -- you'll see some, obviously. Medical is already performing incredibly well. But you'll see some impact this year, but you're going to see a lot more in the next 2 to 3 years after that. These are long-cycle products. They last a long time, and we know how to replace capital equipment at Stryker, and we're going to be doing that. It's incredibly exciting. The last sort of big defibrillator that we launched was almost 20 years ago. So there is a huge replacement market for this modern and really fully featured product. Yes. And as it relates to product launches, I think we talked about this on the last call, but we have about 5 products that are either going into full launch that we're in partial launch or are being launched. We have a perform fracture system, which is really exciting, a reverse stemless product. We have the pyrocarbon, which is hemiarthroplasty product. We have the hollow lens, which is -- you can visualize the surgery in the operating room. That was a limited launch last year. That's going to move to full launch. And I think it's the fifth one, Jason, the number? Those are the main 4 ones. But there's a fifth one. I can't remember right now. But if you look -- go back to the last call, I think we did highlight all of those products. So this is a business that's been growing roughly 20% every single quarter. That continued. We have a very strong first quarter. And we expect that to continue not seeing any real change in the market dynamics at all where we have tremendous momentum, and we expect that momentum to continue. Yes. Well, firstly, if you look at our business in Europe, it gives us tremendous market share in France. And the dual-mobility, they were the originators of dual-mobility, and they have a terrific portfolio of products not just for France, but certainly, they're well known throughout Europe. And then eventually even some of those products, we'll be looking to bring those to the United States. So it really gives us a shot in the arm in Europe where, as you know, we've historically had lower market shares than other parts of the world. So we're very excited about this product. The feedback so far from surgeons has been excellent. They're very differentiated products that are -- that have a lot of history behind them and are really well received in the marketplace. Okay. Great. So firstly, on international, what we're seeing is kind of the same dynamic we saw in the U.S. about 5 or 6 years ago. We are installing a large number of robots, and those tend to be leading indicators. And as you install those, then they start to do the procedures, and you see growth in the implants. So there, where we were 5, 6 years ago, it's really picking up in India, Japan, for sure. Even parts of Europe are picking up. \n We already had strength in the U.K., but we're picking up in other parts of Europe. China is still a bit small but starting to pick up as well. Korea is on fire for us with Mako. We're still a bit sluggish in Latin America. I'd say that's still a big opportunity for us, and there are hospitals that are demanding it. And we have to kind of -- we've made some changes in our own structure to really be able to address that opportunity. \n But overall, it's target rich. It's later in the market cycle than it has been in the U.S. and in Australia. Even Canada is starting to really pick up, and that's a very new dynamic. They were very, very late to the Mako story. And so we're very excited not just with the number of installations. You've seen multiple quarters of international really humming on installations. But that is a gift that will keep on giving. We've seen this in every market where you have large installations. It is a precursor for significant high-growth quarter after quarter. \n So very excited about the international opportunity. And it's still early days in many of these markets. So, so far so good. We're excited in the reception. Frankly, the most important thing is utilization. And so as we make sure these robots are being installed, are they being used at a high rate. And frankly, today, the country with the highest utilization for robot is India, the highest in the world. But it's picking up in other markets as well.\n The second part of your question was on Gauss. So yes, we're really excited about Gauss. Obviously, this was an AI solution that we acquired to quantify hemoglobin for delivery as well as other general surgery procedures, and they had sort of a different kind of interface for the health care worker. We've improved that interface to make it a lot easier to use and combined that with our SurgiCount product -- I'm sorry, the, yes, SurgiCount, so the sponge counting. But this is also -- so measuring the blood in the sponge and the canister but also counting the sponges to make sure those sponges are left in the body. \n There's ideas that we have about how we can connect to this tablet and have other devices tied to the tablet. It's a common tablet being used for both solutions. I'm not ready yet to talk about what that will be. There's a lot of other connectivity discussions going on inside Stryker, particularly with Vocera. At Vocera, obviously, we have the bed now connected to the Vocera badges in that system, and there are a lot of other discussions about what else can we connect with Vocera. It's just a little premature for us to talk to you about what those are. I think I'd rather have those products ready for launch and then talk about it. \n But clearly, we are looking at workflow and bringing better IT solutions for our customers, really looking at that across the portfolio. How can we improve workflow in the hospitals? How can we reduce errors for hospital acquired conditions? Safety and outcomes is a big focus of many of our MedSurg divisions. And I think we're on a really good track. Did I ever think we'd buy an app on an iPhone, which is really what Gauss is? No. But that's the future. And that's going to be our focus. And Vocera, obviously, was a bigger foray into the digital solution world, but don't expect that this will be the end. And I can see within our deal pipeline, HIT is going to feature and don't be surprised if we continue to do both organic innovation as well as acquisitions to bolster our presence within HIT. Thank you for joining our call. As you can see, 2024 is shaping up to be another strong year for Stryker. We look forward to sharing our Q2 results with you in July. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. \n Our organic sales growth was 10% in the quarter compared to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2023. This quarter, we had one less selling day than 2023. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.7%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, almost all of which again contributed positive pricing for the quarter. \n Foreign currency had a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales in the quarter. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 11.3%. International organic sales growth was 6.6% against a very strong comparable growth of over 16% in 2023. This performance included positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly in the United Kingdom and Canada and most of our emerging markets. \n Our adjusted EPS of $2.50 in the quarter was up 16.8% from 2023, driven by strong sales growth and operating margin expansion. Foreign currency exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of $0.05. \n Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12% and organic sales growth of 11.6%, which included 13.5% of U.S. organic growth and 6% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic growth of 19% with strong double-digit growth across the Orthopaedic Instruments and Surgical Technologies businesses. \n From a product perspective, sales growth was led by almost 50% growth in smoke evacuation and strong performances in power tools, Steri-Shield, waste management and SurgiCount. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.1% with double-digit growth in its communications and Endo BU businesses. And from a product perspective, standout growth included cameras, light sources, insufflators, booms and sports medicine implants.\n Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 16.8%, led by the solid sales performances in all 3 businesses. This included strong growth in stretchers, cots, Vocera and Sage products. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 2.9%, highlighted by solid performances in our hemorrhagic stents and guidewires. Neuro Cranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 7%, driven by strong performance in our CMF business. \n Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 6%, which included strong performances in our emerging markets. Orthopaedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 8%, which included organic growth of 8.3% in the U.S. and 7.4% internationally. \n Our U.S. Hip business grew 6.8% organically against a very strong comparable of 16.2% in the same quarter last year. This growth reflects continued strong primary hip performance fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem. Our U.S. Knee business grew 3.1% organically against another very strong comparable of 20.7% in the first quarter of 2023. Our Knee growth reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures and the continued strength of our installed base. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 10.3% organic with strong performances across our upper extremities, biologics and core trauma businesses. \n Our U.S. Spine business grew 3.9% organically, led by the performance in our Interventional Spine business. Our U.S. other ortho business grew 45.6% organically, driven by strong Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 7.4% organically, including strong performances in Canada and most emerging markets, particularly driven by strong Mako installations. \n Now I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.6% represents approximately 50 basis points favorability against the first quarter of 2023. This improvement reflects positive pricing trends as well as continued easing of certain cost pressures that we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales, which was 30 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2023. Our adjusted SG&A was 35% of sales, which was 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to continued discipline in our spending and investments to support our growth. \n In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 21.9% of sales, which was approximately 80 basis points favorable to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted other income and expense of $49 million for the quarter was $16 million lower than 2023, driven by favorability in interest rates and a higher level of invested cash resulting in higher interest income. \n The first quarter of 2024 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 12.3%, reflecting the impact of our geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2024, we still expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. \n Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $2.4 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of approximately $13 billion. Our total debt includes $600 million of debt that is due to be repaid in May and has been prefunded. \n Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $204 million, reflecting the results of net earnings and normal first quarter seasonal cash outflows. Considering our first quarter results, strong procedural volumes and healthy demand for our capital products, we now expect our full year 2024 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.5% with the pricing impact to be roughly flat. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be moderately unfavorable impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year. EPS will be negatively impacted at the higher end of our previously guided range of $0.05 to $0.10. With our momentum heading into the rest of the year and our commitment to expanding operating margins, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.85 to $12.05. \n And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Yes. Sure. Thanks, Larry. I think if you look at sort of what happened in OI&E and also what happened with our tax rate, obviously, we had some favorability just for this quarter. I think fundamentally, we're still targeting $250 million roughly in OI&E and attach rate that really is still between 14% and 15%. So we're still sort of holding to the below the op margin line sort of guidance that we had built into our initial guidance that we provided back in January. \n I think, honestly, if you look at the raise in terms of how we think about it, the robustness of the top line, obviously, the earnings that we're able to kick off of that. And then lastly, we're just -- we're feeling that we're seeing good momentum and positivity around the programs that we put in place to drive leverage to get back to that 2019 number. And so all of that really combines to really give us the confidence to give us that $0.10 raise from the midpoint in EPS. Sure. Yes. I think in Q1, what you saw was just timing between working capital in Q4 and Q1. And then just sort of seasonally in Q1, we have higher cash outflows that occur. So that's the impact of that. On an overall basis, there's no change to the targets that we discussed back at the analyst meeting in November, and that would be the 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion number. Okay. Yes. First, just so we're clear, the target is 200 basis points over the next 2 years, '24 and '25. And that's what we presented back at Analyst Day back in November. It's also the kind of the guidance we brought out in January. I think if you do the rough math, just based on our guidance, you'll see that we're in the realm of 100 basis points or 100 basis points plus in this first year. .\n And you're correct, 80 basis points is a great start to the year. Seasonally, as we think about how this plays out for this year, we expect sort of second half margin expansion to be stronger than first half just given the seasonality of earnings that we see as the year plays out. No change in sort of our overall approach. If you think about what we did in 2023, you saw margin expansion coming through gross margin. 2024, we think and we expect that we'll see op expenses will lead more of the margin expansion. And then our goals in 2025 will likely be more balanced between gross margin and operating expenses. \n There are lots of programs we have in place. I mean you've seen the results that we've had in price. We also have low-cost greenfield site, strategic in-sourcing. We'll continue to push shared services efficiencies, IT harmonization. And then honestly, if you just look at the natural leverage that we drive when we're growing at the high levels, that also is a piece of this equation. So we're excited about the Q1 performance. We will still continue to be working on it through the remainder of this year and into next year, and we'll update you quarterly as the earnings calls play forward. Sure. I mean if you think about pricing, we do sort of -- there are sort of a tale of 2 cities. On the MedSurg side, we generally are able to gain pricing. There's certainly a premium placed on technology, and we work through contracts that provide bands of pricing that allow us to approach customers. On the ortho side, you're right. Traditionally, it's been a market that has had price declines. \n I would say that as we think about our ortho business 5 years ago or even 6 years ago, we were looking at price declines that were in the 3% to 5% range. And I would say now what we're feeling and based on the contract sort of discipline that we have put in place with customers as well as sort of maybe a little bit of the impact of Mako being a closed system, we're feeling that we see sort of less negative price performance on the ortho side of our business. But we don't necessarily anticipate that ortho will ever get to positive, but we are feeling confident about less negative."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, capital demand and select product highlights. \n Procedural volumes remained strong in the first quarter, in line with our expectations, driven by continued adoption in robotic-assisted surgery, demographics, a stable pricing environment and healthy patient activity with surgeons. And while pockets of supply constraints remain, our supply continues to be stable overall. Demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter with continued elevated backlog across our Endoscopy and Medical divisions. \n Our Mako direct-to-patient campaign continues to perform well, which contributed to our very strong Mako growth with record first quarter installations in both the U.S. and internationally. This will continue to drive our Hips and Knees businesses. In April, we performed our first cases using the Pangea plating system in our Trauma and Extremities division and are gearing up for a full launch. Pangea is the largest launch in trauma's history as it offers a comprehensive system that will enable larger hospital conversions. \n Next, we received approval from the FDA for our new LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator and monitor. This is a flagship product within our emergency care business unit and was one of the catalysts for our acquisition of Physio-Control. LIFEPAK 35 is a modern platform with a touchscreen interface that brings advanced connected capabilities to improve workflow. We will launch this product at the end of Q2, and it will have a multiyear benefit to our Medical division.\n Lastly, Mako, Spine and CoPilot are pacing to launch in Q4, followed by the shoulder application at the end of the year. We continue to receive positive feedback from surgeons who have been exposed to these technologies. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Yes. Joanne, it's Jason. I'll take the other ortho here. So just a couple of additional comments, I guess, to my prepared remarks would be, like I said, we had a record quarter of installation in the first quarter this year. If you remember, we had a record quarter in the fourth quarter of last year. So the momentum is going really well on the Mako front. I commented on the direct-to-patient campaign. We've seen really good results out of that. So we feel good about it, and we like what this will translate in terms of the Hips and Knees business as we move forward as well. Yes. Pito, I guess what I would say here, as we look at the overall capital environment, and you can see in our results in the first quarter in our capital business is very strong. So we see opportunities here across the board. I think we mentioned that our backlog continues to be elevated here. So we expect strong capital as we go throughout the year. Shagun, it's Jason. Just -- I'll go back to my prepared remarks, right? As we think about Mako Spine and CoPilot, we're looking at a Q4 launch there. And for Mako shoulder, it will be the end of this year from a launch standpoint. Travis, it's Jason. I mean for competitive reasons, we won't necessarily disclose the number in terms of the amount going into competitive accounts. But I will say that number is big for us and continues to be a winner for us in terms of going into competitive accounts. Yes, Travis, it's Jason. I'd say a couple of different things here. The smoke evac business has continued to be, I think, high teens, 20% grower. In smoke-free states, it's higher than that and similar to kind of what we said today in the prepared remarks. So it's been a great tailwind for us, and we think it will be into the future. Matt, it's Jason. I mean keep in mind, right, from a regulatory standpoint, there's time lines as it relates to the FDA that can shift things by week, sometimes a couple of months. We've always been targeting a back half launch here. So I wouldn't consider this as a significant change in the time line. As you think about the guidance that we have for this year, there was certainly nothing assumed in terms of our guide relative to the spine or shoulder launch. So no impact there as we think about that. Caitlin, it's Jason. As we think about upper extremities, this continues to be a fast grower for us. As we think about kind of transition and the opportunity in the ASC, no change from that perspective. And we expect this will continue to be a fast-growing business for us. Those were the -- those were the big... Sam, it's Jason. I'll take this one, and Glenn can pile on anything additional here. But again, to Glenn's comments, as you think about the margin expansion getting to 100 bps on a full year basis being second half weighted, it certainly would imply that you could have a quarter less than that from a margin expansion standpoint. Certainly, margin expansion in every quarter, but I wouldn't necessarily say it'd be to the levels of what you saw in Q1 every quarter. Josh, it's Jason. I'll take this one. I'd say a couple of different things here. As we think about the market, our view has really not changed at all here. Even if you go back to Investor Day in November of last year, we said the ortho markets would grow, call that mid-single digit area. And we would outperform that 200 to 300 bps above that. So as we think about the full year this year, that's kind of how we're looking at the markets, and we feel as good as ever about that."
