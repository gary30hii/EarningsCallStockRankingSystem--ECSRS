[Operator Instructions] I would like now to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning. Thank you all for joining us as we discuss the Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results for Roper Technologies. We hope everyone is doing well. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O\u2019Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today\u2019s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to slide two. We begin with our safe-harbor statement. During the course of today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today\u2019s call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to slide three. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter and year, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of the following items, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue and related commission expense, and lastly transaction related expenses for completed acquisitions. And now, if you please turn to slide four, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Zack. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and we hope everyone is doing well. For today's agenda, we'll walk through our 2020 financials and operational highlights, then we'll turn to our 2020 segment detailed results and discuss our 2021 segment-by-segment outlook and end with our 2021 enterprise guidance prior to discussing your questions. Next slide, please. As we look back on 2020, it was quite a year. Our businesses performed at a very high level during this period. Revenues grew 3% with organic revenue declining a single percent. EBITDA also grew 3%, and free cash flow grew 16%. This cash flow performance, $1.7 billion is just astounding. This is a testament to many things, notably our asset light business model, the intimacy we have with our customers and the high level of skill and execution of our field teams. This cash flow is just simply a great result. Perhaps more important, 2020 was a year of forward progress for our company. We exit 2020 as a better company, a company with higher quality revenue streams, a company with improved future innovation prospects and a company with whose portfolio was enhanced with $6 billion of capital deployment. To this end, we saw our software recurring revenues increase mid single digits in 2020 and were benefited by high levels of retention and acceleration to the cloud. We continue to be benefited by having close intimate relationships with our customers. Most often, our software is mission-critical to our customer\u2019s operations. In addition, we continue to strategically invest throughout our portfolio during the year. Based on our historical experience, we find times of market disruption the best time to double down on innovation and market investments, which in turn will drive market share gains in the years to come.  Finally, we were able to deploy $6 billion to further enhance Roper's Group of companies' headlines by our Vertafore acquisition. So when we look back on 2020, we highlight two key themes. First, we grew. Cash flow increased 16% in the middle of a pandemic, and second, the quality of our enterprise continued to improve during the year. Net-net, we got bigger and better during 2020. Let's turn to the next slide. Over the past 5 years, we highlight that our revenue grew at a 9% compounded rate, EBITDA at 10% and cash flow at 13%. We continue to grow and compound through macroeconomic cycles. Also, during the time period, the quality of our enterprise meaningfully improved. We are more software-focused with nearly two thirds of our EBITDA coming from software with higher levels of recurring revenue. Conversely, we are much less tied to cyclical end markets today, a little over 15% of our portfolio. Given our long-term strategy and these factors, we are a low-risk enterprise. We compound cash flow through cycle and do so with multiple growth drivers across both organic and inorganic fronts. As we look to '21, we will continue our long-term string of revenue and EBITDA and cash flow compounding. So with that, let's turn to the next page and discuss the macro backdrop for '21. As we look to 2021, we are set up for a strong year. We expect revenue and EBITDA will grow well into the double-digits, likely in the mid-teens range with organic revenue growth in the mid single digit plus range. This is on top of growth in 2020, the compounding continues. Breaking it down, our software businesses both in our application software and network segments are well-positioned heading into '21. These businesses enter the year with momentum from strong retention and recurring revenue gains. They will be further aided by growth in perpetual license, as pipeline and customer activity are anticipated to recover to some extent. Our non-Verathon medical product businesses are expected to return to a more normalized pattern of customer activity, as health care facilities loosen restrictions. But since 2020 was while below trend, we expect above trend growth here. Of note, Verathon has a challenging comp. However, the reoccurring revenue base will remain strong given the large volume of capital placements in 2020 and continued growth of their new single-use Bronchoscope business. We expect Neptune to recover and grow nicely as our customers, especially in the Northeast, US and Canada, gain access to residential locations. We expect our Industrial and Process Tech businesses to continue their quarterly improvements and return to growth after 2 years of macro headwinds. Finally, 2021 will be meaningfully aided by the contribution from our 2020 cohort of acquisitions. To this end, we continue to work with a very full and high-quality M&A pipeline. We are committed to deleveraging, but we also remain active in building and maturing our pipe. So as I think back over the nearly 10 years I've been with Roper, I cannot think of a better set of tailwinds heading into a year. Clearly, lot to do and lots of execution in front of us, but we have a strong momentum heading into 2021. So now let me turn the call over to Rob. Rob?\nRob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to page eight, while looking at our Q4 income statement performance. Total revenue increased 8%, as we eclipsed $1.5 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 2% versus prior year. EBITDA grew 7% in the quarter to a record $552 million. EBITDA margin was down 40 basis points versus prior year at 36.6%. Tax rate came in at 19.9%, a little lower than last year's 21.6%. So all-in, this resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.56 which is above our guidance range. Next slide. Turning to page nine, reviewing the Q4 results by segment. Neil will discuss the full year 2020 segment performance in more detail later, so just touching on some of the Q4 highlights here by segment. Application Software grew 35% with the addition of Vertafore. Organic for the segment was minus 2% with mid single digit recurring revenue growth continuing. Sharp declines in our CBORD & Horizon businesses, serving K-12 and higher education impacted the segment, as many schools unfortunately remain closed. For network software systems, plus 2% organic growth with our Software businesses, putting up a very solid plus 4% organic. The TransCore was flat versus prior year. For Measurement & Analytical Solutions, plus 1% organic growth, as we start to see some sequential recovery at Neptune in our Industrial businesses. Segment margins were impacted a bit by the acceleration of some product and channel investments at Verathon as we discussed coming into the quarter, and it's really been a conceptual [ph] year for Verathon overall. Lastly, for Process Technologies, a 21% organic decline, with margins holding up well at 31.3%. And once again here, we started to see some early signs of improvement after a couple of years of declines. Next slide. So turning to page 10, looking at net working capital. Honestly, the slide mostly speaks for itself, ending the quarter with negative 8% net working capital as a percentage of Q4 annualized revenue. While there are certainly some seasonal trends, primarily around timing of software renewals, they do typically benefit our Q4 performance. You can see here a meaningful improvement versus 2018, improving from negative 3.4% to negative 8% in 2020. Our asset-light negative net working capital model drives our sustainable, high cash conversion and fuels our cash flow compounding. Our people focus on what we all believe matters and our culture is built around growing the right way. Topline growth converts to cash flow, and we are always mindful of impacts to our balance sheet. Next slide. So turning to cash flow, cash flow performance, as Neil mentioned was really pretty spectacular, no matter how you look at it. Q4 free cash flow of $558 million was 23% higher than last year and represented 37% of revenue. This excellent result was driven by the great working capital performance I just discussed, which is really across the enterprise, along with meaningful cash contributions from Vertafore and the other recent acquisitions. So for the full year of 2020, we generated $1.72 billion of operating cash flow and $1.67 billion of free cash flow. So to repeat, that's $1.7 billion of free cash flow in 2020, truly a great year. Full year free cash flow growth was 16%, and our free cash flow conversion from EBITDA was a robust 84%. So really tremendous cash flow performance, and it was broad-based and very durable. Next slide. So turning to page 12, updating on our balance sheet. As Neil mentioned earlier, we ended the year with total capital deployment of approximately $6 billion, which included the EPSi acquisition that closed during the fourth quarter on October 15. We were able to take advantage of attractive market conditions to complete and opportunistically fund these acquisitions with a combination of internally generated cash flow, proceeds from our 2019 Gatan divestiture and investment-grade leverage. Overall cost of financing was approximately 1%. Thanks to our excellent Q4 cash performance, we're off to a great start on our plan to quickly reduce leverage, paying down around $500 million since we closed the EPSi deal. Looking ahead, we plan to rapidly reduce leverage throughout 2021, taking advantage of our prepayable revolver, which has a current balance of approximately $1.6 billion. Our solid investment-grade balance sheet supports long-term cash flow compounding, which we are well-positioned to continue. So with that, I'll pass it back over to Neil for the remainder of our prepared remarks.\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to our recap for 2020. To help orient you to this page, we're comparing a full year outlook from last April to that of what actually happened. It's worth reminding everyone that we felt our businesses and our business model had the level of recurring revenue, customer intimacy and the business leadership required to guide in the face of the COVID uncertainty, both in terms of supply and demand. In aggregate, we thought our full year organic revenues to be plus or minus flat, and we came in at down minus 1%. The TransCore New York project is the primary reconciling item between being down a touch and being flat or slightly up, and more on this in a minute. We guided DEPS to be between $11.60 and $12.60 and came in at $12.74. Looking back on this, we are very proud of our team's ability to look forward and operate through the uncertainty of last year. Also, there is no better example of the durability of our model than this past year. With that, let's walk through the macro drivers across each of our four segments. Relative to Application Software, this segment played out as anticipated and was up 1% on an organic basis for the year. Specifically, we saw recurring revenue up mid single digits, aided by very strong retention rates, as well as an acceleration to the cloud. As a reminder, recurring revenue in this segment is about 70% of our revenue stream. Perpetual revenues, about 10% of this segment's revenue were under pressure as expected. We saw this revenue stream down mid teens as new logo opportunities and wins were pushed and delayed. That said, cross-selling activity remained active for much of 2020. Relative to services revenue, we anticipated some pressure tied to shifting to remote installs and having fewer new implementations, which are tied to new perpetual transactions. For 2020, we saw mid single digit declines here, principally tied to fewer new deals. Our teams did a wonderful job shifting to remote installs, a trend we anticipate will continue in large part on the backside of the pandemic. As it relates to our Network segment, we expect the organic revenue for the year to be up mid singles to double-digits when, in fact, we grew 3% for the full year. Our Network Software businesses performed as anticipated with recurring revenues growing low single digits, again, benefited by high retention rates and high levels of recurring revenue. This segment underperformed our expectations, primarily due to TransCore's New York congestion infrastructure project timing. In April, we expected approximately $75 million more in revenue from this project than actually occurred in 2020. More on this when we turn to the segment overview, but we expect this $75 million of pushed revenue to be recognized in 2021. It's also worth noting that the number of Toll Tags Shipped last year were at historic lows given the lower traffic volumes, but this was anticipated. For our MAS segment, we've talked all year about this being the tale of four situations, Verathon, Other Medical Products, Neptune and Industrial. For the year, again, back in April, we felt this group would be flat to up mid single digits on an organic basis. We posted 1% growth. We feel very good about the execution across this group of companies. The primary reconciliation factor is a slower recovery ramp tied to our non-Verathon Medical product businesses and Neptune. Specifically, we anticipated unprecedented demand for Verathon's innovation product family. For the year, Verathon grew substantially, as COVID accelerated the further adoption of video intubation as the preferred technology. Our other medical product businesses, which grow mid-single digits like clockwork, were down mid single digits for the year, tied directly to lower elective procedure volumes and limited hospital capital spending. Interestingly for Neptune, we highlighted municipal budget uncertainty in April. This proved generally to be a non-factor, as municipalities budgets were approved and available. However, the impact of the lockdowns, especially in the Northeast, US and Canada, had a prolonged impact on our customer\u2019s ability to do routine meter replacements. As a result, Neptune was down low double-digits for the year, slightly worse than our initial expectations. Finally, for this segment, we expected sharp industrial declines, and that is what happens, with these businesses being down low double-digits for the year. That said, we are seeing sequential quarterly improvements across both Neptune and our Industrial businesses. Finally, and as it relates to our Process Tech Segment, we expect it to be down 20% to 25%, and we were logging in at down 21%. This played out as we anticipated with much lower energy-related spending, project timing pushes and the inability to get field service resources into customer locations. So this is the play-by-play rewind for 2020. Now let's turn to the segment pages for a bit more detail. Next slide, please. For Application Software, where revenues here were $1.81 billion, up 1% organically with EBITDA of $772 million. The broad macro activity for this segment has remained quite consistent for much of 2020. Specifically, we continue to see accelerating demand for our cloud solutions. This bodes well for our long-term recurring revenue growth and customer intimacy. At a business unit level, Deltek's GovCon business continues to be super solid and grow very nicely. But we did see some headwinds relative to their offerings that target the consulting, marketing services and AEC space. That said, recent customer activity and top-of-funnel activity suggest some market falling is occurring. Aderant and PowerPlan delivered flat EBITDA in the year with nice recurring revenue gains. We experienced very nice growth across our Lab Software group, again doing our part to help fight the COVID war. Strata delivered double-digit organic growth and completed a strategic acquisition in EPSi. Notably, the combined business will analyze roughly half of the US hospital spend. Finally, our two businesses that serve the education space, CBORD & Horizon, declined double digits in the year, simply due to having a customer base that was shutdown. A decent amount of revenues in these businesses are tied to student volumes. Importantly, we acquired Vertafore last year. They're off to a great start with strong earnings and very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. Looking to Q1, we see flat to low single digit organic growth based on continued mid single digit recurring revenue growth, offset slightly by lower perpetual and services revenues given last year's non-COVID comp. Now let's turn to our Network segment. Here, revenues were $1.74 billion, up 3% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $732 million. Our Network Software businesses performed well during last year, growing low single digits. Specifically, DAT was strong, growing double digits. DAT's network scale and innovation focus continues to enable very solid organic gains. ConstructConnect grew based on network utilization, tied to a tighter construction labor market. iTrade, MHA and Foundry had some headwinds tied to their end markets being disrupted due to COVID. That said, each of these businesses had high retention rates and the networks remain very strong. iPipeline also performed well during their first year being with Roper and completed two bolt-on acquisitions. Our non-software businesses struggled a bit during the year. Specifically, our rf IDEAS, are multi-protocol prudential [ph] reader business, did well in their health care applications, but was hampered by meaningful declines in their secure print market. For the full year, TransCore pushed about $100 million of revenue out of 2020 into 2021 associated with our New York project. In addition, EBITDA margins were pressured due to lower tag shipments and a few non-New York project push-outs. As we look to the first quarter of 2021, we see organic revenue, as you can see in the lower right-hand box, to be down 3% to 5% for the quarter. An important distinction to highlight, our software businesses will continue to grow in the low single digit range. But our non-software businesses, driven by TransCore will decline in the high-teens range in the first quarter due to much lower anticipated tag shipments and timing of revenue associated with the New York projects. As a reminder, the first quarter of this year is coming off a mid-teens growth comp from a year ago. Now let's turn to our MAS segment. Revenues for the year were $1.47 billion, up 1% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $508 million. Verathon was awesome in 2020. The business grew substantially based on unprecedented demand for their video intubation product line. Demand was global. Given Verathon's ability to fulfill this demand, we expect our meaningfully expanded installed base of GlideScope\u2019s to generate increased levels of reoccurring consumables pull-through in the years to come. In addition, the first year of their Single-Use Bronchoscope release was successful. We believe we gained a substantial foothold in the market during the inaugural year of this product category. Our other med product businesses declined, but they started to see more normalized patient volumes towards the end of the year. Further, customer interactions are starting to resemble more normal levels in engagement. Neptune declined low double-digits tied exclusively to our customers in the Northeastern, US and Canada not having access to indoor meters. Other regions were flat during 2020. Neptune's market share remains strong throughout the year. Finally, our Industrial businesses were down, but have shown sequential improvements throughout the year. For Q1, we expect low single-digit organic growth for this segment with similar patterns to that of the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. Revenues for the year were $519 million, down 21% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $156 million or 30% of revenue. Compared versus 2 years ago, these businesses are down about $90 million in EBITDA and yet maintained 30% EBITDA margins. Congrats and thanks to our leadership team for their continued exceptional execution. As a side note, Roper continued to compound despite these cyclical headwinds. That said, this segment is pretty straightforward and has been the same story all year. COVID has negatively impacted our oil and gas and short-cycle businesses. Certainly, lower oil prices did not help either. That said, we have seen some green shoots across the group, as capital spending started to improve as we exited 2020. As we look to the first quarter, we expect declines to moderate in the first quarter to be in the 10% range. Importantly, we have easing comps as we enter the second quarter. Also, over the last couple of years, these businesses continue to make product and channel investments to be best positioned to fully capture this cyclical upswing. The next few years here should be pretty good. Now let's turn to our guidance and the associated framework. While this slide is somewhat busy, we wanted to line-up for you the key macro differences between our 2021 full year outlook on a segment basis versus our actual 2020 results. In aggregate, we expect total revenue to increase in the mid teens range with organic growth being in the mid single digit-plus area.  As we look across the revenue streams for our Application & Software segment, we expect mid singles growth. Specifically, we expect a slightly improved recurring revenue growth rate, aided by last year's recurring momentum and an increased mix towards SaaS. We expect flat services revenues and mid single digit plus growth in Perpetual as we expect a modest market recovery and easing second half comps. Similarly, we expect mid single digit organic growth in our Network segment with our Network Software businesses growing mid single digit plus. We expect TransCore to complete the New York project and see recovering Tag sales. When combined, TransCore should grow mid singles for the year. We expect MAS to grow mid single digits as well. Our Medical Product businesses were exceptional last year, up 20%. Importantly, the quality of our medical products revenue stream will continue to improve as Verathon's reoccurring revenue streams tied to GlideScope and BFlex continue to gain momentum.  As we look to 2021, our Medical Product businesses are expected to grow low single digits, as elective procedures and hospital capital spending returned to more normalized levels throughout 2021, this return being partially offset by our difficult 2020 COVID comp. Neptune should be up high single digits plus with easing restrictions and more access to indoor meter replacements. And finally, our Industrial businesses should recover and grow in the high single digit plus range after 2 years of declines. Our PT businesses are expected to be up high single digits through the year based on the resumption of deferred projects and field maintenance, as well as modest improvements in these end markets. So all in all, we expect organic revenues to increase mid single digits plus and total revenue to grow in the mid teens range. Let's turn to our guidance slide. Based on what we just outlined, when you roll everything together, we're establishing our 2021 full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $14.35 and $14.75. Our tax rate should be in the 21% to 22% range. For the first quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.26 and $3.32. Of note, our guided Q1 adjusted DEPS is roughly 22% to 23% of our full year guidance range and is consistent with our long-term historical DEPS seasonality. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. What a year. None of us will ever forget 2020. Our business performed so very well last year. We grew revenue 3% in aggregate and only declined a single percent on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were steady at 35.8%, and cash flow grew 16% to $1.7 billion. This means, we had cash flow margins of 30%, just amazing. Given this performance, our business model's ability to foresee this performance, we stayed focused on executing our capital deployment strategy, which resulted in $6 billion of deployment on high-quality, niche-leading, vertical software companies. There is no doubt the quality of our enterprise improved during 2020, something we're incredibly proud to be able to say. Our recurring revenue grew mid-single digits. We increased innovation investments and increased the quality of our portfolio with our capital deployment spend. So as we look to 2021, we feel we are incredibly well-positioned. We expect strong organic growth that will be further augmented by contributions from our recent acquisitions. In 2021, we expect about two-thirds of our EBITDA to come from our Software businesses, which provides us all the virtues of an increased mix towards recurring revenues. We will continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet, but we remain committed and focused on our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M& A candidates is active, robust and has many high quality opportunities. So as we look back over 2020, we are proud of our business model's durability and our leaders' ability to successfully navigate last year's uncertainties. We are proud that we continue to be forward-leaning and strategic. We are proud that we improved our business last year with an increasing mix of growing recurring revenue and continued innovation focus. In short, we got bigger and better during 2020. As we turn to your questions, I'll remind everyone that at Roper, we operate a low-risk model whose strategy centers on acquiring fantastic businesses and then providing them with an environment where they can get even better over the long arc of time. This was certainly the case in 2020. So with that, let's turn to our first question.\nOperator: We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, good morning, Deane.\nRob Crisci: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, I really appreciate all the new disclosures you're providing here, especially pages 14 and 20. Those bridges between your original guidance, what you delivered and then the organic bridge on 20 is really helpful, a lot of granularity there. And if we were to start, just because the New York City contract is such a high profile and it did have a swing factor, can you give us a sense of how much - just remind us the revenue you're expecting for the year, how much of it could land in the first quarter? And just confirm there's been no change in scope?\nRob Crisci: Yeah. So - hey, Deane, good morning. It's about $100 million for the full year. And in the first quarter, we only have about $10 million to $15 million in there. As we mentioned, there's a bit of a pause, but now it's started up and running again, and the scope is unchanged.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And if you were to highlight all the areas where you're seeing improvement in licenses and the services pipeline, what's at the high end in terms of the businesses today?\nNeil Hunn: Deane, maybe I can ask you to sort of rephrase the question. I want to make sure that we fully understand the question.\nDeane Dray: Yeah. Just in terms of the licenses revenues that you're seeing today, you've taken us through where some of the challenges have been. What's on the upper-end of your guidance where you would see potentially the - how it would play out on the positive side?\nNeil Hunn: Sure. Okay. So I appreciate the question. I think we understand it now. So the total perpetual revenue for our core businesses, the Software businesses that have been in the portfolio for a while was down obviously, in 2020. We expect about - the recovery in \u201821 to be about half of what we are down. We're seeing strength, you know, we've seen continued strength all year in the perpetual - in 2020 in the perpetual book of business, in Deltek's GovCon business. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, we're seeing - showing [ph] in some activity in their professional services end markets that's encouraging. These are the architects, the engineers, the contractors, the marketing services firms, the consulting firms, those - that book of business. In addition, the other large parts of the perpetual book are at Aderant and PowerPlan. Aderant has its own unique set of competitive factors where the customers have to \u2013 the customers that have not upgraded their software from - the competitive customers have not upgraded the software have to upgrade, and we're winning a large percentage of those. And so all that activity just got pushed to the right a bit, and that's somewhat encouraging and pipeline activity is positive there. And then PowerPlan's pipeline activity is full. It has a handful of large opportunities in it, which are obviously hard to predict the exact timing. But we actually like the pipeline build across, the companies that have the primary book of perpetual business.\nDeane Dray: Okay. That's helpful. And just as my follow-up question would be for Rob. Do you have specific deleveraging plans for the year that you could share with us in terms of where and how? You said you'd be paying down the revolver, but just are there specific goals that you can share for 2021?\nRob Crisci: Sure. So it will be, as you know, when we're in deleveraging mode, all the free cash flow goes towards deleveraging. So we pay a dividend. That will continue. But essentially, the rest of the free cash flow goes towards deleveraging. So that's a rough - probably after you paying a dividend, roughly $1.5 billion in deleveraging is probably a good ballpark number.\nOperator: Next question comes from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Yeah. Thanks, good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nChristopher Glynn: So congrats on all the capital allocation last year. I am just curious, you're getting a lot of inbounds after some of your sub-segment divisions. Given you had some real emphasis on quality and fullness of the pipeline, there's certainly liquidity in the markets. So wondering if your calculus has shifted towards any non-operating cash flow to fund the deleverage and trade back into the pipeline a little sooner?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. I appreciate the question. We - it's very routine for us to get inbounds. I've been here almost 10 years. And there's a handful of, what I would say, meaningful and credible inbounds in any given year. Like we said for years, though, it's just very difficult to make the math work because when we sell a business, just look back at Gatan, you sell a business to a strategic buyer, we leak taxes, then you have to redeploy it, it's just hard with a compounding orientation to make that math work. Certainly, the lower tax rate sort of helped in the Gatan timing. So yes, we get inbounds. I would not say the activity in the last few quarters has ramped up more than it's been over the decade I've been here. But yeah, there's always inbound inquiry.\nChristopher Glynn: Any appetite to entertain that was the other part of that question.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. I think it's the appetite. We've never not had the appetite. It just comes down to the math and doing what's best in our view, according to our math for our shareholders. So it's - the appetite has \u2013 that remained unchanged.\nChristopher Glynn: Understood. Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: The free cash was pretty strong in the fourth quarter, like almost 95% of EBITDA. Last couple of fourth quarters, it's been around 80%. What was the kind of overdrive there? And then when it comes to cash and EBITDA, how much did roughly did Vertafore add?\nRob Crisci: Vertafore was around 90% or so of both cash and EBITDA. And yeah, as I mentioned earlier, Steve, just great working capital performance across the portfolio, very broad-based. You're getting your software renewals, which were very strong in the fourth quarter. There is certainly is some benefit, right from those more cyclical businesses being a little bit softer, right? And that lowers working capital overall. But just great working capital performance. Our cash taxes year-over-year were about flat. So it really was all on working capital.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then within the guidance, I guess, you didn't really quite - you don't usually guide for free cash flow for next year. I think you said $1.5 billion. Is that - is the $1.5 billion after the dividend? And then does that include any of the tax benefit that you guys bought with Vertafore, the benefit of that?\nRob Crisci: Yeah. So the $1.5 billion is deleveraging number, so that's an estimate. That's after paying dividends. So for next year, yeah, you're right, we don't guide free cash flow. We always have very strong conversion. As you know, we expect that very high conversion to continue. As I mentioned, those working capital trends are very stainable, right? It's the culture. It's the type of businesses we buy. As the software businesses grow, their working capital continues to go down, so that all should continue.  In terms of the tax attributes, yes, there are some tax attributes related to Vertafore, which we disclosed, a little over $100 million. So there'll be some benefit from that coming in '21. There's also, like many other multi-industry and really all companies, right, we benefited some from deferral of payroll taxes. So that I'll go back the other way next year as you're starting to pay those payroll taxes again. So those are sort of \u2013 the business sort of counter [ph] each other a little bit. But we feel great about cash flow next year. But we don't guide as you know. Operator Next question comes from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, guys. Good morning. \nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Allison.\nRob Crisci: Good morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: Just want to talk to you, obviously, the theme of reopening seems pretty pervasive in a number of your businesses. Could you help me understand maybe the progression of some of those businesses that you're thinking about if we, in fact, we do start to reopen here? Is it sort of an outsized bump, as things start to get back to work? Or is it more of a progression out of that, any thoughts?\nNeil Hunn: Well, I'll give you the \u2013 it\u2019s Neil. I'll give you the headline, and I'll let Rob sort of add his color on the back end. So it's not like a step function bump-up. It is a sort of sequential improvement throughout the year. Obviously, when you roll past Q1, the comps get a whole lot easier. So that's part of what the last three quarters of the year will look like as well. When you look at it on a company by - sorry segment-by-segment basis, just rolling through, basically, it's the perpetual book of business and the associated services that come with that for Application Software that ramps back up. In Network, they're really - for the Network businesses, it's a little bit of ramp back at foundry. It's a little bit of ramp back at iTrade. But the other businesses were pretty steady as she goes, DAT, ConstructConnect, et cetera. TransCore stands by itself. It's tied principally to two things, one is the New York project completing, and second, the return of traffic volumes and the associated tags that go with them. For the MAS segment, it's Neptune just sequentially coming back and importantly, getting the access to the indoor meters in Northeast, US and Canada. I said in the prepared remarks, market share was super steady, maybe plus a little bit in that business last year. It's just access - our customers getting access to do retain replacements. Verathon will have a difficult headwind because of the capital place we talked about. But the other Medical Product businesses just rotate up in a sequential basis. And then finally, the Industrial businesses do the same. Process is much like Industrial, just a cyclical rebound, modestly higher oil prices helped. But you have all this in the energy businesses, you have all this deferred maintenance that's got to get done. There's a lot of - there's sort of - there were some restocking orders in the fourth quarter there and then some pipeline activity like we got to get in and do the maintenance in a handful of these important customers. So that would be sort of the color of the ramp, but no step function. But Rob, what would you add if anything?\nRob Crisci: No, I think that's right. We're assuming Q1 is very much clearly still in the middle of pandemic and then things improve from there.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then in line with that, obviously, we've been under this closure for a significant amount of time. Any concerns of the financial impact of some of your existing customers that you would anticipate that ramp from or not at this point?\nNeil Hunn: I would say no. And I think the \u2013 I mean, obviously, there's going to be small pockets here and there. We're very \u2013 most of our customers across the portfolio, most are enterprise level. A very small percentage of our software companies would be in the small, medium size where it may be more subject to some sort of macro sort of headwinds or business uncertainty. I think the data point we point to is just the incredible cash flow. I mean, we got paid by our customers, right, and so last year. And so what we do is just critical to what they do. And no, I don't think there's going to be down\u2026\nRob Crisci: Yeah. The pockets of areas that are hit as we talked about, right colleges and universities, most of those customers we tend to have larger customers there. So we're not too worried about our schools being in financial trouble overall. And then on like the iTrade network side, they have customers that are in the food area. So there certainly could be an impact from some smaller restaurants and some of those issues in that market. But overall, not really a meaningful impact meaningful impact to us.\nOperator: Next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Joe.\nRob Crisci: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: I'm in the market to refinance my mortgage at 1% blended, so can you guys help me out with the\u2026\nNeil Hunn: I have a guy in Florida, I never run through [ph] We will count that as the first question, by the way.\nJoe Giordano: And then on the net working capital, obviously, that keeps getting more and more negative and more interesting. But with the current portfolio, where is that \u2013 what is like the maximum that, that can get to without doing more deals into that further push it that way?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. So I think if you go to our working capital page, page 10, you'll see all the benefit here. Q4 to Q4 was on the liability side, right? We're basically equal to \u2013 on the asset side, which is that, that indicates to us and we go business-by-business, it's structural and driven by an increasing mix towards software. So that's the first thing I'd say. Second is when you look at the art of the possible, if you think about a business that is 100% SaaS recurring revenue that's prepaid a year ahead, let's say, that you bill on January 1st and you take 90 days to get paid, that company is going to have 75% of its revenue. That's negative net working capital, right? And we certainly have a couple of businesses that don't quite get to 75%, but they approach 40% or 50%. So as we become more software and our legacy perpetual business becomes more Saas, you're going to see this number get higher. Will it ever get to 40% to 50%? No, it won't. But it will keep inching higher. It should over the next 5 to 10 years. We don't have a target. It's not that we're trying to drive the business to be x percent negative. We just have an incentive system and a culture that we get a little bit better every year on this metric.\nJoe Giordano: That's definitely helpful to frame that up. Thanks. A follow-up would be on \u2013 I'm sorry, on Vertafore. How is that business doing since you've been there? Have you noticed anything like kind of - what kind of initial changes have been instituted, if any? And like when we did our diligence that was definitely a market like where - that business was a leader, but there was - that whole market seemed right for some change there. And how are you guys approaching that, are there upstarts that you look at? Is it an internal change that drives the market forward? Like how are you just approaching that business now?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. So the most important thing that I think we can say in regards to Vertafore that matter, any acquisition is that, you know, if we had to summarize what we do is we buy these amazingly great businesses and then provide them environment to get better over a long period of time. So as a result, there is not a short-term. We've got to do these five things to improve the business. That's not in our strategic M&A strategy. That said, the business is \u2013 and the piece of research you did we thought was quite good and reflective of ours. It's basically a duopoly. We share a market with one principal competitor on the agency side. Fortunately, for us, just after the business - we acquired the business and closed, we won the largest deal in the market in the last three or four years and assured partners. There was a press release that went out a handful of weeks ago. So we're delighted about that. It's a slow ramp over a couple of years, a couple, three years. I think that's just an indication of the quality of the business that Vertafore and the products they have. But also the customer, in that case, was reassured by being - by Vertafore being owned by Roper who is just a long-term owner that's not going to look to sell the business in a handful of years. And therefore, you can make the right investments. If there is one thing that we're, you know, if you well doing in the short run is based on our diligence and similar to work you did is, we wanted to allocate a little bit more to R&D, which we have done. That's reflected in the numbers we've given you from the very beginning. And so that's going to take a few years to play out, just continuing to add functionality and add features and ways to monetize their customer base.\nRob Crisci: Hey, and Joe, just on the - obviously, the company has performed very, very well since we own it. But just to clarify my last answer, the 90 of EBITDA, that's since we own the business, there's a month in there as well. It wasn't all in the fourth quarter. But it was 90 of cash in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: The next question from Blake Gendron with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBlake Gendron: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I want to follow-up on that R&D comment, actually, kind of in the broader context of your portfolio. So COVID was disruptive for a number of reasons, structurally with the end markets and I would imagine competitively. In addition to Vertafore and maybe ramping R&D there, are there any opportunities to ramp R&D across some of the other business units, simply because there's new market opportunities as a result of the pandemic moving forward? I know it's hard for us to really fully appreciate all the changes that will stick structurally across all your business units. But I'm just wondering if we should expect R&D to ramp a little bit across the portfolio, not just Vertafore?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. So a few things I'd say there to begin with. First is when we engage with each of our businesses strategically, we talk to them broadly about how to grow sustainably with CRI-accretive growth over a long arc of time. Answering the two questions of where to play and how to win, but then when you get into how to win, it is - sometimes it's a product answer. A lot of times, it's a go-to-market or market, go-to-market effective sort of answer. So it's not - our strategic orientation of each business doesn't narrow into innovation from the get-go. That said, obviously, innovation and R&D, more mostly a D shop [ph] mostly development across our software and product businesses. You have seen and likely will continue to see a modest increase in R&D spend as a percent of revenue for years to come. In \u201819, it was about 7.5%, last year, it's about a little over 8%. This coming year, probably going to add about 100 basis points, to be a little over 9%. There's Vertafore mix in there that they have a little bit higher percentage, as compared to some of our other businesses. But I think you will see and are seeing an increase in innovation there. So \u2013 I\u2019d sort of stop there. I mean, if you have any follow-ups, we're happy to do it. But the short answer is yes. I guess there's one other thing. If you compare Roper's, the 8% or 9% of revenue that we spend in R&D compared to other software companies, it appears low. When you look at our Software businesses, we're right in line with the peers. We're between 10% and 15%, 17% depending on the company. The Application businesses tend to be on the higher side of that. The Network businesses tend to be on the lower side of that. And the reason the mix for Roper is low is because we have quite a bit of revenue in TransCore, MHA and others that effectively don't have any R&D in our business model. So it's always important to point out when we get asked a question about R&D.\nBlake Gendron: That's helpful to think about the framework there. I wanted to shift to Deltek. I thought it was interesting when you mentioned GovCon's stability versus maybe some of the professional services being impacted by COVID. The GovCon, I would imagine you're dealing with large enterprise customers. So we should expect it to be kind of stable in addition to just general government spending being stable? On the professional side, is it just a matter of reopening? Or is there anything we can think about with respect to customer size, large versus SMB? And then maybe end markets specifically that we should be looking at for the recovery? Is it just non-residential construction on the AEC side? How should we think about Deltek improvement in 2021 and beyond?\nNeil Hunn: I\u2019ll give you a gold star for getting like seven questions into one question. So I'm going to do our best to try to come - tick through these. So on Deltek, it is - it's important to note. It is a combination of large enterprise and the smaller end of the GovCon space that's been super strong throughout the year. It's not just been at the high end. And yes, we expect that to just continue, as the - it's not tied to infrastructure, per se. These government contractors go toward the fast currents of government spend is. It's gone from military to educations, maybe infrastructure. They just go to where it is, that might drive some M&A activity, by the way, which is generally good for us. On the Professional services side, the book of business here is broad. But if there are pockets of concentration, it's in architects, engineers and contractors. Obviously, the contractors, mostly non-res contractors, in this case, they are the ones that are a little bit worried, and they've sort of tightened up a little bit more. It's the architects and engineering firms that have shown some green shoots here in Q4. In addition, marketing services firms is a leading niche for Deltek, and those businesses also have started to fall. So I think that checked off your questions. If we missed one or two, we're happy to follow-up with you after the call.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Morning everyone. This is Joao on for Julian.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Maybe to start with, could we get your thoughts on maybe margin expectations for the segment? Obviously, a lot of movement in the software margins in 2020, kind of a lot of mix shift you guys are calling out on that slide 20, so I just wanted to get your thoughts there?\nRob Crisci: Yeah. I mean, we can go through the segments in detail later on. But I mean, overall, our margins are relatively flat year-over-year in the guide. I think there's a little bit of a core decline in the margins, given a lot of the cost will come back post-COVID, travel and things that didn't happen, very modest decline there. And then the Vertafore revenue comes in at a higher margin. So overall, margins were relatively flat. And then we'd expect some improvement in the bottom sort of the more cyclical type stuff and process, we should get some nice bounce back as that starts to grow in margins.\nNeil Hunn: And if I could just add one thing there, sort of piggybacking your question with the last one. Core EBITDA margins are going to be down a bit because, as Rob said, these costs are coming back in. It's hard to spend money on travel and customer meetings, for instance, last year, and we expect some of that to come back in this year.  That said, I sort of call it like a trap of leadership. We're increasing our R&D as a percent of revenue by about the same amount that we expect the core margins to come down. So there's going to be - some teams and some companies may choose to hold margins, and they're going to have to - there's opportunity cost inside the business somewhere. In our case, we're very specifically and intentionally not doing that versus coming to that trap. And then obviously, we get the benefit of the Vertafore mix coming in. So on - in aggregate, margins should be flat to up a touch.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thanks. And then maybe on the services piece of Application Software, you guys talk about kind of rebuilding that pipeline. What does that process look like? And any thoughts on some of the cadence or just kind of expectations beyond that sort of flat growth you guys guided for?\nRob Crisci: Yeah. I think - so what you have here is a dynamic where the most - first as a precursor. Most - the vast majority, I should say of our services work in the application segment are tied to new implementations, whether they're SaaS or on-premise. So if you look back and think through what happened sequentially in 2020, very quickly in the shutdown, the license activity, the perpetual activity slowed down. So you had low license activity basically through Q4. The services book of business has a little bit of a backlog, right? So the services were continued in Q2, continued a little bit in Q3, completed the in-flight projects. And then it sort of slowed down a handful of months behind the license activity. So when you comeback on this side, the license activity will pick up sooner, but then you got to - and the services work will follow back behind it. So you've essentially had a slower ramp down and a slower ramp up for services. So that's why you see it flattish where you can see growth in the perpetual book.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blanton: Hi. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Alex.\nRob Crisci: Good morning, Alex. Good to hear you.\nAlex Blanton: I wanted to ask, could you characterize your acquisition intentions for 2021? You had said earlier that it would be primarily - would be deleveraging for 12 to 18 months. But today, you mentioned that you had a very active, robust pipeline of potential acquisitions with many opportunities, so has there been a change in your intentions there in terms of deleveraging? How would you characterize the acquisition outlook for this year?\nNeil Hunn: Thank you, Alex for the question. So I would share two things with you. First is, maybe more than a couple of things. So we are active. The pipeline is active. We are spending time with - learning businesses, spending time with all the sponsors that we have relationships with to understand what the cohort of opportunities looks like. Importantly, every sizable transaction that we've completed since 2016, we have had a chance to meet the management teams at least once, if not multiple times, anywhere between 6 months and 18 months before we completed the transaction. So the work that we're doing now is principally focused on that. These are getting to understand businesses well before they're ready to be transacted, right? So businesses we're meeting this month are likely going to be businesses that we may acquire at the end of this year, or into the first half of next year. So it's the early pipeline work is the first thing I would say. Second is we're absolutely committed to deleveraging or unwavering on that. Third thing, if the right deal came through, there's always a way to figure that out. But that's not our primary focus. Our primary focus is the early part of the pipeline build, as well as the deleveraging.\nAlex Blanton: Okay. And secondly, how would you characterize the makeup of these companies that you're getting to know. What industries? Is it still primarily software? Are you still going in that direction?\nNeil Hunn: Absolutely. It's \u2013 again, we're characterized, our M&A pipeline and process characterized by buying businesses that are better than us through the \u2013 our quantitative cash return lens. So that yields mostly software informatics types businesses. They're a combination of a wide variety of end markets, a wide variety of SaaS versus perpetual business models. But yeah, it's essentially what the capital deployment over the last 7 to 10 years. It's what our pipeline is characterized by that same type of business.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thanks, Zack. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and we hope everyone is doing well. For today's agenda, we'll walk through our 2020 financials and operational highlights, then we'll turn to our 2020 segment detailed results and discuss our 2021 segment-by-segment outlook and end with our 2021 enterprise guidance prior to discussing your questions. Next slide, please. As we look back on 2020, it was quite a year. Our businesses performed at a very high level during this period. Revenues grew 3% with organic revenue declining a single percent. EBITDA also grew 3%, and free cash flow grew 16%. This cash flow performance, $1.7 billion is just astounding. This is a testament to many things, notably our asset light business model, the intimacy we have with our customers and the high level of skill and execution of our field teams. This cash flow is just simply a great result. Perhaps more important, 2020 was a year of forward progress for our company. We exit 2020 as a better company, a company with higher quality revenue streams, a company with improved future innovation prospects and a company with whose portfolio was enhanced with $6 billion of capital deployment. To this end, we saw our software recurring revenues increase mid single digits in 2020 and were benefited by high levels of retention and acceleration to the cloud. We continue to be benefited by having close intimate relationships with our customers. Most often, our software is mission-critical to our customer's operations. In addition, we continue to strategically invest throughout our portfolio during the year. Based on our historical experience, we find times of market disruption the best time to double down on innovation and market investments, which in turn will drive market share gains in the years to come.  Finally, we were able to deploy $6 billion to further enhance Roper's Group of companies' headlines by our Vertafore acquisition. So when we look back on 2020, we highlight two key themes. First, we grew. Cash flow increased 16% in the middle of a pandemic, and second, the quality of our enterprise continued to improve during the year. Net-net, we got bigger and better during 2020. Let's turn to the next slide. Over the past 5 years, we highlight that our revenue grew at a 9% compounded rate, EBITDA at 10% and cash flow at 13%. We continue to grow and compound through macroeconomic cycles. Also, during the time period, the quality of our enterprise meaningfully improved. We are more software-focused with nearly two thirds of our EBITDA coming from software with higher levels of recurring revenue. Conversely, we are much less tied to cyclical end markets today, a little over 15% of our portfolio. Given our long-term strategy and these factors, we are a low-risk enterprise. We compound cash flow through cycle and do so with multiple growth drivers across both organic and inorganic fronts. As we look to '21, we will continue our long-term string of revenue and EBITDA and cash flow compounding. So with that, let's turn to the next page and discuss the macro backdrop for '21. As we look to 2021, we are set up for a strong year. We expect revenue and EBITDA will grow well into the double-digits, likely in the mid-teens range with organic revenue growth in the mid single digit plus range. This is on top of growth in 2020, the compounding continues. Breaking it down, our software businesses both in our application software and network segments are well-positioned heading into '21. These businesses enter the year with momentum from strong retention and recurring revenue gains. They will be further aided by growth in perpetual license, as pipeline and customer activity are anticipated to recover to some extent. Our non-Verathon medical product businesses are expected to return to a more normalized pattern of customer activity, as health care facilities loosen restrictions. But since 2020 was while below trend, we expect above trend growth here. Of note, Verathon has a challenging comp. However, the reoccurring revenue base will remain strong given the large volume of capital placements in 2020 and continued growth of their new single-use Bronchoscope business. We expect Neptune to recover and grow nicely as our customers, especially in the Northeast, US and Canada, gain access to residential locations. We expect our Industrial and Process Tech businesses to continue their quarterly improvements and return to growth after 2 years of macro headwinds. Finally, 2021 will be meaningfully aided by the contribution from our 2020 cohort of acquisitions. To this end, we continue to work with a very full and high-quality M&A pipeline. We are committed to deleveraging, but we also remain active in building and maturing our pipe. So as I think back over the nearly 10 years I've been with Roper, I cannot think of a better set of tailwinds heading into a year. Clearly, lot to do and lots of execution in front of us, but we have a strong momentum heading into 2021. So now let me turn the call over to Rob. Rob? Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to our recap for 2020. To help orient you to this page, we're comparing a full year outlook from last April to that of what actually happened. It's worth reminding everyone that we felt our businesses and our business model had the level of recurring revenue, customer intimacy and the business leadership required to guide in the face of the COVID uncertainty, both in terms of supply and demand. In aggregate, we thought our full year organic revenues to be plus or minus flat, and we came in at down minus 1%. The TransCore New York project is the primary reconciling item between being down a touch and being flat or slightly up, and more on this in a minute. We guided DEPS to be between $11.60 and $12.60 and came in at $12.74. Looking back on this, we are very proud of our team's ability to look forward and operate through the uncertainty of last year. Also, there is no better example of the durability of our model than this past year. With that, let's walk through the macro drivers across each of our four segments. Relative to Application Software, this segment played out as anticipated and was up 1% on an organic basis for the year. Specifically, we saw recurring revenue up mid single digits, aided by very strong retention rates, as well as an acceleration to the cloud. As a reminder, recurring revenue in this segment is about 70% of our revenue stream. Perpetual revenues, about 10% of this segment's revenue were under pressure as expected. We saw this revenue stream down mid teens as new logo opportunities and wins were pushed and delayed. That said, cross-selling activity remained active for much of 2020. Relative to services revenue, we anticipated some pressure tied to shifting to remote installs and having fewer new implementations, which are tied to new perpetual transactions. For 2020, we saw mid single digit declines here, principally tied to fewer new deals. Our teams did a wonderful job shifting to remote installs, a trend we anticipate will continue in large part on the backside of the pandemic. As it relates to our Network segment, we expect the organic revenue for the year to be up mid singles to double-digits when, in fact, we grew 3% for the full year. Our Network Software businesses performed as anticipated with recurring revenues growing low single digits, again, benefited by high retention rates and high levels of recurring revenue. This segment underperformed our expectations, primarily due to TransCore's New York congestion infrastructure project timing. In April, we expected approximately $75 million more in revenue from this project than actually occurred in 2020. More on this when we turn to the segment overview, but we expect this $75 million of pushed revenue to be recognized in 2021. It's also worth noting that the number of Toll Tags Shipped last year were at historic lows given the lower traffic volumes, but this was anticipated. For our MAS segment, we've talked all year about this being the tale of four situations, Verathon, Other Medical Products, Neptune and Industrial. For the year, again, back in April, we felt this group would be flat to up mid single digits on an organic basis. We posted 1% growth. We feel very good about the execution across this group of companies. The primary reconciliation factor is a slower recovery ramp tied to our non-Verathon Medical product businesses and Neptune. Specifically, we anticipated unprecedented demand for Verathon's innovation product family. For the year, Verathon grew substantially, as COVID accelerated the further adoption of video intubation as the preferred technology. Our other medical product businesses, which grow mid-single digits like clockwork, were down mid single digits for the year, tied directly to lower elective procedure volumes and limited hospital capital spending. Interestingly for Neptune, we highlighted municipal budget uncertainty in April. This proved generally to be a non-factor, as municipalities budgets were approved and available. However, the impact of the lockdowns, especially in the Northeast, US and Canada, had a prolonged impact on our customer's ability to do routine meter replacements. As a result, Neptune was down low double-digits for the year, slightly worse than our initial expectations. Finally, for this segment, we expected sharp industrial declines, and that is what happens, with these businesses being down low double-digits for the year. That said, we are seeing sequential quarterly improvements across both Neptune and our Industrial businesses. Finally, and as it relates to our Process Tech Segment, we expect it to be down 20% to 25%, and we were logging in at down 21%. This played out as we anticipated with much lower energy-related spending, project timing pushes and the inability to get field service resources into customer locations. So this is the play-by-play rewind for 2020. Now let's turn to the segment pages for a bit more detail. Next slide, please. For Application Software, where revenues here were $1.81 billion, up 1% organically with EBITDA of $772 million. The broad macro activity for this segment has remained quite consistent for much of 2020. Specifically, we continue to see accelerating demand for our cloud solutions. This bodes well for our long-term recurring revenue growth and customer intimacy. At a business unit level, Deltek's GovCon business continues to be super solid and grow very nicely. But we did see some headwinds relative to their offerings that target the consulting, marketing services and AEC space. That said, recent customer activity and top-of-funnel activity suggest some market falling is occurring. Aderant and PowerPlan delivered flat EBITDA in the year with nice recurring revenue gains. We experienced very nice growth across our Lab Software group, again doing our part to help fight the COVID war. Strata delivered double-digit organic growth and completed a strategic acquisition in EPSi. Notably, the combined business will analyze roughly half of the US hospital spend. Finally, our two businesses that serve the education space, CBORD & Horizon, declined double digits in the year, simply due to having a customer base that was shutdown. A decent amount of revenues in these businesses are tied to student volumes. Importantly, we acquired Vertafore last year. They're off to a great start with strong earnings and very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. Looking to Q1, we see flat to low single digit organic growth based on continued mid single digit recurring revenue growth, offset slightly by lower perpetual and services revenues given last year's non-COVID comp. Now let's turn to our Network segment. Here, revenues were $1.74 billion, up 3% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $732 million. Our Network Software businesses performed well during last year, growing low single digits. Specifically, DAT was strong, growing double digits. DAT's network scale and innovation focus continues to enable very solid organic gains. ConstructConnect grew based on network utilization, tied to a tighter construction labor market. iTrade, MHA and Foundry had some headwinds tied to their end markets being disrupted due to COVID. That said, each of these businesses had high retention rates and the networks remain very strong. iPipeline also performed well during their first year being with Roper and completed two bolt-on acquisitions. Our non-software businesses struggled a bit during the year. Specifically, our rf IDEAS, are multi-protocol prudential [ph] reader business, did well in their health care applications, but was hampered by meaningful declines in their secure print market. For the full year, TransCore pushed about $100 million of revenue out of 2020 into 2021 associated with our New York project. In addition, EBITDA margins were pressured due to lower tag shipments and a few non-New York project push-outs. As we look to the first quarter of 2021, we see organic revenue, as you can see in the lower right-hand box, to be down 3% to 5% for the quarter. An important distinction to highlight, our software businesses will continue to grow in the low single digit range. But our non-software businesses, driven by TransCore will decline in the high-teens range in the first quarter due to much lower anticipated tag shipments and timing of revenue associated with the New York projects. As a reminder, the first quarter of this year is coming off a mid-teens growth comp from a year ago. Now let's turn to our MAS segment. Revenues for the year were $1.47 billion, up 1% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $508 million. Verathon was awesome in 2020. The business grew substantially based on unprecedented demand for their video intubation product line. Demand was global. Given Verathon's ability to fulfill this demand, we expect our meaningfully expanded installed base of GlideScope's to generate increased levels of reoccurring consumables pull-through in the years to come. In addition, the first year of their Single-Use Bronchoscope release was successful. We believe we gained a substantial foothold in the market during the inaugural year of this product category. Our other med product businesses declined, but they started to see more normalized patient volumes towards the end of the year. Further, customer interactions are starting to resemble more normal levels in engagement. Neptune declined low double-digits tied exclusively to our customers in the Northeastern, US and Canada not having access to indoor meters. Other regions were flat during 2020. Neptune's market share remains strong throughout the year. Finally, our Industrial businesses were down, but have shown sequential improvements throughout the year. For Q1, we expect low single-digit organic growth for this segment with similar patterns to that of the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. Revenues for the year were $519 million, down 21% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $156 million or 30% of revenue. Compared versus 2 years ago, these businesses are down about $90 million in EBITDA and yet maintained 30% EBITDA margins. Congrats and thanks to our leadership team for their continued exceptional execution. As a side note, Roper continued to compound despite these cyclical headwinds. That said, this segment is pretty straightforward and has been the same story all year. COVID has negatively impacted our oil and gas and short-cycle businesses. Certainly, lower oil prices did not help either. That said, we have seen some green shoots across the group, as capital spending started to improve as we exited 2020. As we look to the first quarter, we expect declines to moderate in the first quarter to be in the 10% range. Importantly, we have easing comps as we enter the second quarter. Also, over the last couple of years, these businesses continue to make product and channel investments to be best positioned to fully capture this cyclical upswing. The next few years here should be pretty good. Now let's turn to our guidance and the associated framework. While this slide is somewhat busy, we wanted to line-up for you the key macro differences between our 2021 full year outlook on a segment basis versus our actual 2020 results. In aggregate, we expect total revenue to increase in the mid teens range with organic growth being in the mid single digit-plus area.  As we look across the revenue streams for our Application & Software segment, we expect mid singles growth. Specifically, we expect a slightly improved recurring revenue growth rate, aided by last year's recurring momentum and an increased mix towards SaaS. We expect flat services revenues and mid single digit plus growth in Perpetual as we expect a modest market recovery and easing second half comps. Similarly, we expect mid single digit organic growth in our Network segment with our Network Software businesses growing mid single digit plus. We expect TransCore to complete the New York project and see recovering Tag sales. When combined, TransCore should grow mid singles for the year. We expect MAS to grow mid single digits as well. Our Medical Product businesses were exceptional last year, up 20%. Importantly, the quality of our medical products revenue stream will continue to improve as Verathon's reoccurring revenue streams tied to GlideScope and BFlex continue to gain momentum.  As we look to 2021, our Medical Product businesses are expected to grow low single digits, as elective procedures and hospital capital spending returned to more normalized levels throughout 2021, this return being partially offset by our difficult 2020 COVID comp. Neptune should be up high single digits plus with easing restrictions and more access to indoor meter replacements. And finally, our Industrial businesses should recover and grow in the high single digit plus range after 2 years of declines. Our PT businesses are expected to be up high single digits through the year based on the resumption of deferred projects and field maintenance, as well as modest improvements in these end markets. So all in all, we expect organic revenues to increase mid single digits plus and total revenue to grow in the mid teens range. Let's turn to our guidance slide. Based on what we just outlined, when you roll everything together, we're establishing our 2021 full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $14.35 and $14.75. Our tax rate should be in the 21% to 22% range. For the first quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.26 and $3.32. Of note, our guided Q1 adjusted DEPS is roughly 22% to 23% of our full year guidance range and is consistent with our long-term historical DEPS seasonality. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. What a year. None of us will ever forget 2020. Our business performed so very well last year. We grew revenue 3% in aggregate and only declined a single percent on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were steady at 35.8%, and cash flow grew 16% to $1.7 billion. This means, we had cash flow margins of 30%, just amazing. Given this performance, our business model's ability to foresee this performance, we stayed focused on executing our capital deployment strategy, which resulted in $6 billion of deployment on high-quality, niche-leading, vertical software companies. There is no doubt the quality of our enterprise improved during 2020, something we're incredibly proud to be able to say. Our recurring revenue grew mid-single digits. We increased innovation investments and increased the quality of our portfolio with our capital deployment spend. So as we look to 2021, we feel we are incredibly well-positioned. We expect strong organic growth that will be further augmented by contributions from our recent acquisitions. In 2021, we expect about two-thirds of our EBITDA to come from our Software businesses, which provides us all the virtues of an increased mix towards recurring revenues. We will continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet, but we remain committed and focused on our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M& A candidates is active, robust and has many high quality opportunities. So as we look back over 2020, we are proud of our business model's durability and our leaders' ability to successfully navigate last year's uncertainties. We are proud that we continue to be forward-leaning and strategic. We are proud that we improved our business last year with an increasing mix of growing recurring revenue and continued innovation focus. In short, we got bigger and better during 2020. As we turn to your questions, I'll remind everyone that at Roper, we operate a low-risk model whose strategy centers on acquiring fantastic businesses and then providing them with an environment where they can get even better over the long arc of time. This was certainly the case in 2020. So with that, let's turn to our first question. Hey, good morning, Deane. Deane, maybe I can ask you to sort of rephrase the question. I want to make sure that we fully understand the question. Sure. Okay. So I appreciate the question. I think we understand it now. So the total perpetual revenue for our core businesses, the Software businesses that have been in the portfolio for a while was down obviously, in 2020. We expect about - the recovery in \u201821 to be about half of what we are down. We're seeing strength, you know, we've seen continued strength all year in the perpetual - in 2020 in the perpetual book of business, in Deltek's GovCon business. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, we're seeing - showing [ph] in some activity in their professional services end markets that's encouraging. These are the architects, the engineers, the contractors, the marketing services firms, the consulting firms, those - that book of business. In addition, the other large parts of the perpetual book are at Aderant and PowerPlan. Aderant has its own unique set of competitive factors where the customers have to \u2013 the customers that have not upgraded their software from - the competitive customers have not upgraded the software have to upgrade, and we're winning a large percentage of those. And so all that activity just got pushed to the right a bit, and that's somewhat encouraging and pipeline activity is positive there. And then PowerPlan's pipeline activity is full. It has a handful of large opportunities in it, which are obviously hard to predict the exact timing. But we actually like the pipeline build across, the companies that have the primary book of perpetual business. Good morning. Yeah. I appreciate the question. We - it's very routine for us to get inbounds. I've been here almost 10 years. And there's a handful of, what I would say, meaningful and credible inbounds in any given year. Like we said for years, though, it's just very difficult to make the math work because when we sell a business, just look back at Gatan, you sell a business to a strategic buyer, we leak taxes, then you have to redeploy it, it's just hard with a compounding orientation to make that math work. Certainly, the lower tax rate sort of helped in the Gatan timing. So yes, we get inbounds. I would not say the activity in the last few quarters has ramped up more than it's been over the decade I've been here. But yeah, there's always inbound inquiry. Yeah. I think it's the appetite. We've never not had the appetite. It just comes down to the math and doing what's best in our view, according to our math for our shareholders. So it's - the appetite has \u2013 that remained unchanged. You're welcome. Hey, Steve. Good morning, Allison. Well, I'll give you the \u2013 it's Neil. I'll give you the headline, and I'll let Rob sort of add his color on the back end. So it's not like a step function bump-up. It is a sort of sequential improvement throughout the year. Obviously, when you roll past Q1, the comps get a whole lot easier. So that's part of what the last three quarters of the year will look like as well. When you look at it on a company by - sorry segment-by-segment basis, just rolling through, basically, it's the perpetual book of business and the associated services that come with that for Application Software that ramps back up. In Network, they're really - for the Network businesses, it's a little bit of ramp back at foundry. It's a little bit of ramp back at iTrade. But the other businesses were pretty steady as she goes, DAT, ConstructConnect, et cetera. TransCore stands by itself. It's tied principally to two things, one is the New York project completing, and second, the return of traffic volumes and the associated tags that go with them. For the MAS segment, it's Neptune just sequentially coming back and importantly, getting the access to the indoor meters in Northeast, US and Canada. I said in the prepared remarks, market share was super steady, maybe plus a little bit in that business last year. It's just access - our customers getting access to do retain replacements. Verathon will have a difficult headwind because of the capital place we talked about. But the other Medical Product businesses just rotate up in a sequential basis. And then finally, the Industrial businesses do the same. Process is much like Industrial, just a cyclical rebound, modestly higher oil prices helped. But you have all this in the energy businesses, you have all this deferred maintenance that's got to get done. There's a lot of - there's sort of - there were some restocking orders in the fourth quarter there and then some pipeline activity like we got to get in and do the maintenance in a handful of these important customers. So that would be sort of the color of the ramp, but no step function. But Rob, what would you add if anything? I would say no. And I think the \u2013 I mean, obviously, there's going to be small pockets here and there. We're very \u2013 most of our customers across the portfolio, most are enterprise level. A very small percentage of our software companies would be in the small, medium size where it may be more subject to some sort of macro sort of headwinds or business uncertainty. I think the data point we point to is just the incredible cash flow. I mean, we got paid by our customers, right, and so last year. And so what we do is just critical to what they do. And no, I don't think there's going to be down... Good morning, Joe. I have a guy in Florida, I never run through [ph] We will count that as the first question, by the way. Yeah. So I think if you go to our working capital page, page 10, you'll see all the benefit here. Q4 to Q4 was on the liability side, right? We're basically equal to \u2013 on the asset side, which is that, that indicates to us and we go business-by-business, it's structural and driven by an increasing mix towards software. So that's the first thing I'd say. Second is when you look at the art of the possible, if you think about a business that is 100% SaaS recurring revenue that's prepaid a year ahead, let's say, that you bill on January 1st and you take 90 days to get paid, that company is going to have 75% of its revenue. That's negative net working capital, right? And we certainly have a couple of businesses that don't quite get to 75%, but they approach 40% or 50%. So as we become more software and our legacy perpetual business becomes more Saas, you're going to see this number get higher. Will it ever get to 40% to 50%? No, it won't. But it will keep inching higher. It should over the next 5 to 10 years. We don't have a target. It's not that we're trying to drive the business to be x percent negative. We just have an incentive system and a culture that we get a little bit better every year on this metric. Yeah. So the most important thing that I think we can say in regards to Vertafore that matter, any acquisition is that, you know, if we had to summarize what we do is we buy these amazingly great businesses and then provide them environment to get better over a long period of time. So as a result, there is not a short-term. We've got to do these five things to improve the business. That's not in our strategic M&A strategy. That said, the business is \u2013 and the piece of research you did we thought was quite good and reflective of ours. It's basically a duopoly. We share a market with one principal competitor on the agency side. Fortunately, for us, just after the business - we acquired the business and closed, we won the largest deal in the market in the last three or four years and assured partners. There was a press release that went out a handful of weeks ago. So we're delighted about that. It's a slow ramp over a couple of years, a couple, three years. I think that's just an indication of the quality of the business that Vertafore and the products they have. But also the customer, in that case, was reassured by being - by Vertafore being owned by Roper who is just a long-term owner that's not going to look to sell the business in a handful of years. And therefore, you can make the right investments. If there is one thing that we're, you know, if you well doing in the short run is based on our diligence and similar to work you did is, we wanted to allocate a little bit more to R&D, which we have done. That's reflected in the numbers we've given you from the very beginning. And so that's going to take a few years to play out, just continuing to add functionality and add features and ways to monetize their customer base. Yeah. So a few things I'd say there to begin with. First is when we engage with each of our businesses strategically, we talk to them broadly about how to grow sustainably with CRI-accretive growth over a long arc of time. Answering the two questions of where to play and how to win, but then when you get into how to win, it is - sometimes it's a product answer. A lot of times, it's a go-to-market or market, go-to-market effective sort of answer. So it's not - our strategic orientation of each business doesn't narrow into innovation from the get-go. That said, obviously, innovation and R&D, more mostly a D shop [ph] mostly development across our software and product businesses. You have seen and likely will continue to see a modest increase in R&D spend as a percent of revenue for years to come. In \u201819, it was about 7.5%, last year, it's about a little over 8%. This coming year, probably going to add about 100 basis points, to be a little over 9%. There's Vertafore mix in there that they have a little bit higher percentage, as compared to some of our other businesses. But I think you will see and are seeing an increase in innovation there. So \u2013 I'd sort of stop there. I mean, if you have any follow-ups, we're happy to do it. But the short answer is yes. I guess there's one other thing. If you compare Roper's, the 8% or 9% of revenue that we spend in R&D compared to other software companies, it appears low. When you look at our Software businesses, we're right in line with the peers. We're between 10% and 15%, 17% depending on the company. The Application businesses tend to be on the higher side of that. The Network businesses tend to be on the lower side of that. And the reason the mix for Roper is low is because we have quite a bit of revenue in TransCore, MHA and others that effectively don't have any R&D in our business model. So it's always important to point out when we get asked a question about R&D. I'll give you a gold star for getting like seven questions into one question. So I'm going to do our best to try to come - tick through these. So on Deltek, it is - it's important to note. It is a combination of large enterprise and the smaller end of the GovCon space that's been super strong throughout the year. It's not just been at the high end. And yes, we expect that to just continue, as the - it's not tied to infrastructure, per se. These government contractors go toward the fast currents of government spend is. It's gone from military to educations, maybe infrastructure. They just go to where it is, that might drive some M&A activity, by the way, which is generally good for us. On the Professional services side, the book of business here is broad. But if there are pockets of concentration, it's in architects, engineers and contractors. Obviously, the contractors, mostly non-res contractors, in this case, they are the ones that are a little bit worried, and they've sort of tightened up a little bit more. It's the architects and engineering firms that have shown some green shoots here in Q4. In addition, marketing services firms is a leading niche for Deltek, and those businesses also have started to fall. So I think that checked off your questions. If we missed one or two, we're happy to follow-up with you after the call. Hey, good morning. And if I could just add one thing there, sort of piggybacking your question with the last one. Core EBITDA margins are going to be down a bit because, as Rob said, these costs are coming back in. It's hard to spend money on travel and customer meetings, for instance, last year, and we expect some of that to come back in this year.  That said, I sort of call it like a trap of leadership. We're increasing our R&D as a percent of revenue by about the same amount that we expect the core margins to come down. So there's going to be - some teams and some companies may choose to hold margins, and they're going to have to - there's opportunity cost inside the business somewhere. In our case, we're very specifically and intentionally not doing that versus coming to that trap. And then obviously, we get the benefit of the Vertafore mix coming in. So on - in aggregate, margins should be flat to up a touch. Good morning, Alex. Thank you, Alex for the question. So I would share two things with you. First is, maybe more than a couple of things. So we are active. The pipeline is active. We are spending time with - learning businesses, spending time with all the sponsors that we have relationships with to understand what the cohort of opportunities looks like. Importantly, every sizable transaction that we've completed since 2016, we have had a chance to meet the management teams at least once, if not multiple times, anywhere between 6 months and 18 months before we completed the transaction. So the work that we're doing now is principally focused on that. These are getting to understand businesses well before they're ready to be transacted, right? So businesses we're meeting this month are likely going to be businesses that we may acquire at the end of this year, or into the first half of next year. So it's the early pipeline work is the first thing I would say. Second is we're absolutely committed to deleveraging or unwavering on that. Third thing, if the right deal came through, there's always a way to figure that out. But that's not our primary focus. Our primary focus is the early part of the pipeline build, as well as the deleveraging. Absolutely. It's \u2013 again, we're characterized, our M&A pipeline and process characterized by buying businesses that are better than us through the \u2013 our quantitative cash return lens. So that yields mostly software informatics types businesses. They're a combination of a wide variety of end markets, a wide variety of SaaS versus perpetual business models. But yeah, it's essentially what the capital deployment over the last 7 to 10 years. It's what our pipeline is characterized by that same type of business."

            "name": "Rob Crisci",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to page eight, while looking at our Q4 income statement performance. Total revenue increased 8%, as we eclipsed $1.5 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 2% versus prior year. EBITDA grew 7% in the quarter to a record $552 million. EBITDA margin was down 40 basis points versus prior year at 36.6%. Tax rate came in at 19.9%, a little lower than last year's 21.6%. So all-in, this resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.56 which is above our guidance range. Next slide. Turning to page nine, reviewing the Q4 results by segment. Neil will discuss the full year 2020 segment performance in more detail later, so just touching on some of the Q4 highlights here by segment. Application Software grew 35% with the addition of Vertafore. Organic for the segment was minus 2% with mid single digit recurring revenue growth continuing. Sharp declines in our CBORD & Horizon businesses, serving K-12 and higher education impacted the segment, as many schools unfortunately remain closed. For network software systems, plus 2% organic growth with our Software businesses, putting up a very solid plus 4% organic. The TransCore was flat versus prior year. For Measurement & Analytical Solutions, plus 1% organic growth, as we start to see some sequential recovery at Neptune in our Industrial businesses. Segment margins were impacted a bit by the acceleration of some product and channel investments at Verathon as we discussed coming into the quarter, and it's really been a conceptual [ph] year for Verathon overall. Lastly, for Process Technologies, a 21% organic decline, with margins holding up well at 31.3%. And once again here, we started to see some early signs of improvement after a couple of years of declines. Next slide. So turning to page 10, looking at net working capital. Honestly, the slide mostly speaks for itself, ending the quarter with negative 8% net working capital as a percentage of Q4 annualized revenue. While there are certainly some seasonal trends, primarily around timing of software renewals, they do typically benefit our Q4 performance. You can see here a meaningful improvement versus 2018, improving from negative 3.4% to negative 8% in 2020. Our asset-light negative net working capital model drives our sustainable, high cash conversion and fuels our cash flow compounding. Our people focus on what we all believe matters and our culture is built around growing the right way. Topline growth converts to cash flow, and we are always mindful of impacts to our balance sheet. Next slide. So turning to cash flow, cash flow performance, as Neil mentioned was really pretty spectacular, no matter how you look at it. Q4 free cash flow of $558 million was 23% higher than last year and represented 37% of revenue. This excellent result was driven by the great working capital performance I just discussed, which is really across the enterprise, along with meaningful cash contributions from Vertafore and the other recent acquisitions. So for the full year of 2020, we generated $1.72 billion of operating cash flow and $1.67 billion of free cash flow. So to repeat, that's $1.7 billion of free cash flow in 2020, truly a great year. Full year free cash flow growth was 16%, and our free cash flow conversion from EBITDA was a robust 84%. So really tremendous cash flow performance, and it was broad-based and very durable. Next slide. So turning to page 12, updating on our balance sheet. As Neil mentioned earlier, we ended the year with total capital deployment of approximately $6 billion, which included the EPSi acquisition that closed during the fourth quarter on October 15. We were able to take advantage of attractive market conditions to complete and opportunistically fund these acquisitions with a combination of internally generated cash flow, proceeds from our 2019 Gatan divestiture and investment-grade leverage. Overall cost of financing was approximately 1%. Thanks to our excellent Q4 cash performance, we're off to a great start on our plan to quickly reduce leverage, paying down around $500 million since we closed the EPSi deal. Looking ahead, we plan to rapidly reduce leverage throughout 2021, taking advantage of our prepayable revolver, which has a current balance of approximately $1.6 billion. Our solid investment-grade balance sheet supports long-term cash flow compounding, which we are well-positioned to continue. So with that, I'll pass it back over to Neil for the remainder of our prepared remarks. Good morning, Deane. Yeah. So - hey, Deane, good morning. It's about $100 million for the full year. And in the first quarter, we only have about $10 million to $15 million in there. As we mentioned, there's a bit of a pause, but now it's started up and running again, and the scope is unchanged. Sure. So it will be, as you know, when we're in deleveraging mode, all the free cash flow goes towards deleveraging. So we pay a dividend. That will continue. But essentially, the rest of the free cash flow goes towards deleveraging. So that's a rough - probably after you paying a dividend, roughly $1.5 billion in deleveraging is probably a good ballpark number. Vertafore was around 90% or so of both cash and EBITDA. And yeah, as I mentioned earlier, Steve, just great working capital performance across the portfolio, very broad-based. You're getting your software renewals, which were very strong in the fourth quarter. There is certainly is some benefit, right from those more cyclical businesses being a little bit softer, right? And that lowers working capital overall. But just great working capital performance. Our cash taxes year-over-year were about flat. So it really was all on working capital. Yeah. So the $1.5 billion is deleveraging number, so that's an estimate. That's after paying dividends. So for next year, yeah, you're right, we don't guide free cash flow. We always have very strong conversion. As you know, we expect that very high conversion to continue. As I mentioned, those working capital trends are very stainable, right? It's the culture. It's the type of businesses we buy. As the software businesses grow, their working capital continues to go down, so that all should continue.  In terms of the tax attributes, yes, there are some tax attributes related to Vertafore, which we disclosed, a little over $100 million. So there'll be some benefit from that coming in '21. There's also, like many other multi-industry and really all companies, right, we benefited some from deferral of payroll taxes. So that I'll go back the other way next year as you're starting to pay those payroll taxes again. So those are sort of \u2013 the business sort of counter [ph] each other a little bit. But we feel great about cash flow next year. But we don't guide as you know. Operator Next question comes from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Good morning, Allison. No, I think that's right. We're assuming Q1 is very much clearly still in the middle of pandemic and then things improve from there. Yeah. The pockets of areas that are hit as we talked about, right colleges and universities, most of those customers we tend to have larger customers there. So we're not too worried about our schools being in financial trouble overall. And then on like the iTrade network side, they have customers that are in the food area. So there certainly could be an impact from some smaller restaurants and some of those issues in that market. But overall, not really a meaningful impact meaningful impact to us. Good morning, Joe. Hey, and Joe, just on the - obviously, the company has performed very, very well since we own it. But just to clarify my last answer, the 90 of EBITDA, that's since we own the business, there's a month in there as well. It wasn't all in the fourth quarter. But it was 90 of cash in the fourth quarter. Yeah. I mean, we can go through the segments in detail later on. But I mean, overall, our margins are relatively flat year-over-year in the guide. I think there's a little bit of a core decline in the margins, given a lot of the cost will come back post-COVID, travel and things that didn't happen, very modest decline there. And then the Vertafore revenue comes in at a higher margin. So overall, margins were relatively flat. And then we'd expect some improvement in the bottom sort of the more cyclical type stuff and process, we should get some nice bounce back as that starts to grow in margins. Yeah. I think - so what you have here is a dynamic where the most - first as a precursor. Most - the vast majority, I should say of our services work in the application segment are tied to new implementations, whether they're SaaS or on-premise. So if you look back and think through what happened sequentially in 2020, very quickly in the shutdown, the license activity, the perpetual activity slowed down. So you had low license activity basically through Q4. The services book of business has a little bit of a backlog, right? So the services were continued in Q2, continued a little bit in Q3, completed the in-flight projects. And then it sort of slowed down a handful of months behind the license activity. So when you comeback on this side, the license activity will pick up sooner, but then you got to - and the services work will follow back behind it. So you've essentially had a slower ramp down and a slower ramp up for services. So that's why you see it flattish where you can see growth in the perpetual book. Good morning, Alex. Good to hear you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions].  I would like now to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. We hope everyone is doing well. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.  Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you'll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue and related commission expense, transaction related expenses for completed acquisitions. And lastly, we've adjusted our cash flow results to exclude income tax payments deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to COVID-19 and cash taxes paid for the Gatan divestiture. As a reminder, GAAP requires tax payments for a gain on sale to be classified as an operating cash flow item, even though it is related to a divestiture.  And now if you please turn to Slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Neil? \nNeil Hunn : Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let's go ahead and get into this morning's content. And as we always do, we'll start by reviewing our agenda. I'll begin discussing our enterprise highlights for the quarter, which was a very busy and very productive quarter for us. To that end, I'll briefly review our acquisition activity. Rob will then discuss our financial performance and capital market activity. Afterwards, I'll walk through a detailed segment review and associated outlook, followed by our enterprise fourth quarter and raised full year guidance. We will then look forward to your questions.  Now with that, let's turn to a brief run through of our Q3 enterprise highlights. Next slide please. Third quarter demonstrated the strength our execution capabilities. First, on an operating basis. Second, on a capital deployment basis. And finally, from a capital markets perspective. Operationally, our revenues and EBITDA continue to grow, albeit modestly, despite the well documented economic challenges resulting from the pandemic situation we're all facing.  At a summary level, our software recurring revenues continue to grow. Recurring revenue growth is very important for us. This indicates high levels of retention, demonstrates our ongoing and increasing relevance we have with our customers and provides for a more stable and predictable forward financial model. However, as anticipated, we experienced modest declines in our perpetual license revenue tied to lower levels of market activity across a few of our software end markets and a difficult comp from a year ago. We discussed this on each of our last few calls, COVID is absolutely driving faster adoption of our SaaS or cloud-based recurring revenue solutions. This is a very healthy and positive trend.  Separately, we continue to see very nice momentum for our products and software used in the fight against COVID. Most notably, our laboratory software businesses continue to see strong demand as we're helping stand up and maintain health system and country level COVID testing capability. In addition, Verathon, our largest medical product business continues to drive meaningful market adoption across their video intubation product line.  The final operating item I'll point out here is, at the onset is the fact that Neptune and our short cycle industrial businesses started to rebound in the quarter from which we draw encouragement. From a financial point of view, our organic revenues declined 3%. Our gross margin were 64% and our operating profitability remained very strong with 37% EBITDA margins. Most importantly, we grew our cash flow double-digits again. Turning to our acquisition activities, we completed four acquisitions for a total of $5.8 billion of capital deployment, certainly led by our $5.35 billion acquisition of Vertafore. More on these when we turn to our next slide.  Finally, the team was successful in the debt capital markets completing a $2.7 billion bond offering with a blended rate of 1.3% and increasing our revolver capacity to $3 billion that has an extended maturity date. I'm super proud of our execution in this quarter with all three phases of our offense on full display: Solid operating performance across the enterprise; $5.8 billion of CRI accretive capital deployment; and successfully executing a capital market transaction at extremely favorable interest rates. Now let's turn to our next slide and talk to our recent acquisitions. Okay, this was a very strong quarter for us relative to our capital deployment strategy. As we mentioned for several calls, the quality and quantity of ideas in our M&A pipeline has been robust for quite some time. We were very selective in our approach for landing on these acquisitions highlighted on this page. First, we completed the acquisition of Vertafore for $5.35 billion. I refer you to the call we did just after announcing this transaction for all the relevant details. But the highlight, Vertafore is a business that delivers cloud-based software to the property and casualty insurance industry principally in United States. Vertafore\u2019s focus is straightforward, to simplify, automate and drive productivity across the complex and highly regulated processes in the P&C space. Today, the business serves over 20,000 independent agencies, 1,000 insured carriers and touches over 140 billion of premiums per year. And high quality management teams motivated to build their businesses are super important for us. And to that end, Amy and her team have done a tremendous job building this business over the last several years. We expect Vertafore will deliver about $590 million of revenue and $290 million of EBITDA next year.  Separately, we announced and closed three strategic add-ons, one for Strata, and two for iPipeline. Relative to Strata, we acquired EPSi. As reminder, both Strata and EPSi deliver decision support, financial planning and analytic software solutions that help hospitals manage their cost structure, and identify opportunities for operational improvements. Strata, when combined with EPSi, would serve over 400 health systems and 2000 hospitals. The aggregate spending power of this combined customer base is approximately $1 trillion, or about 25% of the total healthcare spend in the U.S. The combination of Strata and EPSi will be a powerful one for the market and our customers. Relative by iPipeline, we acquired both WELIS and IFS. WELIS is a nice product tuck-in that enhances iPipeline\u2019s life insurance and annuity illustration capability. For those who don't know, the illustration is the modeled value calculation that permanent insurance carriers are required to provide to their insurers. IFS enhances iPipeline's capabilities to better serve the financial planning channel relative to life insurance account management. We expect these three bolt-ons will deliver about $75 million of revenue and $30 million of EBITDA next year. We're looking at each of these deals either individually or together, they are right down the middle for us. Each business has very strong cash flow capability, which is punctuated by being super asset light. Also, these businesses are, as our most Roper businesses, market leaders in their niche. Over the years when we refer to niche we mean smaller markets. We like small markets, small towns provide deterrence for new potential entrance. On top of this, these and other Roper businesses provide deeply verticalized solutions. By this, we mean solutions that are specifically developed to address unique industry workflows or challenges.  It is at the cross section of; one, being the market leader; two, operating in smaller markets; and three, delivering vertical solutions that enable our businesses to have intense customer intimacy. This intimacy enables our businesses to invest at the pace our customers require. Importantly, these four businesses have very high levels of recurring revenue. For instance, Vertafore has over 90% returns.  Finally, these businesses grow nicely on an organic basis. Their growth drivers are diversified and are multiple. We expect these businesses to grow mid-single-digits over the long arc of time. Taken together, the $5.8 billion in capital deployment should deliver about $665 million in revenue, and $320 million of EBITDA to our enterprise in 2021. In a few pages, Rob will discuss our financing package for these deals which as you likely know by now was quite good.  So now, I'm going to hand it over to Rob, but look forward to discussing our activities here more during the Q&A. Rob, your ball.\nRob Crisci : Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest as always in Roper Technologies. Turning to Page 7, looking at our Q3 income statement performance. Total revenue increased 1% to $1.369 billion. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 3% versus prior year, similar to what we saw in Q2 and about what we would expect for Q4 as the pandemic continues.  We had positive organic revenue growth in both Network Software & Systems and Measurement & Analytical Solutions. We had a slight organic decline in Application Software due to the difficult perpetual license comp we discussed last quarter. Lastly, and similar to Q2, we experienced a 25% decline in our smallest segment, Process Technologies. Margin performance was once again quite strong with gross margin of 64.2% and EBITDA margin down 10 basis points versus prior year, but up quite a bit sequentially to 36.6%. EBITDA grew in the quarter despite the pandemic to a Q3 record of $501 million.  Tax rate came in at 22.2%, which was a couple of points higher than last year. So that all results in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.17 which was well above our guidance range aided by both better organic performance and some accretion from our Vertafore acquisition. So once again, strong execution by our business leaders in a very challenging environment.  Next slide, turning to Page 8 on net working capital. Here we look at the three year trend on working capital which continues to improve. You may recall we exited last quarter with negative working capital of minus 5.4%. And now we further improved working capital as a percent of revenue down to minus 6.3%. Continuing to improve on these important working capital metrics, despite the challenging macro environment really is a testament to the excellent work of our finance organizations across the Roper Enterprise. Our people do a really good job of focusing on what matters. We will see more evidence of this as we move forward to look at cash flow and cash conversion on the next few slides.  Next slide. Turning to Page 9 on compounding cash flow. Really amazing as Neil had mentioned to have our third straight quarter of double-digit cash flow growth in 2020. As we discussed last quarter, for better compatibility and clarity, we adjusted our results for the $124 million of cash tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to COVID-19. So that adjustment hurt our numbers in Q2 and helps us in Q3 but has no net impact on our year-to-date results. Next year, we expect the IRS to return back to their normal schedule.  We do have one additional adjustment this quarter, as Zack mentioned, for the $192 million of cash taxes that we paid in the quarter that were due from the 2019 Gatan divestiture. So none of those adjustments, Q3 operating cash flow grew 12% to $454 million, which represented 33% of revenue. Q3 free cash flow grew 14% to $442 million, which represented 32% of revenue. And you can see on the right hand side on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted free cash flow was up 13% to $1.1 billion. So as a takeaway reads, really consistent cash flow performance in a very challenging environment.  Next slide, on Page 10, turning to Roper's strong cash conversion. So through three quarters of 2020, 28% of our revenue and 78% of our EBITDA has converted to free cash flow. So comparing our 2020 year-to-date to our full year cash conversion over the past few years, we actually see that we are trending ahead of where we've been historically on cash conversion. Even better, Q4 is typically a seasonally strong quarter for cash conversion driven by annual billing cycles and lower tax payments. So, we are quite confident we are heading for a very strong cash result in 2020. Our consistently high cash conversion is important because it further demonstrates the high quality of our EBITDA, which allows us to quickly and predictably reduce leverage after large acquisitions. Next slide, turning to Page 11, updating on our balance sheet. So you can see here where we stand after the completion of the Vertafore acquisition in September. Our cash balance is reduced to a normal level of about $300 million, down from $1.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. That excess cash was used to partially fund the acquisitions. Net debt to trailing EBITDA ended the quarter at 4.8 times. Importantly, this calculation does not include the pro forma impacts of the Vertafore acquisition. Including a full year of Vertafore\u2019s EBITDA would push this ratio down into the low 4s. We expect our leverage to decline quickly over the next year as the EBITDA flows through and we use our generated cash flow to reduce our debt.  Next slide. So on Page 12, we'll talk about the financing activities that occurred in the third quarter. Including the EPSi deal that closed in October, we recently deployed a little over $5.8 billion of capital financed by our excess cash on hand, a meaningful amount of which was generated from last year's Gatan divestiture, new investment grade debt and a draw on our credit facility. We launched a bond offering in August and benefited from strong demand from Roper's debt investors, consistent with what we had experienced when we accessed the high grade bond market in June. So we ended up spreading the $2.7 billion of principal over four tranches which resulted in a very good blended interest rate of 1.3% and duration of a little over seven years. Notably, and importantly, no changes to Roper credit ratings. We remain triple B plus at S&P and Baa2 at Moody's and we remain committed to maintaining solid investment grade ratings moving forward.  We also successfully extended our revolving credit facility out three years and also upsized it from $2.5 billion to $3 billion. The current floating borrowing rate on the revolver is about 1.2%. So we like to strike a balance between fixed rate debt and prepayable floating debt to enable us to delever quickly.  So in summary, these financing activities are consistent with our long-term strategy of augmenting our internally generated cash flow with investment grade debt. Then we use our consistent and durable cash flow generation to rapidly reduce leverage, which we plan to do over the next 12 to 18 months.  So with that, I'll pass it back over to Neil.\nNeil Hunn : Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $451 million, down 1% on an organic basis; EBITDA was $201 million or 44.6% of revenue. Similar to the way we started our commentary about this segment during our last call, our retention rates and thus our recurring revenues remained strong in the quarter. In addition, we're continuing to see an acceleration of our Software as a Service or cloud solutions across this segment. This trend will provide a long-term benefit for both our customers and for our business. Our customers outsource the operations of their software applications to us and gain the benefit of being on the most recent software release at all times. Our businesses are improved by having higher levels of recurring revenue and customer intimacy. Importantly, we believe this migration to the cloud will be a net growth driver for us. So based on this SaaS migration trend, and our continued high levels of customer retention, we saw recurring revenues grow mid-single-digits in the quarter. We expect this strength to continue into next year. As an offset, and as expected, we saw declines in our perpetual revenue stream for two reasons: first, a difficult prior year license comp; and second, a slowing of new logo licenses associated with the current macro headwinds.  Things remain solid at Deltek. We saw normalized bookings increase double-digits in the quarter, coming off very large perpetual bookings a quarter ago. They were seeing particular strength across their GovCon offerings and with their subscription content solutions. Recurring revenues are up double-digits versus this time last year. And as you'll note towards the bottom of this page, a business that has been negatively impacted in this segment is CBORD. To remind everyone, CBORD designs and delivers K-12 and university campus integrated security and nutrition management solutions. Given the fact that many educational campuses are deferring in-person attendance, this business is negatively impacted in the short run. As soon as in-person classes resume, we expect CBORD to return to normal levels of growth. Our laboratory software businesses, Sunquest, Data Innovations and CliniSys all performed nicely, aided by global demand to deploy laboratory software associated with combating COVID-19. A good example we're talking about here is the activity CliniSys is helping drive. Specifically, CliniSys is the IT backbone for the French and Belgian national COVID testing programs. You'll also note from the page that Data Innovations, our diagnostic middleware business, had record orders in the quarter, congrats to the team at Vermont. With this being said, we do expect some of this COVID strength to moderate going forward. Also, we continue to see strength in Strata. One of the nice perks of having Strata in the family of business is this learning from their hospital analytics. From Strata's research, we know that hospital volumes are normalizing in the 90% to 95% pre-COVID level. In addition, most hospitals have enacted cost measures to right-size their operating structures for this level of patient activity. Given our healthcare, IT and medical product businesses primarily serve the hospital market, we take confidence that patient volumes are coming back and hope to see the associated hospital capital spending come back online next year. Finally, we will be reporting Vertafore and the EPSi-Strata bolt-on in this segment. As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect this segment to be flat on an organic basis, principally for the reasons just discussed. We expect to see continued high levels of recurring revenue retention. As a reminder, the vast majority of our customers in this segment are enterprise or larger companies. That said, we do anticipate some continued pressure on our upfront software license sales. We're encouraged by seeing our sales pipeline activity being higher than this time a year ago, but we continue to expect our new logo prospects decision timeframes to extend longer than our historical experience, which leads deals likely moving into next year. All-in-all, we expect flat organic growth, but with a higher-quality revenue mix towards recurring versus perpetual. With that, next slide, please. Now let's turn to our Network segment. Revenues here increased 1% organically to $430 million. EBITDA was $180 million or 41.8% of revenue. I'd like to start, and as a reminder, that our software businesses in this segment principally share highly recurring SaaS revenue models, which are further aided by strong network effects that drive high retention rates, which was certainly the case in this quarter. The entire segment, similar to that of the Application Software segment, we saw mid-single-digit organic increases in recurring revenue.  ConstructConnect continues to perform well. Their network expanded in the quarter and was driven by strong customer adds and network utilization. DAT continues to post record quarters. This quarter is highlighted by record net addition of carriers to the network and enterprise brokerage seats fully recovering to pre-COVID. In addition, iPipeline's SHP and SoftWriters all continue to be strong. A couple of our software businesses in this segment are facing modest headwinds, each of which are short-term and tied to COVID-related economic activity. iTrade is being negatively impacted as food volumes in institutional settings, such as restaurants and sporting events are down. As these activities come back online, so will iTrade's growth. Also, MHA was down a bit in the third quarter as well, directly resulting from patient volumes and long-term care being down. We expect MHA to recover starting in the fourth quarter. Of note, during the quarter, Foundry was awarded their first Engineering Emmy Award for visual effect innovation used in television. The team at Foundry are super excited as they should be for this recognition, congrats. Finally, the TransCore New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project continues. However, the project at the election of our customer continues to slow and be pushed into 2021. Execution of the project remains quite strong, but the timing continues to elongate. In addition, a few other projects are slightly delayed as we near go live, causing some revenue and margin pressure in this segment. Now let's turn to our outlook for this segment. We see low-single-digit organic growth for the final quarter of the year. We continue to see growth and resiliency in our Network Software businesses driven by high recurring revenue mix, strong retention rates, and expanding networks and network participation. Relative to TransCore, we continue to see the New York City project pushing to the right. A few other projects being delayed and lower tag shipments due to the lower levels of vehicle traffic in 2020. All-in-all, again, we expect low-single-digit organic growth for the final quarter of the year. Next slide, please. Turning to our Measurement & Analytical segment. Revenues grew 2% organically to $368 million. EBITDA was $131 million or 35.7% of revenue. With the current pandemic backdrop, this segment's activities continue to be best broken into 4 boxes. One, Verathon and IPA; two, other medical product businesses; three, Neptune; and fourth, our industrial businesses. First, Verathon continues to experience high levels of demand for their GlideScope video intubation solutions. In this quarter, orders remained strong, and the company is able to clear much of the backlog that entered the quarter. As a result of COVID-19, the percentage of all intubations, not just COVID related that are being done using video assistance has meaningfully increased. We expect video assisted intubation market share to remain above pre-COVID levels going forward, which is a great long-term and recurring benefit for Verathon's business model. IPA continues to be strong as well. Second, and relative to our other medical product businesses, we did see revenue headwinds tied directly to lower patient volumes within acute care hospitals. We also note this group of companies normally grow mid-single-digits, but this growth is conditioned on normalized hospital activity. As hospital capital budgets begin to free up in 2021, we expect these businesses to return to a more normal state at some point next year. Third, Neptune improved sequentially but the pace of recovery was hampered a bit by continued restricted access to indoor meters, in particular, in the Northeast United States and Canada. Finally, and as expected, we did see recovery across our shorter-cycle industrial businesses. As we turn to the fourth quarter outlook, this will be the last quarter we have Gatan results in our prior period given its divestiture was in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see low-single-digit growth for this segment, led by continued strong but moderating demand at Verathon. Given the strength in 2020, Verathon continues to accelerate investments in both product and go-to-market areas. In addition, we do expect to see our other medical product businesses improve from historic lows, but as discussed, hospital spending continues to be somewhat uncertain for the near term.  We expect to see continued improvements at Neptune as they gain more access to indoor meters. And finally, we expect to see continued but likely modest short-cycle industrial improvement. Next slide, please. Now turning to the segment that represents 9% of our revenue, Process Technologies. Revenues were $120 million in the quarter, down 25% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $34 million or 28.4% of revenue. While these businesses are facing incredible market headwinds, they continue to demonstrate their resiliency with their 28% plus EBITDA margins. As we said for the last couple of quarters, this, too, was a difficult quarter for these businesses, and we expect the outlook to remain poor for the balance of the year. We saw our upstream businesses decline approximately 40%. CCC was weak based on their inability to perform field service work, again, related to COVID. Cornell declined on weakness in their rental markets but did grow in many of their other end markets. And a bright spot in the quarter was Zetec, which experienced growth based on the strength in their new non-disruptive testing products.  The outlook for the fourth quarter continues to be an extremely challenging one as we expect to see approximately 20% organic declines. Specifically, we do not anticipate any recovery in upstream oil and gas markets but do anticipate sequential and seasonal improvement from many of the other businesses in this segment. Next slide, please. As we turn to our guidance, we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $12.55 and $12.65 per share. The increase is principally attributed to the acquisitions closed since our last call. Full year revenue and EBITDA are expected to increase in the range of 2% to 3%. Our organic revenue outlook for the full year now leans to be flat to slightly down, perhaps 1% or so. Back in April, we guided revenues to be plus or minus flat, now flat to down 1%. While there are several puts and takes, the primary assumption that changed is the substantial amount of revenue tied to the TransCore New York City project pushing into 2021. The majority of other businesses have improved versus our April outlook. For the fourth quarter, we are establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.39 and $3.49 per share. We expect consolidated organic growth to be similar to that of the third quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter is expected to be about 20%. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. In closing, I'll recap with what we started. Strong execution across the three parts of our offense: operational; capital deployment; and capital markets. Operationally, revenue grew 1% overall and declined 3% on an organic basis. EBITDA grew and margins remained strong. Most importantly, free cash flow grew 14% in the quarter. Throughout this year, our asset-light niche and market-leading businesses remain focused on investing for higher levels of long-term and sustainable organic growth. As such, this year, we are seeing increased levels of R&D across many of our businesses. Also, and it's worth repeating, we meaningfully enhanced our portfolio by successfully deploying $5.8 billion. Following these acquisitions, two-thirds of Roper's EBITDA will be generated from our software group of businesses. These acquisitions further add to our recurring revenue profile and our ability to compound our cash flows moving forward. Given our recent capital deployment and our commitment to investment-grade ratings, we are focusing our efforts for the next few quarters on operating our businesses and generating our durable cash flow, which will allow us to delever just as we did following our Deltek acquisition in 2016. So with all of this, we continue to be bullish about the coming quarter, about 2021 and about our longer-term future. And finally, and relative to our long-term strategy model, I'll conclude by highlighting, we compound cash flow. That's our job. Our cash flows are remarkably durable as demonstrated this year. We do this by operating a portfolio of businesses that have leading positions in small, niche and growing markets. Also, our businesses, whether our product or software, deliver highly application-specific or vertical solutions. Taken together, our businesses are awarded with intense customer intimacy. This intimacy allows us to innovate at the pace required by our customers. Our businesses have high-margin and asset-light economic models that naturally generate high levels of operating cash flow as they grow. To this end, we incent our management teams based on growth. And finally, we take the excess free cash flow generated by our businesses. And by this, we mean the cash flow that the businesses generate beyond investments required to drive organic growth, combine it with investment-grade leverage, and acquire businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company, that in turn, improve Roper and further accelerate our cash flow compounding. This very model, this very strategy, are the simple ideas that deliver our powerful results. So with that, let's get to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray : I was hoping you could quantify the revenue push out for the New York City congestion tolling project. We've been thinking $30 million in the fourth quarter. So that's obviously lower, but hopefully you can quantify that. And can you clarify whether there's been any change in scope? Or are these pushouts more as a result of COVID kind of logistics?\nNeil Hunn : Yes, Dean, it's Neil. I'll take the second half of your question and give the first half to Rob. So scope is completely unchanged. The project continues, it's just slower, pushing a little bit as we discussed in the prepared remarks into next year. But yes, the scope is fully intact.\nRob Crisci: Yes. So it's continuing, as Neil mentioned. And so there's now, we've got about $100 million for the project this year, right? So maybe that's down $10 million or so versus what we said last quarter.\nDeane Dray : Got it. And then I don't know if it would be Neil or Rob, but could you expand the point on fourth quarter seasonality. Maybe you can start with the free cash flow expectations because just given the macro, you're concerned about what might be seasonally normal, what might not happen or play out the same? And then within the businesses, is there -- just remind us on where and how you would expect a seasonal impact in the fourth quarter?\nRob Crisci : Sure. So on cash flow, as I mentioned earlier, we feel great about where the conversion is year-to-date and Q4 is generally a high cash conversion quarter because of the annual billing of the software businesses. And the fact that we don't have -- most of the tax payments are usually in the first half of the year. So tax payments are less in the fourth quarter. On the seasonality. So yes, I think it's a good point. I mean, normally, if you go back historically, right, when Roper was more of the cyclical businesses, as a percent, you'd get the Q4 bump in what used to be our energy segment. So there's some of that. I think, sequentially, we still have -- it's just a very small part of Roper, what's happening this year, as Neil mentioned, is our medical product businesses, really specifically, Verathon had an enormous second and third quarter driven by the COVID surge. And so their fourth quarter versus the third quarter is down about $30 million of revenue. And they're still up quite a bit year-over-year. And we're hopeful that happens, right? If the COVID surge gets worse, then Verathon will sell more products, but we're hoping that doesn't happen. So that's what's all included in our guidance for Q4.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak : Just want to go to your comments around iTrade and Foundry. Understanding COVID is certainly having disruption. But obviously, those markets are quite a bit more challenged than maybe others. Are you seeing any sort of longer-term impairment to some of those customers? Any color?\nNeil Hunn: No, I don't think so at all. Take iTrade, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, I mean, that business is partially indexed to sort of the institutional food, and that's also partially indexed to retail. So institutional down, retail up, it just balances a little bit towards the negative. The renewal rates for the more institutional side have been fine. There's no -- they're not dropping off. Obviously, the contract sizes have gotten a little smaller, but the retention rates of the actual customers are the same. On Foundry, Foundry has had a good year. Recurring revenues are up. The EBITDA is up in that business. It's just there's the way that the flow of work happens in converting live production into post and to releasing content, either film or television. There was a fair amount of backlog being worked on in the first half of the year. Then there was this pause in 2Q of live action, came back on slowly in Q3. It's fully ramped up right now across the globe. That creates more content for post. And so there's a couple of quarters inside the middle of this year where the number of net new software sales to new customers paused or waned a bit, but the recurrence was high and we expect that to fully bounce back as the pipeline is filling back up with content.\nAllison Poliniak : Understood. And then just kind of going back to TransCore and some of the other projects. Anything tied to municipal in your portfolio that you're starting to see incremental challenges or delays there?\nNeil Hunn: I would say no. I mean, if you -- on the municipal side, the -- on TransCore, no, I mean, the bidding activity, the sort of the sales pipeline of the TransCore are quite good. There are a large number of projects that are sort of in the process of being awarded now. So that's a good leading indicator. The municipal budgets at Neptune are largely intact and then renewed and sort of dollars are being spent against them on that municipal side. So no, I mean, I think we feel pretty good about the spending -- the budgets that are out there to be spent across the municipal parts of our business.\nRob Crisci : Yes. It\u2019s really just project slowing, which is probably mostly due to COVID, right? It's just things are just taking longer to get going at TransCore for the most part.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn : So I was curious about Sunquest. It sounds like you have some fresh momentum going there. Are you moving past the kind of net attrition, modest slide that, that business has been seeing?\nNeil Hunn: So I\u2019d characterize Sunquest -- hey, they've had just a great year. They're actually going to be up a little bit in EBITDA this year versus last year. Based on all the activities going on around COVID and a little bit of strength we're seeing in the diagnostic, the molecular part of their business, a new product offering and some public health offerings they have as well. That said, I think we still got -- I sort of view this year as a pause in the longer-term trend. I would expect that business to have faced a little bit, maybe a year or so, maybe it's hard to pinpoint it precisely, but call it a year to 2 of headwinds, then it will normalize, stabilize and get back into sort of maybe a low-single-digit organic growth sort of business.\nChristopher Glynn : Okay. And as you're focused on debt reduction in the next year, year and a half, would you still anticipate some EPSi or WELIS type of additions to existing platforms?\nNeil Hunn: It was going to be -- the bar is very high for those. It wouldn't surprise me. That said, if there was a little bit of bolt-on activity, but our principal focus here is to deleverage for the next year or so.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa : Can you just give us some color on how, with a little more precision, your revenue performed in license, maintenance and recurring? I mean, you guys are definitely giving a lot more really solid color directionally on this stuff. But just love to understand, you can talk about it enterprise-wise, if you want. Just a little more precision on kind of how those 3 buckets performed in the quarter?\nRob Crisci: Yes. So I think overall, recurring revenue, which right is maintenance plus subscription, as I think Neil mentioned earlier, was up mid-single digits. The license and the services piece is impacted by COVID, as we talked about all throughout the year. So there's some declines there, and that's what we get you to that. Basically, overall, the software businesses were in line, a tad better than we had coming in really since the pandemic began. I think overall, our software revenue is about 80% recurring, and that's the maintenance and the subscription piece, which continues to grow. Our retention rates continue to be very, very high. So it all bodes well for next year when the services and the perpetual stuff should start to come back.\nSteve Tusa: So I guess, shouldn't that be dilutive to margins for you guys? Is it, aren't licensed higher-margin than the recurring side?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I mean, the perpetual\u2026.. \nRob Crisci : Not services. \nNeil Hunn : Yes, perpetual licenses or high-margin services is the lowest margin part of a software business and recurring revenue was quite high, as you know. Also, these -- not just us, pretty much every business on the planet, their cost structure is lower this year because of the COVID -- you just couldn't spend money on travel and customer meetings and things like that. So that became a natural offset to some of the perpetual headwinds.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hou: This is Jeff Hou on for Julian. Maybe just asking on, you guys mentioned the short-cycle business is seeing a bit of recovery here. Any -- is there any color you can give on sort of how the cadence of that has looked? Was there some pent-up demand earlier in the quarter? Or are we still seeing kind of more gradual sequential improvement that should continue ahead? \nNeil Hunn: Yes. I appreciate the question. It's such a small part of our business, we reported and talked about last quarter is the consumable piece was starting to pick up. That continued -- the strength of that continued through the quarter. We saw some pickup of the capital spending, particularly at our Struers business. I think the pace throughout the quarter was just improving a little bit sequentially through the quarter. I mean, it was pretty straightforward for us.\nRob Crisci: Yes, very gradual sequential improvement. That's a good way of stating it.\nJeff Hou: Thanks for that. And then Rob, you touched on it earlier, but obviously, we're seeing COVID cases and hospitalization rates kind of going up over the past week or two. How does this kind of line up with the Q4 outlook and sort of the expectations for the medical businesses that are benefiting from COVID, the ones that are sort of -- would benefit from more normalization?\nRob Crisci: Yes. So we've really had 5 businesses this year, right, that have benefited from COVID financially. Verathon, IPA, we talked a lot about in our 3 businesses and our laboratory software platform, and they're all at the frontlines of fighting this thing. And so there would be some give and take, if COVID surged and you had more hospitalizations, which I don't think has happened yet, if that started to happen and those businesses would probably do more and then that could hurt other areas. So it's great of having this big diversified portfolio of businesses. Whereas we'll do great in a post-COVID world, we can't wait for it to happen, but you get a little bit of financial benefit in the short-term. Do you have anything to add to that, Neil?\nNeil Hunn: No.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis : What you -- I'm sure you guys have seen the news with all these new stacks coming out, seems to be literally hundreds of them, but -- or many of them, I should say. Is there any concern that, that's going to provide a new competitor for you guys? Or do you think you're too niche for really that type of a vehicle?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So we spent a little bit of time on this. We've got some -- we studied it with some advisers on this very question, Scott, is that a new competitor emerging for capital deployment. And our conclusion to that is no. And the reason is that a SPAC -- the seller is obviously doing a backdoor IPO. The seller is getting a percentage of their proceeds at closing, not the whole thing. And then you also -- there's other factors around the business dynamic and the leadership team and the ability for it to be a public company that investors have appetite for. And so principally, no. Could there be 1 or 2 on the fringe? Maybe, but it's not like a full-on competitor relative to our capital deployment. And by the way, SPACs have been around in big volume for the last 3 or 4 years, it's obviously increased a bit here. There'll be a lot of the SPAC money that doesn't get deployed or recycled. It's just because you raised, it doesn't mean that the deal is going to happen. And so it's not a totally new phenomenon. It's just catching some, obviously, mainstream media right now.\nScott Davis : Yes. Makes sense. I'm glad you've studied it. But a question about Vertafore. The SaaS versus perpetual, obviously, higher than most of the other software businesses you have. Is there a particular reason why that product sells better into a SaaS versus perpetual? Or is it -- how you go-to-market and how you price it? Is it the product or is it the pricing? I guess is kind of the question. \nNeil Hunn : Well, I think it's that they started the journey to migrating to SaaS earlier than many of our other businesses. So they just got to the point where they have about 80% deployed in SaaS and a little over 90% recurring to their revenue stream. Where, for instance, Deltek is midstream in that conversion, going that way, by the way, I mean Deltek is 75% recurring, pushing to 80% this year, and it'll get -- fast forward 5 years, it'll look more like [Mike Deltek]. And then companies like CBORD, Aderant, PowerPlan are just beginning that migration. Again, all of this paced by our customers. Our customers decide when they're ready to go to the cloud and when the value and when the timing is right for them. And because of that pacing it elongates over multiple years. We don't run sort of any of this Adobe risk where you have the J-curve and go backwards before you go forward. And as we said many, many times, this is all a net growth driver for us as you migrate that, the maintenance part up to the cloud, you get an uplift on that. And then obviously, you're selling net new SaaS licenses which drive your recurring revenue base up. I think it's just that Vertafore started earlier in this process than some of our other companies. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: I just wanted to understand the puts and takes in the guide here. So like -- I think you beat the midpoint of your prior guide by $0.22. You're raising the full year by $0.45. How much of that incremental is from the deals? And how would we think about like the core guidance ex the M&A versus what it was 3 months ago?\nRob Crisci: Yes. So think of the deals is $0.45 to $0.50 to the second half. Some of that we got in Q3, about $0.12 and the rest in Q4. And then everything else is pretty much a wash. There's $0.04 or $0.05 from tax. There's the Verathon and TransCore sort of pushed to the right. And then quite frankly, a lot of investment that we're doing in the fourth quarter with businesses like Verathon, to continue to position ourselves well for next year. So think about the operational stuff as sort of washed in. So when you add the M&A, there\u2019s the midpoint change.\nJoe Giordano : Okay. Fair enough. And then just curious on Deltek. What are your guys there saying about like the potential for that business in Biden administration, given the spending plans that they have and things like that?\nNeil Hunn : Yes. It's -- often -- it's a frequent question around elections for Deltek that goes back a lot of years, many elections. And what -- the short answer is, either administration, either way is fine for Deltek. The principal reason for that is these government subcontractors just gravitate towards the rapid or fast current government spending. And so for instance, with Obama, it was healthcare; if Biden wins, it\u2019s infrastructure. They will just migrate. And so that where that spending is. There might be a few incremental sort of subcontractors -- government subcontractors that might show up in infrastructure, though it might be a little bit incrementally then special for Deltek but not a meaningful growth driver. The great thing about this business is it does well in almost any government spending environment because as you know government spending always increases.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Blake Gendron with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBlake Gendron : So we've been focused on the better-than-expected recovery in non-emergent hospital activity. You mentioned, and you've been very descriptive with the Verathon, IPA impacts of COVID. So wondering if this healthcare recovery is driving somewhat of a subdued non-emergent healthcare exposed businesses versus the Verathon and IPA tailwinds? I'm just wondering how we in aggregate maybe frame the improvement in the non-emergent side of the healthcare business?\nRob Crisci : Yes. So the other medical products businesses that aren't Verathon, right, have been down this year quite a bit. So really double-digits, and that's starting to moderate a little bit in the fourth quarter, whether they're going to be probably more flattish year-over-year. And then they would grow quite a bit coming out of that, right? These are the businesses, as Neil has mentioned, that grow mid-single-digit organically like clockwork literally going back 10 years. And so as you get more procedures happening, then those businesses become -- get back to normal and probably have some catch-up as well.\nNeil Hunn : Yes. And just a little more color on that. I mean, hospitals, like a lot of businesses, right, when things got economically really challenged and patient volumes were down quite a bit in Q2 and coming into Q3, hospitals may took dramatic cost actions on the operating side, but also basically froze all capital spending. And hospital budgets as they cycle back in next year, there'll be some level of capital spending, and that's likely going to be on things that are more akin to what we do. I mean, we're like mainstream procedure type things, not esoteric or sort of super high-technology that is super high dollar and sometimes questionable at the hospital level.\nBlake Gendron : Understood. And just a follow-up here. So the question was asked last quarter, businesses like that and ConstructConnect getting more sign-on, just given the sheer dynamism in the market. The shorter-cycle industrial recovery broadly seems to be plateauing or stabilizing. How do you expect this to impact new logos in some of these businesses versus the opportunity to expand existing customer touches through things like product enhancement, perhaps R&D maybe is folded in here?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So a couple of things on ConstructConnect. The business has been -- the team there spent really 3 years building the software capability that's part of the workflow of both general contractors and subcontractors and building product manufacturers. It's no longer just a content business, essentially identifying leads for new projects, really working to drive habitualization of the software and the daily workflow of all the users. And so when you get into an environment like the one we're in, the environment opens up, meaning there's more people that are looking for work. So they come to ConstructConnect and buy the first product. The cross-sell into some of the workflow products, now we actually have the ability to do it, and we're seeing decent and better-than-decent attach rates at multiple products. And importantly, then we're seeing what we hope to see, which is the increase of the daily use. And so we think the long-term retention rates will be higher.  We think this is going to continue for quite some time. I mean, ConstructConnect services, sub-10% of the market and there's 90% of the market is unvended. And that market is the one that -- unvended market is the one that is coming to ConstructConnect in an environment like this.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let's go ahead and get into this morning's content. And as we always do, we'll start by reviewing our agenda. I'll begin discussing our enterprise highlights for the quarter, which was a very busy and very productive quarter for us. To that end, I'll briefly review our acquisition activity. Rob will then discuss our financial performance and capital market activity. Afterwards, I'll walk through a detailed segment review and associated outlook, followed by our enterprise fourth quarter and raised full year guidance. We will then look forward to your questions.  Now with that, let's turn to a brief run through of our Q3 enterprise highlights. Next slide please. Third quarter demonstrated the strength our execution capabilities. First, on an operating basis. Second, on a capital deployment basis. And finally, from a capital markets perspective. Operationally, our revenues and EBITDA continue to grow, albeit modestly, despite the well documented economic challenges resulting from the pandemic situation we're all facing.  At a summary level, our software recurring revenues continue to grow. Recurring revenue growth is very important for us. This indicates high levels of retention, demonstrates our ongoing and increasing relevance we have with our customers and provides for a more stable and predictable forward financial model. However, as anticipated, we experienced modest declines in our perpetual license revenue tied to lower levels of market activity across a few of our software end markets and a difficult comp from a year ago. We discussed this on each of our last few calls, COVID is absolutely driving faster adoption of our SaaS or cloud-based recurring revenue solutions. This is a very healthy and positive trend.  Separately, we continue to see very nice momentum for our products and software used in the fight against COVID. Most notably, our laboratory software businesses continue to see strong demand as we're helping stand up and maintain health system and country level COVID testing capability. In addition, Verathon, our largest medical product business continues to drive meaningful market adoption across their video intubation product line.  The final operating item I'll point out here is, at the onset is the fact that Neptune and our short cycle industrial businesses started to rebound in the quarter from which we draw encouragement. From a financial point of view, our organic revenues declined 3%. Our gross margin were 64% and our operating profitability remained very strong with 37% EBITDA margins. Most importantly, we grew our cash flow double-digits again. Turning to our acquisition activities, we completed four acquisitions for a total of $5.8 billion of capital deployment, certainly led by our $5.35 billion acquisition of Vertafore. More on these when we turn to our next slide.  Finally, the team was successful in the debt capital markets completing a $2.7 billion bond offering with a blended rate of 1.3% and increasing our revolver capacity to $3 billion that has an extended maturity date. I'm super proud of our execution in this quarter with all three phases of our offense on full display: Solid operating performance across the enterprise; $5.8 billion of CRI accretive capital deployment; and successfully executing a capital market transaction at extremely favorable interest rates. Now let's turn to our next slide and talk to our recent acquisitions. Okay, this was a very strong quarter for us relative to our capital deployment strategy. As we mentioned for several calls, the quality and quantity of ideas in our M&A pipeline has been robust for quite some time. We were very selective in our approach for landing on these acquisitions highlighted on this page. First, we completed the acquisition of Vertafore for $5.35 billion. I refer you to the call we did just after announcing this transaction for all the relevant details. But the highlight, Vertafore is a business that delivers cloud-based software to the property and casualty insurance industry principally in United States. Vertafore's focus is straightforward, to simplify, automate and drive productivity across the complex and highly regulated processes in the P&C space. Today, the business serves over 20,000 independent agencies, 1,000 insured carriers and touches over 140 billion of premiums per year. And high quality management teams motivated to build their businesses are super important for us. And to that end, Amy and her team have done a tremendous job building this business over the last several years. We expect Vertafore will deliver about $590 million of revenue and $290 million of EBITDA next year.  Separately, we announced and closed three strategic add-ons, one for Strata, and two for iPipeline. Relative to Strata, we acquired EPSi. As reminder, both Strata and EPSi deliver decision support, financial planning and analytic software solutions that help hospitals manage their cost structure, and identify opportunities for operational improvements. Strata, when combined with EPSi, would serve over 400 health systems and 2000 hospitals. The aggregate spending power of this combined customer base is approximately $1 trillion, or about 25% of the total healthcare spend in the U.S. The combination of Strata and EPSi will be a powerful one for the market and our customers. Relative by iPipeline, we acquired both WELIS and IFS. WELIS is a nice product tuck-in that enhances iPipeline's life insurance and annuity illustration capability. For those who don't know, the illustration is the modeled value calculation that permanent insurance carriers are required to provide to their insurers. IFS enhances iPipeline's capabilities to better serve the financial planning channel relative to life insurance account management. We expect these three bolt-ons will deliver about $75 million of revenue and $30 million of EBITDA next year. We're looking at each of these deals either individually or together, they are right down the middle for us. Each business has very strong cash flow capability, which is punctuated by being super asset light. Also, these businesses are, as our most Roper businesses, market leaders in their niche. Over the years when we refer to niche we mean smaller markets. We like small markets, small towns provide deterrence for new potential entrance. On top of this, these and other Roper businesses provide deeply verticalized solutions. By this, we mean solutions that are specifically developed to address unique industry workflows or challenges.  It is at the cross section of; one, being the market leader; two, operating in smaller markets; and three, delivering vertical solutions that enable our businesses to have intense customer intimacy. This intimacy enables our businesses to invest at the pace our customers require. Importantly, these four businesses have very high levels of recurring revenue. For instance, Vertafore has over 90% returns.  Finally, these businesses grow nicely on an organic basis. Their growth drivers are diversified and are multiple. We expect these businesses to grow mid-single-digits over the long arc of time. Taken together, the $5.8 billion in capital deployment should deliver about $665 million in revenue, and $320 million of EBITDA to our enterprise in 2021. In a few pages, Rob will discuss our financing package for these deals which as you likely know by now was quite good.  So now, I'm going to hand it over to Rob, but look forward to discussing our activities here more during the Q&A. Rob, your ball. Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $451 million, down 1% on an organic basis; EBITDA was $201 million or 44.6% of revenue. Similar to the way we started our commentary about this segment during our last call, our retention rates and thus our recurring revenues remained strong in the quarter. In addition, we're continuing to see an acceleration of our Software as a Service or cloud solutions across this segment. This trend will provide a long-term benefit for both our customers and for our business. Our customers outsource the operations of their software applications to us and gain the benefit of being on the most recent software release at all times. Our businesses are improved by having higher levels of recurring revenue and customer intimacy. Importantly, we believe this migration to the cloud will be a net growth driver for us. So based on this SaaS migration trend, and our continued high levels of customer retention, we saw recurring revenues grow mid-single-digits in the quarter. We expect this strength to continue into next year. As an offset, and as expected, we saw declines in our perpetual revenue stream for two reasons: first, a difficult prior year license comp; and second, a slowing of new logo licenses associated with the current macro headwinds.  Things remain solid at Deltek. We saw normalized bookings increase double-digits in the quarter, coming off very large perpetual bookings a quarter ago. They were seeing particular strength across their GovCon offerings and with their subscription content solutions. Recurring revenues are up double-digits versus this time last year. And as you'll note towards the bottom of this page, a business that has been negatively impacted in this segment is CBORD. To remind everyone, CBORD designs and delivers K-12 and university campus integrated security and nutrition management solutions. Given the fact that many educational campuses are deferring in-person attendance, this business is negatively impacted in the short run. As soon as in-person classes resume, we expect CBORD to return to normal levels of growth. Our laboratory software businesses, Sunquest, Data Innovations and CliniSys all performed nicely, aided by global demand to deploy laboratory software associated with combating COVID-19. A good example we're talking about here is the activity CliniSys is helping drive. Specifically, CliniSys is the IT backbone for the French and Belgian national COVID testing programs. You'll also note from the page that Data Innovations, our diagnostic middleware business, had record orders in the quarter, congrats to the team at Vermont. With this being said, we do expect some of this COVID strength to moderate going forward. Also, we continue to see strength in Strata. One of the nice perks of having Strata in the family of business is this learning from their hospital analytics. From Strata's research, we know that hospital volumes are normalizing in the 90% to 95% pre-COVID level. In addition, most hospitals have enacted cost measures to right-size their operating structures for this level of patient activity. Given our healthcare, IT and medical product businesses primarily serve the hospital market, we take confidence that patient volumes are coming back and hope to see the associated hospital capital spending come back online next year. Finally, we will be reporting Vertafore and the EPSi-Strata bolt-on in this segment. As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect this segment to be flat on an organic basis, principally for the reasons just discussed. We expect to see continued high levels of recurring revenue retention. As a reminder, the vast majority of our customers in this segment are enterprise or larger companies. That said, we do anticipate some continued pressure on our upfront software license sales. We're encouraged by seeing our sales pipeline activity being higher than this time a year ago, but we continue to expect our new logo prospects decision timeframes to extend longer than our historical experience, which leads deals likely moving into next year. All-in-all, we expect flat organic growth, but with a higher-quality revenue mix towards recurring versus perpetual. With that, next slide, please. Now let's turn to our Network segment. Revenues here increased 1% organically to $430 million. EBITDA was $180 million or 41.8% of revenue. I'd like to start, and as a reminder, that our software businesses in this segment principally share highly recurring SaaS revenue models, which are further aided by strong network effects that drive high retention rates, which was certainly the case in this quarter. The entire segment, similar to that of the Application Software segment, we saw mid-single-digit organic increases in recurring revenue.  ConstructConnect continues to perform well. Their network expanded in the quarter and was driven by strong customer adds and network utilization. DAT continues to post record quarters. This quarter is highlighted by record net addition of carriers to the network and enterprise brokerage seats fully recovering to pre-COVID. In addition, iPipeline's SHP and SoftWriters all continue to be strong. A couple of our software businesses in this segment are facing modest headwinds, each of which are short-term and tied to COVID-related economic activity. iTrade is being negatively impacted as food volumes in institutional settings, such as restaurants and sporting events are down. As these activities come back online, so will iTrade's growth. Also, MHA was down a bit in the third quarter as well, directly resulting from patient volumes and long-term care being down. We expect MHA to recover starting in the fourth quarter. Of note, during the quarter, Foundry was awarded their first Engineering Emmy Award for visual effect innovation used in television. The team at Foundry are super excited as they should be for this recognition, congrats. Finally, the TransCore New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project continues. However, the project at the election of our customer continues to slow and be pushed into 2021. Execution of the project remains quite strong, but the timing continues to elongate. In addition, a few other projects are slightly delayed as we near go live, causing some revenue and margin pressure in this segment. Now let's turn to our outlook for this segment. We see low-single-digit organic growth for the final quarter of the year. We continue to see growth and resiliency in our Network Software businesses driven by high recurring revenue mix, strong retention rates, and expanding networks and network participation. Relative to TransCore, we continue to see the New York City project pushing to the right. A few other projects being delayed and lower tag shipments due to the lower levels of vehicle traffic in 2020. All-in-all, again, we expect low-single-digit organic growth for the final quarter of the year. Next slide, please. Turning to our Measurement & Analytical segment. Revenues grew 2% organically to $368 million. EBITDA was $131 million or 35.7% of revenue. With the current pandemic backdrop, this segment's activities continue to be best broken into 4 boxes. One, Verathon and IPA; two, other medical product businesses; three, Neptune; and fourth, our industrial businesses. First, Verathon continues to experience high levels of demand for their GlideScope video intubation solutions. In this quarter, orders remained strong, and the company is able to clear much of the backlog that entered the quarter. As a result of COVID-19, the percentage of all intubations, not just COVID related that are being done using video assistance has meaningfully increased. We expect video assisted intubation market share to remain above pre-COVID levels going forward, which is a great long-term and recurring benefit for Verathon's business model. IPA continues to be strong as well. Second, and relative to our other medical product businesses, we did see revenue headwinds tied directly to lower patient volumes within acute care hospitals. We also note this group of companies normally grow mid-single-digits, but this growth is conditioned on normalized hospital activity. As hospital capital budgets begin to free up in 2021, we expect these businesses to return to a more normal state at some point next year. Third, Neptune improved sequentially but the pace of recovery was hampered a bit by continued restricted access to indoor meters, in particular, in the Northeast United States and Canada. Finally, and as expected, we did see recovery across our shorter-cycle industrial businesses. As we turn to the fourth quarter outlook, this will be the last quarter we have Gatan results in our prior period given its divestiture was in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see low-single-digit growth for this segment, led by continued strong but moderating demand at Verathon. Given the strength in 2020, Verathon continues to accelerate investments in both product and go-to-market areas. In addition, we do expect to see our other medical product businesses improve from historic lows, but as discussed, hospital spending continues to be somewhat uncertain for the near term.  We expect to see continued improvements at Neptune as they gain more access to indoor meters. And finally, we expect to see continued but likely modest short-cycle industrial improvement. Next slide, please. Now turning to the segment that represents 9% of our revenue, Process Technologies. Revenues were $120 million in the quarter, down 25% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $34 million or 28.4% of revenue. While these businesses are facing incredible market headwinds, they continue to demonstrate their resiliency with their 28% plus EBITDA margins. As we said for the last couple of quarters, this, too, was a difficult quarter for these businesses, and we expect the outlook to remain poor for the balance of the year. We saw our upstream businesses decline approximately 40%. CCC was weak based on their inability to perform field service work, again, related to COVID. Cornell declined on weakness in their rental markets but did grow in many of their other end markets. And a bright spot in the quarter was Zetec, which experienced growth based on the strength in their new non-disruptive testing products.  The outlook for the fourth quarter continues to be an extremely challenging one as we expect to see approximately 20% organic declines. Specifically, we do not anticipate any recovery in upstream oil and gas markets but do anticipate sequential and seasonal improvement from many of the other businesses in this segment. Next slide, please. As we turn to our guidance, we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $12.55 and $12.65 per share. The increase is principally attributed to the acquisitions closed since our last call. Full year revenue and EBITDA are expected to increase in the range of 2% to 3%. Our organic revenue outlook for the full year now leans to be flat to slightly down, perhaps 1% or so. Back in April, we guided revenues to be plus or minus flat, now flat to down 1%. While there are several puts and takes, the primary assumption that changed is the substantial amount of revenue tied to the TransCore New York City project pushing into 2021. The majority of other businesses have improved versus our April outlook. For the fourth quarter, we are establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.39 and $3.49 per share. We expect consolidated organic growth to be similar to that of the third quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter is expected to be about 20%. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. In closing, I'll recap with what we started. Strong execution across the three parts of our offense: operational; capital deployment; and capital markets. Operationally, revenue grew 1% overall and declined 3% on an organic basis. EBITDA grew and margins remained strong. Most importantly, free cash flow grew 14% in the quarter. Throughout this year, our asset-light niche and market-leading businesses remain focused on investing for higher levels of long-term and sustainable organic growth. As such, this year, we are seeing increased levels of R&D across many of our businesses. Also, and it's worth repeating, we meaningfully enhanced our portfolio by successfully deploying $5.8 billion. Following these acquisitions, two-thirds of Roper's EBITDA will be generated from our software group of businesses. These acquisitions further add to our recurring revenue profile and our ability to compound our cash flows moving forward. Given our recent capital deployment and our commitment to investment-grade ratings, we are focusing our efforts for the next few quarters on operating our businesses and generating our durable cash flow, which will allow us to delever just as we did following our Deltek acquisition in 2016. So with all of this, we continue to be bullish about the coming quarter, about 2021 and about our longer-term future. And finally, and relative to our long-term strategy model, I'll conclude by highlighting, we compound cash flow. That's our job. Our cash flows are remarkably durable as demonstrated this year. We do this by operating a portfolio of businesses that have leading positions in small, niche and growing markets. Also, our businesses, whether our product or software, deliver highly application-specific or vertical solutions. Taken together, our businesses are awarded with intense customer intimacy. This intimacy allows us to innovate at the pace required by our customers. Our businesses have high-margin and asset-light economic models that naturally generate high levels of operating cash flow as they grow. To this end, we incent our management teams based on growth. And finally, we take the excess free cash flow generated by our businesses. And by this, we mean the cash flow that the businesses generate beyond investments required to drive organic growth, combine it with investment-grade leverage, and acquire businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company, that in turn, improve Roper and further accelerate our cash flow compounding. This very model, this very strategy, are the simple ideas that deliver our powerful results. So with that, let's get to your questions. Yes, Dean, it's Neil. I'll take the second half of your question and give the first half to Rob. So scope is completely unchanged. The project continues, it's just slower, pushing a little bit as we discussed in the prepared remarks into next year. But yes, the scope is fully intact. No, I don't think so at all. Take iTrade, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, I mean, that business is partially indexed to sort of the institutional food, and that's also partially indexed to retail. So institutional down, retail up, it just balances a little bit towards the negative. The renewal rates for the more institutional side have been fine. There's no -- they're not dropping off. Obviously, the contract sizes have gotten a little smaller, but the retention rates of the actual customers are the same. On Foundry, Foundry has had a good year. Recurring revenues are up. The EBITDA is up in that business. It's just there's the way that the flow of work happens in converting live production into post and to releasing content, either film or television. There was a fair amount of backlog being worked on in the first half of the year. Then there was this pause in 2Q of live action, came back on slowly in Q3. It's fully ramped up right now across the globe. That creates more content for post. And so there's a couple of quarters inside the middle of this year where the number of net new software sales to new customers paused or waned a bit, but the recurrence was high and we expect that to fully bounce back as the pipeline is filling back up with content. I would say no. I mean, if you -- on the municipal side, the -- on TransCore, no, I mean, the bidding activity, the sort of the sales pipeline of the TransCore are quite good. There are a large number of projects that are sort of in the process of being awarded now. So that's a good leading indicator. The municipal budgets at Neptune are largely intact and then renewed and sort of dollars are being spent against them on that municipal side. So no, I mean, I think we feel pretty good about the spending -- the budgets that are out there to be spent across the municipal parts of our business. So I'd characterize Sunquest -- hey, they've had just a great year. They're actually going to be up a little bit in EBITDA this year versus last year. Based on all the activities going on around COVID and a little bit of strength we're seeing in the diagnostic, the molecular part of their business, a new product offering and some public health offerings they have as well. That said, I think we still got -- I sort of view this year as a pause in the longer-term trend. I would expect that business to have faced a little bit, maybe a year or so, maybe it's hard to pinpoint it precisely, but call it a year to 2 of headwinds, then it will normalize, stabilize and get back into sort of maybe a low-single-digit organic growth sort of business. It was going to be -- the bar is very high for those. It wouldn't surprise me. That said, if there was a little bit of bolt-on activity, but our principal focus here is to deleverage for the next year or so. Yes. I mean, the perpetual..... Yes, perpetual licenses or high-margin services is the lowest margin part of a software business and recurring revenue was quite high, as you know. Also, these -- not just us, pretty much every business on the planet, their cost structure is lower this year because of the COVID -- you just couldn't spend money on travel and customer meetings and things like that. So that became a natural offset to some of the perpetual headwinds. Yes. I appreciate the question. It's such a small part of our business, we reported and talked about last quarter is the consumable piece was starting to pick up. That continued -- the strength of that continued through the quarter. We saw some pickup of the capital spending, particularly at our Struers business. I think the pace throughout the quarter was just improving a little bit sequentially through the quarter. I mean, it was pretty straightforward for us. No. Yes. So we spent a little bit of time on this. We've got some -- we studied it with some advisers on this very question, Scott, is that a new competitor emerging for capital deployment. And our conclusion to that is no. And the reason is that a SPAC -- the seller is obviously doing a backdoor IPO. The seller is getting a percentage of their proceeds at closing, not the whole thing. And then you also -- there's other factors around the business dynamic and the leadership team and the ability for it to be a public company that investors have appetite for. And so principally, no. Could there be 1 or 2 on the fringe? Maybe, but it's not like a full-on competitor relative to our capital deployment. And by the way, SPACs have been around in big volume for the last 3 or 4 years, it's obviously increased a bit here. There'll be a lot of the SPAC money that doesn't get deployed or recycled. It's just because you raised, it doesn't mean that the deal is going to happen. And so it's not a totally new phenomenon. It's just catching some, obviously, mainstream media right now. Well, I think it's that they started the journey to migrating to SaaS earlier than many of our other businesses. So they just got to the point where they have about 80% deployed in SaaS and a little over 90% recurring to their revenue stream. Where, for instance, Deltek is midstream in that conversion, going that way, by the way, I mean Deltek is 75% recurring, pushing to 80% this year, and it'll get -- fast forward 5 years, it'll look more like [Mike Deltek]. And then companies like CBORD, Aderant, PowerPlan are just beginning that migration. Again, all of this paced by our customers. Our customers decide when they're ready to go to the cloud and when the value and when the timing is right for them. And because of that pacing it elongates over multiple years. We don't run sort of any of this Adobe risk where you have the J-curve and go backwards before you go forward. And as we said many, many times, this is all a net growth driver for us as you migrate that, the maintenance part up to the cloud, you get an uplift on that. And then obviously, you're selling net new SaaS licenses which drive your recurring revenue base up. I think it's just that Vertafore started earlier in this process than some of our other companies. Yes. It's -- often -- it's a frequent question around elections for Deltek that goes back a lot of years, many elections. And what -- the short answer is, either administration, either way is fine for Deltek. The principal reason for that is these government subcontractors just gravitate towards the rapid or fast current government spending. And so for instance, with Obama, it was healthcare; if Biden wins, it's infrastructure. They will just migrate. And so that where that spending is. There might be a few incremental sort of subcontractors -- government subcontractors that might show up in infrastructure, though it might be a little bit incrementally then special for Deltek but not a meaningful growth driver. The great thing about this business is it does well in almost any government spending environment because as you know government spending always increases. Yes. And just a little more color on that. I mean, hospitals, like a lot of businesses, right, when things got economically really challenged and patient volumes were down quite a bit in Q2 and coming into Q3, hospitals may took dramatic cost actions on the operating side, but also basically froze all capital spending. And hospital budgets as they cycle back in next year, there'll be some level of capital spending, and that's likely going to be on things that are more akin to what we do. I mean, we're like mainstream procedure type things, not esoteric or sort of super high-technology that is super high dollar and sometimes questionable at the hospital level. Yes. So a couple of things on ConstructConnect. The business has been -- the team there spent really 3 years building the software capability that's part of the workflow of both general contractors and subcontractors and building product manufacturers. It's no longer just a content business, essentially identifying leads for new projects, really working to drive habitualization of the software and the daily workflow of all the users. And so when you get into an environment like the one we're in, the environment opens up, meaning there's more people that are looking for work. So they come to ConstructConnect and buy the first product. The cross-sell into some of the workflow products, now we actually have the ability to do it, and we're seeing decent and better-than-decent attach rates at multiple products. And importantly, then we're seeing what we hope to see, which is the increase of the daily use. And so we think the long-term retention rates will be higher.  We think this is going to continue for quite some time. I mean, ConstructConnect services, sub-10% of the market and there's 90% of the market is unvended. And that market is the one that -- unvended market is the one that is coming to ConstructConnect in an environment like this."

            "name": "Rob Crisci",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest as always in Roper Technologies. Turning to Page 7, looking at our Q3 income statement performance. Total revenue increased 1% to $1.369 billion. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 3% versus prior year, similar to what we saw in Q2 and about what we would expect for Q4 as the pandemic continues.  We had positive organic revenue growth in both Network Software & Systems and Measurement & Analytical Solutions. We had a slight organic decline in Application Software due to the difficult perpetual license comp we discussed last quarter. Lastly, and similar to Q2, we experienced a 25% decline in our smallest segment, Process Technologies. Margin performance was once again quite strong with gross margin of 64.2% and EBITDA margin down 10 basis points versus prior year, but up quite a bit sequentially to 36.6%. EBITDA grew in the quarter despite the pandemic to a Q3 record of $501 million.  Tax rate came in at 22.2%, which was a couple of points higher than last year. So that all results in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.17 which was well above our guidance range aided by both better organic performance and some accretion from our Vertafore acquisition. So once again, strong execution by our business leaders in a very challenging environment.  Next slide, turning to Page 8 on net working capital. Here we look at the three year trend on working capital which continues to improve. You may recall we exited last quarter with negative working capital of minus 5.4%. And now we further improved working capital as a percent of revenue down to minus 6.3%. Continuing to improve on these important working capital metrics, despite the challenging macro environment really is a testament to the excellent work of our finance organizations across the Roper Enterprise. Our people do a really good job of focusing on what matters. We will see more evidence of this as we move forward to look at cash flow and cash conversion on the next few slides.  Next slide. Turning to Page 9 on compounding cash flow. Really amazing as Neil had mentioned to have our third straight quarter of double-digit cash flow growth in 2020. As we discussed last quarter, for better compatibility and clarity, we adjusted our results for the $124 million of cash tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to COVID-19. So that adjustment hurt our numbers in Q2 and helps us in Q3 but has no net impact on our year-to-date results. Next year, we expect the IRS to return back to their normal schedule.  We do have one additional adjustment this quarter, as Zack mentioned, for the $192 million of cash taxes that we paid in the quarter that were due from the 2019 Gatan divestiture. So none of those adjustments, Q3 operating cash flow grew 12% to $454 million, which represented 33% of revenue. Q3 free cash flow grew 14% to $442 million, which represented 32% of revenue. And you can see on the right hand side on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted free cash flow was up 13% to $1.1 billion. So as a takeaway reads, really consistent cash flow performance in a very challenging environment.  Next slide, on Page 10, turning to Roper's strong cash conversion. So through three quarters of 2020, 28% of our revenue and 78% of our EBITDA has converted to free cash flow. So comparing our 2020 year-to-date to our full year cash conversion over the past few years, we actually see that we are trending ahead of where we've been historically on cash conversion. Even better, Q4 is typically a seasonally strong quarter for cash conversion driven by annual billing cycles and lower tax payments. So, we are quite confident we are heading for a very strong cash result in 2020. Our consistently high cash conversion is important because it further demonstrates the high quality of our EBITDA, which allows us to quickly and predictably reduce leverage after large acquisitions. Next slide, turning to Page 11, updating on our balance sheet. So you can see here where we stand after the completion of the Vertafore acquisition in September. Our cash balance is reduced to a normal level of about $300 million, down from $1.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. That excess cash was used to partially fund the acquisitions. Net debt to trailing EBITDA ended the quarter at 4.8 times. Importantly, this calculation does not include the pro forma impacts of the Vertafore acquisition. Including a full year of Vertafore's EBITDA would push this ratio down into the low 4s. We expect our leverage to decline quickly over the next year as the EBITDA flows through and we use our generated cash flow to reduce our debt.  Next slide. So on Page 12, we'll talk about the financing activities that occurred in the third quarter. Including the EPSi deal that closed in October, we recently deployed a little over $5.8 billion of capital financed by our excess cash on hand, a meaningful amount of which was generated from last year's Gatan divestiture, new investment grade debt and a draw on our credit facility. We launched a bond offering in August and benefited from strong demand from Roper's debt investors, consistent with what we had experienced when we accessed the high grade bond market in June. So we ended up spreading the $2.7 billion of principal over four tranches which resulted in a very good blended interest rate of 1.3% and duration of a little over seven years. Notably, and importantly, no changes to Roper credit ratings. We remain triple B plus at S&P and Baa2 at Moody's and we remain committed to maintaining solid investment grade ratings moving forward.  We also successfully extended our revolving credit facility out three years and also upsized it from $2.5 billion to $3 billion. The current floating borrowing rate on the revolver is about 1.2%. So we like to strike a balance between fixed rate debt and prepayable floating debt to enable us to delever quickly.  So in summary, these financing activities are consistent with our long-term strategy of augmenting our internally generated cash flow with investment grade debt. Then we use our consistent and durable cash flow generation to rapidly reduce leverage, which we plan to do over the next 12 to 18 months.  So with that, I'll pass it back over to Neil. Yes. So it's continuing, as Neil mentioned. And so there's now, we've got about $100 million for the project this year, right? So maybe that's down $10 million or so versus what we said last quarter. Sure. So on cash flow, as I mentioned earlier, we feel great about where the conversion is year-to-date and Q4 is generally a high cash conversion quarter because of the annual billing of the software businesses. And the fact that we don't have -- most of the tax payments are usually in the first half of the year. So tax payments are less in the fourth quarter. On the seasonality. So yes, I think it's a good point. I mean, normally, if you go back historically, right, when Roper was more of the cyclical businesses, as a percent, you'd get the Q4 bump in what used to be our energy segment. So there's some of that. I think, sequentially, we still have -- it's just a very small part of Roper, what's happening this year, as Neil mentioned, is our medical product businesses, really specifically, Verathon had an enormous second and third quarter driven by the COVID surge. And so their fourth quarter versus the third quarter is down about $30 million of revenue. And they're still up quite a bit year-over-year. And we're hopeful that happens, right? If the COVID surge gets worse, then Verathon will sell more products, but we're hoping that doesn't happen. So that's what's all included in our guidance for Q4. Yes. It's really just project slowing, which is probably mostly due to COVID, right? It's just things are just taking longer to get going at TransCore for the most part. Yes. So I think overall, recurring revenue, which right is maintenance plus subscription, as I think Neil mentioned earlier, was up mid-single digits. The license and the services piece is impacted by COVID, as we talked about all throughout the year. So there's some declines there, and that's what we get you to that. Basically, overall, the software businesses were in line, a tad better than we had coming in really since the pandemic began. I think overall, our software revenue is about 80% recurring, and that's the maintenance and the subscription piece, which continues to grow. Our retention rates continue to be very, very high. So it all bodes well for next year when the services and the perpetual stuff should start to come back. Not services. Yes, very gradual sequential improvement. That's a good way of stating it. Yes. So we've really had 5 businesses this year, right, that have benefited from COVID financially. Verathon, IPA, we talked a lot about in our 3 businesses and our laboratory software platform, and they're all at the frontlines of fighting this thing. And so there would be some give and take, if COVID surged and you had more hospitalizations, which I don't think has happened yet, if that started to happen and those businesses would probably do more and then that could hurt other areas. So it's great of having this big diversified portfolio of businesses. Whereas we'll do great in a post-COVID world, we can't wait for it to happen, but you get a little bit of financial benefit in the short-term. Do you have anything to add to that, Neil? Yes. So think of the deals is $0.45 to $0.50 to the second half. Some of that we got in Q3, about $0.12 and the rest in Q4. And then everything else is pretty much a wash. There's $0.04 or $0.05 from tax. There's the Verathon and TransCore sort of pushed to the right. And then quite frankly, a lot of investment that we're doing in the fourth quarter with businesses like Verathon, to continue to position ourselves well for next year. So think about the operational stuff as sort of washed in. So when you add the M&A, there's the midpoint change. Yes. So the other medical products businesses that aren't Verathon, right, have been down this year quite a bit. So really double-digits, and that's starting to moderate a little bit in the fourth quarter, whether they're going to be probably more flattish year-over-year. And then they would grow quite a bit coming out of that, right? These are the businesses, as Neil has mentioned, that grow mid-single-digit organically like clockwork literally going back 10 years. And so as you get more procedures happening, then those businesses become -- get back to normal and probably have some catch-up as well."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. We hope everyone is doing well. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O\u2019Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today\u2019s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you\u2019ll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to slide three. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue, our restructuring charge associated with certain businesses in our Process Technologies segment. These were additional structural actions not contemplated in our prior guidance, transaction related expenses for completed acquisitions. And lastly, we have adjusted our cash flow results to exclude income tax payments deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to COVID-19. And now, if you\u2019ll please turn to slide four, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. We hope that everybody listening or reading are doing well and enjoying the summer. With that, let's go ahead and start with their agenda. As usual, we'll start with the enterprise highlights from the quarter, which are quite good given the health and economic challenges associated with the current pandemic. I'll then walk through our key financial and operational levers on a segment basis, and compare how we did versus what we thought heading into the quarter. Rob will then than discuss our P&L, our balance sheet, our cash position. We find ourselves in a very fortunate position to have well over a $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and a completely undrawn $2.5 billion revolver. Following Rob's remarks, I'll walk through our detailed segment review and out Look, followed by our Q3 and full year guidance. And finally, I'll conclude with the highlights for the quarter and discuss our outlook for continued capital deployment. We'll then look forward to your questions. Now let's turn to a brief run through of our Q2 results. Next slide, please. To start, I'm very proud of how Roper performed in the quarter, both on an operating basis and a balance sheet basis. On an operational basis, our revenues declined 2% in the quarter and 3% on organic basis. We saw organic growth in each of our two software segments. In addition, and as we force our last quarter, we saw very strong demand for our medical product businesses and laboratory software mostly used in a global fight against COVID-19. Worth noting and broadly, our businesses did not experience much if any supply chain disruption in the quarter, which contributed to our revenue performance. We also saw gross margins increase 70 basis points to 64.7%. EBITDA margins were impressively flat versus a year ago at 35.3%, and DEPS was strong and came in at $2.94. Most importantly, free cash flow increased 10% to 315 million. Specific to our balance sheet two items of importance, first, we successfully completed a $600 million, 10 year, 2% bond offering in the quarter. Also we're able to deploy $150 million for two bolt-on's indicating the window for capital deployment is reopening. More on these deals as we turn to the segment pages. So while 3% organic revenue declines are certainly below normal. Given the macroeconomic backdrop heading into the quarter, I'm very pleased with this performance, especially as it relates to our margin performance and cash flow. To this end this quarter's performance serves as a great example, to illustrate the intimate knowledge each of our teams have with their business, their customers, their supply chains, and their employees. As we said, for many years, nimble execution yields great results. And that is certainly the case for this quarter and so far, this year. As we'll discuss later, in the call, we're maintaining our full year organic revenue outlook to be plus or minus flat, which we believe is a testament to our decade long business model transformation. In addition, our greater than 1.5 billion cash position, and our undrawn $2.5 billion revolver allows us to be offensive relative to capital deployment. Our M&A pipeline remains full of high-quality opportunities. And prior to turning to the next slide, I want to thank our entire leadership team and our 16,000 employees for your tremendous work this quarter. Thank you. Next slide, please. Turning to the second quarter segment results summary, this page summarizes our key business model levers and how they performed in the quarter. Starting with Application Software, we expected revenues to be down mid-single digits in the quarter, but actually grew 1%. As we did expect, renewal rates remain high and recurring revenues remain strong. Also, we did see strong demand across our laboratory software businesses, as they worked aggressively to enable scores of COVID-19 related testing capability on a global basis. A good guy for the quarter was our software license sales, we saw across the segment better than expected conversion of perpetual ILF sales pipelines. A further positive variance was the success our teams had in implementing our software remotely, which led to higher service utilization rates and revenues. So this segment performed better than expected based on these two factors better license sales and higher service utilization rates. For our network segment we expected to grow low single digits and did coming in at 2%. For the software businesses in this segment just about what we expected, high levels of recurring revenues and renewal rates and decent network expansions at ConstructConnect and DAT. More on this later, but the TransCore New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project continues to push to the right impacting more the second half versus this quarter. As for the MAS segment, we expect it to decline mid-single digits, but did modestly better, only declining 1% in the quarter. Verathon and IPA outperformed our expectations and was driven by exceptional demand for their products and solutions throughout the quarter. As expected, our other medical product businesses were negatively impacted and continue to be negatively impacted by reduced elective hospital procedures. Neptune performed in line with expectations and was down given that it had limited access to meters, especially in Canada and the Northeast United States where meters are installed inside residences. Finally in the segment, we saw sharp declines as expected in our industrial businesses. Turning to our Process Tech segment, we were down 26% in the quarter, versus an expectation of being down plus 30%. The businesses in this segment perform generally as expected, slightly better than we thought at PAC and AMOT. Finally, the better than expected revenues levered very well the EPS, but DEPS coming in at 2.94 versus our guidance range of 2.50 to 2.70. After Rob's comments, I'll come back and discuss in more detail our segment by segment performance. Rob, I'll turn it over to you.\nRob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Roper Technologies as always. So turning to page seven, looking at our Q2 income statement performance, Q2 organic revenue declined 3% versus prior year with total revenue coming in at 1.306 billion. We had positive organic revenue growth in both Application Software and Network Software and Systems, while sharp declines and our smallest segment Process Technologies pulled our overall organic growth into low single digit negative territory for the quarter. Margin performance, as Neil mentioned, was a standout in the quarter as our businesses expanded gross margin by 70 basis points to 64.7% and held EBITDA margins flat at 35.3%. As a result, EBITDA declined only 2% to 461 million. Our tax rate came in at 22.3%, a little higher than last year, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.94, which was well above our guidance range of 2.50 to 2.70, so in summary, really good execution by our business leaders in a very challenging environment. Next slide, turning to page eight and looking at cash flow, cash flow performance for the quarter was very strong. On a GAAP basis, our operating cash flow was 449 million, which represented a 49% increase over last year. However, for better compatibility and clarity, we are adjusting our results for the 124 million of income tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to COVID-19 and those taxes were subsequently paid in July. So after adjusting for the timing of the 124 million of tax payments that pushed to July, our Q2 operating cash flow grew 8% to 325 million, which represented 25% of revenue. Q2 free cash flow grew 10% to 315 million, which was 24% of revenue. Looking back at the past two years, our Q2 free cash flow has compounded a strong 12%. Congrats and a special thank you to the finance teams at each of our businesses for continuing to make cash flow and cash collections a high priority. It truly was outstanding cash Flow performance in a challenging environment. Next slide, turning to page nine and our asset light business model and negative working capital slide. We exited the first quarter with working capital of minus 4.4% and in Q2 we further improved this metric with working capital as a percent of revenue moving to minus 5.4%. While we're certainly happy as always, to see our income statement hold up well in Q2, we believe it's just as important if not more important, that our cash flow and working capital metrics also remain strong. In fact, as we continue to improve on these important working capital metrics, despite the challenging macro environment, this bodes very well for our ability to compound cash flow at higher levels as the economy does eventually rebound from the pandemic. Next slide, turning to page 10, our strong financial position, so it's really a continuation here of the same story we discussed last quarter. Roper's liquidity position and balance sheet remained very strong. We ended June with over 1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet. To date in July as mentioned, we have made some tax payments about $316 million of tax payments have been paid to date in July. That's the previously mentioned 124 million of deferred payments as well as 192 million of taxes due on the gain from last year's Gatan sale. So after making these payments, our cash balance today is approximately 1.6 billion and our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility remains fully undrawn. In June, we took advantage of historically favorable conditions in the bond market and issued 600 million of 10-year notes at a coupon of 2.0%. At the time, we tied the record for the lowest coupon ever issued by a Triple B issuer. Really great execution by our team and nice to once again see very strong demand for Roper bonds driven by our consistent ability to generate cash flow, high levels of recurring revenue and our diversified portfolio of asset light businesses. At the end of the quarter our net debt to EBITDA stood at 2.1 times. And with our large cash balance and fully undrawn revolver, we remain very well positioned with significant financial capacity to take advantage of our large pipeline of acquisition opportunities. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil.\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Let's go ahead and turn to our Application Software segment. Revenues here were 398 million up 1% on an organic basis, and EBITDA was 172 million or 43.1% of revenue. To start, our retention rates and other recurring revenues remain strong in the quarter. In addition, we saw better than expected software license sales in the quarter broadly across Deltek, Aderant and PowerPlan. Of note, sales pipeline bill that occurred prior to the quarter converted at a higher than anticipated rate. In addition and discussed earlier, we saw better service utilization rates and revenues than expected. Our laboratory software businesses Sunquest, Data Innovations and Clinisys all grew and performed nicely aided by the global demand to deploy diagnostic testing software interfaces and laboratory software associated with combating COVID-19. Specific to Sunquest, we received the termination fee payment for the Queensland project in the quarter. As a reminder, last quarter, we noted that the customer opted to terminate this implementation in the face of COVID-19 related challenges. CBORD, which is our software business that sells nutrition and food management software, as well as campus access solutions to hospitals and universities did decline, given their very limited access to both hospital and university clients. Broadly across this segment and of note, we are absolutely seeing an increased desire from our customers to migrate to our cloud or SaaS offerings, one of several trends that COVID appears to be accelerating. This should be a long-term growth driver for our business, as we have a large installed base of customers who will over time migrate to the cloud. And turning to the outlook for the segment, we expect to be roughly flat on organic basis for the second half of the year, with the third quarter facing a challenging prior your comp specific to perpetual license revenues. We continue to expect high levels of recurring revenue retention. As a reminder, the vast majority of our customers in this segment are enterprise or larger companies. Furthermore, we serve a diversified and durable set of end markets, most notably government contractors, marketing services firms, law firms, utilities and hospitals. That said we do anticipate some continued pressure on our new logo software license sales. This quarter's license revenues were aided by sales pipelines that were built pre-COVID and converted better than expected in the quarter. The second half funnel is increasingly comprised of post-COVID shut down activity. As a result, we expect our prospects decision timeframes may extend longer than our historical experience. That said we are encouraged by the fact that the top of the funnel activity looks good, and we liked the MQL, SQL conversion rates. But again expect decision timing could be more elongated than normal. With that next slide, please. Turning to our Network segment, revenues grew 2% organically to 423 million and EBITDA was 176 million or 41.5% of revenue. As a reminder, most of our software businesses in this segment share highly recurring SaaS revenue models, which are further aided by strong network effects that drive higher retention rates and network ads, which were certainly the case in this quarter. To this end, our ConstructConnect network expanded in the quarter and was driven by strong customer ads and network utilization. As a reminder, our ConstructConnect business's primary product provides building contractors with all available commercial building projects that are in the planning phase and enables them to bid and win work. In an economic environment like this one, the value of this product further increases. Our DAT business grew high single digits in the quarter led by large number of carrier additions to the network and strong growth in our rate data offering. To add to our rate data product capabilities, we acquired FMIC in the quarter. FMIC is the leading benchmarking and rate analysis firm focused on the contract freight market. When combined with DAT the FMIC data sets will be a unique product offering that benchmarks both the contract and spot truck freight markets in the US. In addition to FMIC, we also acquired Team TSI. We're integrating team TSI with our SHP business. When complete, the combined business will have a comprehensive operating, financial and quality benchmarks that span the continuum of post-acute care, namely skilled nursing and home health. In addition to helping the post-acute providers operate their businesses more efficiently, SHP will help improve patient outcomes through innovative real time data and evidence-based collaboration among acute care providers and their post-acute partners. We're excited to see this strategy unfold. As mentioned earlier, these bolt-on acquisitions have a combined purchase price of 150 million. Turning to last year's acquisitions and it's worth noting that Foundry and iPipeline continue to perform well and are proving to have quite resilient business models as we expect. As we look to our rf IDEAS and Inovonics businesses, they were challenged in the quarter directly resulting from having limited access to customers. And finally, the TransCore New York City congestion pricing infrastructure projects continues and is deemed essential. However, the project at the election of our customer has slowed and continues to push into 2021. Execution of the project remains strong, but the time is elongating. Turning to the outlook for the segment, we see mid-single digit organic growth in the second half. Relative to Transport and the New York project as mentioned, we see this project pushing to the right, notably about $0.20 of DEPS is being pushed into next year as compared to what we thought a quarter ago. That said, we continue to see growth and resiliency in our Network Software businesses driven by higher recurring revenues, strong retention rates, expanding networks and solid network participation. Next slide please. Turning to our Measurement and Analytical segment, revenues declined 1% organically to 364 million and EBITDA was 132 million or 36.2% of revenue. In the current environment this segments activities are best broken into four boxes, one, Verathon and IPA; two, other medical product businesses; three, Neptune and four, our industrial businesses. First, Verathon and IPA, both experiencing tremendous demand for their products directly attributable to hospital demand resulting from COVID-19. Verathon experienced strong demand for their GlideScope video intubation products. As a result of COVID-19 the percentage of all intubations not just COVID related that are being done using video assistance has meaningfully increased. Verathon's demand is both for capital systems, which means an expanding customer base and the pull through consumables. We have to give hearty congratulations to Earl, Tracy, Tim, Jeff and the entire team at Verathon. It's one thing to have unprecedented demand. It's a completely different thing to be able to flex the supply chain to fulfill the demand within a single quarter. Congrats and thanks to the Verathon team. A similar story with IPA, hospitals rapidly adopted their automated scrub distribution systems to help deploy scrubs more broadly to staff within the hospital setting. Second, and relative to our other medical product businesses, we did see revenue headwinds tied directly to government mandated lower patient volumes within acute care hospitals on a global basis. We also want to note that this group of companies consistently grows mid-single digits, but this growth is conditioned on regular hospital admissions patterns. Third, Neptune was negatively impacted by restricted access to indoor meters in particular in Canada, in the Northeast United States. And finally, and as expected, we did experience a sharp decline in our short cycle industrial businesses. However, in the second half of the quarter, we did see modest improvements in consumable demand. As we turn to the second half outlook, we expect to see mid-single digit growth in this segment led by continued strong demand at Verathon for the reasons just discussed. In addition, we expect to see reduced levels of non-emergent capital procedures providing continued headwinds for a non-Verathon and non-IPA medical product businesses. We do expect to see improvements in Neptune on easing lockdowns, especially in the Northeast United States, which will provide better access to indoor meters. Also, we're cautiously optimistic given that July municipal budgets appear to be largely intact. And finally, we expect to see gradual improvements in our short cycle industrial end markets. Next slide, please. Turning to our Process Technologies segment, revenues were 121 million in the quarter, down 26% on organic basis and EBITDA was 33 million or 27.4% of revenue. This was certainly a difficult quarter for these businesses and we expect the outlook to remain poor for the balance of 2020. Despite a uniquely challenging environment for these businesses, they still had high 20% EBITDA margins in the quarter. And our leadership teams have done a great job of navigating these end markets and continuing to make no regrets investments. We saw our upstream businesses decline approximately 40% in the quarter. Our PAC business also declined, and it was related to weak fuel demand in the quarter. As a reminder PAC is our laboratory fuel analysis business. Also, CCC was weak based on the inability to perform field service work, all related to COVID-19. One bright spot in the quarter was Zetec, which experienced growth based on the strength of their new non-destructive testing products. Also in the quarter, we initiated targeted restructuring actions across a few of our businesses in this segment, which resulted in a $13.6 million charge. None of these structural changes were considered in our guidance from a quarter ago. These actions will position these businesses to better serve its customers and realize longer term savings. While the oil and gas markets and customer commitments remain more muted, we believe this is the right time to execute these restructuring activities. The outlook for the balance of the year continues to be an extremely challenging one, as we expect to see approximately 25% organic decline for the second half. Specifically, we do not anticipate any recovery in upstream oil and gas markets and expect upstream to account for less than 40 million of revenues in the second half. In addition, we expect to continue to have limited customer access, which hampers our ability to perform field service work. Next slide please. As we turn to our guidance, we're narrowing and modestly raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of 11.90 and 12.40 per share. We continue to guide full year organic revenues to be plus or minus flat. In addition, we're initiating DEPS guidance for 3Q in the range of 2.90 to $3. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Next slide please. Given the global pandemic and associated shutdowns in the quarter, we're pleased with our performance, with revenue only being down 3% organically, EBITDA margins holding flat versus the prior year at 35.3% and cash flow growing 10% to 315 million. From an operating point of view, our businesses remain focused on employee health and safety continue to improve the efficiency of remote work, to remain super intimate with our customers and continue to focus on long-term durable growth. To this end, our businesses continue invest in growth oriented operating initiatives. Our leaders, all of whom are long-term builders are masterful at maintaining product investments during down cycles, which oftentimes lead to market share gains upon recovery. As a leadership team, we remain steadfastly committed to this concept. For the full year, we expect to have plus or minus flat organic revenue growth. We believe our portfolio of businesses and our governance processes continue to be well suited to navigate these difficult times. Our balance sheet is stronger than at any point in history with over $1.5 billion of cash and $2.5 billion of revolver capacity. And specific to capital deployment, we do have a high quality and active pipeline of opportunities as private equity sellers have recently re-entered the market. That said and as always, our CRI based strategy focus is on long-term cash flow compounding, and we will continue to patiently evaluate and pursue capital deployment opportunities that are consistent with this strategy. And as we turn to your questions, I remind everybody that what we do is very simple. We compound cash flow by operating our portfolio of businesses that have leading positions and niche markets that have the proven ability to generate increasing cash flow as their businesses expand. We provide our business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative to driving long-term CRI accretive organic growth, with particular emphasis focused on strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. Our business leaders understand that success in our culture is based on their ability to compete and win for talent and to compete and win for customers that in turn allow us to compete and win for shareholders. To this end, we incent our management teams based on growth. And based on these factors and perhaps most importantly, we have a culture that is rooted in the principles of mutual respect, trust and transparency. And finally, we take the excess free cash flow that is generated by our businesses and deploy to buy businesses that have better cash returns on our existing company that in turn helps accelerate our cash flow compounding. It is these simple ideas that deliver powerful results. And with that, now let's turn to your question.\nOperator: We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.\nRob Crisci: Hey, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Can we start with the congestion tolling project? Can you just give us some context of this latest push out? It would be fair to assume that just logistically COVID is presenting issues in terms of being able to work on the project. But is there been any change in scope that's being considered?\nNeil Hunn: No. Hey, Deane. No change whatsoever in the scope, the contract value that we talked about a few quarters ago remains the exact same. And so the only thing that is happening here is the project is pushing a bit to the right into 2021 for the reason you said, a little bit access to personnel related to COVID and a little bit just at the election of the customer line to paste the project a little bit. And I think also we highlighted last quarter, I mean, the motivation of the client is never been higher. I think it was just around this time last quarter. The proceeds from the project for 2021 and '22 could be used in MTAs operating budget where the initial project that was going to be used for capital only, so there is a clear motivation to get the \u2013 by the customer to get the project up and running. It's just slipping to the right a little bit.\nDeane Dray: Just to clarify, there was a discussion of push outs in the first quarter. So this $0.20 of EPS push out. This is new and incremental, correct?\nNeil Hunn: That's correct.\nRob Crisci: Yeah, that's \u2013 yeah, that's correct Deane. So the project was originally around 200 million for this year, and now we've got about 110 or so million in for 2020. And as Neil mentioned, the rest is pushed to the right, and we expect to be completed in '21.\nDeane Dray: Got it and then second topic would be the net COVID impact across your businesses. And I'm sure this is a fair question to ask. But you listed a number of ways that Roper is positioned to help between the labs support system witnesses [ph], data innovations, the Verathon incubation systems, those would be the positives, but the negative is it all related to just the deferrals of non-emergency procedures. So how do those to net out if?\nNeil Hunn: If your question is relegated to the medical product businesses versus price, if you relegate to that as a broader to Roper, I want to make sure I'm answering the question \u2013\nDeane Dray: No, just the medical related, sorry.\nNeil Hunn: Okay. Yeah. So it's a net \u2013 a meaningful net grower, right, when you look at the benefit of those of Verathon and IPA good guy against the bad guys of the other four or five medical product businesses aggregated together, it's a very meaningful positive, good guy. It's worth noting though, the Verathon demand while it certainly surged in the quarter, the team worked really well to work down the backlog a little bit more to go in the second half of the year. The team that Verathon believes that the demand is \u2013 will endure a bit right. It's about the number, the percentage or the market share of global incubations that are being done with video assistance versus not. Going into the pandemic, it was somewhere in the 15% of all intubations were done with video assistance and 85 direct. And that market share video is going \u2013 it's meaningfully higher now and it will stay. It'll be meaningfully above 15% on the backside of this, so the market just grew, we believe, for these products that Verathon has.\nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, Scott, good morning.\nRob Crisci: Hey, Scott.\nScott Davis: I was trying to get a sense and a little bit of follow up on Deane's question, but trying to get a sense of ConstructConnect. You commented out the pandemic, perhaps helped \u2013 is helping catalyze some growth there. I mean, very few of us are experts in many of these businesses. I'm certainly not an expert in ConstructConnect by any stretch of imagination. But can you give us a sense of how that business grows in this type of environment? Is it \u2013 well, I'll just leave a little bit of that just open ended, how does it grow and how much does it impact? Is there any way to \u2013 the magnitude, the pandemic really helping get word of mouth or otherwise out there on the product.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, happy to talk through that, so just to remind you and everyone ConstructConnect, the primary part of the business all for non-residential or commercial construction in the United States and Canada that's in the planning phase. So once a shovel goes in the ground, other constituents in the value chain pick up that. This is about planning. It allows general contractors, subcontractors, building product manufacturers to be aware of the projects are being planned, so they can bid for and win those projects and we have software that organizes all of that activity. So when the market is raging hot, right, all the subcontractors have more work and they can possibly do the value of leads or what new projects is lower, right. And so we've always sort of said, if there's five market conditions, five is white hot and one is there's basically zero construction, that constructing that value proposition is best in positions two, three and four, right, where there's work and activity going on, but not so much work that contractors have so much to do, right. And so, what's essentially happened here and ConstructConnect reports on this and Zach can give it to you is, nonres construction activity is down 28% versus prior year. It was up a little bit in June versus May. But that's the exact environment where the value proposition of leads and project awareness sort of thrives. And that's why you saw more contractors come into the ConstructConnect market and grow in the quarter.\nRob Crisci: I would just add to that it's a SaaS business, Scott. So there's not huge swings in the revenue like you get with a perpetual license bid. We're seeing increased activity in the network and that leads to a little bit of more subscriptions, more customers, and then over time, that drives additional growth with the business.\nScott Davis: Right and those custom customers, I mean, do they come in and then they generally stick around or they come out when economic conditions get weaker?\nNeil Hunn: Really appreciate the question. So history, if you go way back in the ark of ConstructConnect, some of them will stay and some of them will leave. But since our ownership in '16, the ConstructConnect team has worked really hard to build habituation into the product, if you will. So now there's integrated takeoff which is the estimation process and directly linked and so we believe the customers when we look at the utilization of the product, they're in the product on a multi time a day basis now, where five, six, seven years ago, they'd be in the product only when they needed to look for any project. And so we believe based on that the sort of the long-term retention rates of the business go up.\nScott Davis: Okay. Okay, super helpful. Okay. Congrats guys. Good luck this quarter.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. Congrats on the book as well.\nScott Davis: Thank you.\nOperator: [indiscernible] Please go ahead, sir with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, can you hear me okay?\nNeil Hunn: We can Steve. Hey, I think its Steve, right? Yeah, okay.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Sorry. Sorry guys, just managing some things here. Like eight different calls. Just on the acquisitions you recently did. Can you just give us some color on the revenues and what you paid for those, just general multiples for some of the ones you've done?\nRob Crisci: Yeah. Sure, Steve. So there's the two acquisitions in the quarter, combined purchase price about 150 million. And we've got about 25 million or so revenue in the model for '21. And EBITDA margins there in the mid to high 40s. So pretty good cash, but each business is being integrated into a business. So there was not a lot added for the second half, but there's some integration going on, but that built a real good strategic adds to the Roper businesses.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it and then just a last one on the \u2013 on some of the \u2013 I think you guys had expected a bit weaker performance in some of the software businesses. I know you went through some of this in the prepared remarks. But is there anything that kind of gives back a little bit in the second half that notable and it's material in any of those software businesses that just perhaps some differed downside relative to what you would have expected in the second quarter, some timing items?\nNeil Hunn: So in the second quarter, I mean, yeah, I think the second quarter software for the reasons we said on Application Software, I mean, it was the better utilization rates on the service side. And we expected more deferral or push outs of the license activity. And that proved to be a little conservative. And so that was broad that license activity was brought across Deltek, Aderant, PowerPlan. We saw good performance across the diagnostic businesses that we just talked about. Excuse me, some of that \u2013 a lot of that was COVID related.\nRob Crisci: Right, yeah, there's a lot of good \u2013 good things that happened in acute care software in the quarter which are driven by the demand around COVID. Right, so that's \u2013 some of that stuff happened in the second quarter that we didn't expect. And we'll see what continues into the second half, but that's difficult to predict.\nOperator: Steve, was there a follow up?\nNeil Hunn: Sounds like he went on, okay.\nOperator: Understood, the next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Jeff Alvaro [ph] on for Julian.\nNeil Hunn: Okay Jeff.\nUnidentified Analyst: Maybe just to start Application Software margins came in pretty strong for the quarter, can you just give some color on what contributed there? And maybe as part of that, just your thoughts on how margins look there in \u2013 at other segments for the second half?\nNeil Hunn: I'll take the first part of that. Let Rob take a second. Hey, it's directly \u2013 the Application Software margin performance in the quarter is directly tied to better license activity as you know, perpetual licenses in quarter are super high margin, 90 plus percent, 85%, 90%, so when they perform an expectation on license, and you tend to have better margin performance.\nRob Crisci: And then we also received the Queensland payment for Sunquest, which put revenue and large high margin net revenue in the second quarter as well, which helped. And then as we look at the second half the margins don't move around a lot in the other segments, which is a great thing, right. It's high recurring revenue, very stable business models you don't get this sort of swaying, so we certainly expect EBITDA margins to be sort of flat or a little bit better year-over-year in the software segment.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. And then some interesting comments you guys mentioned, municipal budgets seemed to be intact so far. Any thoughts on how much this holds in the second half? And then maybe thoughts on what level of potential cuts you guys are dialing in for kind of your outlook next year? I know that's a bit early. And then maybe just as part of that, can you just remind us kind of what percentage of sales within M&A as it's kind of tied to municipal budgets?\nRob Crisci: Very low dollars percent of revenue, I mean, it's going to be the part of Neptune that swings around with budgets. And Neptune's a pretty stable high recurring revenue business. So it's a real small percentage of the segment in single digits, it's going to really be driven by swinging budgets.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, and more broadly coming \u2013 this time last quarter in the height of the shutdown, a risk item that we \u2013 or were flagged was our Neptune's customers budgets going to be intact as they rolled into their New Year's because a large percentage of these customers have a July 1 fiscal year just given the broader economic challenges that municipalities and cities are experiencing. The good news is the budgets appear to be largely intact, so that high \u2013 the first risk item appears to be mostly retired. Remaining risk item is now the spend against the budget, right and that's to be determined, but the first step is a checkmark and we'll see how things unfold the rest of the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it, thank you guys.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Ritchie of golden. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, good morning.\nRob Crisci: Hey, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, Neil, maybe just some commentary on the elective procedure impact in the quarter and obviously, like things are still incredibly fluid with the virus, but I'm just trying to understand, maybe how much of this pushes out into 2021 and whether there's like a revenue boost in 2021 once hopefully, elective procedures come back.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. So the products \u2013 the companies that we have that are somewhat indexed to procedure volume, its one derivative behind it, right. So very little of our businesses are consumable in a procedure, but our capital and products are used by other companies who are \u2013 and used in a procedure. And so we're buffered a little bit by what our customers are seeing. We did see a little bit in the second, maybe the June time period, some of the true consumables sort of pick back up. And that's just going to be evolved for the balance of the year. We would expect, as I mentioned, the open continent the prepared remarks, I mean, this group of businesses going back for many, many years grows like clockwork at mid-single digits, and that assumes a patient volume yet that are normalized and so to the extent volumes are normal in 2021, then we would see a pickup in that group of businesses.\nRob Crisci: Just to give you a sense Joe, so the sort of other medical products businesses which exclude Verathon and IPA, which have a huge COVID benefit, so everything else, those businesses were down double digits in the quarter, and they would normally be mid-single growers. And so I think we will catch up some of that at some point, but it's very difficult to predict when.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it, that's helpful, Rob and then just maybe my quick follow up. I thought your commentary around like the acceleration into cloud-based solutions was interesting. I guess, Neil, if you could maybe just provide some context for what that opportunity could be for you guys, either qualitative or quantitative that would be helpful.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, I'll leave it. It's sort of on the qualitative basis, right. So as we said for a long time, we \u2013 as a guiding principle, we allow our customers to pace the transition to the cloud, we don't force it or have a force product migration or just they're waiting for that to occur. We have some businesses like Strata that are born in the cloud. We have other businesses like Aderant and PowerPlan that are still vast, vast majority on-premise. And then we have companies like Deltek that are somewhere in between, right, sort of in the middle in their journey of the migration. What we've seen at Deltek is that that migration is a net growth driver. And we can talk about that in more detail later to the extent you're interested. But you basically are taking a large installed base of customers who pay you annual maintenance and you're uplifting them to the cloud. So you're providing all the backbone and IT sort of management services, but also, you're doing all the release management, getting them on the most recent release. They're more micro releases. And so the customers get to take advantage of what you're actually developing. And that has real value associated within the mind's eye of the customers. And so for that reason, as they migrate from on-premise to cloud, there's an uplift in recurring, a pretty meaningful one and that's a that's a multiyear growth driver for our enterprise on Application Software or an Application Software.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it, that's super helpful. Thanks, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, guys good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nJoe Giordano: Can you talk about maybe some of the implications of a potential infrastructure bill that might have maybe on, I'm guessing Deltek would be the most maybe PowerPlan, I'm not sure? But how that might impact the overall portfolio?\nNeil Hunn: It's not \u2013 I think it would have a slight impact. And the reason I say that I'm looking at Rob and Shannon, it's not something we talked about right. And so about an infrastructure bill, we're not rooting for one so I think we're \u2013\nRob Crisci: Yeah, I think the government contractors are always betting money on whatever there is to spend money on.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, Rob's point there is a very good one, right, so the contractors go where the fast flow is in a government spend. And so maybe you get a few more government contractors that could be dealt like customers, but that's not over yet [ph].\nJoe Giordano: Okay, fair enough. Can you kind of just set a range kind of for us, I's assume like within \u2013 your software businesses did better than expected, obviously, but I'm guessing there's huge differences between businesses like CBORD where you couldn't go? Like people were on site like, can you kind of scale what are the \u2013 even if you don't want to get into the specific business names or like how big were some of the biggest declines and how big were some of the biggest gainers in the in flight?\nNeil Hunn: Well, I'll set it up. I'll give you some context and let Rob sort of give you his view. So as we mentioned, last quarter in this segment, about 70% of revenues are recurring, 20% are tied to services and that's generally coming \u2013 working off some sort of six to 18 month backlog and then 10% of the revenue is that perpetual license. So the most short-term impacted is that 10%, so that tends to mute the magnitude of the swing in any given period of time, assuming that the in flight implementation projects don't stall. We see a lot of that block, if any of that activity in the quarter. So with that Rob?\nRob Crisci: Yeah, they are just very stable businesses. So I'm just looking through all the software businesses and sort of they're all kind of between a low single digit gain or low single digit decline, with the exception of CBORD, which is a little bit worse than that. So again, that a little bit better than expected because you know a huge part of the businesses are stable. The question is are you going to get any of these license wins in the quarter? Are you able to look to deliver services? And we were. And so to the extent that continues, that certainly helps us, there's just aren't big swings in these businesses, which of course, we had huge swings in the product businesses where there's more issues with not being able to access customers, et cetera.\nJoe Giordano: Better, thanks, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blanton: Hi, good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Alex.\nAlex Blanton: I wanted to ask about the push up in the TransCore business in New York City. You mentioned $0.20 going into 2021 from '20, a new $0.20. And then I think you said I want to confirm this, a 110 million now in this year versus 200 million before. So that's a $90 million push, is that \u2013 are those the right numbers?\nRob Crisci: They are Alex. So there was an interim step in there that last quarter with the 200 became 175. And now it's 110, so the move from 175 to 110 is your $0.20.\nAlex Blanton: Okay, that's what I wanted to know. So that's a $65 million push out, generated $0.20 per share, push out, so we can calculate the incremental margin there. That's what I'm getting at.\nNeil Hunn: These are all rough numbers, but yeah, go ahead.\nAlex Blanton: Yeah, I know. Yeah. We don't need percentage. The second thing is, we haven't really \u2013 I don't think anyone asked about the acquisition pipeline. You've got max $4.1 billion of spending power for acquisitions. What does that look like? What are you working on, big, small, what's the timing? Is some of that getting pushed out because of COVID? What's the situation there?\nNeil Hunn: Alex, appreciate the question. So I'll give you a little bit of context and color. So we had a pretty \u2013 the activity coming into COVID. I mean, it was as busy as we had been that I can recall since being here in 2011 in terms of what the funnel activity looked like. Obviously, everything shut down. I mean, when the credit markets shut down, everything shut down in April and May. It was there was really no activity anywhere. No sellers were selling anything for obvious reasons. But the end of May, first part of June we saw some green shoots, we obviously got these two bolt-on's complete, which are sort of in the pipeline pre-COVID. And really here since the middle of June, until now, it's almost as if we're back to January, February in terms of private equity seller interest in activity. The private credit markets aren't fully back, but they're back enough to give sponsors confident that they can run a process or processes. And so we're encouraged by all that because we're sitting here with what you just said a large amount of cash and borrowing capacity to sort of continue this \u2013 our long-term CRI driven sort of compounding strategy. I will note the things that we see that \u2013 obviously, the things that come out of the shoot first after a slowdown are the very best assets, right, the ones that have the best niches, the best competitive position, the best highest level of recurring revenue, durability, things like that. And those tend to be fairly valued, right. There's not a lot of bargains that we would say we see in the software space, but values \u2013 valuations consistent with what we saw coming into the pandemic.\nAlex Blanton: What accounts for the pickup? The COVID situation is actually worse than was in April. There's spikes all over the place and the government doesn't have control over at all. They're not even trying. So what accounts for the opening up of acquisition activity?\nNeil Hunn: We can only speculate what's in the mind's eye of the sellers, right, but a couple of things. First is, the types of \u2013 everything I just said I should have qualified by saying our M&A pipeline is 100% software focused, right and so these are businesses even in the public markets that are proving to be resilient, sort of the comparables if you will and so that is \u2013 colors my comments on what a funnel activity looks like. The other thing is private equity sellers, which is where we buy 100% of our assets from have to return capital. They have limited sort of pressures. That's a constant drumbeat. And then finally, and this is me certainly speculating about private equities view of what might happen in election and taxes, but that certainly may be a motivating factor to get some things done by the end of this year.\nAlex Blanton: Taxes, okay. Yeah. I don't remember the question, but now it slipped my mind.\nNeil Hunn: Happens to me all the time.\nAlex Blanton: Yeah. You said 100% software focused. I know what it was. Your sister company Dover Corp used to say that \u2013 one of the favorite things they said was that during recessions, they always gained market share because they had the dominant positions in their companies and their markets. And so weaker competitors would lose out some business and even go out of business during recessions. So Dover actually benefited from market share standpoint during economic downturns. How would you characterize Roper in that regard? And what is happening now, are you gaining share overall from people having a lot worse time than you are?\nNeil Hunn: So we would echo those comments that companies like Roper in our history is we continue to invest in product through cycle, especially in the down cycle because your competitors oftentimes are not able to. We also stay super close to our customers, the vast majority of what we \u2013 our companies have direct channel access or a sap to work through a distributor so you stay super close to the customers and almost certainly on the back end, you can gain share either because of customer intimacy or because you develop or launch some new product or product capability, so 100% that is the case for Roper in this current environment.\nAlex Blanton: Okay. And this is a tough one, but what percentage of this 4.1 billion do you think you might deploy this year?\nRob Crisci: That's real hard. Yeah, that's really impossible to predict. We're going to do the work we always do and we certainly have the capacity, but we only do the best deals and we never feel pressured. But certainly the balance sheet has never been stronger. So we feel good about our ability to deploy capital this year.\nNeil Hunn: As our \u2013 my predecessors said many years ago, our discipline is only outmatched by our patience.\nAlex Blanton: Okay, thank you very much.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nRob Crisci: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. We hope that everybody listening or reading are doing well and enjoying the summer. With that, let's go ahead and start with their agenda. As usual, we'll start with the enterprise highlights from the quarter, which are quite good given the health and economic challenges associated with the current pandemic. I'll then walk through our key financial and operational levers on a segment basis, and compare how we did versus what we thought heading into the quarter. Rob will then than discuss our P&L, our balance sheet, our cash position. We find ourselves in a very fortunate position to have well over a $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and a completely undrawn $2.5 billion revolver. Following Rob's remarks, I'll walk through our detailed segment review and out Look, followed by our Q3 and full year guidance. And finally, I'll conclude with the highlights for the quarter and discuss our outlook for continued capital deployment. We'll then look forward to your questions. Now let's turn to a brief run through of our Q2 results. Next slide, please. To start, I'm very proud of how Roper performed in the quarter, both on an operating basis and a balance sheet basis. On an operational basis, our revenues declined 2% in the quarter and 3% on organic basis. We saw organic growth in each of our two software segments. In addition, and as we force our last quarter, we saw very strong demand for our medical product businesses and laboratory software mostly used in a global fight against COVID-19. Worth noting and broadly, our businesses did not experience much if any supply chain disruption in the quarter, which contributed to our revenue performance. We also saw gross margins increase 70 basis points to 64.7%. EBITDA margins were impressively flat versus a year ago at 35.3%, and DEPS was strong and came in at $2.94. Most importantly, free cash flow increased 10% to 315 million. Specific to our balance sheet two items of importance, first, we successfully completed a $600 million, 10 year, 2% bond offering in the quarter. Also we're able to deploy $150 million for two bolt-on's indicating the window for capital deployment is reopening. More on these deals as we turn to the segment pages. So while 3% organic revenue declines are certainly below normal. Given the macroeconomic backdrop heading into the quarter, I'm very pleased with this performance, especially as it relates to our margin performance and cash flow. To this end this quarter's performance serves as a great example, to illustrate the intimate knowledge each of our teams have with their business, their customers, their supply chains, and their employees. As we said, for many years, nimble execution yields great results. And that is certainly the case for this quarter and so far, this year. As we'll discuss later, in the call, we're maintaining our full year organic revenue outlook to be plus or minus flat, which we believe is a testament to our decade long business model transformation. In addition, our greater than 1.5 billion cash position, and our undrawn $2.5 billion revolver allows us to be offensive relative to capital deployment. Our M&A pipeline remains full of high-quality opportunities. And prior to turning to the next slide, I want to thank our entire leadership team and our 16,000 employees for your tremendous work this quarter. Thank you. Next slide, please. Turning to the second quarter segment results summary, this page summarizes our key business model levers and how they performed in the quarter. Starting with Application Software, we expected revenues to be down mid-single digits in the quarter, but actually grew 1%. As we did expect, renewal rates remain high and recurring revenues remain strong. Also, we did see strong demand across our laboratory software businesses, as they worked aggressively to enable scores of COVID-19 related testing capability on a global basis. A good guy for the quarter was our software license sales, we saw across the segment better than expected conversion of perpetual ILF sales pipelines. A further positive variance was the success our teams had in implementing our software remotely, which led to higher service utilization rates and revenues. So this segment performed better than expected based on these two factors better license sales and higher service utilization rates. For our network segment we expected to grow low single digits and did coming in at 2%. For the software businesses in this segment just about what we expected, high levels of recurring revenues and renewal rates and decent network expansions at ConstructConnect and DAT. More on this later, but the TransCore New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project continues to push to the right impacting more the second half versus this quarter. As for the MAS segment, we expect it to decline mid-single digits, but did modestly better, only declining 1% in the quarter. Verathon and IPA outperformed our expectations and was driven by exceptional demand for their products and solutions throughout the quarter. As expected, our other medical product businesses were negatively impacted and continue to be negatively impacted by reduced elective hospital procedures. Neptune performed in line with expectations and was down given that it had limited access to meters, especially in Canada and the Northeast United States where meters are installed inside residences. Finally in the segment, we saw sharp declines as expected in our industrial businesses. Turning to our Process Tech segment, we were down 26% in the quarter, versus an expectation of being down plus 30%. The businesses in this segment perform generally as expected, slightly better than we thought at PAC and AMOT. Finally, the better than expected revenues levered very well the EPS, but DEPS coming in at 2.94 versus our guidance range of 2.50 to 2.70. After Rob's comments, I'll come back and discuss in more detail our segment by segment performance. Rob, I'll turn it over to you. Thanks, Rob. Let's go ahead and turn to our Application Software segment. Revenues here were 398 million up 1% on an organic basis, and EBITDA was 172 million or 43.1% of revenue. To start, our retention rates and other recurring revenues remain strong in the quarter. In addition, we saw better than expected software license sales in the quarter broadly across Deltek, Aderant and PowerPlan. Of note, sales pipeline bill that occurred prior to the quarter converted at a higher than anticipated rate. In addition and discussed earlier, we saw better service utilization rates and revenues than expected. Our laboratory software businesses Sunquest, Data Innovations and Clinisys all grew and performed nicely aided by the global demand to deploy diagnostic testing software interfaces and laboratory software associated with combating COVID-19. Specific to Sunquest, we received the termination fee payment for the Queensland project in the quarter. As a reminder, last quarter, we noted that the customer opted to terminate this implementation in the face of COVID-19 related challenges. CBORD, which is our software business that sells nutrition and food management software, as well as campus access solutions to hospitals and universities did decline, given their very limited access to both hospital and university clients. Broadly across this segment and of note, we are absolutely seeing an increased desire from our customers to migrate to our cloud or SaaS offerings, one of several trends that COVID appears to be accelerating. This should be a long-term growth driver for our business, as we have a large installed base of customers who will over time migrate to the cloud. And turning to the outlook for the segment, we expect to be roughly flat on organic basis for the second half of the year, with the third quarter facing a challenging prior your comp specific to perpetual license revenues. We continue to expect high levels of recurring revenue retention. As a reminder, the vast majority of our customers in this segment are enterprise or larger companies. Furthermore, we serve a diversified and durable set of end markets, most notably government contractors, marketing services firms, law firms, utilities and hospitals. That said we do anticipate some continued pressure on our new logo software license sales. This quarter's license revenues were aided by sales pipelines that were built pre-COVID and converted better than expected in the quarter. The second half funnel is increasingly comprised of post-COVID shut down activity. As a result, we expect our prospects decision timeframes may extend longer than our historical experience. That said we are encouraged by the fact that the top of the funnel activity looks good, and we liked the MQL, SQL conversion rates. But again expect decision timing could be more elongated than normal. With that next slide, please. Turning to our Network segment, revenues grew 2% organically to 423 million and EBITDA was 176 million or 41.5% of revenue. As a reminder, most of our software businesses in this segment share highly recurring SaaS revenue models, which are further aided by strong network effects that drive higher retention rates and network ads, which were certainly the case in this quarter. To this end, our ConstructConnect network expanded in the quarter and was driven by strong customer ads and network utilization. As a reminder, our ConstructConnect business's primary product provides building contractors with all available commercial building projects that are in the planning phase and enables them to bid and win work. In an economic environment like this one, the value of this product further increases. Our DAT business grew high single digits in the quarter led by large number of carrier additions to the network and strong growth in our rate data offering. To add to our rate data product capabilities, we acquired FMIC in the quarter. FMIC is the leading benchmarking and rate analysis firm focused on the contract freight market. When combined with DAT the FMIC data sets will be a unique product offering that benchmarks both the contract and spot truck freight markets in the US. In addition to FMIC, we also acquired Team TSI. We're integrating team TSI with our SHP business. When complete, the combined business will have a comprehensive operating, financial and quality benchmarks that span the continuum of post-acute care, namely skilled nursing and home health. In addition to helping the post-acute providers operate their businesses more efficiently, SHP will help improve patient outcomes through innovative real time data and evidence-based collaboration among acute care providers and their post-acute partners. We're excited to see this strategy unfold. As mentioned earlier, these bolt-on acquisitions have a combined purchase price of 150 million. Turning to last year's acquisitions and it's worth noting that Foundry and iPipeline continue to perform well and are proving to have quite resilient business models as we expect. As we look to our rf IDEAS and Inovonics businesses, they were challenged in the quarter directly resulting from having limited access to customers. And finally, the TransCore New York City congestion pricing infrastructure projects continues and is deemed essential. However, the project at the election of our customer has slowed and continues to push into 2021. Execution of the project remains strong, but the time is elongating. Turning to the outlook for the segment, we see mid-single digit organic growth in the second half. Relative to Transport and the New York project as mentioned, we see this project pushing to the right, notably about $0.20 of DEPS is being pushed into next year as compared to what we thought a quarter ago. That said, we continue to see growth and resiliency in our Network Software businesses driven by higher recurring revenues, strong retention rates, expanding networks and solid network participation. Next slide please. Turning to our Measurement and Analytical segment, revenues declined 1% organically to 364 million and EBITDA was 132 million or 36.2% of revenue. In the current environment this segments activities are best broken into four boxes, one, Verathon and IPA; two, other medical product businesses; three, Neptune and four, our industrial businesses. First, Verathon and IPA, both experiencing tremendous demand for their products directly attributable to hospital demand resulting from COVID-19. Verathon experienced strong demand for their GlideScope video intubation products. As a result of COVID-19 the percentage of all intubations not just COVID related that are being done using video assistance has meaningfully increased. Verathon's demand is both for capital systems, which means an expanding customer base and the pull through consumables. We have to give hearty congratulations to Earl, Tracy, Tim, Jeff and the entire team at Verathon. It's one thing to have unprecedented demand. It's a completely different thing to be able to flex the supply chain to fulfill the demand within a single quarter. Congrats and thanks to the Verathon team. A similar story with IPA, hospitals rapidly adopted their automated scrub distribution systems to help deploy scrubs more broadly to staff within the hospital setting. Second, and relative to our other medical product businesses, we did see revenue headwinds tied directly to government mandated lower patient volumes within acute care hospitals on a global basis. We also want to note that this group of companies consistently grows mid-single digits, but this growth is conditioned on regular hospital admissions patterns. Third, Neptune was negatively impacted by restricted access to indoor meters in particular in Canada, in the Northeast United States. And finally, and as expected, we did experience a sharp decline in our short cycle industrial businesses. However, in the second half of the quarter, we did see modest improvements in consumable demand. As we turn to the second half outlook, we expect to see mid-single digit growth in this segment led by continued strong demand at Verathon for the reasons just discussed. In addition, we expect to see reduced levels of non-emergent capital procedures providing continued headwinds for a non-Verathon and non-IPA medical product businesses. We do expect to see improvements in Neptune on easing lockdowns, especially in the Northeast United States, which will provide better access to indoor meters. Also, we're cautiously optimistic given that July municipal budgets appear to be largely intact. And finally, we expect to see gradual improvements in our short cycle industrial end markets. Next slide, please. Turning to our Process Technologies segment, revenues were 121 million in the quarter, down 26% on organic basis and EBITDA was 33 million or 27.4% of revenue. This was certainly a difficult quarter for these businesses and we expect the outlook to remain poor for the balance of 2020. Despite a uniquely challenging environment for these businesses, they still had high 20% EBITDA margins in the quarter. And our leadership teams have done a great job of navigating these end markets and continuing to make no regrets investments. We saw our upstream businesses decline approximately 40% in the quarter. Our PAC business also declined, and it was related to weak fuel demand in the quarter. As a reminder PAC is our laboratory fuel analysis business. Also, CCC was weak based on the inability to perform field service work, all related to COVID-19. One bright spot in the quarter was Zetec, which experienced growth based on the strength of their new non-destructive testing products. Also in the quarter, we initiated targeted restructuring actions across a few of our businesses in this segment, which resulted in a $13.6 million charge. None of these structural changes were considered in our guidance from a quarter ago. These actions will position these businesses to better serve its customers and realize longer term savings. While the oil and gas markets and customer commitments remain more muted, we believe this is the right time to execute these restructuring activities. The outlook for the balance of the year continues to be an extremely challenging one, as we expect to see approximately 25% organic decline for the second half. Specifically, we do not anticipate any recovery in upstream oil and gas markets and expect upstream to account for less than 40 million of revenues in the second half. In addition, we expect to continue to have limited customer access, which hampers our ability to perform field service work. Next slide please. As we turn to our guidance, we're narrowing and modestly raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of 11.90 and 12.40 per share. We continue to guide full year organic revenues to be plus or minus flat. In addition, we're initiating DEPS guidance for 3Q in the range of 2.90 to $3. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Next slide please. Given the global pandemic and associated shutdowns in the quarter, we're pleased with our performance, with revenue only being down 3% organically, EBITDA margins holding flat versus the prior year at 35.3% and cash flow growing 10% to 315 million. From an operating point of view, our businesses remain focused on employee health and safety continue to improve the efficiency of remote work, to remain super intimate with our customers and continue to focus on long-term durable growth. To this end, our businesses continue invest in growth oriented operating initiatives. Our leaders, all of whom are long-term builders are masterful at maintaining product investments during down cycles, which oftentimes lead to market share gains upon recovery. As a leadership team, we remain steadfastly committed to this concept. For the full year, we expect to have plus or minus flat organic revenue growth. We believe our portfolio of businesses and our governance processes continue to be well suited to navigate these difficult times. Our balance sheet is stronger than at any point in history with over $1.5 billion of cash and $2.5 billion of revolver capacity. And specific to capital deployment, we do have a high quality and active pipeline of opportunities as private equity sellers have recently re-entered the market. That said and as always, our CRI based strategy focus is on long-term cash flow compounding, and we will continue to patiently evaluate and pursue capital deployment opportunities that are consistent with this strategy. And as we turn to your questions, I remind everybody that what we do is very simple. We compound cash flow by operating our portfolio of businesses that have leading positions and niche markets that have the proven ability to generate increasing cash flow as their businesses expand. We provide our business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative to driving long-term CRI accretive organic growth, with particular emphasis focused on strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. Our business leaders understand that success in our culture is based on their ability to compete and win for talent and to compete and win for customers that in turn allow us to compete and win for shareholders. To this end, we incent our management teams based on growth. And based on these factors and perhaps most importantly, we have a culture that is rooted in the principles of mutual respect, trust and transparency. And finally, we take the excess free cash flow that is generated by our businesses and deploy to buy businesses that have better cash returns on our existing company that in turn helps accelerate our cash flow compounding. It is these simple ideas that deliver powerful results. And with that, now let's turn to your question. Good morning, Deane. No. Hey, Deane. No change whatsoever in the scope, the contract value that we talked about a few quarters ago remains the exact same. And so the only thing that is happening here is the project is pushing a bit to the right into 2021 for the reason you said, a little bit access to personnel related to COVID and a little bit just at the election of the customer line to paste the project a little bit. And I think also we highlighted last quarter, I mean, the motivation of the client is never been higher. I think it was just around this time last quarter. The proceeds from the project for 2021 and '22 could be used in MTAs operating budget where the initial project that was going to be used for capital only, so there is a clear motivation to get the \u2013 by the customer to get the project up and running. It's just slipping to the right a little bit. That's correct. If your question is relegated to the medical product businesses versus price, if you relegate to that as a broader to Roper, I want to make sure I'm answering the question \u2013 Okay. Yeah. So it's a net \u2013 a meaningful net grower, right, when you look at the benefit of those of Verathon and IPA good guy against the bad guys of the other four or five medical product businesses aggregated together, it's a very meaningful positive, good guy. It's worth noting though, the Verathon demand while it certainly surged in the quarter, the team worked really well to work down the backlog a little bit more to go in the second half of the year. The team that Verathon believes that the demand is \u2013 will endure a bit right. It's about the number, the percentage or the market share of global incubations that are being done with video assistance versus not. Going into the pandemic, it was somewhere in the 15% of all intubations were done with video assistance and 85 direct. And that market share video is going \u2013 it's meaningfully higher now and it will stay. It'll be meaningfully above 15% on the backside of this, so the market just grew, we believe, for these products that Verathon has. Thank you. Hey, Scott, good morning. Yeah, happy to talk through that, so just to remind you and everyone ConstructConnect, the primary part of the business all for non-residential or commercial construction in the United States and Canada that's in the planning phase. So once a shovel goes in the ground, other constituents in the value chain pick up that. This is about planning. It allows general contractors, subcontractors, building product manufacturers to be aware of the projects are being planned, so they can bid for and win those projects and we have software that organizes all of that activity. So when the market is raging hot, right, all the subcontractors have more work and they can possibly do the value of leads or what new projects is lower, right. And so we've always sort of said, if there's five market conditions, five is white hot and one is there's basically zero construction, that constructing that value proposition is best in positions two, three and four, right, where there's work and activity going on, but not so much work that contractors have so much to do, right. And so, what's essentially happened here and ConstructConnect reports on this and Zach can give it to you is, nonres construction activity is down 28% versus prior year. It was up a little bit in June versus May. But that's the exact environment where the value proposition of leads and project awareness sort of thrives. And that's why you saw more contractors come into the ConstructConnect market and grow in the quarter. Really appreciate the question. So history, if you go way back in the ark of ConstructConnect, some of them will stay and some of them will leave. But since our ownership in '16, the ConstructConnect team has worked really hard to build habituation into the product, if you will. So now there's integrated takeoff which is the estimation process and directly linked and so we believe the customers when we look at the utilization of the product, they're in the product on a multi time a day basis now, where five, six, seven years ago, they'd be in the product only when they needed to look for any project. And so we believe based on that the sort of the long-term retention rates of the business go up. Yeah. Congrats on the book as well. We can Steve. Hey, I think its Steve, right? Yeah, okay. So in the second quarter, I mean, yeah, I think the second quarter software for the reasons we said on Application Software, I mean, it was the better utilization rates on the service side. And we expected more deferral or push outs of the license activity. And that proved to be a little conservative. And so that was broad that license activity was brought across Deltek, Aderant, PowerPlan. We saw good performance across the diagnostic businesses that we just talked about. Excuse me, some of that \u2013 a lot of that was COVID related. Sounds like he went on, okay. Okay Jeff. I'll take the first part of that. Let Rob take a second. Hey, it's directly \u2013 the Application Software margin performance in the quarter is directly tied to better license activity as you know, perpetual licenses in quarter are super high margin, 90 plus percent, 85%, 90%, so when they perform an expectation on license, and you tend to have better margin performance. Yeah, and more broadly coming \u2013 this time last quarter in the height of the shutdown, a risk item that we \u2013 or were flagged was our Neptune's customers budgets going to be intact as they rolled into their New Year's because a large percentage of these customers have a July 1 fiscal year just given the broader economic challenges that municipalities and cities are experiencing. The good news is the budgets appear to be largely intact, so that high \u2013 the first risk item appears to be mostly retired. Remaining risk item is now the spend against the budget, right and that's to be determined, but the first step is a checkmark and we'll see how things unfold the rest of the year. Yeah, thank you. Hey, good morning. Yeah. So the products \u2013 the companies that we have that are somewhat indexed to procedure volume, its one derivative behind it, right. So very little of our businesses are consumable in a procedure, but our capital and products are used by other companies who are \u2013 and used in a procedure. And so we're buffered a little bit by what our customers are seeing. We did see a little bit in the second, maybe the June time period, some of the true consumables sort of pick back up. And that's just going to be evolved for the balance of the year. We would expect, as I mentioned, the open continent the prepared remarks, I mean, this group of businesses going back for many, many years grows like clockwork at mid-single digits, and that assumes a patient volume yet that are normalized and so to the extent volumes are normal in 2021, then we would see a pickup in that group of businesses. Yeah, I'll leave it. It's sort of on the qualitative basis, right. So as we said for a long time, we \u2013 as a guiding principle, we allow our customers to pace the transition to the cloud, we don't force it or have a force product migration or just they're waiting for that to occur. We have some businesses like Strata that are born in the cloud. We have other businesses like Aderant and PowerPlan that are still vast, vast majority on-premise. And then we have companies like Deltek that are somewhere in between, right, sort of in the middle in their journey of the migration. What we've seen at Deltek is that that migration is a net growth driver. And we can talk about that in more detail later to the extent you're interested. But you basically are taking a large installed base of customers who pay you annual maintenance and you're uplifting them to the cloud. So you're providing all the backbone and IT sort of management services, but also, you're doing all the release management, getting them on the most recent release. They're more micro releases. And so the customers get to take advantage of what you're actually developing. And that has real value associated within the mind's eye of the customers. And so for that reason, as they migrate from on-premise to cloud, there's an uplift in recurring, a pretty meaningful one and that's a that's a multiyear growth driver for our enterprise on Application Software or an Application Software. Thank you. Good morning. It's not \u2013 I think it would have a slight impact. And the reason I say that I'm looking at Rob and Shannon, it's not something we talked about right. And so about an infrastructure bill, we're not rooting for one so I think we're \u2013 Yeah, Rob's point there is a very good one, right, so the contractors go where the fast flow is in a government spend. And so maybe you get a few more government contractors that could be dealt like customers, but that's not over yet [ph]. Well, I'll set it up. I'll give you some context and let Rob sort of give you his view. So as we mentioned, last quarter in this segment, about 70% of revenues are recurring, 20% are tied to services and that's generally coming \u2013 working off some sort of six to 18 month backlog and then 10% of the revenue is that perpetual license. So the most short-term impacted is that 10%, so that tends to mute the magnitude of the swing in any given period of time, assuming that the in flight implementation projects don't stall. We see a lot of that block, if any of that activity in the quarter. So with that Rob? Thank you. Good morning, Alex. These are all rough numbers, but yeah, go ahead. Alex, appreciate the question. So I'll give you a little bit of context and color. So we had a pretty \u2013 the activity coming into COVID. I mean, it was as busy as we had been that I can recall since being here in 2011 in terms of what the funnel activity looked like. Obviously, everything shut down. I mean, when the credit markets shut down, everything shut down in April and May. It was there was really no activity anywhere. No sellers were selling anything for obvious reasons. But the end of May, first part of June we saw some green shoots, we obviously got these two bolt-on's complete, which are sort of in the pipeline pre-COVID. And really here since the middle of June, until now, it's almost as if we're back to January, February in terms of private equity seller interest in activity. The private credit markets aren't fully back, but they're back enough to give sponsors confident that they can run a process or processes. And so we're encouraged by all that because we're sitting here with what you just said a large amount of cash and borrowing capacity to sort of continue this \u2013 our long-term CRI driven sort of compounding strategy. I will note the things that we see that \u2013 obviously, the things that come out of the shoot first after a slowdown are the very best assets, right, the ones that have the best niches, the best competitive position, the best highest level of recurring revenue, durability, things like that. And those tend to be fairly valued, right. There's not a lot of bargains that we would say we see in the software space, but values \u2013 valuations consistent with what we saw coming into the pandemic. We can only speculate what's in the mind's eye of the sellers, right, but a couple of things. First is, the types of \u2013 everything I just said I should have qualified by saying our M&A pipeline is 100% software focused, right and so these are businesses even in the public markets that are proving to be resilient, sort of the comparables if you will and so that is \u2013 colors my comments on what a funnel activity looks like. The other thing is private equity sellers, which is where we buy 100% of our assets from have to return capital. They have limited sort of pressures. That's a constant drumbeat. And then finally, and this is me certainly speculating about private equities view of what might happen in election and taxes, but that certainly may be a motivating factor to get some things done by the end of this year. Happens to me all the time. So we would echo those comments that companies like Roper in our history is we continue to invest in product through cycle, especially in the down cycle because your competitors oftentimes are not able to. We also stay super close to our customers, the vast majority of what we \u2013 our companies have direct channel access or a sap to work through a distributor so you stay super close to the customers and almost certainly on the back end, you can gain share either because of customer intimacy or because you develop or launch some new product or product capability, so 100% that is the case for Roper in this current environment. As our \u2013 my predecessors said many years ago, our discipline is only outmatched by our patience. Thank you."

            "name": "Rob Crisci",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Roper Technologies as always. So turning to page seven, looking at our Q2 income statement performance, Q2 organic revenue declined 3% versus prior year with total revenue coming in at 1.306 billion. We had positive organic revenue growth in both Application Software and Network Software and Systems, while sharp declines and our smallest segment Process Technologies pulled our overall organic growth into low single digit negative territory for the quarter. Margin performance, as Neil mentioned, was a standout in the quarter as our businesses expanded gross margin by 70 basis points to 64.7% and held EBITDA margins flat at 35.3%. As a result, EBITDA declined only 2% to 461 million. Our tax rate came in at 22.3%, a little higher than last year, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.94, which was well above our guidance range of 2.50 to 2.70, so in summary, really good execution by our business leaders in a very challenging environment. Next slide, turning to page eight and looking at cash flow, cash flow performance for the quarter was very strong. On a GAAP basis, our operating cash flow was 449 million, which represented a 49% increase over last year. However, for better compatibility and clarity, we are adjusting our results for the 124 million of income tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to COVID-19 and those taxes were subsequently paid in July. So after adjusting for the timing of the 124 million of tax payments that pushed to July, our Q2 operating cash flow grew 8% to 325 million, which represented 25% of revenue. Q2 free cash flow grew 10% to 315 million, which was 24% of revenue. Looking back at the past two years, our Q2 free cash flow has compounded a strong 12%. Congrats and a special thank you to the finance teams at each of our businesses for continuing to make cash flow and cash collections a high priority. It truly was outstanding cash Flow performance in a challenging environment. Next slide, turning to page nine and our asset light business model and negative working capital slide. We exited the first quarter with working capital of minus 4.4% and in Q2 we further improved this metric with working capital as a percent of revenue moving to minus 5.4%. While we're certainly happy as always, to see our income statement hold up well in Q2, we believe it's just as important if not more important, that our cash flow and working capital metrics also remain strong. In fact, as we continue to improve on these important working capital metrics, despite the challenging macro environment, this bodes very well for our ability to compound cash flow at higher levels as the economy does eventually rebound from the pandemic. Next slide, turning to page 10, our strong financial position, so it's really a continuation here of the same story we discussed last quarter. Roper's liquidity position and balance sheet remained very strong. We ended June with over 1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet. To date in July as mentioned, we have made some tax payments about $316 million of tax payments have been paid to date in July. That's the previously mentioned 124 million of deferred payments as well as 192 million of taxes due on the gain from last year's Gatan sale. So after making these payments, our cash balance today is approximately 1.6 billion and our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility remains fully undrawn. In June, we took advantage of historically favorable conditions in the bond market and issued 600 million of 10-year notes at a coupon of 2.0%. At the time, we tied the record for the lowest coupon ever issued by a Triple B issuer. Really great execution by our team and nice to once again see very strong demand for Roper bonds driven by our consistent ability to generate cash flow, high levels of recurring revenue and our diversified portfolio of asset light businesses. At the end of the quarter our net debt to EBITDA stood at 2.1 times. And with our large cash balance and fully undrawn revolver, we remain very well positioned with significant financial capacity to take advantage of our large pipeline of acquisition opportunities. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil. Hey, Deane. Yeah, that's \u2013 yeah, that's correct Deane. So the project was originally around 200 million for this year, and now we've got about 110 or so million in for 2020. And as Neil mentioned, the rest is pushed to the right, and we expect to be completed in '21. Hey, Scott. I would just add to that it's a SaaS business, Scott. So there's not huge swings in the revenue like you get with a perpetual license bid. We're seeing increased activity in the network and that leads to a little bit of more subscriptions, more customers, and then over time, that drives additional growth with the business. Yeah. Sure, Steve. So there's the two acquisitions in the quarter, combined purchase price about 150 million. And we've got about 25 million or so revenue in the model for '21. And EBITDA margins there in the mid to high 40s. So pretty good cash, but each business is being integrated into a business. So there was not a lot added for the second half, but there's some integration going on, but that built a real good strategic adds to the Roper businesses. Right, yeah, there's a lot of good \u2013 good things that happened in acute care software in the quarter which are driven by the demand around COVID. Right, so that's \u2013 some of that stuff happened in the second quarter that we didn't expect. And we'll see what continues into the second half, but that's difficult to predict. And then we also received the Queensland payment for Sunquest, which put revenue and large high margin net revenue in the second quarter as well, which helped. And then as we look at the second half the margins don't move around a lot in the other segments, which is a great thing, right. It's high recurring revenue, very stable business models you don't get this sort of swaying, so we certainly expect EBITDA margins to be sort of flat or a little bit better year-over-year in the software segment. Very low dollars percent of revenue, I mean, it's going to be the part of Neptune that swings around with budgets. And Neptune's a pretty stable high recurring revenue business. So it's a real small percentage of the segment in single digits, it's going to really be driven by swinging budgets. Hey, Joe. Just to give you a sense Joe, so the sort of other medical products businesses which exclude Verathon and IPA, which have a huge COVID benefit, so everything else, those businesses were down double digits in the quarter, and they would normally be mid-single growers. And so I think we will catch up some of that at some point, but it's very difficult to predict when. Yeah, I think the government contractors are always betting money on whatever there is to spend money on. Yeah, they are just very stable businesses. So I'm just looking through all the software businesses and sort of they're all kind of between a low single digit gain or low single digit decline, with the exception of CBORD, which is a little bit worse than that. So again, that a little bit better than expected because you know a huge part of the businesses are stable. The question is are you going to get any of these license wins in the quarter? Are you able to look to deliver services? And we were. And so to the extent that continues, that certainly helps us, there's just aren't big swings in these businesses, which of course, we had huge swings in the product businesses where there's more issues with not being able to access customers, et cetera. They are Alex. So there was an interim step in there that last quarter with the 200 became 175. And now it's 110, so the move from 175 to 110 is your $0.20. That's real hard. Yeah, that's really impossible to predict. We're going to do the work we always do and we certainly have the capacity, but we only do the best deals and we never feel pressured. But certainly the balance sheet has never been stronger. So we feel good about our ability to deploy capital this year. Thanks."

I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O\u2019Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today\u2019s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you\u2019ll please turn to slide two, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A description can be found on this page, in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today\u2019s call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to slide three. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter and year primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue. And now, if you\u2019ll please turn to slide four, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks Zack and good morning everyone. First, and most importantly, we hope that everyone that is joining us this morning and your families are staying safe and our in good health. With that in mind, our first quarter was quite good, 4% organic revenue growth, expanding gross and EBITDA margins, and very strong cash flow coming in at 13% above last year. After a brief run through of Q1 results, I'll turn the call to Rob and he will discuss our P&L, our balance sheet, and our cash position. We find ourselves in a very fortunate position to have $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and a completely undrawn $2.5 billion revolver. Then, I'll turn to discuss our operational status and respond to the COVID-19 situation. To this end, all of our product businesses are deemed essential, and all our non-production workforce are being productive working remotely from home. As we turn to our segment discussion, the majority of our comments will focus on a detailed view of how our businesses and business models should perform through the current situation. The impacts we're seeing across our diverse set of businesses range from a pause and new license sales for some of our high recurring revenue software business to a positive spike in demand for Verizon's critical medical products to sharp declines in our Industrial and Process Technologies businesses.  Following this, we will break down our Q2 and full year organic revenue guidance. In the midst of this global economic shutdown, we are guiding our full year organic revenues be plus or minus flat. This is a remarkable testament to the durability of our business model. During the discussion of our guidance, we outlined to you the assumptions that would cause our earnings to be on the low or high end of our guidance range. I'll then turn to discuss our outlook for continued capital deployment and end with a summary of a few of the Roper companies that are on the frontlines responding to the COVID-19 virus. Finally, we'll turn to your questions. Now, let's turn to a brief run through our Q1 results. Next slide please. Q1 was quite good for us. Our businesses continue to work hard to execute strategy and town offenses. And Q1 is another good data point that what we're doing is taking hold. revenue grew 4% organically, with solid organic growth in three of our four segments. Gross margins and EBITDA margins expanded nicely and debt came in at $3.05, a $0.05 above our guidance range. And as we said for nearly 20 years, cash is the best performance measure with free cash flow being up 13% in the quarter to $353 million, which was 26% of revenue and 76% of EBITDA. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rob to discuss or detail financial performance.\nRob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. It's really great to have the opportunity to connect with all of you today. Turning to page six, Q1 income statement metrics. As Neil mentioned, organic growth was a very solid 4%, which was better than we had expected coming into the quarter. We did have positive organic growth in three of the four segment, led by Network Software & Systems at plus 9% and Application Software at plus 5%. Once again, really strong margin execution by our business leaders in the quarter, driving strong operating leverage while continuing to invest for future growth, gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 63.5%. EBITDA margin also expanded 50 basis points to a record 34.5%, driving very solid 7% EBITDA growth for the quarter. Earnings before taxes increased 7% to $408 million. As a reminder, last year, we had a $43 million discrete tax item in Q1, resulting in a $0.41 benefit, which drove our tax rate last year below 10%. This year our Q1 tax rate was a more normal 21%, which resulted in debt of $3.05, which was well above our guidance range, as Neil mentioned. So in summary, a really strong operational quarter for Roper and really great execution by our business leaders. Next slide. Turning to cash flow, Q1 operating cash flow 364 million was a 10% increase versus prior year, Q1 free cash flows was $353 million, a 13% increase versus prior year. So, looking over the past few years, our Q1 free cash flows compound at a very strong 14%. As Roper -- at Roper, as Neil said, and as you've all said, as you know, hundreds of times over the past few decades, we really do believe cash is the best measure performance and those are really another great cash flow. We've consistently compared our EBITDA to free cash flow at a rate well above 70% over the past several years, as you can see 76% conversion in Q1 and we certainly expect to have strong cash conversion to continue moving forward. Next slide. So turn to page eight. The asset light business model, once again we exited the quarter with negative net working capital, negative 4.4%. That was aided by consistently strong working capital management across the enterprise and increasing deferred revenue across our portfolio of niche market leading software businesses. Brokers focus on cash flow and working capital will be especially important as we work our way through the pandemic. While we certainly could see some negative short term impact from delayed payments in some affected end markets such as acute healthcare, we are well positioned overall given the durable and markets we serve. Our large deferred revenue balance gives us a very high recurring revenue base, limiting earnings volatility. On a cash basis, spread across the independent businesses and rather evenly throughout the calendar year, limiting any impact of attrition on our cash conversion. So in closing, we expect our working capital to remain negative and our strong cash conversion to continue in 2020 and beyond. Next slide. So turning to the balance sheet and the strong financial position, this is always a very important slide, but even more critical in today's economic environment, dealing with really the unprecedented shock to global economic activity around the pandemic. We will first look at the numbers here and then I'll spend a little time on the following slide to talk more about our outlook, and the steps we've taken at Roper to prepare ourselves to continue to execute on our discipline capital deployment strategy. In short, Ropers liquidity position and balance sheet are very strong. We currently have over $1 billion of cash on hand and our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility remains fully undrawn As a reminder, we divested our Gatan -- we do have approximately $200 million of cash taxes yet to be paid on the Gatan divestiture and that payment is now not due until July with a postponement of tax day. So in summary at the end of the quarter, gross debt set at $5.3 billion against nearly $2 billion of trailing EBITDA for a gross debt to EBIT a ratio of 2.7 times. However, taking into account our unusually large cash balance, net debt was only $4.3 billion. Next slide. So turning to page 10, I wanted to take a moment really during the unprecedented time and review we think -- what we think are the many benefits of brokerage in the business model. The diversification we have across 45 independent, high margin asset light businesses operating across many different niches resulted in excellent credit profile. We are not dependent on specific end markets and almost nothing is centralized, limiting the overall financial impact of any facility closures or industry, specific economic shocks. So aided by our business model and diversification, we are confident that Roper Enterprise will continue to generate high levels of cash flow in nearly all conceivable macroeconomic scenarios. As mentioned earlier, we have over \u2013 balance sheet, which as you all know, is a very unusual \u2013 unusually high number for over I think longtime shareholders realize how unusual this is. Typically we hold a limited amount of cash and drawn a revolver to fund acquisitions. This is however fortunate timing given the pandemic and something we want to take advantage of with an eye toward future cash flow compounding. So over the last couple of weeks, we initiated and completed an amendment process with 100% support from our bank group to modify our gross debt to EBITDA covenant to receive credit for this cash. It was fascinating [indiscernible] with the banks. We are one of the only companies that kind of demanded process as a purely offensive move. This process really was an eye opener to just how unique our company is. My thanks to Shannon and also our high quality Bank Group for all the work to complete this amendment quickly and successfully. So under the new calculation, our net debt to EBITDA ratio currently fits at 2.1 times, which is about a half a turn lower than old calculation compared to the continent of 3.5. So in summary, we've remained very well \u2013 of our large pipeline of high quality [indiscernible] opportunities. So with that, I'll turn it back over, Neil.\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. It's worth underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and borrowing capacity. Also a great job by Rob and Shannon, and adjusting to a net debt covenant this further strengthens our capital appointment capacity and the ability to play offense at the appropriate time. Also, thanks to our lending group. Now let's turn to how we're responding operationally to COVID-19 sectors. We are blessed to have very few COVID-19 cases, each of which has recovered or is recovering. From an operational readiness perspective we are also fortunate. All of our businesses with manufacturing facilities have engage essential and remain operational delivering the vital products that our customers need during \u2013 at successfully transition to working from home. Our portfolio of niche businesses are characterized by having meaningfully reduced cyclical exposure, having high levels of recurring revenues, low asset intensity, low levels of fixed costs and high levels of operating cash flow. We operate this portfolio in a highly decentralized operating structure that enables rapid, nimble execution. Our locally driven, bottoms up approach to business planning performs exceptionally well in any environment and clearly. This is an unprecedented one. Given this, there have not been any top down mandates or mandatory targets, but rather a few guiding principles to consider and an incentive system that promotes investments and long-term organic growth. We did after businesses to assess the short and medium term impact to the demand drivers and take a sober view of each. Based on this, each business deploy appropriate cost countermeasures with emphasis on three items. First, each business work to manage their margins appropriately with always vigilant management of cash flow. Second, each business targeted mostly temporary cost, countermeasures. And third, each business continues to make no regrets investments in innovation and talent, all of which have a mind eye towards an offensive-oriented posture upon recovery. Also important and often under discussed is our direct channel access in the vast majority of our companies. Rarely does Roper have a business that relies on third parties or distributors for market access. Given this, we remain engaged with our customers in good times and bad. We learn, we adapt, most importantly, we stay connected. This typically enables market share capture in difficult times and accelerated benefits during the recovery cycle. And in all times, our leaders keep an intense focus on cash. Having worked through this process over the last several weeks, I'm incredibly proud of how our leaders have reacted and managed through the current situation. And I'd like to thank each and everyone for the work, hard decisions and difficult conversations you have had to endure. Thank you. As we turn to our first quarter segment results, I'll start with our application software segment. Briefly, a quick run-through of Q1, which was quite strong. Revenues were $405 million, up 5% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $156 million or 38.6% of revenue. The quarter was highlighted by continued strength at Deltek for consistent factors: strength in GovCon execution, nice wins at the enterprise level and certain professional service markets and continued cloud or SaaS adoption. However, based on the impact of C19 sheltering, Deltek did see a slowing in perpetual deal activity during the last couple of weeks in the quarter. Power plant was also strong in the quarter. The sales pipeline build that we discussed in prior quarters executed nicely. CBORD and Strata were strong. In CBORD's case, due to their integrated security and subscription-based software sold into higher-ed markets, and for Strata, much of the same, continued solid sales execution and adoption of their hospital-based cost accounting and financial planning solutions. As we turn to outlook considerations, we want to provide an overview of the business model drivers for the businesses in this segment. To start, about 10% of the revenues in this segment are derived from perpetual software licenses. Within this bucket of revenue, new sales are derived principally from three sources: new logos; add-on product sales to existing customers; and finally, seat or volume expansions. Given the current economic outlook, we expect the vast majority of new logo sales to meaningfully slow down for the balance of the year. However, we do expect some volume of add-on product bookings to continue. Typically, during economic slowdowns, some level of selling activity does occur within this bucket of license revenue. These types of projects are smaller dollar and sold and delivered remotely. The next bucket of revenues are tied to service delivery. Service revenues arise from two sources: new product implementations or existing product upgrades. The first bucket is tied directly to new license sales, either new logos or add-ons. The second bucket or services upgrade, run independent of new license activity. The services book of business runs off a six to 12-month backlog. To date, the vast majority of our service projects continue, albeit at a slower pace, given both our customers and our delivery teams are adjusting to working remotely. We expect this revenue stream to be minimally impacted during the course of the year. Finally, the remaining 70% of revenue is tied to recurring maintenance or SaaS-based revenues. Our companies in this segment, service end markets that are expected to perform relatively well versus a broader economy, government contractors, law firms, healthcare and education. Given we mostly serve larger enterprises and less affected end markets, we do expect retention rates to remain high. Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss some specific business impacts. Our application software businesses have proven to be extremely durable and consistent organic growers and will continue to do so once customer access and activities begin to come back online. However, in an environment where we essentially \u2013 where essentially all businesses on a global basis are closed, these businesses will be modestly impacted. As we look at Deltek specifically, we expect the government contractor market to continue to perform well. New lead generation and pipeline build have continued during the last few weeks. On the other hand, we do expect a slowdown in new logo bookings and their professional service markets as the companies they serve are in meaningfully impacted segments and tend to be SMB sized. PS revenue and retention should perform well across both GovCon and Professional Service markets. Turning to Aderant, PowerPlan and CBORD, we believe these businesses will be impacted in a similar fashion. We expect some net new logo bookings to slow for the next few quarters as these businesses tend to rely on face-to-face interactions to drive enterprise level new logo sales. These activities will likely be limited for the remainder of 2020. The smaller, add-on type product sales are expected to maintain at some level, albeit at a lower level of sales activity. All three of these businesses have done a fantastic job of shifting their implementation and service activities to be remotely delivered. Recurring revenue retention should perform well. As we look at our four businesses, we sell into the hospital setting, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience limited physical access to hospitals. Also, given the financial duress, most U.S. health systems are facing, we expect hospital capital spending to be meaningfully down in 2020. That said, labs are extremely busy improving their value to the world over right now. Our teams have been busy enabling all the new COVID-19 tests and will continue to do so. As a direct result to COVID-19, the Sunquest project in Queensland has been canceled. Strata should continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. We expect continued strong demand for Strata solution, which help hospitals identify and manage costs and help model and execute financial plans. Finally, we do anticipate a possible acceleration to the cloud on the back end of the current environment. As customers have had to implement their DR plans, they are likely returning with an increased appetite to offload and remote it management of their core systems. Time will tell. Next slide, please. Turning to our network segment. Q1 revenues grew 9% organically to $441 million. EBITDA was $185 million or 42% of revenue, a solid quarter, indeed. TransCore's work for the congestion pricing infrastructure project continued in the quarter as it has been deemed essential work by the state of New York. Network software was strong and highlighted by iTrade and DAT. iTrade grew high single digits on the back of strong renewal and cross-sell activity. DAT continued to expand our network and successfully completed the market launch of rate forecasting and book-it-now capabilities. Finally, RF Ideas did very well due to their identity management solutions. For this segment, approximately 60% of the revenues are driven by our network software businesses, 85% of which are recurring. These businesses have very strong network effects and generally serve less impacted end markets such as healthcare, life insurance, logistics, food and media and entertainment. Given the core software functionality value and strong network benefits, we expect retention rates to hold up well across these businesses. Relative to TransCore, as mentioned, the New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project continues and is deemed essential. Over the course of the last couple of weeks, New York State and the MTA budget moved the congestion pricing toll revenue into the operating budget versus the MTA capital budget. Our view is that this modestly increases the urgency of this project. All this being said, we have pushed the project to the right a bit, moving approximately $25 million into early 2021. For the balance of TransCore, project activity continues and will continue, but we do expect some projects to be pushed into 2021. Over a longer arc of time, the business case for all electronic tolling may accelerate as a result of the current health pandemic. Essentially, human to human contact paying a toll may be greatly reduced, if not eliminated. TransCore will be ready to execute if this demand driver accelerates. Next slide, please. Turning to some company-specific impacts for the software businesses in our network segment. First, our DAT and ConstructConnect. Both of these businesses have subscription-based revenue models. Both have some exposure to small and medium sized businesses, but also work directly with large enterprises. Both businesses have network benefits that typically exhibit countercyclical behavior. For example, and specific to ConstructConnect, the core product is a lead \u2013 is a project lead identification source. As more contractors look for fewer projects, they tend to enter our network to source and bid for new project business. In the first three weeks in April, it's encouraging to see the ConstructConnect network expands modestly. For DAT, the brokers stay connected to the network and take advantage of lower spot rates versus contracted rates and carriers stay connected to find load volumes. iTrade is quite busy connecting food retailers . With an increasing number of grower shippers, we expect minimal disruption here. iPipeline has been super active helping their life insurance customers adapt their products and their underwriting processes in this environment. The outlook remains stable here as well. Relative to foundry, content creation continues. There is a large pipeline of post-production work that is currently being processed as well as continued new animation content creation. As a potential early read for western production, Chinese live-action has restarted on a limited basis. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses will perform relatively well but are not spared from some level of impact. Both SHP and SoftWriters customers are being impacted by the lack of hospital-based procedures and the associated outpatient recoveries. For instance, new starts of care for home health are down 30% to 35% versus a year ago. We expect these customers to likely pause buying new products until their patient volumes return. Retention, however, should remain high as our products are needed for cooperation\u2019s. And finally, MHA's revenues are tied to pharmaceutical utilization across long-term care settings. Starting now and likely for several quarters into the future, new admissions into long-term care settings will likely slow. However, this should only modestly impact the growth rate of MHA. Next slide, please. Turning to our Measurement & Analytical Segment. Q1 revenues grew 3% organically to $365 million. EBITDA was $123 million or 33.6% of revenue. The quarter was highlighted by strong growth at Verathon amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Unrelated to C-19, Verathon saw continued traction in their new single-use bronchoscope products. Additionally, Northern Digital and Neptune continued their solid string of growth. Also, we did experience declines, as expected, in our short-cycle industrial businesses with some further weakening in the quarter due to COVID-19. Turning to the outlook. This segment can be analyzed across four areas: Verathon, other medical products, Neptune and industrial. At Verathon, we are experiencing truly unprecedented demand for their GlideScopeAmid products. Intubation procedures have skyrocketed due to COVID-19. Verathon's video intubation products enable the caregiver to intubate a patient with appropriate spatial distance from the patient, making the intubation procedure meaningfully less risky for the caregiver. The demand for these products is global and has been sustained since the middle of March. Our other medical product businesses, which grow organically MSD like Clockwork in virtually all environments, are likely negatively impacted based on the global nature of historically lower hospital-based volumes and the associated economic impact. Hospitals have never been forced to defer all non-emergency cases. Neptune is a very stable growth business due to the consistent required meter upgrade and replacements. Given the shelter in-place requirements, limited access to indoor meters and municipality budget uncertainties, some level of sales activity will likely push to the right with the most acute impact being in the second quarter. Finally, our industrial businesses are negatively impacted and generally tied to industrial output. Our industrial products are critical to industrial production processes. There are some pockets of strength, Danisco, Party [ph] and Hansen, but for this group, our revenues for these businesses will be tied to the pacing of plant reopenings. And as a green shoot, we are seeing strong activity across Chinese end markets as our markets come back online. Next slide, please. Turning to our Process Technologies segment. Revenues were $142 million in the quarter, down 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $46 million or 32.4% margins. This was a difficult quarter for these businesses, and we expect the outlook to remain extremely poor for the balance of 2020. We saw our upstream businesses decline in the high teens in the quarter. Also, CCC was weak based on the inability to perform field service work all related to C19. One bright spot in the quarter was Zetec, up mid-single digits based on growth from their new non-disruptive testing products. The outlook for the balance of the year is going to be an extremely challenging one. About 60% of the segment's revenue and about 6% of Roper's revenue is related to oil and gas. We will be hit the hardest, down approximately 50% in the second quarter in our upstream business. For the year, upstream revenues will be less than $100 million or roughly 2% of Roper. We do not expect the recovery at all in 2020. Our mid and downstream businesses are also meaningfully negatively impacted, but less so than our upstream businesses. Peso recovery here will be gated by CCC's ability to get into the field and perform field service work and the recovery of fuel refining for PAC. Next slide, please. As we turn to our guidance, we are initiating DEPS guidance for 2Q in the range of $2.50 to $2.70 and updating our full year DEPS guidance to be between $11.60 and $12.60 per share. Embedded in this guidance model is an increased full year tax rate of 23%. We built this model, as we always do, on a business by business, bottoms-up analysis. We have summarized the organic outlook for each segment for the second quarter and the full year with the underlying material assumptions. For application software, we see second quarter revenue down MSD, with full year revenue plus or minus low single digits. Where we settle for the full year is dependent upon the volume and timing of add-on perpetual deals, the pacing of services work and sustaining high recurring revenue retention rates. For network systems, we've seen second quarter organic revenues up low single digits and full year up mid-single digits to possibly low double digits. The largest variable is the pacing of the New York congestion pricing project. For MAS, we see this segment down mid-single digits in the second quarter and flat to up mid-single digit for the year. Principal factors for this segment are the sustained nature of Verathon's demand spike, the timing of medical procedures coming back online, the nature of water municipality budgets and the ramp of global industrial production. Finally, our process segment will be materially and negatively impacted. We expect 2Q revenues to be down at least 30% and full year down in the 20% to 25% range. Again, we do not expect recovery this year. When you roll all this together, we expect our consolidated organic revenues to be down mid-single digits for the second quarter. And for the full year, organic revenues are expected to be plus or minus low single digits. Again, this is a remarkable testament to the durability of our businesses and business model. Our teams did a good job responding to the demand shock and placing cost countermeasures in place, the vast majority of which being temporary. This enabled us to remain \u2013 this enables us to maintain high margins as we work through the demand shock retain virtually all no regrets investments and innovation and talent while preserving the operational flexibility to rebound quickly. Now let's turn to our summary. We had a very solid Q1, really proud of the team here for these results. As we quickly pivot towards operating in a C19 world, our enterprise remains fully operational, and working from home is proving to be highly effective. So effective that we'll likely remain in this posture for quite some time. Our balance sheet is stronger than at any point in history, with $1 billion in cash and $2.5 billion of revolver capacity. For the full year, we expect to have plus or minus flat organic revenue growth. We believe our portfolio of businesses and our governance processes are well suited to navigate this extremely difficult time. We will do so in a way that prudently balances short financial performance and cost countermeasures with that of long-term investments in innovation and talent. Our teams are keenly focused on market share gains, both now and upon recovery. As we execute our strategy that focuses on long-term cash flow compounding, we will continue to patiently evaluate and pursue capital deployment opportunities. Our process is rigorous and disciplined. We do expect many attractive capital deployment opportunities to arise from the current economic situation. As our balance sheet is very well positioned, we will offensively deploy capital as the right opportunities are identified. Final slide, please. As we prepare for your questions, I wanted to highlight a few examples of how Roper businesses are aiding in the fight against COVID-19. Our lab businesses enabled a new C-19 test to interface with lab information systems and provide results to doctors and patients. iTrade is connecting new food trading relationships as food buying shifted almost entirely to grocers. Strata is using their AI tools to help hospitals have financial clarity in these uncertain times. And Verathon, as discussed, is truly on the front lines. I'm extraordinarily proud to be able to lead this organization. Now let's turn to your questions.\nOperator: Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Dean.\nDeane Dray: It's great to hear everyone's voice on the call. And I just want to thank you for all the additional color that you provided today on both the application software and network software business models in the mix. That was helpful. And that last slide on all the ways you're participating in the COVID defense, that was great to see as well. So Neil, for the first question, it's the idea here is most companies are drawing on revolvers. You're obviously not doing that. You're at much stronger position. But keeping $1 billion in cash at the ready to deploy an M&A at the appropriate time, can you talk through the \u2013 when will be the appropriate time? Because will these \u2013 there be targets in distress that would be opportunistic? Because it typically takes a while for prices to reset in a downdraft like this. So maybe kind of set expectations on when and how you deploy M&A here? Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: Sure. Appreciate the question. In any environment, it's hard to predict the timing of capital deployment because, as you know, it's lumpy. But a few comments. First, leading into the shutdown, leading into the middle of March, we were extraordinarily active and pause several things and believe at the right time, we can unpause those things. Only time will tell there. But we stay in constant contact with the owners of those assets, the leadership team for those assets. And these were very late-stage sort of situations. On the \u2013 but once we work through that, sort of, late-stage part of the pipeline, there continues to be some level of discussions between sponsors and ourselves. We've spent years developing relationships. We know the portfolio as well. And this is the time where those relationships matter the most, because it's unlikely that here in the next couple, three, four, five months, how long it is, that there's going to be broad-based sell-side processes. But sponsors still have requirement to get liquidity back to their shareholders. And if there's one-off trades that make sense for both sides, we think those could happen. And then finally, they're more likely than not, we saw it in the last downturn in 2007, 2008, 2009 time frame as we studied that. I wouldn't call them just \u2013 they're just \u2013 there are likely be some companies that are distressed from a capital structure point of view, not from an operating point of view, which gives them -- sort of, they put them in a pinch to where we're able to acquire nice assets, operating assets and meet all of our criteria, but they just have made some poor decisions or have some bad timing on their capital structure. So there's really -- it's the nature of where we sort of target might change modestly, because you're right, it does take typically a couple of quarters, plus or minus, for private valuations to reset to where public ones are.\nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. And then a follow-up for Rob on working capital. You said that there was -- you might be seeing some delayed payments. Can you elaborate on that? And when you said you expect working capital to remain negative, was that a comment for quarterly or for the year? And how do you think the quarterly stacks out for -- in terms of being negative each quarter? Thanks.\nRob Crisci: Yeah. Good morning, Deane. Appreciate the question. It's always difficult to predict working capital, right? It's one of the toughest things to predict. We certainly know that there are some end markets, particularly acute care, healthcare, where if you call the news, there's going to be some challenges there where hospitals are slowing some payments, et cetera. So difficult to predict each quarter. I will say that our customers overall were in very durable end markets. And so, we expect really no credit risk across all of our customers. So it's a matter of timing of payments. And when you have the huge deferred revenue balance, when you have management teams, they're really close to their customers. We feel really confident that the working capital position will remain very strong and negative throughout the year.\nDeane Dray: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Steve.\nRob Crisci: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Thanks for all the detail. Every quarter, more successive detail on all the businesses. It's very helpful in helping us some industrial analysts understand these tech businesses. So I appreciate that. On the second quarter guide, the \u2013 it looks to me like your sales are down like $85 million -- $80 million to $90 million, just using kind of a mid-single-digit rate maybe. And \u2013 but the EPS decline of like $0.45 seems to be a pretty high decremental. Is that just kind of the nature of the business? How to \u2013 can you kind of just help us walk to kind of the profit performance there? Anything moving around mix wise?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. I'll start, and then I'll ask Rob to add any color. So obviously, the \u2013 this demand shop for every company came fast and deep, right? So we started feeling it across a few of our companies at the end of the quarter. And then obviously, it's sustained here through the first part of April. So a couple of comments. So first, when this happened, just from a planning perspective, we first \u2013 we didn't try to overreact or react too quickly. We first had to get everybody home, which took a week or two. We then took a week to 10 days to let our leaders really onboard and accept the reality of the demand shock. And then we started our planning process, which was really the first week or so in April. So sometimes takes by. And so by the time you do the planning process in the second quarter and then start putting in the cost countermeasures, it was really just starting to layer in now against what we believe is going to be the steepest demand shock. And so when you put those two together, you just naturally get sort of the worst leverage, if you will, in 2Q and things stabilized from that point in time.\nRob Crisci: Yes. And I'll just add to that. We talked a lot about the perpetual license timing. And so when you're in the second quarter period where the economy is basically shut down for at least the first month of the quarter. So we're not assuming much, if any, license revenue. As you know, that comes at a really high margin. We do have the TransCore project continuing, which is lower margin. So you're really also looking at some mix impacts, adding on to what Neil said.\nNeil Hunn: And then the final thing, Steve, so I should have mentioned at the onset is we're not adding back any of the restructuring costs. So that is a little bit of a headwind in the quarter as well.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. How much is that again?\nNeil Hunn: It's sub-$10 million.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. That makes some sense. And then it's my understanding that in some of these software businesses, you see kind of perhaps a bit of a pause, but then that's kind of a quarterly variance. We're kind of used to some CapEx businesses that are kind of more annual cycles. So that \u2013 are you expecting kind of a push on revenues in application software from second quarter into third, so that you kind of have a bit of like pent-up revenue in the second half of the year, if you will? Is that how we should kind of think about this or not really?\nNeil Hunn: So Steve, everything's certainly pushing to the right. We've not assumed that there's a \u2013 it's a 2Q push that comes back in 3Q. It's just everything sliding to the right. And to the extent what you describe happens, then that would lead us to be more on the higher side of our guidance than the lower side. On the new logo sales, the new customers that are buying relatively high dollar transformational type IT projects, those are going to be pushed to the right for the balance of the year for the most part, right? Who's going to make a big IT investment right now, setting aside how our salespeople actually get to that customer and sell. But the smaller ticket items, the upgrades and the add-on products, that level of activity has actually been quite nice. At Deltek, for instance, the top of the funnel here in the last three or four weeks, like this is the inquiries are up 30% to 35% versus a year ago. Now some of that is everybody's sitting at home doing Google searches, right? So the quality of that top of the funnel may not be as high. But what's been accepted as sales acceptance leads at Deltek has actually paced even a little bit ahead of last year. So the exact nature of how this thing is going to unfold because it's more of a shock than a cycle is yet to be seen.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry, one more for you. Any impact to MHA? I know that obviously, nursing homes and those types of things are having a real hard time right now dealing with all of this in certain areas, kind of struggle to understand whether that's it's obviously negative in life, but whether it's negative or positive for your business. How does that work here with the stress in nursing homes?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. So certainly, the number of new admissions to the skilled nursing, or SNF, sort of, care setting is likely going to be paused for quite some time, right? We're not putting in the elderly population in that care setting. So that \u2013 because the census, if you will, in SNFs, is going to be impacted by that. That will have some, but it'd be a modest and slow building impact, negative impact to the growth rate for MHA. What still happens, we're not seeing any meaningful discharges, right? The people that are in this setting for a long ark of time, they're not being pulled out because of what's going on. And this is just one of many growth drivers at MHA, right? You still have pricing that goes up. You still have pharmaceutical consumption per capita that goes up. You still have the team building to put new products online. There still are new pharmacies that will start that we'll capture. So there's a handful of sort of consistent growth drivers. But certainly, census levels will moderate some in the skilled nursing facility, which will impact the growth rate of modestly of MHA.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Thanks for the color guys. I appreciate it. Best of luck.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Good morning, everyone. This is John for Julian. Maybe switching back to working capital first. Can you talk a bit on how the unearned revenue is going to kind of play with that expectation? How well has that been holding up? And how much of a headwind can that be with AS guided down for Q2?\nRob Crisci: Yeah, sure. This is Rob. The way deferred revenue works for our software businesses is, it's just the passage of time that needs to happen in order for the revenue to be recognized. And so, as I mentioned on the call, it is \u2013 when you have a renewal, then \u2013 and then that's the point at which you hope the customer renews or they don't. And generally, they do at very high 90% renewal rates. And those renewals are time throughout the year. So as long as you maintain your recurring revenue, it's very, very steady. The deferred revenue continues to grow as the software businesses grow. A reminder, we're selling this software. It's really critical software systems across durable markets, like government contractors, mostly large enterprises to the customers. And so it's very, very steady. It gives you high levels of recurring revenue and high levels of cash flow. So we don't see any meaningful impact from that certainly in the short term.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then I guess maybe on that guided decline for next quarter, it does sound like a big chunk of that is just push out of licensing and so on. But is there any impact from kind of the mix here moving much more towards license and service rather than perpetual just being down to 10% now kind of as you say?\nNeil Hunn: Well, certainly, we expect the bucket of revenue of perpetual license revenue, the historical 10% number, that will be down. It will be impacted for the reasons that we talked about. The recurring won't be impacted in any meaningful way and the services backlog will work through the back -- the services teams to work through the backlog, as we've said. So I don't know if you have...\nRob Crisci: Yeah. And then, just, as you go through the guidance, keep in mind, we did increase the tax rate. So that's a big difference from prior guidance and if you're looking at last year versus this year. So the tax rate is a little bit higher. And then we are assuming relatively high deleveraging and process technologies, given all the declines there and that we're not assuming any sort of a rebound. And as Neil mentioned, we're taking specific cost actions as well that are flowing through. So those are all key drivers in the roll up.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nRob Crisci: Hey, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, I apologize if you went through some of the stuff with kind of quadruple passing this morning a little bit. So for TransCore, I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks, you pushed some off into next year. I don't think that should be too surprising. But given some of the stuff that's been in the paper recently about necessary permits and issues with different government agencies, can you talk about what actually needs to happen before this is able to be before the actual hardware can be deployed?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. The hardware is being deployed. The project is on track. It's on pace other than just pushing this $25 million in our planning assumptions into the Q1 of next year. What you may have read and what others have read is there \u2013 I think there is a distinct separation between the work that we're doing with our customer to put the infrastructure in, which is pacing for the reasons we said. It's now the revenue from this or the operating budget, not the capital budget because the MTA, obviously, revenues are way down, given what's going on. And then what happened \u2013 governmental process to enable and structure the tolling itself. That's going to happen at a very \u2013 in part of next year, but the infrastructure work continues, and that's our planning assumption. All the signals and all the discussions, as you can imagine, we stay very, very close with this customer, and we're in the same posture on that together with a customer.\nJoe Giordano: So does \u2013 I guess, would that put potentially like to push on some of the recurring revenue associated with this if there's some issue with like a go-live so you get your deployment and then there could be like a delay in when stuff actually goes on?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, it could. If we ultimately don't go in, then the maintenance part would not turn on would be our planning assumption there. But I think there's a pretty high level of interest by all parties to see this project turn on.\nJoe Giordano: Yes. Okay. And then again, you probably went through this a little bit. But on the software backlog that you have, like can you just talk me through how you're thinking about that in terms of whether it's a six-month or a year? Like what do you \u2013 what are you modeling in, in terms of like companies being smaller and needing less licenses and stuff like that?\nNeil Hunn: So well, there's a couple of different questions embedded there.\nJoe Giordano: Yes. I know.\nNeil Hunn: So first \u2013 but first of all, you have to go company by company. So really, all we're talking about in our comments where we see a meaningful headwind on the license activities at our application software business. We went company-by-company on the network side. The recurring nature, they'll be impacted, but doesn't have the license activity because they're all SaaS businesses there. So when you look at application software, it's really the combination of those companies there that are going to likely not have large new customer perpetual deals happen in this environment. The smaller products, the add-on projects, the upgrade projects, the increased functionality, the how do you turn on, do some SaaS conversions, right, during this process, during the current economic environment, the activity in the sales funnel suggests that's going to continue, but currently five or six weeks end of situation, we have to see how that continues. So that's on the license side. On the services side, the services work results from selling licenses. So there'll still be some of that. And then there's a fair amount of upgrades that happened. And actually, when times like this are actually a pretty decent time to upgrade systems, because you have maybe less people in the office and less user activity, so the IT staff to do what they need to do to get to a new version. Now we have to see if it actually plays out. But even if it doesn't, even if that has slowed, the services teams work off a six to 12-month services backlog of implementation, they basically have six to 12 months to replenish the backlog from new sales activities.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. So fair to say you're assuming that the big \u2013 like essentially like a zero and new big licensing and things like that for now.\nNeil Hunn: Well, again, you've got to parse it out, right? It's very low large new logos assumed in the planning horizon. There is going to be some new licensing for the product add-ons. That's exactly right.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys. \nNeil Hunn: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management.\nAlex Blanton: Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Alex, Good morning \nRob Crisci: Hey, Alex.\nNeil Hunn: I hope you\u2019re well.\nAlex Blanton: Typically, during recessions, dominant companies like Roper gained market share, a lot of market share, in some cases, from weaker competitors. And it seems to me that, that would be true right now in spades. Could you comment on where you would expect the greatest cash effective Roper. You're gaining share from companies that get in trouble during this period.\nNeil Hunn: I appreciate the question. No. It's a \u2013 we agree with your sentiment. History would suggest that's the case. When you have the operational readiness that we have, when you have the balance sheet that we have, when you have the cash flow that we have, sort of amount of those heartily needs allows us to very quickly pivot to play offense versus defense, and that's the posture that we're leaning, right? We also talked in our prepared remarks about our direct channel access. So we're talking across all of our businesses every day with our customers. Where the opportunities are, it's incrementally, and I don't \u2013 I mean, it's in all the businesses. I don't want to sort of call out one business there where there's a disproportionate opportunity, because it's a structural opportunity with our business model that we have across the 45 businesses. But we agree there is times to fulfill need right now when our competitors cannot fulfill a product that garners you sort of an opportunity to capture and keep that share of momentum building on that side of this thing. So we agree with the sentiment and we're alternatively leaning forward, but we've got to do that in a prudent way, given the current situation we all face.\nAlex Blanton: Right. Then you mentioned that you keep in very close touch with your customers, so you can identify these opportunities when they arise.\nNeil Hunn: That's correct.\nAlex Blanton: I have one more question on your \u2013 on the acquisition outlook. You mentioned that there's a delay implementing some of the sellers, plans to sell the businesses, which is understandable. But could you characterize the backlog? You said it was a very full backlog or pipeline of acquisition opportunities. Could you expand on that a bit?\nNeil Hunn: Sure. Sure.\nAlex Blanton: Because you've got a highly talented\u2026\nNeil Hunn: Correct. There's always a lot of activity that happens in our pipeline. I've been here since 2011. For the first six or seven years is my responsibility to manage the pipeline, in addition to my operating responsibilities. And so just speaking over the whole time I've been here, there's a lot of activity. What we're specifically commenting on earlier is there was very late-stage activity. Under exclusivity, most terms agreed to most diligence done a few deals that we just decided it was prudent to pause and take stock of the current situation. So there's a late-stage pipeline. Now the things right behind that, most \u2013 every other process, sales process that was in the market has pulled for obvious reasons. And so we're going to have to lean into our knowledge of the existing sponsor relationships and relationships that we have to see if we can build funnel on a proprietary basis for the next couple of quarters. And only time will tell if we're going to be able to successfully do that. And then from that point, private equity business models need to return capital to their Limiteds, and we expect that to continue once the new reality of the valuation regime, the leverage regime, all sort of land on us all.\nAlex Blanton: Okay. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy of Stephens.\nRobert McCarthy: Thanks for fitting me guys. How are you doing today?\nNeil Hunn: Great. Hope you are well?\nRobert McCarthy: Good. Yes, just expanding on kind of the private equity on the acquisition environment. Obviously, a situation where as Deane suggested, prices are coming down. But I mean, could you see a phenomenon here of \u2013 as private equity has a lot of businesses that are probably highly impacted more than what their risk characteristics would have suggested that you could provide the ATM on some decent deals where they could get an exit, so there could be a liquidity premium to getting something out, returning it to Limiteds and you could still pick off some decent businesses at some reasonable valuations? Do you think there's a path forward for that? And maybe just expand more broadly about your acquisition capacity in cancer?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So on the capacity side, it's going to \u2013 it's $2 billion to $3 billion right now very easily. We're going to be prudent in how we deploy that and always be very mindful of the current situation we're in. Relative to the first part of your question, I think it depends on the sponsor, right? If you talk to some of these very large, highly successful sponsors who have raised eight to 15 funds and returned three to 5x, might after their Limiteds are going to have a lot of patients with them as they work through this. So those assets and those portfolios, I think, waits a little longer. On the other hand, there's scores of more middle market sponsors that do not have that track record that probably exhibit the exact behavior that their outlying. And so only time will tell, but it's our job to identify those opportunities as they come up.\nRobert McCarthy: Thank you for that. And then I guess in terms of thinking about the longer-term opportunity with CBORD and also TransCore mean obviously, episodically, companies have been talking about changing the regime for not only payments but also access, particularly given the light of the pandemic. I mean, you're going to probably see a reconfiguration of security and access around motion as opposed to touch, just given the nature of sanitation and public hygiene, do you think that creates a bit of an opportunity for you in each of those businesses, or do you think it's a little bit too much of a nuance right now?\nNeil Hunn: I think it does over the medium term, right? So there's the Seaboard, it's the work we've done with Apple for contactless sort of entry and security. I think also the way that in the near term, at least, universities are going to want to follow where the students are, and so we might be able to be assistants \u2013 assist them in that. TransCore, we talked about the concept of handing cash and getting change back is likely going to end here at some point. And then also, RFID is a business we all talk a whole lot about. We talked about in the quarter -- I mean, in the quarter, they had a very strong quarter. They're all about contactless reading for identity access, for instance, in hospitals and health systems for secure print, right? So how do you actually go to a printer and get your materials off without having to touch it. So they enable those sorts of solutions from a product perspective.\nRobert McCarthy: Thanks for your time.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We would now like to turn the call back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thanks Zack and good morning everyone. First, and most importantly, we hope that everyone that is joining us this morning and your families are staying safe and our in good health. With that in mind, our first quarter was quite good, 4% organic revenue growth, expanding gross and EBITDA margins, and very strong cash flow coming in at 13% above last year. After a brief run through of Q1 results, I'll turn the call to Rob and he will discuss our P&L, our balance sheet, and our cash position. We find ourselves in a very fortunate position to have $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and a completely undrawn $2.5 billion revolver. Then, I'll turn to discuss our operational status and respond to the COVID-19 situation. To this end, all of our product businesses are deemed essential, and all our non-production workforce are being productive working remotely from home. As we turn to our segment discussion, the majority of our comments will focus on a detailed view of how our businesses and business models should perform through the current situation. The impacts we're seeing across our diverse set of businesses range from a pause and new license sales for some of our high recurring revenue software business to a positive spike in demand for Verizon's critical medical products to sharp declines in our Industrial and Process Technologies businesses.  Following this, we will break down our Q2 and full year organic revenue guidance. In the midst of this global economic shutdown, we are guiding our full year organic revenues be plus or minus flat. This is a remarkable testament to the durability of our business model. During the discussion of our guidance, we outlined to you the assumptions that would cause our earnings to be on the low or high end of our guidance range. I'll then turn to discuss our outlook for continued capital deployment and end with a summary of a few of the Roper companies that are on the frontlines responding to the COVID-19 virus. Finally, we'll turn to your questions. Now, let's turn to a brief run through our Q1 results. Next slide please. Q1 was quite good for us. Our businesses continue to work hard to execute strategy and town offenses. And Q1 is another good data point that what we're doing is taking hold. revenue grew 4% organically, with solid organic growth in three of our four segments. Gross margins and EBITDA margins expanded nicely and debt came in at $3.05, a $0.05 above our guidance range. And as we said for nearly 20 years, cash is the best performance measure with free cash flow being up 13% in the quarter to $353 million, which was 26% of revenue and 76% of EBITDA. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rob to discuss or detail financial performance. Thanks, Rob. It's worth underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and borrowing capacity. Also a great job by Rob and Shannon, and adjusting to a net debt covenant this further strengthens our capital appointment capacity and the ability to play offense at the appropriate time. Also, thanks to our lending group. Now let's turn to how we're responding operationally to COVID-19 sectors. We are blessed to have very few COVID-19 cases, each of which has recovered or is recovering. From an operational readiness perspective we are also fortunate. All of our businesses with manufacturing facilities have engage essential and remain operational delivering the vital products that our customers need during \u2013 at successfully transition to working from home. Our portfolio of niche businesses are characterized by having meaningfully reduced cyclical exposure, having high levels of recurring revenues, low asset intensity, low levels of fixed costs and high levels of operating cash flow. We operate this portfolio in a highly decentralized operating structure that enables rapid, nimble execution. Our locally driven, bottoms up approach to business planning performs exceptionally well in any environment and clearly. This is an unprecedented one. Given this, there have not been any top down mandates or mandatory targets, but rather a few guiding principles to consider and an incentive system that promotes investments and long-term organic growth. We did after businesses to assess the short and medium term impact to the demand drivers and take a sober view of each. Based on this, each business deploy appropriate cost countermeasures with emphasis on three items. First, each business work to manage their margins appropriately with always vigilant management of cash flow. Second, each business targeted mostly temporary cost, countermeasures. And third, each business continues to make no regrets investments in innovation and talent, all of which have a mind eye towards an offensive-oriented posture upon recovery. Also important and often under discussed is our direct channel access in the vast majority of our companies. Rarely does Roper have a business that relies on third parties or distributors for market access. Given this, we remain engaged with our customers in good times and bad. We learn, we adapt, most importantly, we stay connected. This typically enables market share capture in difficult times and accelerated benefits during the recovery cycle. And in all times, our leaders keep an intense focus on cash. Having worked through this process over the last several weeks, I'm incredibly proud of how our leaders have reacted and managed through the current situation. And I'd like to thank each and everyone for the work, hard decisions and difficult conversations you have had to endure. Thank you. As we turn to our first quarter segment results, I'll start with our application software segment. Briefly, a quick run-through of Q1, which was quite strong. Revenues were $405 million, up 5% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $156 million or 38.6% of revenue. The quarter was highlighted by continued strength at Deltek for consistent factors: strength in GovCon execution, nice wins at the enterprise level and certain professional service markets and continued cloud or SaaS adoption. However, based on the impact of C19 sheltering, Deltek did see a slowing in perpetual deal activity during the last couple of weeks in the quarter. Power plant was also strong in the quarter. The sales pipeline build that we discussed in prior quarters executed nicely. CBORD and Strata were strong. In CBORD's case, due to their integrated security and subscription-based software sold into higher-ed markets, and for Strata, much of the same, continued solid sales execution and adoption of their hospital-based cost accounting and financial planning solutions. As we turn to outlook considerations, we want to provide an overview of the business model drivers for the businesses in this segment. To start, about 10% of the revenues in this segment are derived from perpetual software licenses. Within this bucket of revenue, new sales are derived principally from three sources: new logos; add-on product sales to existing customers; and finally, seat or volume expansions. Given the current economic outlook, we expect the vast majority of new logo sales to meaningfully slow down for the balance of the year. However, we do expect some volume of add-on product bookings to continue. Typically, during economic slowdowns, some level of selling activity does occur within this bucket of license revenue. These types of projects are smaller dollar and sold and delivered remotely. The next bucket of revenues are tied to service delivery. Service revenues arise from two sources: new product implementations or existing product upgrades. The first bucket is tied directly to new license sales, either new logos or add-ons. The second bucket or services upgrade, run independent of new license activity. The services book of business runs off a six to 12-month backlog. To date, the vast majority of our service projects continue, albeit at a slower pace, given both our customers and our delivery teams are adjusting to working remotely. We expect this revenue stream to be minimally impacted during the course of the year. Finally, the remaining 70% of revenue is tied to recurring maintenance or SaaS-based revenues. Our companies in this segment, service end markets that are expected to perform relatively well versus a broader economy, government contractors, law firms, healthcare and education. Given we mostly serve larger enterprises and less affected end markets, we do expect retention rates to remain high. Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss some specific business impacts. Our application software businesses have proven to be extremely durable and consistent organic growers and will continue to do so once customer access and activities begin to come back online. However, in an environment where we essentially \u2013 where essentially all businesses on a global basis are closed, these businesses will be modestly impacted. As we look at Deltek specifically, we expect the government contractor market to continue to perform well. New lead generation and pipeline build have continued during the last few weeks. On the other hand, we do expect a slowdown in new logo bookings and their professional service markets as the companies they serve are in meaningfully impacted segments and tend to be SMB sized. PS revenue and retention should perform well across both GovCon and Professional Service markets. Turning to Aderant, PowerPlan and CBORD, we believe these businesses will be impacted in a similar fashion. We expect some net new logo bookings to slow for the next few quarters as these businesses tend to rely on face-to-face interactions to drive enterprise level new logo sales. These activities will likely be limited for the remainder of 2020. The smaller, add-on type product sales are expected to maintain at some level, albeit at a lower level of sales activity. All three of these businesses have done a fantastic job of shifting their implementation and service activities to be remotely delivered. Recurring revenue retention should perform well. As we look at our four businesses, we sell into the hospital setting, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience limited physical access to hospitals. Also, given the financial duress, most U.S. health systems are facing, we expect hospital capital spending to be meaningfully down in 2020. That said, labs are extremely busy improving their value to the world over right now. Our teams have been busy enabling all the new COVID-19 tests and will continue to do so. As a direct result to COVID-19, the Sunquest project in Queensland has been canceled. Strata should continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. We expect continued strong demand for Strata solution, which help hospitals identify and manage costs and help model and execute financial plans. Finally, we do anticipate a possible acceleration to the cloud on the back end of the current environment. As customers have had to implement their DR plans, they are likely returning with an increased appetite to offload and remote it management of their core systems. Time will tell. Next slide, please. Turning to our network segment. Q1 revenues grew 9% organically to $441 million. EBITDA was $185 million or 42% of revenue, a solid quarter, indeed. TransCore's work for the congestion pricing infrastructure project continued in the quarter as it has been deemed essential work by the state of New York. Network software was strong and highlighted by iTrade and DAT. iTrade grew high single digits on the back of strong renewal and cross-sell activity. DAT continued to expand our network and successfully completed the market launch of rate forecasting and book-it-now capabilities. Finally, RF Ideas did very well due to their identity management solutions. For this segment, approximately 60% of the revenues are driven by our network software businesses, 85% of which are recurring. These businesses have very strong network effects and generally serve less impacted end markets such as healthcare, life insurance, logistics, food and media and entertainment. Given the core software functionality value and strong network benefits, we expect retention rates to hold up well across these businesses. Relative to TransCore, as mentioned, the New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project continues and is deemed essential. Over the course of the last couple of weeks, New York State and the MTA budget moved the congestion pricing toll revenue into the operating budget versus the MTA capital budget. Our view is that this modestly increases the urgency of this project. All this being said, we have pushed the project to the right a bit, moving approximately $25 million into early 2021. For the balance of TransCore, project activity continues and will continue, but we do expect some projects to be pushed into 2021. Over a longer arc of time, the business case for all electronic tolling may accelerate as a result of the current health pandemic. Essentially, human to human contact paying a toll may be greatly reduced, if not eliminated. TransCore will be ready to execute if this demand driver accelerates. Next slide, please. Turning to some company-specific impacts for the software businesses in our network segment. First, our DAT and ConstructConnect. Both of these businesses have subscription-based revenue models. Both have some exposure to small and medium sized businesses, but also work directly with large enterprises. Both businesses have network benefits that typically exhibit countercyclical behavior. For example, and specific to ConstructConnect, the core product is a lead \u2013 is a project lead identification source. As more contractors look for fewer projects, they tend to enter our network to source and bid for new project business. In the first three weeks in April, it's encouraging to see the ConstructConnect network expands modestly. For DAT, the brokers stay connected to the network and take advantage of lower spot rates versus contracted rates and carriers stay connected to find load volumes. iTrade is quite busy connecting food retailers . With an increasing number of grower shippers, we expect minimal disruption here. iPipeline has been super active helping their life insurance customers adapt their products and their underwriting processes in this environment. The outlook remains stable here as well. Relative to foundry, content creation continues. There is a large pipeline of post-production work that is currently being processed as well as continued new animation content creation. As a potential early read for western production, Chinese live-action has restarted on a limited basis. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses will perform relatively well but are not spared from some level of impact. Both SHP and SoftWriters customers are being impacted by the lack of hospital-based procedures and the associated outpatient recoveries. For instance, new starts of care for home health are down 30% to 35% versus a year ago. We expect these customers to likely pause buying new products until their patient volumes return. Retention, however, should remain high as our products are needed for cooperation's. And finally, MHA's revenues are tied to pharmaceutical utilization across long-term care settings. Starting now and likely for several quarters into the future, new admissions into long-term care settings will likely slow. However, this should only modestly impact the growth rate of MHA. Next slide, please. Turning to our Measurement & Analytical Segment. Q1 revenues grew 3% organically to $365 million. EBITDA was $123 million or 33.6% of revenue. The quarter was highlighted by strong growth at Verathon amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Unrelated to C-19, Verathon saw continued traction in their new single-use bronchoscope products. Additionally, Northern Digital and Neptune continued their solid string of growth. Also, we did experience declines, as expected, in our short-cycle industrial businesses with some further weakening in the quarter due to COVID-19. Turning to the outlook. This segment can be analyzed across four areas: Verathon, other medical products, Neptune and industrial. At Verathon, we are experiencing truly unprecedented demand for their GlideScopeAmid products. Intubation procedures have skyrocketed due to COVID-19. Verathon's video intubation products enable the caregiver to intubate a patient with appropriate spatial distance from the patient, making the intubation procedure meaningfully less risky for the caregiver. The demand for these products is global and has been sustained since the middle of March. Our other medical product businesses, which grow organically MSD like Clockwork in virtually all environments, are likely negatively impacted based on the global nature of historically lower hospital-based volumes and the associated economic impact. Hospitals have never been forced to defer all non-emergency cases. Neptune is a very stable growth business due to the consistent required meter upgrade and replacements. Given the shelter in-place requirements, limited access to indoor meters and municipality budget uncertainties, some level of sales activity will likely push to the right with the most acute impact being in the second quarter. Finally, our industrial businesses are negatively impacted and generally tied to industrial output. Our industrial products are critical to industrial production processes. There are some pockets of strength, Danisco, Party [ph] and Hansen, but for this group, our revenues for these businesses will be tied to the pacing of plant reopenings. And as a green shoot, we are seeing strong activity across Chinese end markets as our markets come back online. Next slide, please. Turning to our Process Technologies segment. Revenues were $142 million in the quarter, down 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $46 million or 32.4% margins. This was a difficult quarter for these businesses, and we expect the outlook to remain extremely poor for the balance of 2020. We saw our upstream businesses decline in the high teens in the quarter. Also, CCC was weak based on the inability to perform field service work all related to C19. One bright spot in the quarter was Zetec, up mid-single digits based on growth from their new non-disruptive testing products. The outlook for the balance of the year is going to be an extremely challenging one. About 60% of the segment's revenue and about 6% of Roper's revenue is related to oil and gas. We will be hit the hardest, down approximately 50% in the second quarter in our upstream business. For the year, upstream revenues will be less than $100 million or roughly 2% of Roper. We do not expect the recovery at all in 2020. Our mid and downstream businesses are also meaningfully negatively impacted, but less so than our upstream businesses. Peso recovery here will be gated by CCC's ability to get into the field and perform field service work and the recovery of fuel refining for PAC. Next slide, please. As we turn to our guidance, we are initiating DEPS guidance for 2Q in the range of $2.50 to $2.70 and updating our full year DEPS guidance to be between $11.60 and $12.60 per share. Embedded in this guidance model is an increased full year tax rate of 23%. We built this model, as we always do, on a business by business, bottoms-up analysis. We have summarized the organic outlook for each segment for the second quarter and the full year with the underlying material assumptions. For application software, we see second quarter revenue down MSD, with full year revenue plus or minus low single digits. Where we settle for the full year is dependent upon the volume and timing of add-on perpetual deals, the pacing of services work and sustaining high recurring revenue retention rates. For network systems, we've seen second quarter organic revenues up low single digits and full year up mid-single digits to possibly low double digits. The largest variable is the pacing of the New York congestion pricing project. For MAS, we see this segment down mid-single digits in the second quarter and flat to up mid-single digit for the year. Principal factors for this segment are the sustained nature of Verathon's demand spike, the timing of medical procedures coming back online, the nature of water municipality budgets and the ramp of global industrial production. Finally, our process segment will be materially and negatively impacted. We expect 2Q revenues to be down at least 30% and full year down in the 20% to 25% range. Again, we do not expect recovery this year. When you roll all this together, we expect our consolidated organic revenues to be down mid-single digits for the second quarter. And for the full year, organic revenues are expected to be plus or minus low single digits. Again, this is a remarkable testament to the durability of our businesses and business model. Our teams did a good job responding to the demand shock and placing cost countermeasures in place, the vast majority of which being temporary. This enabled us to remain \u2013 this enables us to maintain high margins as we work through the demand shock retain virtually all no regrets investments and innovation and talent while preserving the operational flexibility to rebound quickly. Now let's turn to our summary. We had a very solid Q1, really proud of the team here for these results. As we quickly pivot towards operating in a C19 world, our enterprise remains fully operational, and working from home is proving to be highly effective. So effective that we'll likely remain in this posture for quite some time. Our balance sheet is stronger than at any point in history, with $1 billion in cash and $2.5 billion of revolver capacity. For the full year, we expect to have plus or minus flat organic revenue growth. We believe our portfolio of businesses and our governance processes are well suited to navigate this extremely difficult time. We will do so in a way that prudently balances short financial performance and cost countermeasures with that of long-term investments in innovation and talent. Our teams are keenly focused on market share gains, both now and upon recovery. As we execute our strategy that focuses on long-term cash flow compounding, we will continue to patiently evaluate and pursue capital deployment opportunities. Our process is rigorous and disciplined. We do expect many attractive capital deployment opportunities to arise from the current economic situation. As our balance sheet is very well positioned, we will offensively deploy capital as the right opportunities are identified. Final slide, please. As we prepare for your questions, I wanted to highlight a few examples of how Roper businesses are aiding in the fight against COVID-19. Our lab businesses enabled a new C-19 test to interface with lab information systems and provide results to doctors and patients. iTrade is connecting new food trading relationships as food buying shifted almost entirely to grocers. Strata is using their AI tools to help hospitals have financial clarity in these uncertain times. And Verathon, as discussed, is truly on the front lines. I'm extraordinarily proud to be able to lead this organization. Now let's turn to your questions. Good morning, Dean. Sure. Appreciate the question. In any environment, it's hard to predict the timing of capital deployment because, as you know, it's lumpy. But a few comments. First, leading into the shutdown, leading into the middle of March, we were extraordinarily active and pause several things and believe at the right time, we can unpause those things. Only time will tell there. But we stay in constant contact with the owners of those assets, the leadership team for those assets. And these were very late-stage sort of situations. On the \u2013 but once we work through that, sort of, late-stage part of the pipeline, there continues to be some level of discussions between sponsors and ourselves. We've spent years developing relationships. We know the portfolio as well. And this is the time where those relationships matter the most, because it's unlikely that here in the next couple, three, four, five months, how long it is, that there's going to be broad-based sell-side processes. But sponsors still have requirement to get liquidity back to their shareholders. And if there's one-off trades that make sense for both sides, we think those could happen. And then finally, they're more likely than not, we saw it in the last downturn in 2007, 2008, 2009 time frame as we studied that. I wouldn't call them just \u2013 they're just \u2013 there are likely be some companies that are distressed from a capital structure point of view, not from an operating point of view, which gives them -- sort of, they put them in a pinch to where we're able to acquire nice assets, operating assets and meet all of our criteria, but they just have made some poor decisions or have some bad timing on their capital structure. So there's really -- it's the nature of where we sort of target might change modestly, because you're right, it does take typically a couple of quarters, plus or minus, for private valuations to reset to where public ones are. Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, Steve. Yeah. I'll start, and then I'll ask Rob to add any color. So obviously, the \u2013 this demand shop for every company came fast and deep, right? So we started feeling it across a few of our companies at the end of the quarter. And then obviously, it's sustained here through the first part of April. So a couple of comments. So first, when this happened, just from a planning perspective, we first \u2013 we didn't try to overreact or react too quickly. We first had to get everybody home, which took a week or two. We then took a week to 10 days to let our leaders really onboard and accept the reality of the demand shock. And then we started our planning process, which was really the first week or so in April. So sometimes takes by. And so by the time you do the planning process in the second quarter and then start putting in the cost countermeasures, it was really just starting to layer in now against what we believe is going to be the steepest demand shock. And so when you put those two together, you just naturally get sort of the worst leverage, if you will, in 2Q and things stabilized from that point in time. And then the final thing, Steve, so I should have mentioned at the onset is we're not adding back any of the restructuring costs. So that is a little bit of a headwind in the quarter as well. It's sub-$10 million. So Steve, everything's certainly pushing to the right. We've not assumed that there's a \u2013 it's a 2Q push that comes back in 3Q. It's just everything sliding to the right. And to the extent what you describe happens, then that would lead us to be more on the higher side of our guidance than the lower side. On the new logo sales, the new customers that are buying relatively high dollar transformational type IT projects, those are going to be pushed to the right for the balance of the year for the most part, right? Who's going to make a big IT investment right now, setting aside how our salespeople actually get to that customer and sell. But the smaller ticket items, the upgrades and the add-on products, that level of activity has actually been quite nice. At Deltek, for instance, the top of the funnel here in the last three or four weeks, like this is the inquiries are up 30% to 35% versus a year ago. Now some of that is everybody's sitting at home doing Google searches, right? So the quality of that top of the funnel may not be as high. But what's been accepted as sales acceptance leads at Deltek has actually paced even a little bit ahead of last year. So the exact nature of how this thing is going to unfold because it's more of a shock than a cycle is yet to be seen. Yeah. So certainly, the number of new admissions to the skilled nursing, or SNF, sort of, care setting is likely going to be paused for quite some time, right? We're not putting in the elderly population in that care setting. So that \u2013 because the census, if you will, in SNFs, is going to be impacted by that. That will have some, but it'd be a modest and slow building impact, negative impact to the growth rate for MHA. What still happens, we're not seeing any meaningful discharges, right? The people that are in this setting for a long ark of time, they're not being pulled out because of what's going on. And this is just one of many growth drivers at MHA, right? You still have pricing that goes up. You still have pharmaceutical consumption per capita that goes up. You still have the team building to put new products online. There still are new pharmacies that will start that we'll capture. So there's a handful of sort of consistent growth drivers. But certainly, census levels will moderate some in the skilled nursing facility, which will impact the growth rate of modestly of MHA. Well, certainly, we expect the bucket of revenue of perpetual license revenue, the historical 10% number, that will be down. It will be impacted for the reasons that we talked about. The recurring won't be impacted in any meaningful way and the services backlog will work through the back -- the services teams to work through the backlog, as we've said. So I don't know if you have... Thank you. Good morning. Yes. The hardware is being deployed. The project is on track. It's on pace other than just pushing this $25 million in our planning assumptions into the Q1 of next year. What you may have read and what others have read is there \u2013 I think there is a distinct separation between the work that we're doing with our customer to put the infrastructure in, which is pacing for the reasons we said. It's now the revenue from this or the operating budget, not the capital budget because the MTA, obviously, revenues are way down, given what's going on. And then what happened \u2013 governmental process to enable and structure the tolling itself. That's going to happen at a very \u2013 in part of next year, but the infrastructure work continues, and that's our planning assumption. All the signals and all the discussions, as you can imagine, we stay very, very close with this customer, and we're in the same posture on that together with a customer. Yes, it could. If we ultimately don't go in, then the maintenance part would not turn on would be our planning assumption there. But I think there's a pretty high level of interest by all parties to see this project turn on. So well, there's a couple of different questions embedded there. So first \u2013 but first of all, you have to go company by company. So really, all we're talking about in our comments where we see a meaningful headwind on the license activities at our application software business. We went company-by-company on the network side. The recurring nature, they'll be impacted, but doesn't have the license activity because they're all SaaS businesses there. So when you look at application software, it's really the combination of those companies there that are going to likely not have large new customer perpetual deals happen in this environment. The smaller products, the add-on projects, the upgrade projects, the increased functionality, the how do you turn on, do some SaaS conversions, right, during this process, during the current economic environment, the activity in the sales funnel suggests that's going to continue, but currently five or six weeks end of situation, we have to see how that continues. So that's on the license side. On the services side, the services work results from selling licenses. So there'll still be some of that. And then there's a fair amount of upgrades that happened. And actually, when times like this are actually a pretty decent time to upgrade systems, because you have maybe less people in the office and less user activity, so the IT staff to do what they need to do to get to a new version. Now we have to see if it actually plays out. But even if it doesn't, even if that has slowed, the services teams work off a six to 12-month services backlog of implementation, they basically have six to 12 months to replenish the backlog from new sales activities. Well, again, you've got to parse it out, right? It's very low large new logos assumed in the planning horizon. There is going to be some new licensing for the product add-ons. That's exactly right. Yeah. Thank you. Alex, Good morning I hope you're well. I appreciate the question. No. It's a \u2013 we agree with your sentiment. History would suggest that's the case. When you have the operational readiness that we have, when you have the balance sheet that we have, when you have the cash flow that we have, sort of amount of those heartily needs allows us to very quickly pivot to play offense versus defense, and that's the posture that we're leaning, right? We also talked in our prepared remarks about our direct channel access. So we're talking across all of our businesses every day with our customers. Where the opportunities are, it's incrementally, and I don't \u2013 I mean, it's in all the businesses. I don't want to sort of call out one business there where there's a disproportionate opportunity, because it's a structural opportunity with our business model that we have across the 45 businesses. But we agree there is times to fulfill need right now when our competitors cannot fulfill a product that garners you sort of an opportunity to capture and keep that share of momentum building on that side of this thing. So we agree with the sentiment and we're alternatively leaning forward, but we've got to do that in a prudent way, given the current situation we all face. That's correct. Sure. Sure. Correct. There's always a lot of activity that happens in our pipeline. I've been here since 2011. For the first six or seven years is my responsibility to manage the pipeline, in addition to my operating responsibilities. And so just speaking over the whole time I've been here, there's a lot of activity. What we're specifically commenting on earlier is there was very late-stage activity. Under exclusivity, most terms agreed to most diligence done a few deals that we just decided it was prudent to pause and take stock of the current situation. So there's a late-stage pipeline. Now the things right behind that, most \u2013 every other process, sales process that was in the market has pulled for obvious reasons. And so we're going to have to lean into our knowledge of the existing sponsor relationships and relationships that we have to see if we can build funnel on a proprietary basis for the next couple of quarters. And only time will tell if we're going to be able to successfully do that. And then from that point, private equity business models need to return capital to their Limiteds, and we expect that to continue once the new reality of the valuation regime, the leverage regime, all sort of land on us all. Thank you. Great. Hope you are well? Yes. So on the capacity side, it's going to \u2013 it's $2 billion to $3 billion right now very easily. We're going to be prudent in how we deploy that and always be very mindful of the current situation we're in. Relative to the first part of your question, I think it depends on the sponsor, right? If you talk to some of these very large, highly successful sponsors who have raised eight to 15 funds and returned three to 5x, might after their Limiteds are going to have a lot of patients with them as they work through this. So those assets and those portfolios, I think, waits a little longer. On the other hand, there's scores of more middle market sponsors that do not have that track record that probably exhibit the exact behavior that their outlying. And so only time will tell, but it's our job to identify those opportunities as they come up. I think it does over the medium term, right? So there's the Seaboard, it's the work we've done with Apple for contactless sort of entry and security. I think also the way that in the near term, at least, universities are going to want to follow where the students are, and so we might be able to be assistants \u2013 assist them in that. TransCore, we talked about the concept of handing cash and getting change back is likely going to end here at some point. And then also, RFID is a business we all talk a whole lot about. We talked about in the quarter -- I mean, in the quarter, they had a very strong quarter. They're all about contactless reading for identity access, for instance, in hospitals and health systems for secure print, right? So how do you actually go to a printer and get your materials off without having to touch it. So they enable those sorts of solutions from a product perspective. Thank you."

            "name": "Rob Crisci",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. It's really great to have the opportunity to connect with all of you today. Turning to page six, Q1 income statement metrics. As Neil mentioned, organic growth was a very solid 4%, which was better than we had expected coming into the quarter. We did have positive organic growth in three of the four segment, led by Network Software & Systems at plus 9% and Application Software at plus 5%. Once again, really strong margin execution by our business leaders in the quarter, driving strong operating leverage while continuing to invest for future growth, gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 63.5%. EBITDA margin also expanded 50 basis points to a record 34.5%, driving very solid 7% EBITDA growth for the quarter. Earnings before taxes increased 7% to $408 million. As a reminder, last year, we had a $43 million discrete tax item in Q1, resulting in a $0.41 benefit, which drove our tax rate last year below 10%. This year our Q1 tax rate was a more normal 21%, which resulted in debt of $3.05, which was well above our guidance range, as Neil mentioned. So in summary, a really strong operational quarter for Roper and really great execution by our business leaders. Next slide. Turning to cash flow, Q1 operating cash flow 364 million was a 10% increase versus prior year, Q1 free cash flows was $353 million, a 13% increase versus prior year. So, looking over the past few years, our Q1 free cash flows compound at a very strong 14%. As Roper -- at Roper, as Neil said, and as you've all said, as you know, hundreds of times over the past few decades, we really do believe cash is the best measure performance and those are really another great cash flow. We've consistently compared our EBITDA to free cash flow at a rate well above 70% over the past several years, as you can see 76% conversion in Q1 and we certainly expect to have strong cash conversion to continue moving forward. Next slide. So turn to page eight. The asset light business model, once again we exited the quarter with negative net working capital, negative 4.4%. That was aided by consistently strong working capital management across the enterprise and increasing deferred revenue across our portfolio of niche market leading software businesses. Brokers focus on cash flow and working capital will be especially important as we work our way through the pandemic. While we certainly could see some negative short term impact from delayed payments in some affected end markets such as acute healthcare, we are well positioned overall given the durable and markets we serve. Our large deferred revenue balance gives us a very high recurring revenue base, limiting earnings volatility. On a cash basis, spread across the independent businesses and rather evenly throughout the calendar year, limiting any impact of attrition on our cash conversion. So in closing, we expect our working capital to remain negative and our strong cash conversion to continue in 2020 and beyond. Next slide. So turning to the balance sheet and the strong financial position, this is always a very important slide, but even more critical in today's economic environment, dealing with really the unprecedented shock to global economic activity around the pandemic. We will first look at the numbers here and then I'll spend a little time on the following slide to talk more about our outlook, and the steps we've taken at Roper to prepare ourselves to continue to execute on our discipline capital deployment strategy. In short, Ropers liquidity position and balance sheet are very strong. We currently have over $1 billion of cash on hand and our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility remains fully undrawn As a reminder, we divested our Gatan -- we do have approximately $200 million of cash taxes yet to be paid on the Gatan divestiture and that payment is now not due until July with a postponement of tax day. So in summary at the end of the quarter, gross debt set at $5.3 billion against nearly $2 billion of trailing EBITDA for a gross debt to EBIT a ratio of 2.7 times. However, taking into account our unusually large cash balance, net debt was only $4.3 billion. Next slide. So turning to page 10, I wanted to take a moment really during the unprecedented time and review we think -- what we think are the many benefits of brokerage in the business model. The diversification we have across 45 independent, high margin asset light businesses operating across many different niches resulted in excellent credit profile. We are not dependent on specific end markets and almost nothing is centralized, limiting the overall financial impact of any facility closures or industry, specific economic shocks. So aided by our business model and diversification, we are confident that Roper Enterprise will continue to generate high levels of cash flow in nearly all conceivable macroeconomic scenarios. As mentioned earlier, we have over \u2013 balance sheet, which as you all know, is a very unusual \u2013 unusually high number for over I think longtime shareholders realize how unusual this is. Typically we hold a limited amount of cash and drawn a revolver to fund acquisitions. This is however fortunate timing given the pandemic and something we want to take advantage of with an eye toward future cash flow compounding. So over the last couple of weeks, we initiated and completed an amendment process with 100% support from our bank group to modify our gross debt to EBITDA covenant to receive credit for this cash. It was fascinating [indiscernible] with the banks. We are one of the only companies that kind of demanded process as a purely offensive move. This process really was an eye opener to just how unique our company is. My thanks to Shannon and also our high quality Bank Group for all the work to complete this amendment quickly and successfully. So under the new calculation, our net debt to EBITDA ratio currently fits at 2.1 times, which is about a half a turn lower than old calculation compared to the continent of 3.5. So in summary, we've remained very well \u2013 of our large pipeline of high quality [indiscernible] opportunities. So with that, I'll turn it back over, Neil. Yeah. Good morning, Deane. Appreciate the question. It's always difficult to predict working capital, right? It's one of the toughest things to predict. We certainly know that there are some end markets, particularly acute care, healthcare, where if you call the news, there's going to be some challenges there where hospitals are slowing some payments, et cetera. So difficult to predict each quarter. I will say that our customers overall were in very durable end markets. And so, we expect really no credit risk across all of our customers. So it's a matter of timing of payments. And when you have the huge deferred revenue balance, when you have management teams, they're really close to their customers. We feel really confident that the working capital position will remain very strong and negative throughout the year. Good morning, Steve. Yes. And I'll just add to that. We talked a lot about the perpetual license timing. And so when you're in the second quarter period where the economy is basically shut down for at least the first month of the quarter. So we're not assuming much, if any, license revenue. As you know, that comes at a really high margin. We do have the TransCore project continuing, which is lower margin. So you're really also looking at some mix impacts, adding on to what Neil said. Yeah, sure. This is Rob. The way deferred revenue works for our software businesses is, it's just the passage of time that needs to happen in order for the revenue to be recognized. And so, as I mentioned on the call, it is \u2013 when you have a renewal, then \u2013 and then that's the point at which you hope the customer renews or they don't. And generally, they do at very high 90% renewal rates. And those renewals are time throughout the year. So as long as you maintain your recurring revenue, it's very, very steady. The deferred revenue continues to grow as the software businesses grow. A reminder, we're selling this software. It's really critical software systems across durable markets, like government contractors, mostly large enterprises to the customers. And so it's very, very steady. It gives you high levels of recurring revenue and high levels of cash flow. So we don't see any meaningful impact from that certainly in the short term. Yeah. And then, just, as you go through the guidance, keep in mind, we did increase the tax rate. So that's a big difference from prior guidance and if you're looking at last year versus this year. So the tax rate is a little bit higher. And then we are assuming relatively high deleveraging and process technologies, given all the declines there and that we're not assuming any sort of a rebound. And as Neil mentioned, we're taking specific cost actions as well that are flowing through. So those are all key drivers in the roll up. Hey, Joe. Hey, Alex."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O\u2019Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today\u2019s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today\u2019s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you will please turn to Page 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today\u2019s call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Unless otherwise noted, we will discuss our results and guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense, a Sunquest trade name and technology asset impairment related to the merger with CliniSys; and lastly, income tax restructuring associated with our pending divestiture of TransCore. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now, if you please turn to Page 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Zach and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let\u2019s turn to Page 4 and review today\u2019s agenda. As usual, we will start with our quarterly and full year highlights. We will then provide details regarding our segment performance, followed by sharing our first quarter and full year 2022 guidance. At the end, we will leave plenty of time to address all your questions. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today\u2019s call are: first, our strong finish to \u201821; second, that we are setup very well for solid 2022 organic performance; and third, we have substantial M&A capacity given our rapid deleveraging last year. As it relates to the fourth quarter and closed the 2021, financial performance was excellent with double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. Additionally, because of our strong cash performance last year, our balance sheet is in a great spot as we exceeded our deleveraging plans for the year. As we look towards our 2022 outlook, we have considerable tailwinds that help setup for a very strong year. Underpinning this outlook is our software recurring revenue growth momentum. Given strong market demand, continued innovation in new products and increased shift towards our SaaS solutions, we exit 2021 with robust ARR growth that carries momentum into \u201822. In addition, our product businesses are experiencing strong demand and record levels of backlog, which provide these businesses with an unprecedented level of in-hand orders and revenue visibility heading into the year. Factoring all this together, we expect 6% to 8% organic revenue growth in 2022. In addition to this organic outlook, our balance sheet is well-positioned to allow us to be more meaningfully offensive with M&A in 2022. So, the table is set for us to have great 2022 and continue our long-term track record of double-digit cash flow compounding. Now, let me turn things over to our CFO, Rob Crisci, to walk through our financial summary. Rob?\nRob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone and thanks again for joining us. Turning to Page 6, looking at our Q4 income statement performance, as Zack stated earlier, all the financials here are reported on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Both organic revenue and total revenue for the quarter increased 13% to a total of $1.51 billion. EBITDA grew 12% to $576 million. EBITDA margin was down 10 basis points versus prior year at 38.1%. That all resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.73, which was above our guidance range. Free cash flow grew 4% in the quarter on top of last year\u2019s 23% fourth quarter growth. Cash conversion was once again very strong at 35% of revenue and 92% of EBITDA. Q4 was a nice finish to a very strong year and positions us well for a great 2022. Next slide. Turning to Page 7, reviewing the Q4 results by segment, Neil will discuss the full year segment performance in more detail a little later, but we wanted to just highlight the Q4 results by segment here. All four segments grew double-digit organically as our businesses executed very well and continued to win within their niche markets. Application Software segment grew 10% organically with broad-based strength throughout the segment. EBITDA margin increased to 43.8%. For Network Software, excellent 14% organic growth with EBITDA margin increasing to 52.3%. For Measurement & Analytical Solutions, 15% organic growth was broad-based with double-digit growth at Neptune, medical products and our industrial businesses. EBITDA margin was 31.3% as our businesses continue to navigate supply chain challenges. Lastly, for Process Technologies, a nice rebound from last year\u2019s decline, with 17% organic revenue growth and EBITDA margins of 31.2%. Next slide. Turning to Page 8, which is a summary of our full year 2021 financial highlights. For full year 2021, organic revenue growth was 9%. We benefited from both our strong organic growth and meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions to achieve 19% total revenue growth. EBITDA grew 22% for the year to exceed $2.2 billion. EBITDA margin increased 90 basis points to 38.2%. Full year DEPS increased 23% to $14.18, which was above the high-end of our guidance range. Free cash flow performance was outstanding for the year with 19% growth to $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow represented 31% of revenue and 82% of EBITDA. Excellent cash conversion, which is of course a key component of Roper\u2019s business model and value creation flywheel. We are well-positioned to continue our double-digit cash flow compounding moving forward. Next slide. Turning to Page 9, which is the latest installment in our successful deleveraging story. Including our discontinued operations, total operating cash flow for 2021 exceeded $2 billion. After CapEx and servicing of our dividend, nearly all of our excess free cash flow went to debt reduction. In total, we were able to reduce our net debt by $1.7 billion in 2021, which exceeded the deleveraging outlook we shared with you last January by about $200 million. We ended the year with net debt to EBITDA of 3.1x. Subsequent to year end, we closed the previously announced $350 million Zetec divestiture, which has further reduced our leverage. The closing of the TransCore divestiture expected for later this quarter will bring in over $2.1 billion of additional after-tax proceeds. We are pleased with our performance here as we once again demonstrated our ability to quickly delever after large acquisitions, reinforcing our commitment to our solid investment grade ratings. So with that, I will turn it back over to Neil for the remainder of our prepared remarks. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Let\u2019s turn to Page 11 and walk through the 2021 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $2.38 billion, up 8% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 44.2%. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for this segment increase 8% for the year. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, cross-selling activity and new customer adds. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was broad-based. To highlight a few companies, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the U.S. federal, contractor, architect, engineering and other services end markets, had another great year. Deltek had nice gains in both our government contracting and private sector end markets, gaining share at each and driving considerable SaaS adoption. Deltek continues to benefit by having favorable secular tailwinds. Turning to Vertafore a great year, exceeding the EBITDA expectations that we outlined at the time of the acquisition in 2020, Vertafore had impressive demand from their enterprise customers as they continue to partner with P&C agencies to tech-enable their customer acquisition, quoting and underwriting workflows. Notably, Vertafore had record quarterly bookings in Q4, which only adds to their ARR momentum. Amy, to you and your team, congrats to a phenomenal start as part of the Roper family. During the fourth quarter, we combined CliniSys and Sunquest to create the largest global lab diagnostics and informatics business. Together, the businesses will begin integrating their go-forward product roadmaps and innovation efforts and operate under the CliniSys brands. Also of note, both CliniSys and data innovation set records by a wide margin for bookings activity in 2021. Finally, as it relates to this group, we recently completed the acquisition of Horizon Lab Systems, which adds public health, water and environmental laboratory cloud-based software to the global CliniSys product portfolio. Aderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, taking share in \u201821 from our primary large law competitor. Also, starting in 2020 and gaining momentum last year, Aderant is seeing a meaningful shift towards our cloud offering, helping drive substantial increases in their recurring revenue stream. Finally, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition, American LegalNet, which will extend and enhance Aderant\u2019s court docketing software solution. Finally, Strata\u2019s combination with EPSI has worked out wonderfully well. Today, Strata partners with about half of the U.S. acute care hospitals to help them manage forecast and plan their operating and capital expenses and continues to extend both market share and product cross-selling. Looking to the outlook for 2022 in this segment, we expect mid single-digit growth that is driven by our ARR or recurring revenue momentum, making for a solid year for this segment. And with that, let\u2019s turn to our next slide. Turning to Page 12, as a reminder, the financial performance for this segment, as well as in X2, MAS and PT are shown on a continuing ops basis. 2021 revenues in our Network segment were $1.34 billion, up 11% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins clocked in at 51.1% for the year. The exceptional organic growth performance in this segment was underpinned by very strong growth in recurring revenue, which is roughly 80% of the segment\u2019s revenue. The growth in margin performance in this segment was broad-based and well distributed. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight match businesses were just amazing throughout 2021. Market conditions were very favorable, which led to record levels of network adds especially on the carrier side. More so, the leadership team at DAT did a terrific job scaling infrastructure to meet the market\u2019s demands, while maintaining aggressive new product innovation efforts, which led to higher ARPU as well. Over the longer arc of time, our freight match businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the digitization of the spot freight markets. Also, all of our other businesses in this segment saw increasing levels of ARR growth throughout the year, which helped setup for a strong 2022. To highlight a few, Foundry did a terrific job of continuing to extend their product advantage by using AI ML to automate tasks within the media and entertainment postproduction workflows. In addition, Foundry has benefited by the continued increases in content creation budget for streaming, animation and theatrical releases. iTrade, our network food supply chain business, rebounded very nicely in 2021 following the 2020 COVID shutdowns. In addition to benefiting by foodservice reopening, iTrade was able to meaningfully expand their food supply chain network in 2021. iPipeline continues to benefit from the tech enabling of the life insurance distribution model and our long-term care GPO, pharmacy software and home health analytics businesses continue to benefit from the post-COVID recovery and the longer term demographic aging of America. Finally, both RFID and Inovonics had good years, improving in the second half, especially within their healthcare applications. Turning to the full year outlook, we expect to see high single-digit organic growth for this segment, driven by a combination of strong recurring revenue momentum and favorable market tailwinds. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 13, revenues in our MAS segment were $1.56 billion, up 8% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 33.1% for the year. Again, these results are on a continuing ops basis. Before getting into business specific details, across this segment, demand continues to be very strong. As previously mentioned, product backlogs ended the year at record levels. Also, each of these businesses, are navigating the current supply chain environment. Strong demand at Neptune continued throughout the year, picking up in the back half as Neptune\u2019s end markets continue to fully reopen. Also, the Neptune team continues to do a great job, innovating their core product offering both in terms of the metering and the meter reading technologies. These innovative product advances helped set Neptune up for many great years. Verathon was very good last year. Remember, they had a great 2020, which was aided by COVID-related demand, but Verathon\u2019s 2021 was meaningfully higher than 2019, roughly 40% larger. Over the last 2 years, this team has innovated like crazy, going from zero to number two in the U.S. single use bronchoscope market, launching several new Video Laryngoscope products and developing a new ultrasound core platform. Perhaps more importantly, in 2021, Verathon\u2019s largest product offering is now a mission-critical consumable medical product. Our other medical product businesses, especially NDI and CIVCO, recovered nicely in 2021 as healthcare spending started to normalize. These businesses entered 2022 with record levels of order backlog. Demand across our industrial businesses rebounded with better end market and capital spending conditions, but somewhat hampered by supply chain challenges. As it relates to the 2022 guidance, we expect to see high single-digit growth for this segment, underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain environment. Net-net, we expect a very strong year for this group. Now, let\u2019s turn to our final segment, Process Tech. As we turn to Page 14, revenues at our Process Tech segment were $499 million in 2021, up 8% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 32.2% for the year. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The story here is we saw improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment and very strong demand in the second half. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell\u2019s product innovation as they\u2019re seeing very nice demand tick up for their IoT connected pumping solutions and the share gains they\u2019re enjoying as a result of their niche focused go-to-market teams. Similar to that of our MAS businesses, these businesses are being impacted by supply chain challenges, but continue to navigate well through the issues. Across this group, the business has exited 2021 with record levels of order backlog. As we turn to the outlook for 2022, we expect mid-teens organic growth based on strong levels of backlog and solid market conditions. Now please turn to Page 16 as we\u2019ll walk through our 2022 guidance. For 2022, we\u2019re establishing adjusted DEPS guidance on a continuing ops basis of $15.25 to $15.55 Underpinning this DEPS guidance is organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% and a tax rate of 21% to 22%. As we said throughout the call, we feel quite bullish about our 2022 based on our 2021 recurring revenue growth and the momentum it carries into this year with strong product demand and the record levels of order backlog. As you look to the first quarter, we\u2019re establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.63 and $3.67, again, on a continuing ops basis. Now some concluding comments, and we\u2019ll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 17 and our closing remarks, we want to leave you with the same three points we started with: We had a strong \u201821; we are set up very well for a solid 2022 organic performance; and we have substantial M&A capacity heading into the year. As it relates to 2021, our revenues grew 19% to $5.8 billion and 9% on an organic basis. EBITDA grew 22% to $2.2 billion, which was 38.2% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 19% to $1.8 billion, 31% of revenue and 82% of EBITDA. Finally, we exceeded our deleveraging plan by reducing net debt by $1.7 billion and ending the year with 3.1x leverage. As we discussed throughout this call, we are set up to have a very strong 2022. Our 2021 software recurring revenue growth provides significant momentum heading into the year. Additionally, our product businesses had and have broad-based demand and record levels of backlog. Taken together and further aided by favorable market tailwinds, we expect to see 6% to 8% organic revenue growth this year. In addition, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have a highly active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We anticipate having about $5 billion of available M&A firepower over the course of 2022. As a result, we have a high level of conviction that will continue our double-digit cash flow compounding in 2022. And with that, let\u2019s open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And today\u2019s first question comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Maybe we can start with the impact of Omicron supply chain, etcetera. It did come up a couple of points, parts in your prepared remarks. But in the scheme of things, it did not sound as impactful as we\u2019ve heard from other companies. So not surprising in measurement and process, it did have an impact. So could you size there, what might have been either revenue pushouts, because I\u2019ve seen record backlog, so that implies that you might not be able to get some of the product out the door. And then just confirm on the software side, what the impact is, if any. I mean it\u2019s probably limited site access, maybe some landing new logos and so forth. But just how did that play out? And what\u2019s the expectations in the first quarter when, hopefully, we get to some sort of normal level of activity and access.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So Deane, I\u2019ll start, maybe going in reverse order. And then there is a handful of [Technical Difficulty] there is no supply chain fortunately. So there wasn\u2019t an impact in any meaningful \u2013 not meaningful way on our software businesses. The businesses have been working remote for the last 2 years. And so that\u2019s a complete \u2013 the Omicron spike, if you will, is a complete non-factor. Bookings activity, as we talked about, was super strong in Q4 there. So that\u2019s our view there. On our product businesses, yes, it was \u2013 it was more about supply chain, less about Omicron and shutdown of facilities. I mean it happened for a week here or there, not an impact really in the quarter and the issue on supply chain, as you hear it from some of the companies, it\u2019s not one thing. It is really sort of a hornet\u2019s nest of small things. One of the nice things about our organization, as you know, is we\u2019ve got 25 or so product businesses and 25 groups of people focused on their bespoke issues, and they did a very nice job in Q4 working through that. A little bit of margin pressure in those businesses at the gross margin line in Q4, just sort of expediting and sort of pulling things forward to be able to meet demand. A couple of other things I\u2019d say, and I\u2019ll turn it to Rob, is as we look to 2022, those issues haven\u2019t abated. We expect them to sort of lessen in the second half, but still persist to some degree. And the final thing is the companies, their teams have done a very nice job of sort of taking the price taking price and offsetting going forward in 2022, the impact of the inflationary environment associated with this. Rob, anything you want to...\nRob Crisci: Yes. That\u2019s right. So yes, it clearly impacts the product margins a little bit. You saw that in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re assuming Q1 is similar and then a little bit of gradual improvement throughout the year on margins for the product businesses.\nDeane Dray: And did you size or can you size any missed revenues or was it not meaningful?\nNeil Hunn: It was not meaningful.\nRob Crisci: Yes, I mean, we\u2019re at record backlog levels as all other businesses are that sell products. And so we will benefit from that moving forward. But we wouldn\u2019t say it was meaningful to sort of revenue in the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nChristopher Glynn: So congrats on rebooting the balance sheet there. Just wanted to ask about the pipeline, how are you seeing the toggle between what\u2019s currently most actionable versus decision trees around holding fire? I think sometimes you\u2019ve talked about don\u2019t do the very good at the expense of great.\nNeil Hunn: Well, I want to make sure we understand your question. I mean I think the \u2013 in terms of the opportunities that are out there for acquisitions, I mean, it is \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of opportunities. There are always a lot of opportunities. The pipeline activity is full, there\u2019s lots of discussions, diligence. We\u2019re always in some phase of diligence at some point, something. The thing that we said for a very long period of time, the 10 years I\u2019ve been here, is that we continue to invest through cycle. We\u2019re a permanent home. We\u2019re trying to find the very best businesses we can find because we\u2019re going to own them over a very long arc of time. And that the compounding effect overwhelms any sort of short-term value. We\u2019ve been here and there and compounding overwhelm that in sort of a cycle benefit. That feature is going to have perfect visibility on what the future holds, which we don\u2019t claim to have.\nChristopher Glynn: That\u2019s great, it\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then you\u2019re pretty bullish kind of even multiyear comment on Neptune. I\u2019m just wondering if you could drill in there a little bit and what you\u2019re seeing specifically for 2022 for Neptune and the particular compounders into 2023, \u201824?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not going to \u2013 we try not to give guidance on the forward year for a specific business. But you\u2019re right, the commentary and our view of Neptune and what Don and the team\u2019s doing there is quite bullish. It\u2019s rooted in three things, principally around the products, both the meter itself going more static from mechanical, the reading technology going from \u2013 going to more cellular. And then once you have both of those elements in place, then Neptune becomes more of a data business, helping its customers sort of navigate the data and work with their customers in a more meaningful and impactful way. Importantly, on the first two, especially the meter technology itself, we think we have some very real proprietary advantages in the static ultrasound technology that we\u2019re using, both on the residential side and the commercial side that we are quite bullish about going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just want to talk, I know you mentioned strong freight matching. Obviously, I\u2019m a little biased here in terms of what I cover. But when we think about that, obviously, the network challenges has put a huge spotlight on that market. And I know DAT certainly supports some of the new entrants. But how are you managing a, I would say, that risk in terms of the viability of some of the new entrants that are coming on to your system or utilizing your system, as well as competitive dynamics? Any thought there?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, so DAT, as you know, is wonderfully positioned and spot freight market is one of two primary competitors or players that help match the shippers and the brokers and the carriers, I should say. And as you think about the tech enabling of the brokerage model, DAT sits right in the center of that and as their business model in future is only aided by that. In terms of the tech-enabled brokers, they are just \u2013 all brokers are becoming tech-enabled. There are some that are native tech-enabled and some that are sort of migrating their business models, all of which are customers and all of which were helping do their job to sort of do their business with less human interaction to more computer-driven connectivity.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess, leaning on that competitive dynamic, meters, obviously, the growth and opportunity certainly attracts new innovation there. Do you know any change in competitive dynamics or things that you\u2019re concerned around? Obviously, Neptune seems like it\u2019s growing quite nicely for you. Any thoughts on that?\nNeil Hunn: Is your question, Allison, on the competitive dynamics on DAT and freight matching or on Neptune?\nAllison Poliniak: Freight matching originally first. But this one will be...\nNeil Hunn: Okay. Yes. So on \u2013 no, so hey, we \u2013 it\u2019s something that we pay very close attention to. The team at DAT has a very open ecosystem. They partner with many folks, and so we pay attention to all of that. But this is a very vibrant two-sided scaled network. Scale matters a ton here. And I mean, when I say a ton, I mean it\u2019s a huge rate limiter for competition. You\u2019ve got to have scale on both sides of the network to be effective, very hard, not impossible but super, super hard to create de novo. But we pay attention to that and any competitive activity, and we need to think about how to counteract that. On the Neptune side, hey, I think this is over a very long arc of time when we think that the metering technology can render a market share advantage. I\u2019ll remind you that Neptune seemingly every year for 20 years ekes out 50 to 100 basis points of market share. I think we\u2019re clearly the leader in the North American water utility metering space, and we\u2019ll just \u2013 we expect that will just continue eking out a little bit of share gain each year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to dial into the EBITDA margin guidance a little bit, so I think you are guiding sort of EPS up around 9% for the year at the midpoint, sales up maybe 1 point or 2 lower than that right now. So when we\u2019re looking at EBITDA margins, are we expecting those to be up sort of 20, 30 bps or so at the midpoint? And any color around those product businesses, just to understand in measurement and analytics and in process. Are we expecting margins up much for the full year as a whole in those two divisions?\nRob Crisci: Yes, so we\u2019re \u2013 we have EBITDA leverage, right, on organic growth around 40%, which is generally pretty normal. So that on a full year basis I think you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve got total EBITDA margins up a little bit sort of embedded in the guidance. Software businesses are, right, 44% EBITDA for application, 51% for network. We\u2019ve got that about the same year-over-year, very stable there. You\u2019re growing, you\u2019re investing, we have very nice organic growth in those businesses this year. So that will drive a lot of organic EBITDA growth at those margin levels. And then \u2013 and as we mentioned on products, it\u2019s a little bit lower margins in the first half of the year, similar to Q4. And then I think we\u2019ll benefit from a lot of the price cost things that we\u2019ve been doing as we get to the second half, margins get a little better. So I think on a full year basis, again there, margins are pretty flat year-over-year, maybe a little bit of improvement as we get to the second half.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s helpful. And just my follow-up question on the free cash flow outlook, very good performance last year with sort of 82% conversion out of EBITDA, anything you\u2019d call out sort of one-timeish helping that and how should we think about cash flow conversion in 2022?\nRob Crisci: Yes, so there were a couple of things that helped us this year for sure. I mean, we had great working capital performance, which we view we\u2019ll always have, especially when you have highly negative net working capital of revenue minus 15%. That drives great conversion. In \u201820 in particular, there were some tax benefits that we benefited from. And so the 80% to 83% conversion is great. We generally feel like if we\u2019re plus or minus 80% conversion, and that\u2019s kind of where we start and then we see sort of the one-off items that happened year-over-year. So that\u2019s \u2013 we always sort of I think we\u2019ll be around 80% and then sometimes it ends up a little bit better.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Good morning guys.\nNeil Hunn: Hi. Good morning.\nScott Davis: Neil, can you talk a little bit about what you are trying to accomplish with combining CliniSys and Sunquest? And is \u2013 and how do you really combine businesses like that? Do you \u2013 can you integrate that \u2013 can sales, for example, be combined? Certainly understand any other functions, but just trying to think about holistically how that helps you guys out.\nNeil Hunn: Yes, I appreciate the question. Good morning. So first, I would say, as we have gone through just our portfolio work over my time as being CEO, there is \u2013 we have tried to see if there are a little \u2013 small pockets where it makes sense to put businesses together. We did it a couple of years ago with Seaboard and Horizon that are both doing very similar things into the education market. And now with CliniSys and Sunquest, as you know, they are doing literally the same thing, just Sunquest historically in the U.S. and CliniSys across Europe. So, in terms of this integration, there are still going to be three core technology platforms for the lab information, U.S., UK and global. But this integration is really all about then sharing the innovation from that going forward. The microservices or service-oriented architecture allows us to do that. The first three in the Q are advanced analytics that helped the laboratorians do their job and make better decisions. The acceleration of anatomic pathology, which is the tissue side of the lab into the cloud and then increasingly, the adoption of molecular or genetics into the lab space. So, this is more about the product integration, if you will, on a go-forward basis. Go-to-market teams remain very similar as they are selling bespoke into their very specific geographies. So, the go-to-market motion is the same. Final thing I would say here is the teams are totally geeked up about this internally. There is a ton of enthusiasm and excitement as the team is now 1,300 people, 12 countries, 21 languages and is part of the largest lab diagnostics business in the planet now.\nScott Davis: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Just a quick follow-up on that, are the customer needs essentially the same when you go around the world now, Neil, when you think about that product offering?\nNeil Hunn: The customer needs are remarkably similar in that you have the fluid side of a lab, the tissue side of the lab and increasingly, the genetics or molecular labs. And then the integration of the ologies, if you will, rarely now do you have a genetic test without some sort of tissue or blood or urine test. So, how do you integrate the pathologies is a major theme. So, those things are very similar. And so if you are a lab in the UK, in NHS or your lab in the U.S. or a lab in France or Spain or wherever it is, the needs are very similar.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good luck guys. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nRob Jamieson: Hey. Good morning. This is Rob on for Joe. I just had a couple of questions about like Foundry and iPipeline. You called out some of the secular tailwinds behind these businesses. And I was just curious how much \u2013 you have good penetration there already, but how much is the growth and further gains that you are going to see in the future is from like new enhancements or upgrades to the existing platforms or products that you offer there. And is there like an opportunity to maybe increase like spend per customer or deepen that wallet as you go forward?\nNeil Hunn: So, the answer is it\u2019s I will try to generalize them because your question around Foundry and iPipeline, totally different markets, obviously, in media and entertainment and life insurance distribution sort of workflows or channel. Both businesses have net retention well north of 100%, right, which tells you that you have an appreciating asset from your customer base. You are selling more into your customer base in any given year. That is largely a result of two things. One is your customers are growing with you. They are growing, so you are growing with them. And then two, you are selling them more value, more things. So, you are correct in that. In Foundry\u2019s case, a lot of their growth has been \u2013 they are going to sort of ride the tailwinds of the 8% to 12% of content spend that happens in media and entertainment between streaming animation and theatrical. But then the workflows in post production are remarkably tedious and manual. And so as we automate those workflows, those are modules that we can sell to monetize the investment in innovation that we are doing there. Similarly, conceptually at least at iPipeline, this is a business that we bought it several years ago. It was all about and the strategy continues to be what they call straight-through processing. How do you get a \u2013 from a quote of life insurance to underwriting life insurance, how does that happen with minimal to no human touch. And so being able to do that and automating those workflows is a huge task. But as you do that, you are creating a ton of value for the distribution channel and you are able to monetize that through the product.\nRob Jamieson: That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Rob Mason of Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Mason: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Neil, you have spoken in the past about a heavy focus on software in the M&A pipeline. And I am just curious, given what we have seen around public market valuations there over the last couple of months, how private market valuations have responded? And is it requiring more patients on your part if a reset of some sort needs to happen there? Just what you are seeing in private markets?\nNeil Hunn: Well, we are always patient. So, we should start with that. And so it\u2019s we are patient and disciplined relative to the asset selection, the value that we ultimately try to transact at. I will tell you my experience here at Roper for a decade and the experience that predate Roper by 15 years sort of being in tech M&A for 20 years or 25 years now is the private markets always lag by some quarter or two quarters or three quarters, the public markets relative to valuation swings to the extent they are meaningful. And so that\u2019s what our \u2013 my personal expectation would be to the extent that we have structurally lower public valuations for software businesses, then it might take a couple of three quarters for those to filter into the private markets. Unclear if that\u2019s the case, right. And so we will be patient. I also said earlier that our analytics, we always are reviewing the analytics, and our analytics suggest that it\u2019s better to buy a great business at the market clearing price at the time and let the compounding sort of begin rather than it is to try to see if you can wait for that asset and save 0.5 of a turn of EBITDA\u2026\nRob Crisci: Or by a lower quality business.\nNeil Hunn: Or by a lower quality business, that\u2019s right. But we will be, and we always are patient.\nRob Mason: Understand. And just as a follow-up, you had commented on Vertafore\u2019s EBITDA coming in above plan for the year. I am curious, two questions, I guess. What drove that? And then when you purchased Vertafore, you talked about a mid-single digit growth revenue expectation there, but believe that could be conservative over time. And I am just \u2013 as you have owned the business a year, what needs to happen to move that mid-single digit growth perspective higher?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, so the overdrive on the earnings was they just \u2013 they did a better job of managing our costs and the way mix came in on a revenue line. So, it was \u2013 and also a little bit is that first part of the year, they are still having a hard time of spending money sort of with COVID. So, it\u2019s a little bit of that. But more importantly, the momentum that the business left, I mean record bookings in Q4, and just the feedback that we are getting from the customers at the enterprise level did a nice little tuck-in that helps them get some customer acquisition on the lower side of the P&C agency space. That\u2019s doing well in the first few weeks. In terms of \u2013 you are right, we did \u2013 the expectation when we bought the business is the mid-single digit growth business, it still very much is that. Is there an upside to high-single digits over a long market time, we would like to hope so. Amy and her team have a very well-articulated data-driven, market-driven outside-in strategy and there is some execution associated to sort of inflect the growth rate a bit higher, but right now, we will hold at mid-singles and want to see Amy and the team put post a few years of better performance where we call it high singles.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hi. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Hi. Good morning Steve. Good to hear you.\nSteve Tusa: Can you give us some color on first quarter organic trends just what the guidance for first quarter organic growth? And then, sorry, I just wanted to clarify on EBITDA margins. What do you guys expect for the first quarter kind of on a year-over-year basis?\nRob Crisci: Yes. So, we have the 6 to 8 organic revenue guide for the year. It\u2019s really pretty consistent throughout the year. For the first quarter, the software businesses are a little bit stronger, given all the ARR momentum we have coming out of Q4. And then the product businesses are a little bit lower, given some of the supply chain challenges we have spoken about. And then I think, as I mentioned, the EBITDA margins we have for Q1 are flat sequentially to what we had in Q4 for the company.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, great. And then just on that kind of comment about double-digit free cash flow growth in compounding continuing is that kind of a high level of guide for the year? And could you \u2013 will you be growing free cash flow double digit without another acquisition, or would that take another acquisition to grow?\nRob Crisci: Yes. So, I mean it\u2019s not a guide. It\u2019s what we do here at Roper. So, I think if you take our organic and you take capital deployment and you look at us over any given year or certainly over a couple of years, we are double-digit compounder. So, I think that will continue to be the case. And we have got a lot of firepower for M&A that will certainly help that number here in the next couple of years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Brian Lau of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBrian Lau: Hi. Good morning everybody. I just wanted to talk about the network software and systems guide. So, high-single digits in \u201822 after a couple of strong mid to high teens quarters in 3Q, 4Q, kind of meaningfully ahead of the historic trends of like mid-single digits. Is this the new medium-term kind of algorithm for the segment? And is this where you think application software can get as you kind of continue the SaaS transition there as well?\nRob Crisci: Yes. Well, just historically, TransCore was in that segment, right. So, the software business have a little bit higher organic growth profile than the old segment did with TransCore was a little bit of more up and down given on various projects. And I will turn it over to Neil.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I mean I think it\u2019s \u2013 that work has been strong. It\u2019s been strong across the board as we highlighted this quarter, much of 2021. There was like super strength at our Freight Match businesses, both in North America and Canada. So, that super strength to moderate a little bit, while the rest of the portfolio improves a little bit, but it\u2019s \u2013 this has been a great couple of years last year, this year for network. Application software, the businesses are great. I think that all of them sort of are very steady eddy mid-single digit growers. As we transition more of a revenue stream away from perpetual into recurring over a long arc of time, is there a chance that, that can inflect a little bit higher, I believe so, but it\u2019s going to take a few years to do that.\nBrian Lau: Okay. Great. And then just on measurement, could you just clarify what the growth would look like in \u201822 without supply chain constraints versus that kind of high-single digit outlook? Thanks.\nRob Crisci: Hard to quantify.\nNeil Hunn: It\u2019s very hard to say. I mean I think probably in the same ballpark.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Brendan Luke with AllianceBernstein. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. As I look at application software and network software and systems, just speaking to the recurring revenue growth, would you say that sort of active SaaS transitions are a drag on the top line here, or we sort of entered the phase where they are driving top line growth disproportionately?\nNeil Hunn: So, I appreciate the question. I love talking about this one. So, we believe in the application software business that the transition to SaaS is a net growth driver. You have two opposing factors going on. You have \u2013 as you transition new clients to the SaaS recurring models. Obviously, that\u2019s the classic J-curve as it relates to perpetual. We are in the year, and that\u2019s a bad guy. Over the long-term, that\u2019s a great guy because you have a higher level of recurring revenue. Offsetting that is, as we have these businesses that have very large installed bases of customers that are paying maintenance, and in fact, it\u2019s about $900 million a year, plus or minus, is what our maintenance stream is across our businesses. That maintenance gets transitioned to SaaS at a, I don\u2019t know, call it, 1.7 to 2.5 uplift. And so it becomes a net growth. That growth driver in year tends to offset the negative J-curve if that makes sense. So, we believe it\u2019s a net growth driver over a long arc of time. We also just \u2013 and as a postscript on that, we don\u2019t force the migration on our customers. The customers are pacing the migration to the cloud. So, that\u2019s why this is going to take 5 years plus to maybe 10 years to sort of fully migrate to the cloud because we are going at the pace of our customers. But it is \u2013 that\u2019s our view on the net growth driver as we migrate to the cloud.\nUnidentified Analyst: Excellent. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blanton: Hi. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning Alex.\nAlex Blanton: I didn\u2019t see in the slides your working capital to sales ratio. What is that doing\u2026?\nRob Crisci: We just have a slide. It\u2019s very consistent mid-teens negative, right. It\u2019s \u2013 it is just part of the model now, especially post TransCore when the working capital went away. So, we are not updating it each quarter, but it\u2019s the same as it was last quarter, minus 13% is where we sit today.\nAlex Blanton: Minus 13%?\nRob Crisci: Yes, sir.\nAlex Blanton: Yes. Okay. Thank you. On TransCore, when do you expect to complete that?\nNeil Hunn: We expect to complete it in this quarter.\nAlex Blanton: This quarter. So, are you \u2013 and you probably can\u2019t answer this, but are you waiting to get that money to make an acquisition?\nRob Crisci: No.\nNeil Hunn: No.\nRob Crisci: No, we have the ability to make acquisitions before the cash comes in.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thanks, Zach and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let's turn to Page 4 and review today's agenda. As usual, we will start with our quarterly and full year highlights. We will then provide details regarding our segment performance, followed by sharing our first quarter and full year 2022 guidance. At the end, we will leave plenty of time to address all your questions. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are: first, our strong finish to \u201821; second, that we are setup very well for solid 2022 organic performance; and third, we have substantial M&A capacity given our rapid deleveraging last year. As it relates to the fourth quarter and closed the 2021, financial performance was excellent with double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. Additionally, because of our strong cash performance last year, our balance sheet is in a great spot as we exceeded our deleveraging plans for the year. As we look towards our 2022 outlook, we have considerable tailwinds that help setup for a very strong year. Underpinning this outlook is our software recurring revenue growth momentum. Given strong market demand, continued innovation in new products and increased shift towards our SaaS solutions, we exit 2021 with robust ARR growth that carries momentum into \u201822. In addition, our product businesses are experiencing strong demand and record levels of backlog, which provide these businesses with an unprecedented level of in-hand orders and revenue visibility heading into the year. Factoring all this together, we expect 6% to 8% organic revenue growth in 2022. In addition to this organic outlook, our balance sheet is well-positioned to allow us to be more meaningfully offensive with M&A in 2022. So, the table is set for us to have great 2022 and continue our long-term track record of double-digit cash flow compounding. Now, let me turn things over to our CFO, Rob Crisci, to walk through our financial summary. Rob? Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 11 and walk through the 2021 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $2.38 billion, up 8% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 44.2%. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for this segment increase 8% for the year. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, cross-selling activity and new customer adds. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was broad-based. To highlight a few companies, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the U.S. federal, contractor, architect, engineering and other services end markets, had another great year. Deltek had nice gains in both our government contracting and private sector end markets, gaining share at each and driving considerable SaaS adoption. Deltek continues to benefit by having favorable secular tailwinds. Turning to Vertafore a great year, exceeding the EBITDA expectations that we outlined at the time of the acquisition in 2020, Vertafore had impressive demand from their enterprise customers as they continue to partner with P&C agencies to tech-enable their customer acquisition, quoting and underwriting workflows. Notably, Vertafore had record quarterly bookings in Q4, which only adds to their ARR momentum. Amy, to you and your team, congrats to a phenomenal start as part of the Roper family. During the fourth quarter, we combined CliniSys and Sunquest to create the largest global lab diagnostics and informatics business. Together, the businesses will begin integrating their go-forward product roadmaps and innovation efforts and operate under the CliniSys brands. Also of note, both CliniSys and data innovation set records by a wide margin for bookings activity in 2021. Finally, as it relates to this group, we recently completed the acquisition of Horizon Lab Systems, which adds public health, water and environmental laboratory cloud-based software to the global CliniSys product portfolio. Aderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, taking share in \u201821 from our primary large law competitor. Also, starting in 2020 and gaining momentum last year, Aderant is seeing a meaningful shift towards our cloud offering, helping drive substantial increases in their recurring revenue stream. Finally, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition, American LegalNet, which will extend and enhance Aderant's court docketing software solution. Finally, Strata's combination with EPSI has worked out wonderfully well. Today, Strata partners with about half of the U.S. acute care hospitals to help them manage forecast and plan their operating and capital expenses and continues to extend both market share and product cross-selling. Looking to the outlook for 2022 in this segment, we expect mid single-digit growth that is driven by our ARR or recurring revenue momentum, making for a solid year for this segment. And with that, let's turn to our next slide. Turning to Page 12, as a reminder, the financial performance for this segment, as well as in X2, MAS and PT are shown on a continuing ops basis. 2021 revenues in our Network segment were $1.34 billion, up 11% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins clocked in at 51.1% for the year. The exceptional organic growth performance in this segment was underpinned by very strong growth in recurring revenue, which is roughly 80% of the segment's revenue. The growth in margin performance in this segment was broad-based and well distributed. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight match businesses were just amazing throughout 2021. Market conditions were very favorable, which led to record levels of network adds especially on the carrier side. More so, the leadership team at DAT did a terrific job scaling infrastructure to meet the market's demands, while maintaining aggressive new product innovation efforts, which led to higher ARPU as well. Over the longer arc of time, our freight match businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the digitization of the spot freight markets. Also, all of our other businesses in this segment saw increasing levels of ARR growth throughout the year, which helped setup for a strong 2022. To highlight a few, Foundry did a terrific job of continuing to extend their product advantage by using AI ML to automate tasks within the media and entertainment postproduction workflows. In addition, Foundry has benefited by the continued increases in content creation budget for streaming, animation and theatrical releases. iTrade, our network food supply chain business, rebounded very nicely in 2021 following the 2020 COVID shutdowns. In addition to benefiting by foodservice reopening, iTrade was able to meaningfully expand their food supply chain network in 2021. iPipeline continues to benefit from the tech enabling of the life insurance distribution model and our long-term care GPO, pharmacy software and home health analytics businesses continue to benefit from the post-COVID recovery and the longer term demographic aging of America. Finally, both RFID and Inovonics had good years, improving in the second half, especially within their healthcare applications. Turning to the full year outlook, we expect to see high single-digit organic growth for this segment, driven by a combination of strong recurring revenue momentum and favorable market tailwinds. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 13, revenues in our MAS segment were $1.56 billion, up 8% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 33.1% for the year. Again, these results are on a continuing ops basis. Before getting into business specific details, across this segment, demand continues to be very strong. As previously mentioned, product backlogs ended the year at record levels. Also, each of these businesses, are navigating the current supply chain environment. Strong demand at Neptune continued throughout the year, picking up in the back half as Neptune's end markets continue to fully reopen. Also, the Neptune team continues to do a great job, innovating their core product offering both in terms of the metering and the meter reading technologies. These innovative product advances helped set Neptune up for many great years. Verathon was very good last year. Remember, they had a great 2020, which was aided by COVID-related demand, but Verathon's 2021 was meaningfully higher than 2019, roughly 40% larger. Over the last 2 years, this team has innovated like crazy, going from zero to number two in the U.S. single use bronchoscope market, launching several new Video Laryngoscope products and developing a new ultrasound core platform. Perhaps more importantly, in 2021, Verathon's largest product offering is now a mission-critical consumable medical product. Our other medical product businesses, especially NDI and CIVCO, recovered nicely in 2021 as healthcare spending started to normalize. These businesses entered 2022 with record levels of order backlog. Demand across our industrial businesses rebounded with better end market and capital spending conditions, but somewhat hampered by supply chain challenges. As it relates to the 2022 guidance, we expect to see high single-digit growth for this segment, underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain environment. Net-net, we expect a very strong year for this group. Now, let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. As we turn to Page 14, revenues at our Process Tech segment were $499 million in 2021, up 8% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 32.2% for the year. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The story here is we saw improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment and very strong demand in the second half. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand tick up for their IoT connected pumping solutions and the share gains they're enjoying as a result of their niche focused go-to-market teams. Similar to that of our MAS businesses, these businesses are being impacted by supply chain challenges, but continue to navigate well through the issues. Across this group, the business has exited 2021 with record levels of order backlog. As we turn to the outlook for 2022, we expect mid-teens organic growth based on strong levels of backlog and solid market conditions. Now please turn to Page 16 as we'll walk through our 2022 guidance. For 2022, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance on a continuing ops basis of $15.25 to $15.55 Underpinning this DEPS guidance is organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% and a tax rate of 21% to 22%. As we said throughout the call, we feel quite bullish about our 2022 based on our 2021 recurring revenue growth and the momentum it carries into this year with strong product demand and the record levels of order backlog. As you look to the first quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.63 and $3.67, again, on a continuing ops basis. Now some concluding comments, and we'll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 17 and our closing remarks, we want to leave you with the same three points we started with: We had a strong \u201821; we are set up very well for a solid 2022 organic performance; and we have substantial M&A capacity heading into the year. As it relates to 2021, our revenues grew 19% to $5.8 billion and 9% on an organic basis. EBITDA grew 22% to $2.2 billion, which was 38.2% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 19% to $1.8 billion, 31% of revenue and 82% of EBITDA. Finally, we exceeded our deleveraging plan by reducing net debt by $1.7 billion and ending the year with 3.1x leverage. As we discussed throughout this call, we are set up to have a very strong 2022. Our 2021 software recurring revenue growth provides significant momentum heading into the year. Additionally, our product businesses had and have broad-based demand and record levels of backlog. Taken together and further aided by favorable market tailwinds, we expect to see 6% to 8% organic revenue growth this year. In addition, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have a highly active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We anticipate having about $5 billion of available M&A firepower over the course of 2022. As a result, we have a high level of conviction that will continue our double-digit cash flow compounding in 2022. And with that, let's open it up to your questions. Good morning, Deane. Yes. So Deane, I'll start, maybe going in reverse order. And then there is a handful of [Technical Difficulty] there is no supply chain fortunately. So there wasn't an impact in any meaningful \u2013 not meaningful way on our software businesses. The businesses have been working remote for the last 2 years. And so that's a complete \u2013 the Omicron spike, if you will, is a complete non-factor. Bookings activity, as we talked about, was super strong in Q4 there. So that's our view there. On our product businesses, yes, it was \u2013 it was more about supply chain, less about Omicron and shutdown of facilities. I mean it happened for a week here or there, not an impact really in the quarter and the issue on supply chain, as you hear it from some of the companies, it's not one thing. It is really sort of a hornet's nest of small things. One of the nice things about our organization, as you know, is we've got 25 or so product businesses and 25 groups of people focused on their bespoke issues, and they did a very nice job in Q4 working through that. A little bit of margin pressure in those businesses at the gross margin line in Q4, just sort of expediting and sort of pulling things forward to be able to meet demand. A couple of other things I'd say, and I'll turn it to Rob, is as we look to 2022, those issues haven't abated. We expect them to sort of lessen in the second half, but still persist to some degree. And the final thing is the companies, their teams have done a very nice job of sort of taking the price taking price and offsetting going forward in 2022, the impact of the inflationary environment associated with this. Rob, anything you want to... It was not meaningful. Good morning. Well, I want to make sure we understand your question. I mean I think the \u2013 in terms of the opportunities that are out there for acquisitions, I mean, it is \u2013 there's a lot of opportunities. There are always a lot of opportunities. The pipeline activity is full, there's lots of discussions, diligence. We're always in some phase of diligence at some point, something. The thing that we said for a very long period of time, the 10 years I've been here, is that we continue to invest through cycle. We're a permanent home. We're trying to find the very best businesses we can find because we're going to own them over a very long arc of time. And that the compounding effect overwhelms any sort of short-term value. We've been here and there and compounding overwhelm that in sort of a cycle benefit. That feature is going to have perfect visibility on what the future holds, which we don't claim to have. Yes. I think it's \u2013 we're not going to \u2013 we try not to give guidance on the forward year for a specific business. But you're right, the commentary and our view of Neptune and what Don and the team's doing there is quite bullish. It's rooted in three things, principally around the products, both the meter itself going more static from mechanical, the reading technology going from \u2013 going to more cellular. And then once you have both of those elements in place, then Neptune becomes more of a data business, helping its customers sort of navigate the data and work with their customers in a more meaningful and impactful way. Importantly, on the first two, especially the meter technology itself, we think we have some very real proprietary advantages in the static ultrasound technology that we're using, both on the residential side and the commercial side that we are quite bullish about going forward. Yes, so DAT, as you know, is wonderfully positioned and spot freight market is one of two primary competitors or players that help match the shippers and the brokers and the carriers, I should say. And as you think about the tech enabling of the brokerage model, DAT sits right in the center of that and as their business model in future is only aided by that. In terms of the tech-enabled brokers, they are just \u2013 all brokers are becoming tech-enabled. There are some that are native tech-enabled and some that are sort of migrating their business models, all of which are customers and all of which were helping do their job to sort of do their business with less human interaction to more computer-driven connectivity. Is your question, Allison, on the competitive dynamics on DAT and freight matching or on Neptune? Okay. Yes. So on \u2013 no, so hey, we \u2013 it's something that we pay very close attention to. The team at DAT has a very open ecosystem. They partner with many folks, and so we pay attention to all of that. But this is a very vibrant two-sided scaled network. Scale matters a ton here. And I mean, when I say a ton, I mean it's a huge rate limiter for competition. You've got to have scale on both sides of the network to be effective, very hard, not impossible but super, super hard to create de novo. But we pay attention to that and any competitive activity, and we need to think about how to counteract that. On the Neptune side, hey, I think this is over a very long arc of time when we think that the metering technology can render a market share advantage. I'll remind you that Neptune seemingly every year for 20 years ekes out 50 to 100 basis points of market share. I think we're clearly the leader in the North American water utility metering space, and we'll just \u2013 we expect that will just continue eking out a little bit of share gain each year. Hi. Good morning. Yes, I appreciate the question. Good morning. So first, I would say, as we have gone through just our portfolio work over my time as being CEO, there is \u2013 we have tried to see if there are a little \u2013 small pockets where it makes sense to put businesses together. We did it a couple of years ago with Seaboard and Horizon that are both doing very similar things into the education market. And now with CliniSys and Sunquest, as you know, they are doing literally the same thing, just Sunquest historically in the U.S. and CliniSys across Europe. So, in terms of this integration, there are still going to be three core technology platforms for the lab information, U.S., UK and global. But this integration is really all about then sharing the innovation from that going forward. The microservices or service-oriented architecture allows us to do that. The first three in the Q are advanced analytics that helped the laboratorians do their job and make better decisions. The acceleration of anatomic pathology, which is the tissue side of the lab into the cloud and then increasingly, the adoption of molecular or genetics into the lab space. So, this is more about the product integration, if you will, on a go-forward basis. Go-to-market teams remain very similar as they are selling bespoke into their very specific geographies. So, the go-to-market motion is the same. Final thing I would say here is the teams are totally geeked up about this internally. There is a ton of enthusiasm and excitement as the team is now 1,300 people, 12 countries, 21 languages and is part of the largest lab diagnostics business in the planet now. The customer needs are remarkably similar in that you have the fluid side of a lab, the tissue side of the lab and increasingly, the genetics or molecular labs. And then the integration of the ologies, if you will, rarely now do you have a genetic test without some sort of tissue or blood or urine test. So, how do you integrate the pathologies is a major theme. So, those things are very similar. And so if you are a lab in the UK, in NHS or your lab in the U.S. or a lab in France or Spain or wherever it is, the needs are very similar. Thank you. So, the answer is it's I will try to generalize them because your question around Foundry and iPipeline, totally different markets, obviously, in media and entertainment and life insurance distribution sort of workflows or channel. Both businesses have net retention well north of 100%, right, which tells you that you have an appreciating asset from your customer base. You are selling more into your customer base in any given year. That is largely a result of two things. One is your customers are growing with you. They are growing, so you are growing with them. And then two, you are selling them more value, more things. So, you are correct in that. In Foundry's case, a lot of their growth has been \u2013 they are going to sort of ride the tailwinds of the 8% to 12% of content spend that happens in media and entertainment between streaming animation and theatrical. But then the workflows in post production are remarkably tedious and manual. And so as we automate those workflows, those are modules that we can sell to monetize the investment in innovation that we are doing there. Similarly, conceptually at least at iPipeline, this is a business that we bought it several years ago. It was all about and the strategy continues to be what they call straight-through processing. How do you get a \u2013 from a quote of life insurance to underwriting life insurance, how does that happen with minimal to no human touch. And so being able to do that and automating those workflows is a huge task. But as you do that, you are creating a ton of value for the distribution channel and you are able to monetize that through the product. Thank you. Well, we are always patient. So, we should start with that. And so it's we are patient and disciplined relative to the asset selection, the value that we ultimately try to transact at. I will tell you my experience here at Roper for a decade and the experience that predate Roper by 15 years sort of being in tech M&A for 20 years or 25 years now is the private markets always lag by some quarter or two quarters or three quarters, the public markets relative to valuation swings to the extent they are meaningful. And so that's what our \u2013 my personal expectation would be to the extent that we have structurally lower public valuations for software businesses, then it might take a couple of three quarters for those to filter into the private markets. Unclear if that's the case, right. And so we will be patient. I also said earlier that our analytics, we always are reviewing the analytics, and our analytics suggest that it's better to buy a great business at the market clearing price at the time and let the compounding sort of begin rather than it is to try to see if you can wait for that asset and save 0.5 of a turn of EBITDA... Or by a lower quality business, that's right. But we will be, and we always are patient. Yes, so the overdrive on the earnings was they just \u2013 they did a better job of managing our costs and the way mix came in on a revenue line. So, it was \u2013 and also a little bit is that first part of the year, they are still having a hard time of spending money sort of with COVID. So, it's a little bit of that. But more importantly, the momentum that the business left, I mean record bookings in Q4, and just the feedback that we are getting from the customers at the enterprise level did a nice little tuck-in that helps them get some customer acquisition on the lower side of the P&C agency space. That's doing well in the first few weeks. In terms of \u2013 you are right, we did \u2013 the expectation when we bought the business is the mid-single digit growth business, it still very much is that. Is there an upside to high-single digits over a long market time, we would like to hope so. Amy and her team have a very well-articulated data-driven, market-driven outside-in strategy and there is some execution associated to sort of inflect the growth rate a bit higher, but right now, we will hold at mid-singles and want to see Amy and the team put post a few years of better performance where we call it high singles. Hi. Good morning Steve. Good to hear you. Yes. I mean I think it's \u2013 that work has been strong. It's been strong across the board as we highlighted this quarter, much of 2021. There was like super strength at our Freight Match businesses, both in North America and Canada. So, that super strength to moderate a little bit, while the rest of the portfolio improves a little bit, but it's \u2013 this has been a great couple of years last year, this year for network. Application software, the businesses are great. I think that all of them sort of are very steady eddy mid-single digit growers. As we transition more of a revenue stream away from perpetual into recurring over a long arc of time, is there a chance that, that can inflect a little bit higher, I believe so, but it's going to take a few years to do that. It's very hard to say. I mean I think probably in the same ballpark. So, I appreciate the question. I love talking about this one. So, we believe in the application software business that the transition to SaaS is a net growth driver. You have two opposing factors going on. You have \u2013 as you transition new clients to the SaaS recurring models. Obviously, that's the classic J-curve as it relates to perpetual. We are in the year, and that's a bad guy. Over the long-term, that's a great guy because you have a higher level of recurring revenue. Offsetting that is, as we have these businesses that have very large installed bases of customers that are paying maintenance, and in fact, it's about $900 million a year, plus or minus, is what our maintenance stream is across our businesses. That maintenance gets transitioned to SaaS at a, I don't know, call it, 1.7 to 2.5 uplift. And so it becomes a net growth. That growth driver in year tends to offset the negative J-curve if that makes sense. So, we believe it's a net growth driver over a long arc of time. We also just \u2013 and as a postscript on that, we don't force the migration on our customers. The customers are pacing the migration to the cloud. So, that's why this is going to take 5 years plus to maybe 10 years to sort of fully migrate to the cloud because we are going at the pace of our customers. But it is \u2013 that's our view on the net growth driver as we migrate to the cloud. Thank you. Good morning Alex. We expect to complete it in this quarter. No."

            "name": "Rob Crisci",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone and thanks again for joining us. Turning to Page 6, looking at our Q4 income statement performance, as Zack stated earlier, all the financials here are reported on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Both organic revenue and total revenue for the quarter increased 13% to a total of $1.51 billion. EBITDA grew 12% to $576 million. EBITDA margin was down 10 basis points versus prior year at 38.1%. That all resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.73, which was above our guidance range. Free cash flow grew 4% in the quarter on top of last year's 23% fourth quarter growth. Cash conversion was once again very strong at 35% of revenue and 92% of EBITDA. Q4 was a nice finish to a very strong year and positions us well for a great 2022. Next slide. Turning to Page 7, reviewing the Q4 results by segment, Neil will discuss the full year segment performance in more detail a little later, but we wanted to just highlight the Q4 results by segment here. All four segments grew double-digit organically as our businesses executed very well and continued to win within their niche markets. Application Software segment grew 10% organically with broad-based strength throughout the segment. EBITDA margin increased to 43.8%. For Network Software, excellent 14% organic growth with EBITDA margin increasing to 52.3%. For Measurement & Analytical Solutions, 15% organic growth was broad-based with double-digit growth at Neptune, medical products and our industrial businesses. EBITDA margin was 31.3% as our businesses continue to navigate supply chain challenges. Lastly, for Process Technologies, a nice rebound from last year's decline, with 17% organic revenue growth and EBITDA margins of 31.2%. Next slide. Turning to Page 8, which is a summary of our full year 2021 financial highlights. For full year 2021, organic revenue growth was 9%. We benefited from both our strong organic growth and meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions to achieve 19% total revenue growth. EBITDA grew 22% for the year to exceed $2.2 billion. EBITDA margin increased 90 basis points to 38.2%. Full year DEPS increased 23% to $14.18, which was above the high-end of our guidance range. Free cash flow performance was outstanding for the year with 19% growth to $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow represented 31% of revenue and 82% of EBITDA. Excellent cash conversion, which is of course a key component of Roper's business model and value creation flywheel. We are well-positioned to continue our double-digit cash flow compounding moving forward. Next slide. Turning to Page 9, which is the latest installment in our successful deleveraging story. Including our discontinued operations, total operating cash flow for 2021 exceeded $2 billion. After CapEx and servicing of our dividend, nearly all of our excess free cash flow went to debt reduction. In total, we were able to reduce our net debt by $1.7 billion in 2021, which exceeded the deleveraging outlook we shared with you last January by about $200 million. We ended the year with net debt to EBITDA of 3.1x. Subsequent to year end, we closed the previously announced $350 million Zetec divestiture, which has further reduced our leverage. The closing of the TransCore divestiture expected for later this quarter will bring in over $2.1 billion of additional after-tax proceeds. We are pleased with our performance here as we once again demonstrated our ability to quickly delever after large acquisitions, reinforcing our commitment to our solid investment grade ratings. So with that, I will turn it back over to Neil for the remainder of our prepared remarks. Neil? Yes. That's right. So yes, it clearly impacts the product margins a little bit. You saw that in the fourth quarter. We're assuming Q1 is similar and then a little bit of gradual improvement throughout the year on margins for the product businesses. Yes, I mean, we're at record backlog levels as all other businesses are that sell products. And so we will benefit from that moving forward. But we wouldn't say it was meaningful to sort of revenue in the quarter. Yes, so we're \u2013 we have EBITDA leverage, right, on organic growth around 40%, which is generally pretty normal. So that on a full year basis I think you're right. We've got total EBITDA margins up a little bit sort of embedded in the guidance. Software businesses are, right, 44% EBITDA for application, 51% for network. We've got that about the same year-over-year, very stable there. You're growing, you're investing, we have very nice organic growth in those businesses this year. So that will drive a lot of organic EBITDA growth at those margin levels. And then \u2013 and as we mentioned on products, it's a little bit lower margins in the first half of the year, similar to Q4. And then I think we'll benefit from a lot of the price cost things that we've been doing as we get to the second half, margins get a little better. So I think on a full year basis, again there, margins are pretty flat year-over-year, maybe a little bit of improvement as we get to the second half. Yes, so there were a couple of things that helped us this year for sure. I mean, we had great working capital performance, which we view we'll always have, especially when you have highly negative net working capital of revenue minus 15%. That drives great conversion. In \u201820 in particular, there were some tax benefits that we benefited from. And so the 80% to 83% conversion is great. We generally feel like if we're plus or minus 80% conversion, and that's kind of where we start and then we see sort of the one-off items that happened year-over-year. So that's \u2013 we always sort of I think we'll be around 80% and then sometimes it ends up a little bit better. Or by a lower quality business. Yes. So, we have the 6 to 8 organic revenue guide for the year. It's really pretty consistent throughout the year. For the first quarter, the software businesses are a little bit stronger, given all the ARR momentum we have coming out of Q4. And then the product businesses are a little bit lower, given some of the supply chain challenges we have spoken about. And then I think, as I mentioned, the EBITDA margins we have for Q1 are flat sequentially to what we had in Q4 for the company. Yes. So, I mean it's not a guide. It's what we do here at Roper. So, I think if you take our organic and you take capital deployment and you look at us over any given year or certainly over a couple of years, we are double-digit compounder. So, I think that will continue to be the case. And we have got a lot of firepower for M&A that will certainly help that number here in the next couple of years. Yes. Well, just historically, TransCore was in that segment, right. So, the software business have a little bit higher organic growth profile than the old segment did with TransCore was a little bit of more up and down given on various projects. And I will turn it over to Neil. Hard to quantify. We just have a slide. It's very consistent mid-teens negative, right. It's \u2013 it is just part of the model now, especially post TransCore when the working capital went away. So, we are not updating it each quarter, but it's the same as it was last quarter, minus 13% is where we sit today. Yes, sir. No. No, we have the ability to make acquisitions before the cash comes in."

[Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us, as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. During and subsequent to the third quarter, Roper signed definitive agreement to divest TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy businesses. Results for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all period presented. Unless otherwise noted, the number shown in this presentation is in continuing operation basis.  For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of the following item: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense and lastly income tax restructuring associated with our pending divestures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.  And now, if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're looking forward to sharing with you the details of our solid quarter performance, as well as summarizing the acceleration of our portfolio transformation. As we look at the sequence of our call this morning, we'll start with our quarterly highlights and our recent divestiture activity. I'll then turn the call over to Rob who will share the details of our financial performance and our bridge to continued operations. I'll then walk everyone through our segment by segment performance and our outlook for the balance of the year. As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk to you all of your questions towards the end. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, this was another quarter of solid operational and excellent financial performance. On a continuing ops basis, we grew revenue, EBITDA and DEPS north of 20% in the quarter. It is important to highlight and characterize the underlying strength of these results. Revenue on an organic basis grew 12% in the quarter. End market and customer demand was very strong across our portfolio within both our software and product businesses. Importantly, our software segments were strong operationally with 10% growth in one segment and 17% in the other. Our software businesses recurring revenue grew low double digits in the quarter, highlighting the underlying strength, stability and increasing quality of a revenue base. To remind everyone, about 80% of our software revenues are recurring in nature. It's also worth noting that our 2020 acquisition cohort, led by Vertafore, continues to perform very well. As it relates to our product businesses, like most other companies we, are experiencing supply chain and logistical challenges. But the businesses nevertheless performed very well during the third quarter. As mentioned, customer demand was very strong throughout the quarter and backlogs are up over 50% versus last year. Given this strong operational performance, we continued our disciplines deleveraging of our balance sheet with net debt at 3.5x trailing EBITDA. Also, we are improving the outlook for the year, which we'll detail later in the call. Earlier this morning, we announced two new additions to our Board of Directors, Irene Esteves and Tom Joyce. The addition of Irene and Tom to our Board is part of our long-term board refreshment process. Both are tremendous additions to our board. Finally, we've been active over the last few months working to accelerate the transformation of our portfolio through the announced divestiture of three businesses. Let's turn to the next slide Page 6 to walk through those details and highlights. Next slide please. During the last several weeks, we entered into definitive agreements to divest three of our businesses: TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy, the last of which we announced this morning. We agreed to divest TransCore to ST Engineering for $2.68 billion. In our view, this is the right time and the right buyer for TransCore, given their forward strategy and growth outlook. Taken together, we're divesting these three businesses for $3.15 billion, or about 20x this year's EBITDA. Following the completion of these deals, Roper will be improved. We will have a higher quality portfolio characterized by having higher proportions of recurring revenue, a higher organic growth profile, and be significantly more asset light. Finally, we are and will be very active in deploying these after-tax proceeds. Together with our internally generated cash flow, we will have about $5 billion of available M&A firepower to deploy between now and the end of 2022, none of which is included in our current financial outlook. Our enterprise will be even further enhanced once we complete this activity. Before I turn it over to Rob, I wanted to take a moment and highlight Roper's ability to govern, build and approve businesses over the long term. As part of these transactions, we are retaining our DAT and Loadlink network software businesses, which are purchased together with TransCore in 2004, and we are retaining our CIVCO Medical Solutions business. Given we do not usually get clean book-ins to transaction activity, this provides a unique opportunity to talk about the business building that occurs within Roper. Specifically, just after the acquisition of TransCore, we established DAT and Loadlink as standalone businesses with independent strategies and management teams who operated within Roper's governance and incentive system. Over the course of the last 15 years, these businesses have consolidated freight networks, continuously innovated their product solutions, built go-to- market capability and grown revenues high single digits on a compounded organic basis.  Similarly, the retained CIVCO Medical Solutions business has grown high single digits on organic basis over the last 15 years as well. During this period of time, CIVCO Medical Solutions has continually innovated their products solutions, including the recent gel-free ultrasound products, and fundamentally restructured their go-to-market strategy. At Roper, we buy great businesses and provide an environment and incentive system where they get even better over the long arc of time. Now let me turn over to Rob to walk through the details of our financial performance.\nRob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 7. On this page, we will review some Q3 financial metrics on a basis that includes the discontinued operations in order to compare our Q3 results to our previous guidance on an apples-to-apples basis, including the businesses now classified as discontinued operations, we generated $1.621 billion of revenue and $602 million of EBITDA. Total DEPS was $3.91, which exceeded our Q3 DEPS guidance of $3.80 to $3.84. Free cash flow for the quarter was $431 million, down 2% versus prior year; year-to-date free cash flow is now up 29% through three quarters. Now turning to Page 8. Here we'll review some of the key income statement metrics on a continuing operations basis. Revenue increased 22% to $1.463 billion. Q2 organic revenue increased 12% with strong growth across all four reporting segments led by 17% organic growth in our Network Software segment. EBITDA increased 21% to $558 million, net earnings grew 24% to $384 million, and DEPS also grew 24% to $3.60. Next slide. Turning to Page 9. This slide will update you on the latest installment in our successful deleveraging story. Year-to-date, we have reduced our net debt by nearly $1.3 billion and our total debt reduction is now $1.8 billion since completing the last of the 2020 acquisitions approximately one year ago. We continue to benefit from our excellent cash conversion as nearly $2.3 billion of total EBITDA we generated over the last four quarters has converted to $1.94 billion of free cash flow, representing EBITDA to free cash flow conversion of 85%. At the end of September, our net debt to EBITDA has decreased to 3.5. We are on track to be near 3x by the end of 2021 and therefore, well positioned to return to capital deployment even before accounting for the divestitures. The proceeds from the divestitures further amplify our capacity with $5 billion-plus available for deployment through 2022, as Neil highlighted earlier. Next slide. Moving now to Page 10. A quick look here at how the divestitures meaningfully improve our working capital position moving forward. This page repeat the working capital numbers we showed last October and adds a Q3 '21 column that shows the enterprise including the removal of the three businesses being divested, we are now at negative 12% net working capital to revenue compared to negative 6% in the same quarter last year, and negative 3% back in Q3 2019. Divesting TransCore reduces our net working capital by approximately $200 million with the majority coming out of our unbilled receivables balance. This structurally lower net working capital positions us very well for continued high cash conversion moving forward. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to cover the segments.\nNeil Hunn: Thanks Rob. Let's turn to Page 12 and walk through our application software segment. Revenues in this segment were $603 million, up 10% on organic basis. EBITDA margins were 44.4% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for this segment increased approximately 10%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention, continued migration to our fast delivery models, cross-selling activity and new customer adds. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was broad. To highlight a few businesses, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the US federal contractor, architect, engineering, and other services end markets had another good quarter. During the quarter, demand was particularly strong in Enterprise GovCon and construction end markets. Importantly, during the quarter, Deltek also had success at the top end of market with their cloud or SaaS solutions. Vertafore, our agency management cloud software business focused on P&C insurance agencies also had a nice quarter with very strong new bookings and nice expansion activity in some of their largest customers. Aderant, our legal software business continues its momentum and market share gains, as we talked about last quarter; Aderant is gaining momentum for their SaaS solutions this quarter, setting a record for SaaS bookings activity. Consistent with the theme of this segment, PowerPlan was strong as well both in terms of new bookings and adds to their recurring revenue base. It's nice to see PowerPlan's refocus strategies start to pay dividends. As relates to our healthcare IT businesses, Strata, the data innovations and CliniSys were rock solid in the quarter. For Strata, their recurring subscription based software solutions continue to perform well and grow nicely. Strata's integration of EPSi is on track and nearly complete. The customer base continues to demonstrate excitement for this combination. Finally, CliniSys continued to gain market share in the UK lab market, and has been established as one of the four strategic IT partners for the NHS. As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue growth to be similar to that of the third quarter as recurring revenue growth rates are expected to remain strong. A solid quarter here for sure. And with that, let's turn to the next slide. Turning to Page 13. The financial performance for this segment, as well as next two MAS and PT are shown on a continuing ops basis. Revenues in our network segment were $343 million, up 17% on organic basis and EBITDA margins remained very strong at 51.6% in the quarter. The software businesses in this segment are now greater than 90% of the segments revenue. Our NSF software growth was broad based and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 17%. At the business level, our Freight Match businesses both in the US and Canada continue to be solid growers. As reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize and transact the trucking, shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses has been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers with continued strength in the quarter on the carrier side of the network.  In addition, these businesses had improving revenue per customer ARPU, as the value of the network continues to increase with higher levels of network activity. Foundry, our media and entertainment software business which enables the combination of live action and computer generated graphics to be combined into a single frame demonstrated continued recovery and growth in the quarter. Worth pointing out is Foundry's continued commitment to product innovation. And the recent release of their AI enabled news features that allow for more automated workflow steps within the video compositing process. Our businesses that focus in and around the US Long Term Care markets, MHA, SHP and SoftWriters did particularly well in the quarter. iTradeNetwork, our perishable food supply chain, network business had a nice quarter as bookings growth was very strong and demonstrates this followed recovery in their end markets. Finally, we saw growth across the two product businesses within the segment, rf IDEAS and Inovonics Products with particular strength in our healthcare end markets. As we look to the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to see low double digit growth in this segment again on a continuing ops basis. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 14, revenue in our MAS segment was $392 million, up 9% on organic basis. Organic growth in this segment excluding Verathon was again north of 20%. Notably, this is the last quarter for the very difficult Verathon COVID comp and we expect Verathon return to growth in Q4. EBITDA margins for this segment were 32.4% in the quarter; the EBITDA margins in this segment were consistent with our expectations, but lower than prior year due to Verathon's extraordinary prior year quarter, and the cost impacts of certain businesses navigating their supply chain challenges. Again, these results are on a continuing ops basis. Before getting into business specific details across this segment demand can be characterized as being very strong. The demand was across all businesses and across both capital and consumable products. Product backlogs are up over 50% as compared to a year ago. Our businesses, each of which was impacted by supply chain challenges navigated through the quarter. As relates to individual business performance, Verathon coming off unprecedented demand for their intubation family of products a year ago is roughly 40% larger today versus 2019. The momentum within this business continues given the larger install base of intubation capital equipment, which enables recurring considerable pull through volumes. In addition, Verathon is experiencing impressive growth in their Bronchoscope product family and sustained growth across their BladderScan ultrasound franchise. Our other medical product businesses accelerated nicely in the quarter with particular strength at NDI and CIVCO Medical Solutions. Strong demand at Neptune continued in the quarter. Neptune's end markets continue to open up and improve but have not fully recovered, especially in the northeast US and Canada. Demand across our Industrial Businesses was robust as well and performance was strong but somewhat impacted by supply chain challenges. For the fourth quarter, we expect low double digit organic growth for this segment. This is based on continued encouraging market conditions both in medical and industrial markets and easing prior year comp for Verathon. Now let's turn to our final segment Process Tech. As we turn to Page 15, revenues in our Process Tech segment were $124 million, up 16% on organic basis, EBITDA margins were 31.6% in the quarter. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment and strong demand. Both orders and backlog were up approximately 50% in the quarter versus a year ago. Recovery in our upstream oil and gas business is accelerated in the quarter. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions but also based on Cornell's product innovation, as they're seeing very nice demand pick up for their IoT connected pumping solutions. Similar to that of our MAS Industrial businesses, the businesses in this segment are being impacted by supply chain challenges but continue to navigate through these issues. As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect high teen organic growth based on improving market conditions. Now please turn to Page 17, where I'll highlight our increased outlook for 2021. Based on strong year-to-date performance and expected continued momentum, we're establishing full year 2021 guidance on continuing ops basis of $14.08 to $14.12. As you read down this table, you will note that the full year DEPS impact for the businesses being divested is $1.18. If you combine this with our newly established continuing ops guidance, you will note we are raising our full year outlook on apples-to- apples basis by $0.26 in the low end and $0.10 on the high end. As relates to the fourth quarter, we're establishing again on continuing ops basis guidance in the range of $3.62 and $3.66. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. As we turn to Page 18 and our closing summary, our third quarter was a solid quarter from both an operational and financial perspective. Simultaneously, we undertook significant work to further the transformation of our business portfolio. Revenue, EBITDA and DEPS grew 20% plus, organic revenue was up 12%. Across our enterprise, end market and customer demand was strong in terms of software, product capital items and consumables. Throughout the quarter, our product businesses navigated through the market based supply chain challenges. Given all of this, we're able to increase on an apples-to-apples basis our outlook for the full year. We also continue to deleverage our balance sheet by $1.8 billion since the 2020 acquisitions with net leverage now coming in at 3.5x trailing EBITDA. As relates to the strategic governance of our enterprise, we're excited to be announcing the addition of Irene and Tom as new members of our Board of Directors. As part of our long-term board refreshment strategy, these two new directors will complement our existing directors, and help enable Roper to continue our track record of long-term cash flow compounding. Over the last decade, we have worked to enhance the quality of our portfolio. To this end, recently, we took actions to meaningfully improve the quality of our portfolio by agreeing to divest TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy. Once complete, Roper will be a better version of Roper, will have higher proportions of recurring revenue, higher organic growth prospects, and be significantly more asset light. In addition, we expect to have roughly $5 billion of capital available to deploy between now and the end of 2022. And as it relates to our M&A pipeline, it is and always has been characterized as having many high quality opportunities. So we're clear, we're 100% back on offense when it comes to our capital appointment portion of our strategy, and have fully resumed our usual process oriented and disciplined M&A activities. And with that, let's open up to your questions.\nOperator: We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeaneDray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, good morning, Deane.\nRob Crisci: Good morning, Deane.\nDeaneDray: Hey, look, when I look at free cash flow, organic revenue growth, recurring revenue, everything checks the boxes, and there's a lot of moving parts this quarter and I really appreciate all the reconciliation of previous guidance versus revised with a divestiture. So just set that aside and the first question I want to ask is for Neil, to help put in context, these recent portfolio moves. And I don't want to parse your words, but the slide says accelerating a portfolio transformation. You're not saying optimize, you are not trimming at the edges, but you are making some sizable moves here in a cluster. And it just begs the question, what is the strategic transformation? Is it more just making Roper a better Roper? Or is there a more sizable change in portfolio composition coming in what the timing might be. Thanks. We'll start there.\nNeilHunn: Yes. Thanks, Dean. So hey, the - it's all about Roper being a better version of our self, our strategy, as you know and most people listening know, for the last 20 years has been fundamentally based on improving the quality of our enterprise, historically, that's been characterized as being more asset light or recently, it's not just that, but increasing mix towards recurring revenue, increasing mix towards higher and slightly higher organic growth businesses. So that strategy has been in place and will remain in place, nothing's changed there relative to these three transactions is really a result, these three are result of really two different decisions. Zetec was really an opportunistic situation with a strategic buyer, who offered a compelling price. And it was just made sense, in our view, for our shareholders to let that go to that buyer and reduce a little bit of cyclicality and exposure to the Zetec end markets. As it relates to CIVCO Radiotherapy and TransCore, those were -- while they're independent decisions, the result of a single process, which was our sort of our new and revised sort of deep strategic review of all the businesses, we do this with each business on a rolling sort of three-year basis. The CIVCO Radiotherapy and TransCore reviews were late last year, early this year, and we just felt, given their future growth prospects, which are interesting and likely robust, but also capital intensive. In both cases, we're going to just be a sub optimized with us as an owner, you overlay that where the valuations will get for the businesses, the three together roughly 20x this year just made sense from all vectors for us.\nDeaneDray: Is there just to circle back for the timing? And just like what's ahead, how far down the road are you on this optimization? Are there other bigger pieces coming? What kind of timing should we expect? \nNeilHunn: Yes, I think the, again, it's, I wouldn't -- I would call it the acceleration of the transformation. Transformation has been slow and evolutionary over 20 years, as we've gone from 40% cyclical to now, 10% or 15% cyclical, going from more asset intensive, less asset intensive gone from products to software. I mean, this has been an evolutionary approach, and we expect that to continue.\nDeaneDray: Good. Well, just, I really appreciate the specifics you provided each one of these divestitures makes sense. You're getting good valuation for them. So, kudos to you guys. And then the second question, and this feels more like some that would ask at an Analyst Day, but just it jumped off the page here on your board additions. Today, adding Tom Joyce from Danaher, Irene from CFO of Time Warner. I've presented to your board last November, I've got an appreciation for how high powered the group already is and how hands on they are. Talk about the partnership with the board, the dynamics, especially at this stage of the evolution of the portfolio. And what were the priorities for the board is in our at this time?\nNeilHunn: Yes, appreciate the opportunity, any opportunity to talk about our board because it is absolutely and undeniably a strategic asset for our business. The board, we highly engaged with five times a year, three days each time. So it's a board that works hard. They enjoy working hard, it's a board and that amount of time that we spend, it's not just a series of presentations where there is space to have conversation, deliberation, challenge one another, and then form a point of view on the forward direction of our enterprise, highly collaborative group, but one where people express their points of view open and freely. So it's a great environment. Also in governance, there's a refreshment process that goes with that, the Board Chair that became the Board Chair at Brian's passing, Will Prezzano just aged off the board. And we have a sort of that requirement to refresh the Board and we're super fortunate to have Irene and Tom join us. Irene will bring just a tremendous - she's most recently professionally as a executive at Time Warner, but a long track record in financial institutions just a very astute and financially savvy executive understands risk and risk management and also a very experienced Board member at this stage in her career. Tom, this will be his first public, outside public company board. Everybody here listening knows Tom very well, but just the combination of what he's done in his 30-year career at Danaher, combination of business building and capital deployment leader development is core to what we are all about. And I think both will just bring tremendous new thoughts to our boardroom as we continue to evolve and build our business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllisonPoliniak: Hi, good morning, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, Allison.\nAllisonPoliniak: I just want to talk of the CRA metric. Obviously, core to your M&A strategy, and I suspect going forward, but with, some of that asset intensive business coming out, elevating Roper's on CRA. I guess one is that, is it more challenging in terms of pool of potential properties that you want to acquire? And, I just maybe any thoughts on does that CRA metric relative to Roper kind of shift going forward? Just any color there?\nNeilHunn: Yes, cash return for us is our North Star, right? It is how we not just -- it just not only guides our capital deployment strategy, it guides every operational decision in the business. It defines for us, for instance, what good organic growth is versus just growth at any cost, right? It's how you do - in CRA for those that aren't intimate with it is really just a measure of business quality. Do you have a cash flow relationship with your customer, if you will, we're able to provide value, capture value for that and have an underlying business model that doesn't require a lot of assets to deliver that value. That's what cash return is, it is our North Star, will continue to be our North Star. It's just -- it's core to our culture here. Allison, in terms of your question about the number of targets, it mathematically yes, it's the number of targets are fewer as we're looking to buy companies that are have CRA that are higher than our existing, but it's not a limiter to our strategy, right? There's a vast ocean of software, informatics data-enabled business models that are out there that we've been fishing in for the last 10 years. And it's not a practical constraint for our capital deployment strategy.\nAllisonPoliniak: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick question on measurement and analytical solutions at core without Verathon, obviously, up 20%-plus. But then you talked about EBITDA, some headwinds there, one being Verathon, but the other being supply chains. Is that just a headwind in terms of growth? Is it cost you can pass through, just any incremental color there to help me reconcile that?\nNeilHunn: Hey, I'll start and I'll pass over to Rob. And so first, I would say, our businesses more broadly, like most businesses, maybe around the world, certainly as country over the last 20 years have built their supply chain for optimize on the lowest cost and less so on resiliency, a nice thing that our businesses did, starting a couple years ago, is build some resiliency with the China sort of tariff situation. So that was a precursor that helped us a bit for us relative to the headwinds, yes, it was growth was limited a bit, certainly across all of our product businesses. And then also the choice that our businesses made when there's an opportunity to either expedite apart or go into a spot market or an alternative source for a part and pay incrementally bit more, they did that. And so there's a little bit of gross margin headwind, hard to notice, in a macro sense, but a little bit of headwind on GP percentage, and then certainly some impact on the revenue side. Rob, if you want to add something?\nRobCrisci: Yes, I just, about 25% of that MAS segment are the industrial businesses. And so that's where you see some of this and, I think we mentioned earlier that backlog is up 50% so that, we're -- we have great orders, and that bodes well for the future. But yes, I think what Neil said they're spot on.\nOperator: The next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.\nTrishGorman: Hey, good morning. This is Trish Gorman on for Julian, just maybe following up on that last question regarding the supply chain constraints. Can you just talk more about what your assumptions are kind of embedded in for guidance for when those might be.\nRobCrisci: Yes, so we're not expecting that they're going to ease really anytime soon. So we're expecting what we saw in the third quarter similar to what we'll see in the fourth quarter and then as we get in next year, we'll update that next quarter, but we're continuing to build backlog, the customer relationships are great as Neil said we're expediting wherever we can to get products to customers. And so I think long term it's a great story; short term, it's hard to say what's going to happen.\nTrishGorman: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just maybe a follow up kind of broader. We've been seeing industrial companies paying anywhere from 30x to 100x EBITDA for software assets now. And so does Roper think you'll have to pay this kind of price too or can it still buy software assets for 20x EBITDA or less as it did with Vertafore. Thanks.\nNeilHunn: Yes, appreciate the question. Certainly valuations for higher quality software businesses are high. They've been high for a while they remain high. It's, I think I said a couple quarters ago it feels like this. They may be stabilizing at a level I think that still may be the case. But that level is very high. That said Roper buys businesses that are tried and true. The competitive forces and market are observable, the market growth is concerned -- is observable, the forward growth outlook is diligence able and understandable and the growth drivers can be clearly modeled. When you get those businesses that are in small markets that are leaders that have mid to high single digit organic growth and are 30% to 40% plus EBITDA margin businesses, those trade in that we call it circa 20x maybe 18x, maybe 22x. But they're sort of in that zone. And that's where we think that will continue to play and focus.\nOperator: Next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.\nChristopherGlynn: Oh, yes. Thanks. Good morning. So given the comment that the number of targets is not a practical constraint, and I appreciate repeating that, which we've heard previously. I'm wondering if the expectation is actually to, at least replace the divestiture earnings and EBITDA in fairly short order? And can you under head of receiving those proceeds in terms of your negotiations with agencies and such?\nNeilHunn: Yes, so appreciate the question. So first, we said it in the prepared remarks, it's on the slides is worth mentioning, we take the proceeds from these through transactions added to our cash flow we're generating in our current balance sheet leverage, there's about $5 billion of M&A firepower between now and the end of next year. So that's all good, the balance sheets in good shape, or as we mentioned we are super active in the M&A markets. But we always have been and always will be patient and disciplines, right? I mean, this is every deal matters; we're buying these businesses with the very long term in mind to never sell them. So you have to buy the very best asset you can find. And sometimes that takes time. So I'm not, we're sort of putting out this mathematical marker of $5 billion, but I would not associate any specific timeframe with that. It's just, we're patient, discipline focused, but active in the M&A markets.\nRobCrisci: And I would say we do have flexibility in terms of the timing on when that capital is deployed. I think you have to wait, for the proceeds to come in the door. But as Neil said, we're going to be very, very disciplined and we don't feel like we're rushing anyway.\nChristopherGlynn: Okay, and just wanted to dive into the backlog of 50% plus that the MAS segment, curious the play of medical versus industrial and how Verathon factors into it.\nNeilHunn: So it was the backlog was up over 50% in both MAS and Patterson. I'll certainly turn over to Rob here in second but the backlog was strong at medical products, Verathon Northern MMI. It was strong at Neptune and it was strong at industrial so --\nRobCrisci: Yes, it's very broad based. It really is across all the businesses, and again, that's getting a lot of orders in and then being able to get the products out the door.\nChristopherGlynn: Okay, last one for me any estimate on the after tax and impact of the $3.15 billion?\nRobCrisci: Yes, I think we want to wait until we get the deals closed to comment on that. I mean, there certainly will be some tax leakage. But we'd rather wait till next year, we get the deals closed and then we can give you a good number.\nOperator: Next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. \nJosephGiordano: Hey, good morning, guys. So does this mean that I, we're not going to be able to ask you guys about New York City deal and the --.\nRobCrisci: You can ask.\nRobCrisci: We're under contract to not disclose a lot of details about that going forward.\nJosephGiordano: It will be sadly missed. Yes, I just wanted to ask on Neptune. A lot of like kind of different things being said out there in that market. Can you talk about where that business is this year? Like is that business growing this year? Or is it still down? How much did it decline last year? Just kind of curious to see what's really going on in that metering market right now.\nNeilHunn: Yes, so I'll give you a little bit of color and turn over to Rob. So it's for Neptune this year will be like really close to '19. Just from a size perspective that absolutely is growing this year, in the very short term, we're actually we believe it's hard to measure in the very short term but the reports from the company Neptune as we picked up a little bit of market share this quarter because we are able to deliver product on a much shorter lead time than some of the people we compete with. The thing that's about the market itself, the markets are opening, but nowhere close to fully recovered, especially in Canada and less so but certainly not open in the Northeast United States in the US Northeast. Final thing I'd say about Neptune is the strategy here is, I mean, it's very clear, and it appears to be working, if you will, having traction around the strategy on the product with the static meter product that were introduced to the market, the way we read the data off the meter. And importantly, now the software and analytics that play that Neptune is developing, right? What do you do with all that data once you capture it off the meter in a more frequent basis? So it's the strategy is certainly got traction in the marketplace, and the business is growing, and they have record levels of backlog as we sit here at the end of the quarter.\nJosephGiordano: Can you just remind me how much of the product at Neptune are you guys manufacturing, like in house and how much is contract?\nNeilHunn: It's virtually all in house. I mean, certainly there's -- it's a supply chain, and there are certain pieces that come but between the two facilities at Neptune it's a vertically integrated business.\nJosephGiordano: Okay. And then my last question and I promise next quarter I'll ask software questions. So this is like the first one. But the process got, is that I mean, it's slightly less growth expectation than previous, is that just supply chain limiting your ability to deliver or does the market change at all?\nNeilHunn: No, 100% supply chain related across all the businesses and incrementally the markets more favorable. We talked about the backlogs but the obviously you know that the US rack markets more favorable energy prices more favorable the project work at CCC is going well. So yes, it's all supply chain related.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.\nAndrewShlosh: Hey, good morning, guys. It's Andrew Shlosh on for Jeff. How are you? Sorry about that. I was on mute. So just Firstly, you said Vertafore was strong in the quarter and really good bookings there. Are you able to quantify the growth on a sales basis?\nRobCrisci: Yes, it's right on track with the numbers that we laid out last year, when we acquired the business; they're doing very, very well.\nNeilHunn: Yes. And it's, at the time of the acquisition, we said it was a mid single digit organic grower. And it's, that's where it is.\nAndrewShlosh: Awesome. No, that's great color. And the other thing I was kind of thinking about, so measurement and analytical solutions was up 9%, organic, 20%, organic, excluding Verathon, we talked a little bit about the growth there and I know revenues significantly above 2019 levels, how do we think about the growth going into 2022?\nRobCrisci: Yes, we will guide 2022 in beginning January, February, when we announced earnings, so I think the trends are very, very good. And all those businesses, we talked about the movement at Verathon to these, to the equipment that has been critical to the COVID fight, and now it's become more common. And so that leads to consumables. And so I think it's a great long-term growth story at Verathon, all those businesses. But we'll wait till next year to give you the numbers on that.\nNeilHunn: The one thing I'd add that is we're going to carry a very high backlog going into next year, there's momentum and demand, we'll see to the extent that it's going to be, we expected to carry through for the full year, but it'll certainly start strong.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexander Blanton from Clear Harbor Asset Management.\nAlexBlanton: Hi, good morning. Yes, very interesting quarter. I wanted to ask about the organic growth, it was 12% average and 10% for application, 17% for network, 13% -- 9% for measurement. 16% for process, these are numbers that are way above historical rates of organic growth for this company. And it's really stunning. And one comment that I had from our group this morning was, well, last year was depressed. So that really won't continue. Could you comment on that how much of that growth is just due to a depressed base, if any, and do you expect these kinds of things to continue this organic growth rates.\nRobCrisci: Yes, so these businesses when we acquire them, I think we're pretty consistent. They're mid single digit organic growth businesses, sometimes they're high; we work hard to get them from mid to high. I think if you look at the double digit, certainly last year was down low single digits, and now we're up double digits. And so if you take the sort of the two year run rate, you're in that mid to high single digit organic, which I think is the natural run rate for those businesses, which we're always looking to accelerate.\nAlexBlanton: Yes, well, mid to high single digit is somewhat above what Roper did for many, many years, which was more like the mid single digits, not the high. So there is a -- there was a pickup.\nNeilHunn: Yes, Alex, it's the, yes, it's Neil. I mean, I would say a couple things there. I mean, we certainly, we're going to carry momentum from this year into next year, so if you just look across the portfolio, I think next year, we haven't done the guidance yet, it'll probably be a little bit better than trend, trend sort of mid single digits over a long arc of time, next year might be a touch better than that. We'll see we do our guidance next year. But what we're trying to do from our -- for three years now, as CEO, we've been trying to increase the organic growth rate of this business of the portfolio, through a very structured, process oriented way that focus on strategy, the execution of strategy and really building world class teams and team effectiveness. And we're starting to see that sort of work in pockets of organization that's a bit more mature. So the final story chapter hasn't been written on that story for us yet. It's got another several years to play out, but certainly encouraged by the early signs.\nAlexBlanton: Yes. Second question is on the outlook for acquisitions. You mentioned a very robust pipeline in the new release and your earnings release, which was unusual, you don't usually comment on the pipeline and that location. But could give us a little more color on that, what kind of timing can we look forward to be super acquisitions right away in the next year, or it's going to be later on and so forth. \nNeilHunn: So I'll give you a very generic answer on the timing, which is, it's the pipeline always has a lot of deals in it, the pipe, we are able to because of our approach, filter that pipeline, where it's high quality, and we are spending our time on sort of high impact things. But the deal business, you can have a deal where you think you're the winner until you're not at the finish line. And so, the timing is always a little bit subject to a handshake, if you will, between the buyer and the seller. It's not just a one way thing. And so we're going to be very patient and very disciplined. And we don't feel any sense of urgency to get this $5 billion deploy just for the sake of getting it deployed, we're going to do it in the way we've done for the last 20 years. And so it's hard to handicap the specific timing of when anything would happen, but we're going to be busy at work trying to get it done.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason from Baird.\nRobMason: Yes, good morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to speak on the software businesses a minute; the growth was very good to see across both application software networks. And Neil sprinkled throughout your commentary was frequently the strength around SaaS bookings. And I know you have several businesses where you have SaaS conversions underway. So just given the overall strength that typically you start to, there's a little bit of headwind, as you're converting some of those on-prem businesses over to subscription. I'm just curious what that -- what is that headwind and buried in the growth that you're putting up?\nNeilHunn: Appreciate, Rob, the opportunity to talk about this, just to level set, everybody that the vast majority of the revenue on the network side of our business is already in the cloud and/or recurring, it's 90 plus percent. So the vast, vast majority of the cloud conversions, Rob, what you're talking about, shows up in our application software segment, and is centered at Deltek, Aderant, PowerPlan, little bit at Seaport. As you mentioned, when you convert, the punch line of all this is that we convert we believe it's a modest net growth driver not a headwind. The reason it's a growth driver is you have two competing factors. One is the bad guy, you referring to the J curve. When you instead of selling a perpetual deal, you sell a recurring revenue deal in the year of that deal. That's a bad guy, right? Because instead of getting 100% of revenue, when you ship the perpetual license, you get some small percentage of that depending on what month the subscriptions booked.  However, what counters that are when you have these large installed base of customers that are paying annual maintenance on their historical perpetual, we're actively lifting and shifting those customers to the cloud. And when you do that, because what you're doing for them carries more value, right? You're on the current release, you're managing the infrastructure, managing cyber security, you're managing your -- there's a greater value proposition, you're able to charge a higher recurring revenue base. And so the uplift on the recurring overwhelms the negative headwind on that upfront sale, and that becomes a modest net growth driver for us. Happy to talk about that offline in more detail, if you'd like.\nRobMason: And is there a timeframe that you're thinking about where these conversions, largely complete themselves for the existing businesses.\nNeilHunn: It's going to be -- it's elongated. In our case companies are, can make a decision, they can either, like some companies do just force it, like we're taking you to the cloud this year. And it becomes the company's perspective. In our case, we're allowing our customers to pace that. So our customers are the ones who are saying I'm ready to go to cloud and when we're going to meet them where they are. So in that case, it's going to be an elongated period of time, certainly five plus years, it might be as long as 10. So it's going to be a slow throttle to get fully cloud enabled.\nRobMason: How do you think about balancing, I guess, internal investment into support both sides of that?\nNeilHunn: Yes. So it's the way that the architecture of as our companies have become more cloud enabled the architecture allows them with a service orientation, to make investment, one investment and deploy it to both platforms. So it's not really an either or it's an and.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.\nSteveTusa: Hey, guys, good morning. Yes. On the organic, you guys didn't provide an update to the 7% plus, I know like there's some noise around disc ops and continued ops what is that number now for the year, I mean, I can kind of add up all the segments, but again, there's a lot of noise in the numbers, just, moving stuff around. So just an update to that 7% plus now on the continuing ops, for the year, total count?\nRobCrisci: Yes. I think on a continuing ops basis for the year is the eighth on an apples-to-apples basis, the seven is unchanged.\nSteveTusa: Okay, got it. So then why next year, if you kind of have some supply constraints and stuff, kind of pushing revenue in the next year, and this ridiculously strong backlog? Why would that slow next year? I mean is there any particular reason why that would slow?\nRobCrisci: I mean I think we'll guide next year in January and after we do all of our business reviews, but I don't see a reason why there should be a challenge.\nSteveTusa: Okay and then just one last one just on margins. What do you expect kind of this year for these continuing ops, kind of roughly EBITDA margin range and then in particular for MAS total company and then MAS EBITDA margins just for baseline for next year?\nRobCrisci: So I think the total company margins are we sort of just gave you Q3, Q4, similar and like I said, we'll guide next year, after we do all of our reviews.\nSteveTusa: Okay, and then MAS, any comments there?\nRobCrisci: You mean application software?\nSteveTusa: Yes. The MAS margin just where you're going to end up for the year in the fourth quarter?\nRobCrisci: Yes, I mean, I think generally similar to the third quarter.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're looking forward to sharing with you the details of our solid quarter performance, as well as summarizing the acceleration of our portfolio transformation. As we look at the sequence of our call this morning, we'll start with our quarterly highlights and our recent divestiture activity. I'll then turn the call over to Rob who will share the details of our financial performance and our bridge to continued operations. I'll then walk everyone through our segment by segment performance and our outlook for the balance of the year. As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk to you all of your questions towards the end. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, this was another quarter of solid operational and excellent financial performance. On a continuing ops basis, we grew revenue, EBITDA and DEPS north of 20% in the quarter. It is important to highlight and characterize the underlying strength of these results. Revenue on an organic basis grew 12% in the quarter. End market and customer demand was very strong across our portfolio within both our software and product businesses. Importantly, our software segments were strong operationally with 10% growth in one segment and 17% in the other. Our software businesses recurring revenue grew low double digits in the quarter, highlighting the underlying strength, stability and increasing quality of a revenue base. To remind everyone, about 80% of our software revenues are recurring in nature. It's also worth noting that our 2020 acquisition cohort, led by Vertafore, continues to perform very well. As it relates to our product businesses, like most other companies we, are experiencing supply chain and logistical challenges. But the businesses nevertheless performed very well during the third quarter. As mentioned, customer demand was very strong throughout the quarter and backlogs are up over 50% versus last year. Given this strong operational performance, we continued our disciplines deleveraging of our balance sheet with net debt at 3.5x trailing EBITDA. Also, we are improving the outlook for the year, which we'll detail later in the call. Earlier this morning, we announced two new additions to our Board of Directors, Irene Esteves and Tom Joyce. The addition of Irene and Tom to our Board is part of our long-term board refreshment process. Both are tremendous additions to our board. Finally, we've been active over the last few months working to accelerate the transformation of our portfolio through the announced divestiture of three businesses. Let's turn to the next slide Page 6 to walk through those details and highlights. Next slide please. During the last several weeks, we entered into definitive agreements to divest three of our businesses: TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy, the last of which we announced this morning. We agreed to divest TransCore to ST Engineering for $2.68 billion. In our view, this is the right time and the right buyer for TransCore, given their forward strategy and growth outlook. Taken together, we're divesting these three businesses for $3.15 billion, or about 20x this year's EBITDA. Following the completion of these deals, Roper will be improved. We will have a higher quality portfolio characterized by having higher proportions of recurring revenue, a higher organic growth profile, and be significantly more asset light. Finally, we are and will be very active in deploying these after-tax proceeds. Together with our internally generated cash flow, we will have about $5 billion of available M&A firepower to deploy between now and the end of 2022, none of which is included in our current financial outlook. Our enterprise will be even further enhanced once we complete this activity. Before I turn it over to Rob, I wanted to take a moment and highlight Roper's ability to govern, build and approve businesses over the long term. As part of these transactions, we are retaining our DAT and Loadlink network software businesses, which are purchased together with TransCore in 2004, and we are retaining our CIVCO Medical Solutions business. Given we do not usually get clean book-ins to transaction activity, this provides a unique opportunity to talk about the business building that occurs within Roper. Specifically, just after the acquisition of TransCore, we established DAT and Loadlink as standalone businesses with independent strategies and management teams who operated within Roper's governance and incentive system. Over the course of the last 15 years, these businesses have consolidated freight networks, continuously innovated their product solutions, built go-to- market capability and grown revenues high single digits on a compounded organic basis.  Similarly, the retained CIVCO Medical Solutions business has grown high single digits on organic basis over the last 15 years as well. During this period of time, CIVCO Medical Solutions has continually innovated their products solutions, including the recent gel-free ultrasound products, and fundamentally restructured their go-to-market strategy. At Roper, we buy great businesses and provide an environment and incentive system where they get even better over the long arc of time. Now let me turn over to Rob to walk through the details of our financial performance. Thanks Rob. Let's turn to Page 12 and walk through our application software segment. Revenues in this segment were $603 million, up 10% on organic basis. EBITDA margins were 44.4% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for this segment increased approximately 10%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention, continued migration to our fast delivery models, cross-selling activity and new customer adds. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was broad. To highlight a few businesses, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the US federal contractor, architect, engineering, and other services end markets had another good quarter. During the quarter, demand was particularly strong in Enterprise GovCon and construction end markets. Importantly, during the quarter, Deltek also had success at the top end of market with their cloud or SaaS solutions. Vertafore, our agency management cloud software business focused on P&C insurance agencies also had a nice quarter with very strong new bookings and nice expansion activity in some of their largest customers. Aderant, our legal software business continues its momentum and market share gains, as we talked about last quarter; Aderant is gaining momentum for their SaaS solutions this quarter, setting a record for SaaS bookings activity. Consistent with the theme of this segment, PowerPlan was strong as well both in terms of new bookings and adds to their recurring revenue base. It's nice to see PowerPlan's refocus strategies start to pay dividends. As relates to our healthcare IT businesses, Strata, the data innovations and CliniSys were rock solid in the quarter. For Strata, their recurring subscription based software solutions continue to perform well and grow nicely. Strata's integration of EPSi is on track and nearly complete. The customer base continues to demonstrate excitement for this combination. Finally, CliniSys continued to gain market share in the UK lab market, and has been established as one of the four strategic IT partners for the NHS. As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue growth to be similar to that of the third quarter as recurring revenue growth rates are expected to remain strong. A solid quarter here for sure. And with that, let's turn to the next slide. Turning to Page 13. The financial performance for this segment, as well as next two MAS and PT are shown on a continuing ops basis. Revenues in our network segment were $343 million, up 17% on organic basis and EBITDA margins remained very strong at 51.6% in the quarter. The software businesses in this segment are now greater than 90% of the segments revenue. Our NSF software growth was broad based and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 17%. At the business level, our Freight Match businesses both in the US and Canada continue to be solid growers. As reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize and transact the trucking, shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses has been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers with continued strength in the quarter on the carrier side of the network.  In addition, these businesses had improving revenue per customer ARPU, as the value of the network continues to increase with higher levels of network activity. Foundry, our media and entertainment software business which enables the combination of live action and computer generated graphics to be combined into a single frame demonstrated continued recovery and growth in the quarter. Worth pointing out is Foundry's continued commitment to product innovation. And the recent release of their AI enabled news features that allow for more automated workflow steps within the video compositing process. Our businesses that focus in and around the US Long Term Care markets, MHA, SHP and SoftWriters did particularly well in the quarter. iTradeNetwork, our perishable food supply chain, network business had a nice quarter as bookings growth was very strong and demonstrates this followed recovery in their end markets. Finally, we saw growth across the two product businesses within the segment, rf IDEAS and Inovonics Products with particular strength in our healthcare end markets. As we look to the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to see low double digit growth in this segment again on a continuing ops basis. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 14, revenue in our MAS segment was $392 million, up 9% on organic basis. Organic growth in this segment excluding Verathon was again north of 20%. Notably, this is the last quarter for the very difficult Verathon COVID comp and we expect Verathon return to growth in Q4. EBITDA margins for this segment were 32.4% in the quarter; the EBITDA margins in this segment were consistent with our expectations, but lower than prior year due to Verathon's extraordinary prior year quarter, and the cost impacts of certain businesses navigating their supply chain challenges. Again, these results are on a continuing ops basis. Before getting into business specific details across this segment demand can be characterized as being very strong. The demand was across all businesses and across both capital and consumable products. Product backlogs are up over 50% as compared to a year ago. Our businesses, each of which was impacted by supply chain challenges navigated through the quarter. As relates to individual business performance, Verathon coming off unprecedented demand for their intubation family of products a year ago is roughly 40% larger today versus 2019. The momentum within this business continues given the larger install base of intubation capital equipment, which enables recurring considerable pull through volumes. In addition, Verathon is experiencing impressive growth in their Bronchoscope product family and sustained growth across their BladderScan ultrasound franchise. Our other medical product businesses accelerated nicely in the quarter with particular strength at NDI and CIVCO Medical Solutions. Strong demand at Neptune continued in the quarter. Neptune's end markets continue to open up and improve but have not fully recovered, especially in the northeast US and Canada. Demand across our Industrial Businesses was robust as well and performance was strong but somewhat impacted by supply chain challenges. For the fourth quarter, we expect low double digit organic growth for this segment. This is based on continued encouraging market conditions both in medical and industrial markets and easing prior year comp for Verathon. Now let's turn to our final segment Process Tech. As we turn to Page 15, revenues in our Process Tech segment were $124 million, up 16% on organic basis, EBITDA margins were 31.6% in the quarter. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment and strong demand. Both orders and backlog were up approximately 50% in the quarter versus a year ago. Recovery in our upstream oil and gas business is accelerated in the quarter. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions but also based on Cornell's product innovation, as they're seeing very nice demand pick up for their IoT connected pumping solutions. Similar to that of our MAS Industrial businesses, the businesses in this segment are being impacted by supply chain challenges but continue to navigate through these issues. As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect high teen organic growth based on improving market conditions. Now please turn to Page 17, where I'll highlight our increased outlook for 2021. Based on strong year-to-date performance and expected continued momentum, we're establishing full year 2021 guidance on continuing ops basis of $14.08 to $14.12. As you read down this table, you will note that the full year DEPS impact for the businesses being divested is $1.18. If you combine this with our newly established continuing ops guidance, you will note we are raising our full year outlook on apples-to- apples basis by $0.26 in the low end and $0.10 on the high end. As relates to the fourth quarter, we're establishing again on continuing ops basis guidance in the range of $3.62 and $3.66. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. As we turn to Page 18 and our closing summary, our third quarter was a solid quarter from both an operational and financial perspective. Simultaneously, we undertook significant work to further the transformation of our business portfolio. Revenue, EBITDA and DEPS grew 20% plus, organic revenue was up 12%. Across our enterprise, end market and customer demand was strong in terms of software, product capital items and consumables. Throughout the quarter, our product businesses navigated through the market based supply chain challenges. Given all of this, we're able to increase on an apples-to-apples basis our outlook for the full year. We also continue to deleverage our balance sheet by $1.8 billion since the 2020 acquisitions with net leverage now coming in at 3.5x trailing EBITDA. As relates to the strategic governance of our enterprise, we're excited to be announcing the addition of Irene and Tom as new members of our Board of Directors. As part of our long-term board refreshment strategy, these two new directors will complement our existing directors, and help enable Roper to continue our track record of long-term cash flow compounding. Over the last decade, we have worked to enhance the quality of our portfolio. To this end, recently, we took actions to meaningfully improve the quality of our portfolio by agreeing to divest TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy. Once complete, Roper will be a better version of Roper, will have higher proportions of recurring revenue, higher organic growth prospects, and be significantly more asset light. In addition, we expect to have roughly $5 billion of capital available to deploy between now and the end of 2022. And as it relates to our M&A pipeline, it is and always has been characterized as having many high quality opportunities. So we're clear, we're 100% back on offense when it comes to our capital appointment portion of our strategy, and have fully resumed our usual process oriented and disciplined M&A activities. And with that, let's open up to your questions. Hey, good morning, Deane. Yes. Thanks, Dean. So hey, the - it's all about Roper being a better version of our self, our strategy, as you know and most people listening know, for the last 20 years has been fundamentally based on improving the quality of our enterprise, historically, that's been characterized as being more asset light or recently, it's not just that, but increasing mix towards recurring revenue, increasing mix towards higher and slightly higher organic growth businesses. So that strategy has been in place and will remain in place, nothing's changed there relative to these three transactions is really a result, these three are result of really two different decisions. Zetec was really an opportunistic situation with a strategic buyer, who offered a compelling price. And it was just made sense, in our view, for our shareholders to let that go to that buyer and reduce a little bit of cyclicality and exposure to the Zetec end markets. As it relates to CIVCO Radiotherapy and TransCore, those were -- while they're independent decisions, the result of a single process, which was our sort of our new and revised sort of deep strategic review of all the businesses, we do this with each business on a rolling sort of three-year basis. The CIVCO Radiotherapy and TransCore reviews were late last year, early this year, and we just felt, given their future growth prospects, which are interesting and likely robust, but also capital intensive. In both cases, we're going to just be a sub optimized with us as an owner, you overlay that where the valuations will get for the businesses, the three together roughly 20x this year just made sense from all vectors for us. Yes, I think the, again, it's, I wouldn't -- I would call it the acceleration of the transformation. Transformation has been slow and evolutionary over 20 years, as we've gone from 40% cyclical to now, 10% or 15% cyclical, going from more asset intensive, less asset intensive gone from products to software. I mean, this has been an evolutionary approach, and we expect that to continue. Yes, appreciate the opportunity, any opportunity to talk about our board because it is absolutely and undeniably a strategic asset for our business. The board, we highly engaged with five times a year, three days each time. So it's a board that works hard. They enjoy working hard, it's a board and that amount of time that we spend, it's not just a series of presentations where there is space to have conversation, deliberation, challenge one another, and then form a point of view on the forward direction of our enterprise, highly collaborative group, but one where people express their points of view open and freely. So it's a great environment. Also in governance, there's a refreshment process that goes with that, the Board Chair that became the Board Chair at Brian's passing, Will Prezzano just aged off the board. And we have a sort of that requirement to refresh the Board and we're super fortunate to have Irene and Tom join us. Irene will bring just a tremendous - she's most recently professionally as a executive at Time Warner, but a long track record in financial institutions just a very astute and financially savvy executive understands risk and risk management and also a very experienced Board member at this stage in her career. Tom, this will be his first public, outside public company board. Everybody here listening knows Tom very well, but just the combination of what he's done in his 30-year career at Danaher, combination of business building and capital deployment leader development is core to what we are all about. And I think both will just bring tremendous new thoughts to our boardroom as we continue to evolve and build our business. Hey, Allison. Yes, cash return for us is our North Star, right? It is how we not just -- it just not only guides our capital deployment strategy, it guides every operational decision in the business. It defines for us, for instance, what good organic growth is versus just growth at any cost, right? It's how you do - in CRA for those that aren't intimate with it is really just a measure of business quality. Do you have a cash flow relationship with your customer, if you will, we're able to provide value, capture value for that and have an underlying business model that doesn't require a lot of assets to deliver that value. That's what cash return is, it is our North Star, will continue to be our North Star. It's just -- it's core to our culture here. Allison, in terms of your question about the number of targets, it mathematically yes, it's the number of targets are fewer as we're looking to buy companies that are have CRA that are higher than our existing, but it's not a limiter to our strategy, right? There's a vast ocean of software, informatics data-enabled business models that are out there that we've been fishing in for the last 10 years. And it's not a practical constraint for our capital deployment strategy. Hey, I'll start and I'll pass over to Rob. And so first, I would say, our businesses more broadly, like most businesses, maybe around the world, certainly as country over the last 20 years have built their supply chain for optimize on the lowest cost and less so on resiliency, a nice thing that our businesses did, starting a couple years ago, is build some resiliency with the China sort of tariff situation. So that was a precursor that helped us a bit for us relative to the headwinds, yes, it was growth was limited a bit, certainly across all of our product businesses. And then also the choice that our businesses made when there's an opportunity to either expedite apart or go into a spot market or an alternative source for a part and pay incrementally bit more, they did that. And so there's a little bit of gross margin headwind, hard to notice, in a macro sense, but a little bit of headwind on GP percentage, and then certainly some impact on the revenue side. Rob, if you want to add something? Yes, appreciate the question. Certainly valuations for higher quality software businesses are high. They've been high for a while they remain high. It's, I think I said a couple quarters ago it feels like this. They may be stabilizing at a level I think that still may be the case. But that level is very high. That said Roper buys businesses that are tried and true. The competitive forces and market are observable, the market growth is concerned -- is observable, the forward growth outlook is diligence able and understandable and the growth drivers can be clearly modeled. When you get those businesses that are in small markets that are leaders that have mid to high single digit organic growth and are 30% to 40% plus EBITDA margin businesses, those trade in that we call it circa 20x maybe 18x, maybe 22x. But they're sort of in that zone. And that's where we think that will continue to play and focus. Yes, so appreciate the question. So first, we said it in the prepared remarks, it's on the slides is worth mentioning, we take the proceeds from these through transactions added to our cash flow we're generating in our current balance sheet leverage, there's about $5 billion of M&A firepower between now and the end of next year. So that's all good, the balance sheets in good shape, or as we mentioned we are super active in the M&A markets. But we always have been and always will be patient and disciplines, right? I mean, this is every deal matters; we're buying these businesses with the very long term in mind to never sell them. So you have to buy the very best asset you can find. And sometimes that takes time. So I'm not, we're sort of putting out this mathematical marker of $5 billion, but I would not associate any specific timeframe with that. It's just, we're patient, discipline focused, but active in the M&A markets. So it was the backlog was up over 50% in both MAS and Patterson. I'll certainly turn over to Rob here in second but the backlog was strong at medical products, Verathon Northern MMI. It was strong at Neptune and it was strong at industrial so -- Yes, so I'll give you a little bit of color and turn over to Rob. So it's for Neptune this year will be like really close to '19. Just from a size perspective that absolutely is growing this year, in the very short term, we're actually we believe it's hard to measure in the very short term but the reports from the company Neptune as we picked up a little bit of market share this quarter because we are able to deliver product on a much shorter lead time than some of the people we compete with. The thing that's about the market itself, the markets are opening, but nowhere close to fully recovered, especially in Canada and less so but certainly not open in the Northeast United States in the US Northeast. Final thing I'd say about Neptune is the strategy here is, I mean, it's very clear, and it appears to be working, if you will, having traction around the strategy on the product with the static meter product that were introduced to the market, the way we read the data off the meter. And importantly, now the software and analytics that play that Neptune is developing, right? What do you do with all that data once you capture it off the meter in a more frequent basis? So it's the strategy is certainly got traction in the marketplace, and the business is growing, and they have record levels of backlog as we sit here at the end of the quarter. It's virtually all in house. I mean, certainly there's -- it's a supply chain, and there are certain pieces that come but between the two facilities at Neptune it's a vertically integrated business. No, 100% supply chain related across all the businesses and incrementally the markets more favorable. We talked about the backlogs but the obviously you know that the US rack markets more favorable energy prices more favorable the project work at CCC is going well. So yes, it's all supply chain related. Yes. And it's, at the time of the acquisition, we said it was a mid single digit organic grower. And it's, that's where it is. The one thing I'd add that is we're going to carry a very high backlog going into next year, there's momentum and demand, we'll see to the extent that it's going to be, we expected to carry through for the full year, but it'll certainly start strong. Yes, Alex, it's the, yes, it's Neil. I mean, I would say a couple things there. I mean, we certainly, we're going to carry momentum from this year into next year, so if you just look across the portfolio, I think next year, we haven't done the guidance yet, it'll probably be a little bit better than trend, trend sort of mid single digits over a long arc of time, next year might be a touch better than that. We'll see we do our guidance next year. But what we're trying to do from our -- for three years now, as CEO, we've been trying to increase the organic growth rate of this business of the portfolio, through a very structured, process oriented way that focus on strategy, the execution of strategy and really building world class teams and team effectiveness. And we're starting to see that sort of work in pockets of organization that's a bit more mature. So the final story chapter hasn't been written on that story for us yet. It's got another several years to play out, but certainly encouraged by the early signs. So I'll give you a very generic answer on the timing, which is, it's the pipeline always has a lot of deals in it, the pipe, we are able to because of our approach, filter that pipeline, where it's high quality, and we are spending our time on sort of high impact things. But the deal business, you can have a deal where you think you're the winner until you're not at the finish line. And so, the timing is always a little bit subject to a handshake, if you will, between the buyer and the seller. It's not just a one way thing. And so we're going to be very patient and very disciplined. And we don't feel any sense of urgency to get this $5 billion deploy just for the sake of getting it deployed, we're going to do it in the way we've done for the last 20 years. And so it's hard to handicap the specific timing of when anything would happen, but we're going to be busy at work trying to get it done. Appreciate, Rob, the opportunity to talk about this, just to level set, everybody that the vast majority of the revenue on the network side of our business is already in the cloud and/or recurring, it's 90 plus percent. So the vast, vast majority of the cloud conversions, Rob, what you're talking about, shows up in our application software segment, and is centered at Deltek, Aderant, PowerPlan, little bit at Seaport. As you mentioned, when you convert, the punch line of all this is that we convert we believe it's a modest net growth driver not a headwind. The reason it's a growth driver is you have two competing factors. One is the bad guy, you referring to the J curve. When you instead of selling a perpetual deal, you sell a recurring revenue deal in the year of that deal. That's a bad guy, right? Because instead of getting 100% of revenue, when you ship the perpetual license, you get some small percentage of that depending on what month the subscriptions booked.  However, what counters that are when you have these large installed base of customers that are paying annual maintenance on their historical perpetual, we're actively lifting and shifting those customers to the cloud. And when you do that, because what you're doing for them carries more value, right? You're on the current release, you're managing the infrastructure, managing cyber security, you're managing your -- there's a greater value proposition, you're able to charge a higher recurring revenue base. And so the uplift on the recurring overwhelms the negative headwind on that upfront sale, and that becomes a modest net growth driver for us. Happy to talk about that offline in more detail, if you'd like. It's going to be -- it's elongated. In our case companies are, can make a decision, they can either, like some companies do just force it, like we're taking you to the cloud this year. And it becomes the company's perspective. In our case, we're allowing our customers to pace that. So our customers are the ones who are saying I'm ready to go to cloud and when we're going to meet them where they are. So in that case, it's going to be an elongated period of time, certainly five plus years, it might be as long as 10. So it's going to be a slow throttle to get fully cloud enabled. Yes. So it's the way that the architecture of as our companies have become more cloud enabled the architecture allows them with a service orientation, to make investment, one investment and deploy it to both platforms. So it's not really an either or it's an and."

On this page, we will review some Q3 financial metrics on a basis that includes the discontinued operations in order to compare our Q3 results to our previous guidance on an apples-to-apples basis, including the businesses now classified as discontinued operations, we generated $1.621 billion of revenue and $602 million of EBITDA. Total DEPS was $3.91, which exceeded our Q3 DEPS guidance of $3.80 to $3.84. Free cash flow for the quarter was $431 million, down 2% versus prior year; year-to-date free cash flow is now up 29% through three quarters. Now turning to Page 8. Here we'll review some of the key income statement metrics on a continuing operations basis. Revenue increased 22% to $1.463 billion. Q2 organic revenue increased 12% with strong growth across all four reporting segments led by 17% organic growth in our Network Software segment. EBITDA increased 21% to $558 million, net earnings grew 24% to $384 million, and DEPS also grew 24% to $3.60. Next slide. Turning to Page 9. This slide will update you on the latest installment in our successful deleveraging story. Year-to-date, we have reduced our net debt by nearly $1.3 billion and our total debt reduction is now $1.8 billion since completing the last of the 2020 acquisitions approximately one year ago. We continue to benefit from our excellent cash conversion as nearly $2.3 billion of total EBITDA we generated over the last four quarters has converted to $1.94 billion of free cash flow, representing EBITDA to free cash flow conversion of 85%. At the end of September, our net debt to EBITDA has decreased to 3.5. We are on track to be near 3x by the end of 2021 and therefore, well positioned to return to capital deployment even before accounting for the divestitures. The proceeds from the divestitures further amplify our capacity with $5 billion-plus available for deployment through 2022, as Neil highlighted earlier. Next slide. Moving now to Page 10. A quick look here at how the divestitures meaningfully improve our working capital position moving forward. This page repeat the working capital numbers we showed last October and adds a Q3 '21 column that shows the enterprise including the removal of the three businesses being divested, we are now at negative 12% net working capital to revenue compared to negative 6% in the same quarter last year, and negative 3% back in Q3 2019. Divesting TransCore reduces our net working capital by approximately $200 million with the majority coming out of our unbilled receivables balance. This structurally lower net working capital positions us very well for continued high cash conversion moving forward. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to cover the segments. Good morning, Deane. Yes, I just, about 25% of that MAS segment are the industrial businesses. And so that's where you see some of this and, I think we mentioned earlier that backlog is up 50% so that, we're -- we have great orders, and that bodes well for the future. But yes, I think what Neil said they're spot on. Yes, so we're not expecting that they're going to ease really anytime soon. So we're expecting what we saw in the third quarter similar to what we'll see in the fourth quarter and then as we get in next year, we'll update that next quarter, but we're continuing to build backlog, the customer relationships are great as Neil said we're expediting wherever we can to get products to customers. And so I think long term it's a great story; short term, it's hard to say what's going to happen. And I would say we do have flexibility in terms of the timing on when that capital is deployed. I think you have to wait, for the proceeds to come in the door. But as Neil said, we're going to be very, very disciplined and we don't feel like we're rushing anyway. Yes, it's very broad based. It really is across all the businesses, and again, that's getting a lot of orders in and then being able to get the products out the door. Yes, I think we want to wait until we get the deals closed to comment on that. I mean, there certainly will be some tax leakage. But we'd rather wait till next year, we get the deals closed and then we can give you a good number. You can ask. We're under contract to not disclose a lot of details about that going forward. Yes, it's right on track with the numbers that we laid out last year, when we acquired the business; they're doing very, very well. Yes, we will guide 2022 in beginning January, February, when we announced earnings, so I think the trends are very, very good. And all those businesses, we talked about the movement at Verathon to these, to the equipment that has been critical to the COVID fight, and now it's become more common. And so that leads to consumables. And so I think it's a great long-term growth story at Verathon, all those businesses. But we'll wait till next year to give you the numbers on that. Yes, so these businesses when we acquire them, I think we're pretty consistent. They're mid single digit organic growth businesses, sometimes they're high; we work hard to get them from mid to high. I think if you look at the double digit, certainly last year was down low single digits, and now we're up double digits. And so if you take the sort of the two year run rate, you're in that mid to high single digit organic, which I think is the natural run rate for those businesses, which we're always looking to accelerate. Yes. I think on a continuing ops basis for the year is the eighth on an apples-to-apples basis, the seven is unchanged. I mean I think we'll guide next year in January and after we do all of our business reviews, but I don't see a reason why there should be a challenge. So I think the total company margins are we sort of just gave you Q3, Q4, similar and like I said, we'll guide next year, after we do all of our reviews. You mean application software? Yes, I mean, I think generally similar to the third quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies conference call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense. And now if you please turn to Slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This morning, I'll provide the highlights, of which there were several for the quarter. Rob will then discuss our P&L performance and balance sheet metrics and then turn it back to me to review our segment details, our increased outlook for the year and our concluding comments. As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk through all your questions towards the end. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, we delivered an excellent second quarter with strength across all four of our segments. Specific to the financial metrics, which Rob will detail shortly, revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow all grew north of 20% in the quarter. Also during the quarter, we are encouraged to see the post-pandemic recovery gain momentum and broaden at the same time. Specifically, not only did we experience continued improvement across virtually all of our businesses, the strength within each business was broad. Our software businesses, which now make up over 55% of our revenue base, performed very well in the quarter. Specifically, on an organic basis, we grew our Application Software segment 9% and grew our software businesses within our NSS segment 10%. Across our software businesses, we saw the acceleration of our recurring revenue growth, approximately 80% of our software revenues, from mid singles to high singles and a solid recovery of perpetual license activity. Relative to our product businesses, a very similar pattern: acceleration and recovery of our consumables revenue sources and very nice ordering patterns for our capital equipment-type products. In addition, our 2020 acquisition cohort led by Vertafore is performing very well. Importantly and consistent with our guidance over the last three quarters, we continue to delever our balance sheet at a rapid pace, now under 4x debt to EBITDA. And finally, before handing things over to Rob, just a great first half to the year. Our teams have performed magnificently, thanks to each and every team member at Roper. Given the great start and the positive momentum across our enterprise, we are once again increasing our full year guidance. Rob, let me hand it over to you.\nRob Crisci : Hey, thanks, Neil, and congrats again on the Lightning winning the Stanley Cup. Turning to Page 6, looking at some of the key financial highlights for Q2. Total revenue increased 22% to $1.59 billion, another record for any Roper quarter. Q2 organic revenue growth was 7% versus last year's comp of minus 3%. All four segments performed well, with strong organic growth across our portfolio of software and product businesses. Q2 EBITDA grew 26% to $579 million, and EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points to 36.4%. Adjusted DEPS was $3.76, 28% above prior year and also above our Q2 guidance range of $3.61 to $3.65. Free cash flow was $409 million, up a very strong 30% versus last year. As a reminder, last year, we adjusted our Q2 cash flow to account for the income tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to 2020 delayed tax deadlines. Net working capital was negative 8%. We continue to benefit from Roper's transformation to a high recurring revenue, majority software business model that is structurally designed to consistently drive high cash conversion. Lastly, we have been laser-focused on debt reduction this year after last year's record capital deployment, and we continue to make great progress on that front with an additional $375 million paid down in Q2. So in summary, an excellent second quarter, wrapping up a very strong first half for Roper. Next slide. Turning to Page 7, an update to the charge we introduced last quarter showing our rapid deleveraging. Through the first half of 2021, we have now reduced our net debt by nearly $900 million, raising the total debt reduction to approximately $1.4 billion since completing the 2020 acquisition late last year. Our debt reduction, along with the meaningful contributions from our 2020 acquisitions, has enabled us to rapidly lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, from 4.7 to 3.8 in only six months. We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward, which positions us well for a return to meaningful capital deployment in the coming quarters. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to discuss our segment performance.\nNeil Hunn : Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 9 and walk through our Application Software segment. Revenues in this segment were $592 million, up 9% on an organic basis. As a reminder, this segment grew 1% organically last year, aided by strong results from our lab software franchises that were critical to the COVID response. EBITDA margins were 43.7% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for the segment increased approximately 9%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, new product cross-selling activity and new customer adds. To that end, the non-recurring organic revenue in this segment grew 9% as well. Specific to business unit performance, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the U.S. federal contractor, architect, engineering and other services end market had an excellent quarter. Their strength was rooted in large-scale GovCon customer wins and expansion activity. Deltek was further benefited by the recovery in the professional services end market. Terrific job by Mike and the entire team at Deltek. Aderant, our legal software business, continues its momentum and market share gains. In addition, and encouragingly, their customers are beginning the journey of migrating to Aderant's cloud solutions. This will take many years for the entire customer base to migrate, but will result in increased customer intimacy and higher levels of recurring revenue. CliniSys and Data Innovations continued their long string of market share gains in the quarter. And CBORD grew based on strength in healthcare and, in particular, their higher education product offerings. Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well, both at Vertafore and EPSi. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment based on strength in both our recurring and non-recurring revenue streams, a solid quarter here for sure. And with that, let's turn to our next slide. Turning to Page 10. Revenues in our Network segment were $459 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 42.5% in the quarter. Our software businesses in this segment, about 65% of the revenues were up 10% on an organic basis. This growth was broad-based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 11%. At the business level, our Freight Match businesses, both in the U.S. and Canada, continue to be solid growers. As a reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize, interact and transact the trucking, shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses have been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers, but with particular strength in this quarter on the carrier side of the network. We also continue to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect as our network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner. Foundry, our media and entertainment software business, which enables the combination of live action and computer-generated graphics to be combined into a single frame, recovered nicely in the quarter with particular strength in the mid-market. Importantly, we continue to see very strong customer retention levels across each and every one of our network software businesses. The strong growth in our software businesses was partially offset by project delays in our TransCore New York congestion pricing project. These delays are based on pending federal environmental approvals. While we all believe the federal approval will be granted, the approval process to complete our work is taking longer than originally anticipated. Conversely, TransCore tag demand appears to be normalizing for the balance of the year. As we look to our second half outlook, we expect to see high single-digit growth in this segment: the growth to be underpinned by strength in our network software businesses, which we expect to grow in the low double-digit range in the second half of the year. Based on the New York TransCore project pushing to the right, we now expect about $40 million of this project's revenue to push out of the second half of the year and into 2022. All in all, high single-digit organic increases in this segment for the balance of the year. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11, revenues in our MAS segment were $397 million, up 7% on an organic basis. Organic growth in this segment, excluding Verathon, was north of 20%. EBITDA margins for the segment were 33.4% in the quarter. Verathon, coming off unprecedented demand for their intubation family of products a year ago, is roughly 40% larger today versus 2019. The momentum within this business continues given the larger installed base of intubation capital equipment, which enables recurring consumable pull-through volumes. In addition, Verathon continues to experience impressive growth within their bronchoscope product family and the recovery in their BladderScan ultrasound product group. EBITDA margins in the segment were lower due to Verathon's extraordinary prior year quarter and the associated margin benefit. Our other medical product businesses accelerated nicely in the quarter based on hospitals and hospital equipment OEMs resuming normal levels of activity. Demand at Neptune was very strong as well. The Northeast opened up and the balance of the country experienced normalizing levels of activity. Our industrial businesses were strong. As I mentioned in the opening, the strength was buoyed by improving consumables activity and solid returns to capital equipment spending. Our businesses within this segment have done a nice job navigating the difficult supply environment. In supply environments like the one we are in right now, our decentralized, highly nimble organization tends to perform quite well. This quarter was no exception. For the balance of the year, we expect double-digit growth for this segment. This is based on broadly improving conditions both in medical and industrial markets and easing prior year comps for Verathon. Now let's turn to our final segment, process tech. As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our process tech segment were $140 million, up 13% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins improved by over 500 basis points to 32.8% in the quarter. The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after over nearly 2 years of declines. Our upstream oil and gas business has started to recover nicely. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT-connected pumping solutions. And finally at CCC, we're seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and the demand for field services to come back online. Also, greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing, especially on an international basis. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect 20%-plus organic growth based on improving market conditions and continued easing comps. Now please turn to Page 14, and I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. Based on strong first half performance, improvement to our recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $15 and $15.20 per share. Of note, our prior high-end DEPS guidance was $15, now the bottom end of our range. Also, we're increasing our guidance notwithstanding pushing roughly $40 million of the TransCore New York City project into next year, providing everyone a good sense of how strong the balance of our portfolio is performing. Our full year organic growth is expected to be 7% or a touch higher. This full year growth outlook implies low double-digit organic growth in the second half. Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range. For the third quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.80 and $3.84. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Turning to Page 15 and our closing summary. This is a very strong quarter for our enterprise with software revenues growing on an organic basis, 9% in our Application Software segment and 10% for our software businesses in our NSS segment. In addition, the recovery pattern is characterized as gaining momentum and being broad, strength in product and software, strength in recurring and nonrecurring. We performed very well virtually every financial metric, growing 20% plus in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. EBITDA margins expanded by 110 basis points and free cash flow increased 30% to $409 million in the quarter. As promised, we continue to delever our balance sheet, reducing debt by $375 million in the quarter and by $1.4 billion since completing our 2020 acquisitions in Q4 of last year. As we look forward, positive momentum continues to build. Over the last decade, we have worked to improve the quality of our portfolio to be more software based, resulting in enterprise having higher levels of recurring revenue and be increasingly asset-light. In addition to having this improved quality within our business portfolio, we're seeing our recurring revenue growth rates improve from mid singles to high singles. Finally, our businesses will benefit from improving end market conditions. Given each of these: improved portfolio quality, improving recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we expect to see double-digit organic growth in the second half of the year. Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well and solidly contribute to, and improve the quality of, our enterprise. Given all of these factors, we're increasing our outlook for the full year. Finally, while we continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet, we also remain committed to our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high-quality opportunities. As our balance sheet becomes more offensive towards the end of the year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment in our usual process-oriented and disciplined manner. And with that, let's turn to your questions.\nOperator: We will now get into our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.\nRob Crisci: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Maybe we can start on measurement and analytical. The point is there were some soft spots on the margin side. I know you called out supply chain is -- how much of an impact was that higher input costs? And then for Verathon and no really tough comp. And -- but -- and sadly, it looks like this latest COVID surge is going to put this product back in demand for ventilators. So just -- are you ready for that capacity? And just start there, please.\nRob Crisci : Yes, sure. Good morning, Deane. Yes, on margins, really, it's driven by Verathon and just that exceptional quarter last year. And so with the decline this year, a little bit lower. There's certainly some supply chain things going on everywhere like every other company, not really a meaningful impact for us. And I'll let Neil talk about the Verathon question.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. And again, just to echo what Rob said, the margin pressure there is just Verathon was amazing last year and they were deleveraged, as you expected, this year. In terms of the capacity there, the company is perfectly fine. I mean they ramped up last year in a way that was unprecedented. And as we look back and just we're sort of amazed at how that company operation was able to do that. I would also just highlight for Verathon, it was -- the demand there was a little bit driven by ventilators, but a lot a bit by the anesthesiologists and the people who do the intubations wanting to do it at an arm's length away for general surgery as opposed to when you do a direct intubation, you have to visualize the vocal cords right on top of the patient. Our product allows you to do it, if you monitor and be arm's length. And so it's less, the demand, it's less about the ventilators and more about just a better, more effective way to do an intubation, so much so that the total percentage of intubations done now versus 2018 or 2019, using video assistance, we believe, is permanently meaningfully higher. So it should be a long-term tailwind for the business.\nDeane Dray: Great. And then just second question for us is the deleveraging, which has been happening faster. I know the target has been to get to the mid-3x leverage, and it looks like you could be there next quarter. And notably, you talked about back playing offense. Can you talk about the funnel? It's interesting you're using a new data point of just sizing the funnel at $150 billion as oppose to talking about the number of potential assets. So just flesh out what the funnel looks like and the assumption that you could be getting to that mid-3 sooner than originally projected. Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So relative to the leverage of getting there, I mean, we -- essentially, when we did the larger transactions last year, we thought we'd be in strike zone or being back in the M&A business sort of late this year into early next year. And I think we're just on track. And I may be pacing a touch ahead, but cash flow has been amazingly strong in Q4, Q1 and Q2, which has certainly helped. Relative to the pipeline and the characterization of pipeline, it is just -- there's a lot of great things. But for my 10 years here, there's always been a lot of great things at any moment in time to buy. I would remind you and everybody that we do a lot of work well ahead of when assets are actually for sale. And I'll remind you that Vertafore, we met with Amy and the team 18 months before we ultimately bought the company. And so we do a lot of early spade work, understanding the businesses, understanding the management teams and tracking. And that's the activity we've done this year to sort of position us for late this year and into next year deploying capital.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Yes, thanks. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nChristopher Glynn: Curious about Aderant's share gain, that's been going on for some time. Just curious how you see the duration on that dynamic.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I appreciate the question about Aderant, a business that we don't get a chance to talk about very much. And Deane and Chris and Raphael and the whole team there has just done really a remarkable job. I think the success here at Aderant is a combination of a great leadership team in a great market with a great product, but also complemented by our government system that focuses over success -- over a long arc of time. So the share gain from our principal competitor, as you mentioned, has been happening for essentially since we've owned the business. There is just a couple of years of inventory left in terms of those large law firms that have yet to make a decision on their enterprise system between us and our primary competitor, but that's been a known issue for three or four years now that inventory is going to run out in 2023, 2024. And so Aderant goes to work on their product offerings. They go to work on their cloud solutions. We've done a couple of bolt-on acquisitions in that business to where the -- if you will, the divot that existed in 2023 or 2024 relative to the growth rate four or five years ago. Now this no longer exists in any capacity, and we believe Aderant will grow -- easily grow through the divot because of the product portfolio, the cloud migration and really the long-term planning and execution of that team.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. A lot of information there. And just curious if there's any particular second half mix dynamics across the segment we should be mindful of.\nRob Crisci: Not really. I think we laid out each of the segments and what we see for organic for the second half. It's really great results we're expecting. And Q3 and Q4, relatively similar margin dynamics. The leverage, as you know, as the businesses start to grow, especially the industrial and the processing, is always very strong on the rebound. And then the software businesses are always strong no matter where you are in any sort of a cycle. So we feel really good about the second half.\nChristopher Glynn: Sounds good. Thanks, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: The next question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hey, guys, good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nAllison Poliniak: I want to keep on the Application Software segment. I know a pretty strong outlook in the second half in terms of that high single-digit organic growth. But how -- I know both recurring and the non-recurring revenue are starting -- in the non-recurring more specifically is starting to grow. How do we think of those dynamics in the second half, particularly just given, I would think, easier comps at least on the non-recurring side? Any thoughts there?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I think so, Allison. Let me tackle that sort of recurring and non-recurring broadly in Application Software. And if I don't exactly land in your question, then circle back to us on that. So the second half for organic recurring is strong, right? So the dynamic there is that in the middle of COVID, recurring was more, generally speaking, across our enterprise, mid singles, it's ticking up to high singles. The reason for that is twofold. One is that you have more additions, product and customer additions today, both perpetual and SaaS related that drives recurring. But then also, you have our software businesses that were most negatively impacted by COVID now being coming out of the ditch. Think of like in Application Software, think of CBORD for instance. So not only did they have good bookings performance in the quarter, but they saw a bit of a tick up in their transactional revenue stream in Q2. And that will continue even more in Q3 and Q4 as kids get more on campuses and K-12 and higher education.\nAllison Poliniak: No, that's helpful. That's helpful. And kind of a similar dynamic with Measurement & Analytical, businesses like Neptune, you noted some recovery there. Is there a way to kind of say relative to what you would think is normal there in terms of that volume? Are we far off of it? Are we kind of there? Or a little bit above? Just trying a sense of any pent-up demand that's coming out of that.\nNeil Hunn: So in Neptune, we're returning to normal. So I think this -- we believe that 2021 revenue will be equal to ish 2019, maybe a touch higher. So in terms of actual activities, June for Neptune, I believe, was their highest bookings month in the history of the company. The guys are nodding their heads. So the actual current momentum is great. I don't think we expect that to sustain itself for the balance of the year, just get more normalized as the Northeast is open. Canada is not open quite yet, we expect it to come online here in 3Q, in 4Q, but that gives you a sense of what's happening at Neptune.\nRob Crisci : And I'll just add to that, as you talk about MAS, you also have the medical products businesses that aren't Verathon, right, that were impacted negatively throughout COVID. Those are now really rebounding very strongly, and that's just beginning as we're getting to sort of more normalized world in the medical world outside of the Verathon issue.\nAllison Poliniak: Perfect. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Just wanted to circle back firstly on the software businesses. Neil, you talked about, I think, there was obviously the cyclical aspect to an extent of the recurring revenue growth profile improving. Also sounds though like as if there's something more structural going on in driving that. So maybe help us understand what those aspects might be. I know your R&D to sales has gone up substantially in recent years. And also then within application. Just give us some update on Vertafore's performance relative to expectations on accretion and returns.\nNeil Hunn: Okay. So let's take the software recurring question. Other than what I just mentioned about the shorter-term dynamics of mid singles going to high singles on the recurring revenue base, the structural element that's underpinning this is migration to the cloud. So you think we have -- our network businesses are almost all cloud as it speaks today delivered in that manner. The application businesses, you have Deltek, it's on its journey. You have Aderant, it's just starting its journey. You have PowerPlan, it's just starting its journey. At CBORD, it's just starting its journey. And we mentioned many times, it's our customers that are pacing this activity, not us. So this will take 5, 10 years to complete the migration, maybe longer. But as you do that, you're lifting customers that are paying you maintenance and getting them into the cloud are large installed base, and that's accretive, meaningfully accretive to the recurring revenue growth rate. Relative to Vertafore, I appreciate the question. Vertafore is just a rock-solid business. As we mentioned, when we bought it, it's 90-plus percent recurring in terms of its revenue stream. It's on track for -- against our models and our deal -- models and sort of our expectations. Q2 was a touch better than we thought. But all in all, I'll call it on track relative to financial performance. Specific to the company itself, Amy and her team, they've demonstrated a wonderful ability to land new large customers. I think we mentioned in Q4 of last year, maybe Q1, we've won the largest deal in the market since we've owned the company which is encouraging. The customer base really appreciates the steady hand of ownership of Roper as opposed to trading every 3 to 5 years of private equity. And so it's still early, but the early days are certainly positive.\nJulian Mitchell: And then just my follow-up around Measurement & Analytical Solutions. It was touched on a little bit earlier, but the margin, obviously, you had sort of 300 bps of year-on-year pressure in Q2 on that margin line. Just wondered what's baked into the second half guidance on margins year-on-year in that segment. I think last second half, they were sort of 34.5% roughly. Just wondered where you think this second half shakes out in those margins relative to that.\nRob Crisci : Yes. So in our guide, we're assuming a little bit lower than that because you still had Verathon very, very strong in the third quarter and then fourth quarter was more normalized. So we have built in the guidance a little bit down from last year, but better than Q2 from a year-over-year fee standpoint.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. It's principally Verathon we baked in a little supply chain pressure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen.\nJoseph Giordano: So capping like a weird world here, I guess, we continue to be where markets are at high as rates keep pushing lower and everyone kind of scrambling to transact deals with really good balance sheets. So I'm just curious, when you talk about the funnel, have you seen kind of increased pressure in competition just because of the nature of where liquidity is and where rates are?\nNeil Hunn: So we haven't -- while we've been in the market and talking with companies, we haven't been actively bidding on a large number of assets in this interim period as we've been deleveraging. So I can't speak with specificity to deals that we've done. But what I can speak to is what we're observing from other companies and other transactions that are happening. Here in the last quarter, certainly -- I won't time bound it. Since the beginning of the year, valuations for the assets that we looked at actually feel like they pulled back a touch. They've actually gotten a little bit better. Maybe moderate, maybe they're flat, maybe they're a little bit better, but they're certainly not increasing, which seems to be the case really since 2013 or '14. So that maybe that bodes well. But we'll be able to speak more to that as we get more into the market and start bidding on activity here late this year into next year.\nJoseph Giordano: And then just a question on the New York project. This is kind of an initial foray into this type of work for big cities. Do you think that the amount of regulatory problems that this has had makes it less likely that other cities try to explore this? Or is the revenue potential for something like this outweigh that from the point of view of like the city leaders?\nNeil Hunn: Well, first, I'd say I wouldn't characterize this as a regulatory problem. I would characterize it as a regulatory process that has slowed down the project. And so it's not as though people are saying, no, it's just a process that takes time. We all believe, by the way, the federal approval will occur. At the end of the day, it's an environmental approval, and this is about reducing cars and congestion and pollution in New York, right? So it is an environmental-friendly exercise. I think this is just the first in the United States. I think MTA in New York are sort of carving out what this looks like and sort of setting an expectation for the other cities in the U.S. that will eventually follow suit. So no, I don't think it will slow things now. If anything, it might speed it up because I know the road bumps are sort of well understood now.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.\nStephen Tusa: Just a question on Vertafore, the -- and the acquisition contributions at A&S. I think last quarter, it was like 39%. This quarter was 38%. Is there any like revenue volatility at all seasonally at Vertafore? I mean it's only like $10 million or something, but you also have EPSi in there, whatever the smaller one is. And any seasonality to those revenues at all?\nRob Crisci : Steve, there's a ton of seasonality. So Vertafore's Q1 is usually season of the best quarter. But you're right, it's just a few million dollars difference. And then the EPSi acquisition -- or integration with Strata is ongoing. So that's going very, very well. I think there are some customers that are choosing to go with Strata instead of EPSi, which is a wonderful thing as that thing is coming together. And so that, again, could give a couple of million dollars of revenue here and there that ends up in Strata versus EPSi. But overall, both of the deals are on track to our model, as Neil mentioned.\nStephen Tusa: Got it. And then just lastly, could you just remind us of anything seasonally on free cash flow? This year is kind of unusual, or maybe it's not, with the first quarter being strong and the second quarter kind of giving back a little bit sequentially. Anything in the second half moving mechanically that moves around seasonally? How do we think about kind of the sequential for free cash?\nRob Crisci : Sure. Yes. So as you know, the second quarter has 2 federal tax payments. So it's always our lowest conversion quarter. Now as we talked about, there is the benefit from the Vertafore tax attribute which we've -- which helped us in the second quarter against the payroll tax headwind which we talked about last quarter. So if you net those 2 together, probably a $40 million benefit for the second quarter. And then for the second half of the year though, those things really cancel each other out. So there's really no benefit from that for the second half of the year or any sort of a headwind. So as you move forward, Q3 and Q4 conversion should be pretty normal to what we normally see, which is 80% plus when you look at EBITDA to free cash flow.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. Got it. So like is there a number like so $1.9 billion for the year or something like that in cash?\nRob Crisci : Yes. I think 80% EBITDA to free cash flow conversion in the second half is kind of what we're expecting, and you can do the math.\nStephen Tusa: So that was a second half number. Okay. Got it. Awesome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Blanton from Clear Harbor Asset Management.\nAlexander Blanton: Nice quarter, it's great. Could you comment on CBORD, what it looks like for the fall with universities getting back into operation in a more normal way?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So I need to talk about CBORD. They had a great quarter. The bookings activity in the quarter was just fantastic. The vast majority of the bookings activity in the quarter was in higher education. So you see these universities really preparing to ramp up. It's a combination of integrated security platforms and the payments platform. And as you know, we have integration with the iPhone now for access to the campuses. And so they're certainly preparing, and it was just a great bookings quarter on that front for CBORD.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Mason from Baird.\nRobert Mason: Just back to the MTA project real quick. Could you just clarify how that will shake out -- how the revenue will shake out first half, second half? I think we were originally expecting about $100 million for the year. So now maybe that goes to $60 million, but just how that $60 million would break down first half, second half, if you could.\nNeil Hunn: Happy to do it. Rob?\nRob Crisci : Yes. So we had about $35 million in the first half, and we're assuming about 25% in the second half and it's relatively split between Q3 and Q4. And the project continues, it's just sort of everything is slowing down. So we're continuing to work, and that's what -- if they can turn the switch tomorrow and that could speed up, but that's what we're assuming from a modeling standpoint.\nRobert Mason: Okay. And then completion would be assumed -- of the installation would be assumed next year then?\nNeil Hunn: That's the working assumption.\nRobert Mason: Yes. Just a second question. Neil, you had spoken about the freight matching business, DAT, and that continues to be a very dynamic space. And you obviously have a very strong legacy position there. But I'm just curious if you could speak to how you're evolving the product given the way the market is evolving in that space and some of the things you've done or maybe what you're contemplating for future investments around that business.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I appreciate the question. You're right. It's a wonderful business and a wonderful space that enjoys a 3 to 4x relative market share advantage to our principal competitor. So we have tremendous scale advantage in this Freight Match spot market for freight in North America. It is a marketplace. It's a 2-sided network. It's paid by both the carriers and the brokers. There's value on both sides of the equation for sure. The big thing that's happening in the space is the brokers are becoming more tech-enabled, right? So how do you match and connect shipments with fewer and fewer calls and sort of complete automation straight through? A dynamic that's very similar to our business in the life insurance, very similar to Vertafore, conceptually. How do you tech-enable the agencies to do their job? And that's precisely the product road map that DAT is endeavoring, right? So you'll have the high end of folks that are going to do a lot of this on their own. And then you have the very long tail of thousands and thousands brokers that are going to run on our technology to do that. It's part of the reason why the strength is in the market today. It strengthened the business today. It's also what we believe will happen when you can organize the spot market in a more efficient way with less friction cost to match a load, then the spot market will compete very favorably against the contracted market, which is much larger. So we believe there'll be a permanent market share shift into the spot market which will further benefit our business, the brokers, et cetera. So it's -- we're very bullish on this for the long term.\nRobert Mason: Is there the need to stretch back to the shipper, the origination side, for this business?\nNeil Hunn: Well, we -- I mean, we did an acquisition last year that works with the shippers to understand volumes and rates and pricing. And we have an integrated offering now that shares sort of -- that provides pricing between the contracted market and the spot market. So we have an increasing relationship with the shippers. But the brokers provide a high and legitimate value in this value chain, right? So I think there will always be shipper -- principally shipper to broker to carrier relationship, it's just going to be a more automated and seamless relationship.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now turn the call back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This morning, I'll provide the highlights, of which there were several for the quarter. Rob will then discuss our P&L performance and balance sheet metrics and then turn it back to me to review our segment details, our increased outlook for the year and our concluding comments. As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk through all your questions towards the end. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, we delivered an excellent second quarter with strength across all four of our segments. Specific to the financial metrics, which Rob will detail shortly, revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow all grew north of 20% in the quarter. Also during the quarter, we are encouraged to see the post-pandemic recovery gain momentum and broaden at the same time. Specifically, not only did we experience continued improvement across virtually all of our businesses, the strength within each business was broad. Our software businesses, which now make up over 55% of our revenue base, performed very well in the quarter. Specifically, on an organic basis, we grew our Application Software segment 9% and grew our software businesses within our NSS segment 10%. Across our software businesses, we saw the acceleration of our recurring revenue growth, approximately 80% of our software revenues, from mid singles to high singles and a solid recovery of perpetual license activity. Relative to our product businesses, a very similar pattern: acceleration and recovery of our consumables revenue sources and very nice ordering patterns for our capital equipment-type products. In addition, our 2020 acquisition cohort led by Vertafore is performing very well. Importantly and consistent with our guidance over the last three quarters, we continue to delever our balance sheet at a rapid pace, now under 4x debt to EBITDA. And finally, before handing things over to Rob, just a great first half to the year. Our teams have performed magnificently, thanks to each and every team member at Roper. Given the great start and the positive momentum across our enterprise, we are once again increasing our full year guidance. Rob, let me hand it over to you. Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 9 and walk through our Application Software segment. Revenues in this segment were $592 million, up 9% on an organic basis. As a reminder, this segment grew 1% organically last year, aided by strong results from our lab software franchises that were critical to the COVID response. EBITDA margins were 43.7% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for the segment increased approximately 9%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, new product cross-selling activity and new customer adds. To that end, the non-recurring organic revenue in this segment grew 9% as well. Specific to business unit performance, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the U.S. federal contractor, architect, engineering and other services end market had an excellent quarter. Their strength was rooted in large-scale GovCon customer wins and expansion activity. Deltek was further benefited by the recovery in the professional services end market. Terrific job by Mike and the entire team at Deltek. Aderant, our legal software business, continues its momentum and market share gains. In addition, and encouragingly, their customers are beginning the journey of migrating to Aderant's cloud solutions. This will take many years for the entire customer base to migrate, but will result in increased customer intimacy and higher levels of recurring revenue. CliniSys and Data Innovations continued their long string of market share gains in the quarter. And CBORD grew based on strength in healthcare and, in particular, their higher education product offerings. Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well, both at Vertafore and EPSi. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment based on strength in both our recurring and non-recurring revenue streams, a solid quarter here for sure. And with that, let's turn to our next slide. Turning to Page 10. Revenues in our Network segment were $459 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 42.5% in the quarter. Our software businesses in this segment, about 65% of the revenues were up 10% on an organic basis. This growth was broad-based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 11%. At the business level, our Freight Match businesses, both in the U.S. and Canada, continue to be solid growers. As a reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize, interact and transact the trucking, shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses have been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers, but with particular strength in this quarter on the carrier side of the network. We also continue to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect as our network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner. Foundry, our media and entertainment software business, which enables the combination of live action and computer-generated graphics to be combined into a single frame, recovered nicely in the quarter with particular strength in the mid-market. Importantly, we continue to see very strong customer retention levels across each and every one of our network software businesses. The strong growth in our software businesses was partially offset by project delays in our TransCore New York congestion pricing project. These delays are based on pending federal environmental approvals. While we all believe the federal approval will be granted, the approval process to complete our work is taking longer than originally anticipated. Conversely, TransCore tag demand appears to be normalizing for the balance of the year. As we look to our second half outlook, we expect to see high single-digit growth in this segment: the growth to be underpinned by strength in our network software businesses, which we expect to grow in the low double-digit range in the second half of the year. Based on the New York TransCore project pushing to the right, we now expect about $40 million of this project's revenue to push out of the second half of the year and into 2022. All in all, high single-digit organic increases in this segment for the balance of the year. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11, revenues in our MAS segment were $397 million, up 7% on an organic basis. Organic growth in this segment, excluding Verathon, was north of 20%. EBITDA margins for the segment were 33.4% in the quarter. Verathon, coming off unprecedented demand for their intubation family of products a year ago, is roughly 40% larger today versus 2019. The momentum within this business continues given the larger installed base of intubation capital equipment, which enables recurring consumable pull-through volumes. In addition, Verathon continues to experience impressive growth within their bronchoscope product family and the recovery in their BladderScan ultrasound product group. EBITDA margins in the segment were lower due to Verathon's extraordinary prior year quarter and the associated margin benefit. Our other medical product businesses accelerated nicely in the quarter based on hospitals and hospital equipment OEMs resuming normal levels of activity. Demand at Neptune was very strong as well. The Northeast opened up and the balance of the country experienced normalizing levels of activity. Our industrial businesses were strong. As I mentioned in the opening, the strength was buoyed by improving consumables activity and solid returns to capital equipment spending. Our businesses within this segment have done a nice job navigating the difficult supply environment. In supply environments like the one we are in right now, our decentralized, highly nimble organization tends to perform quite well. This quarter was no exception. For the balance of the year, we expect double-digit growth for this segment. This is based on broadly improving conditions both in medical and industrial markets and easing prior year comps for Verathon. Now let's turn to our final segment, process tech. As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our process tech segment were $140 million, up 13% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins improved by over 500 basis points to 32.8% in the quarter. The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after over nearly 2 years of declines. Our upstream oil and gas business has started to recover nicely. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT-connected pumping solutions. And finally at CCC, we're seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and the demand for field services to come back online. Also, greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing, especially on an international basis. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect 20%-plus organic growth based on improving market conditions and continued easing comps. Now please turn to Page 14, and I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. Based on strong first half performance, improvement to our recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $15 and $15.20 per share. Of note, our prior high-end DEPS guidance was $15, now the bottom end of our range. Also, we're increasing our guidance notwithstanding pushing roughly $40 million of the TransCore New York City project into next year, providing everyone a good sense of how strong the balance of our portfolio is performing. Our full year organic growth is expected to be 7% or a touch higher. This full year growth outlook implies low double-digit organic growth in the second half. Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range. For the third quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.80 and $3.84. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Turning to Page 15 and our closing summary. This is a very strong quarter for our enterprise with software revenues growing on an organic basis, 9% in our Application Software segment and 10% for our software businesses in our NSS segment. In addition, the recovery pattern is characterized as gaining momentum and being broad, strength in product and software, strength in recurring and nonrecurring. We performed very well virtually every financial metric, growing 20% plus in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. EBITDA margins expanded by 110 basis points and free cash flow increased 30% to $409 million in the quarter. As promised, we continue to delever our balance sheet, reducing debt by $375 million in the quarter and by $1.4 billion since completing our 2020 acquisitions in Q4 of last year. As we look forward, positive momentum continues to build. Over the last decade, we have worked to improve the quality of our portfolio to be more software based, resulting in enterprise having higher levels of recurring revenue and be increasingly asset-light. In addition to having this improved quality within our business portfolio, we're seeing our recurring revenue growth rates improve from mid singles to high singles. Finally, our businesses will benefit from improving end market conditions. Given each of these: improved portfolio quality, improving recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we expect to see double-digit organic growth in the second half of the year. Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well and solidly contribute to, and improve the quality of, our enterprise. Given all of these factors, we're increasing our outlook for the full year. Finally, while we continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet, we also remain committed to our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high-quality opportunities. As our balance sheet becomes more offensive towards the end of the year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment in our usual process-oriented and disciplined manner. And with that, let's turn to your questions. Good morning, Deane. Yes. And again, just to echo what Rob said, the margin pressure there is just Verathon was amazing last year and they were deleveraged, as you expected, this year. In terms of the capacity there, the company is perfectly fine. I mean they ramped up last year in a way that was unprecedented. And as we look back and just we're sort of amazed at how that company operation was able to do that. I would also just highlight for Verathon, it was -- the demand there was a little bit driven by ventilators, but a lot a bit by the anesthesiologists and the people who do the intubations wanting to do it at an arm's length away for general surgery as opposed to when you do a direct intubation, you have to visualize the vocal cords right on top of the patient. Our product allows you to do it, if you monitor and be arm's length. And so it's less, the demand, it's less about the ventilators and more about just a better, more effective way to do an intubation, so much so that the total percentage of intubations done now versus 2018 or 2019, using video assistance, we believe, is permanently meaningfully higher. So it should be a long-term tailwind for the business. Yes. So relative to the leverage of getting there, I mean, we -- essentially, when we did the larger transactions last year, we thought we'd be in strike zone or being back in the M&A business sort of late this year into early next year. And I think we're just on track. And I may be pacing a touch ahead, but cash flow has been amazingly strong in Q4, Q1 and Q2, which has certainly helped. Relative to the pipeline and the characterization of pipeline, it is just -- there's a lot of great things. But for my 10 years here, there's always been a lot of great things at any moment in time to buy. I would remind you and everybody that we do a lot of work well ahead of when assets are actually for sale. And I'll remind you that Vertafore, we met with Amy and the team 18 months before we ultimately bought the company. And so we do a lot of early spade work, understanding the businesses, understanding the management teams and tracking. And that's the activity we've done this year to sort of position us for late this year and into next year deploying capital. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. I appreciate the question about Aderant, a business that we don't get a chance to talk about very much. And Deane and Chris and Raphael and the whole team there has just done really a remarkable job. I think the success here at Aderant is a combination of a great leadership team in a great market with a great product, but also complemented by our government system that focuses over success -- over a long arc of time. So the share gain from our principal competitor, as you mentioned, has been happening for essentially since we've owned the business. There is just a couple of years of inventory left in terms of those large law firms that have yet to make a decision on their enterprise system between us and our primary competitor, but that's been a known issue for three or four years now that inventory is going to run out in 2023, 2024. And so Aderant goes to work on their product offerings. They go to work on their cloud solutions. We've done a couple of bolt-on acquisitions in that business to where the -- if you will, the divot that existed in 2023 or 2024 relative to the growth rate four or five years ago. Now this no longer exists in any capacity, and we believe Aderant will grow -- easily grow through the divot because of the product portfolio, the cloud migration and really the long-term planning and execution of that team. Thank you, Chris. Good morning. Yes. I think so, Allison. Let me tackle that sort of recurring and non-recurring broadly in Application Software. And if I don't exactly land in your question, then circle back to us on that. So the second half for organic recurring is strong, right? So the dynamic there is that in the middle of COVID, recurring was more, generally speaking, across our enterprise, mid singles, it's ticking up to high singles. The reason for that is twofold. One is that you have more additions, product and customer additions today, both perpetual and SaaS related that drives recurring. But then also, you have our software businesses that were most negatively impacted by COVID now being coming out of the ditch. Think of like in Application Software, think of CBORD for instance. So not only did they have good bookings performance in the quarter, but they saw a bit of a tick up in their transactional revenue stream in Q2. And that will continue even more in Q3 and Q4 as kids get more on campuses and K-12 and higher education. So in Neptune, we're returning to normal. So I think this -- we believe that 2021 revenue will be equal to ish 2019, maybe a touch higher. So in terms of actual activities, June for Neptune, I believe, was their highest bookings month in the history of the company. The guys are nodding their heads. So the actual current momentum is great. I don't think we expect that to sustain itself for the balance of the year, just get more normalized as the Northeast is open. Canada is not open quite yet, we expect it to come online here in 3Q, in 4Q, but that gives you a sense of what's happening at Neptune. Thank you. Okay. So let's take the software recurring question. Other than what I just mentioned about the shorter-term dynamics of mid singles going to high singles on the recurring revenue base, the structural element that's underpinning this is migration to the cloud. So you think we have -- our network businesses are almost all cloud as it speaks today delivered in that manner. The application businesses, you have Deltek, it's on its journey. You have Aderant, it's just starting its journey. You have PowerPlan, it's just starting its journey. At CBORD, it's just starting its journey. And we mentioned many times, it's our customers that are pacing this activity, not us. So this will take 5, 10 years to complete the migration, maybe longer. But as you do that, you're lifting customers that are paying you maintenance and getting them into the cloud are large installed base, and that's accretive, meaningfully accretive to the recurring revenue growth rate. Relative to Vertafore, I appreciate the question. Vertafore is just a rock-solid business. As we mentioned, when we bought it, it's 90-plus percent recurring in terms of its revenue stream. It's on track for -- against our models and our deal -- models and sort of our expectations. Q2 was a touch better than we thought. But all in all, I'll call it on track relative to financial performance. Specific to the company itself, Amy and her team, they've demonstrated a wonderful ability to land new large customers. I think we mentioned in Q4 of last year, maybe Q1, we've won the largest deal in the market since we've owned the company which is encouraging. The customer base really appreciates the steady hand of ownership of Roper as opposed to trading every 3 to 5 years of private equity. And so it's still early, but the early days are certainly positive. Yes. It's principally Verathon we baked in a little supply chain pressure. So we haven't -- while we've been in the market and talking with companies, we haven't been actively bidding on a large number of assets in this interim period as we've been deleveraging. So I can't speak with specificity to deals that we've done. But what I can speak to is what we're observing from other companies and other transactions that are happening. Here in the last quarter, certainly -- I won't time bound it. Since the beginning of the year, valuations for the assets that we looked at actually feel like they pulled back a touch. They've actually gotten a little bit better. Maybe moderate, maybe they're flat, maybe they're a little bit better, but they're certainly not increasing, which seems to be the case really since 2013 or '14. So that maybe that bodes well. But we'll be able to speak more to that as we get more into the market and start bidding on activity here late this year into next year. Well, first, I'd say I wouldn't characterize this as a regulatory problem. I would characterize it as a regulatory process that has slowed down the project. And so it's not as though people are saying, no, it's just a process that takes time. We all believe, by the way, the federal approval will occur. At the end of the day, it's an environmental approval, and this is about reducing cars and congestion and pollution in New York, right? So it is an environmental-friendly exercise. I think this is just the first in the United States. I think MTA in New York are sort of carving out what this looks like and sort of setting an expectation for the other cities in the U.S. that will eventually follow suit. So no, I don't think it will slow things now. If anything, it might speed it up because I know the road bumps are sort of well understood now. Yes. So I need to talk about CBORD. They had a great quarter. The bookings activity in the quarter was just fantastic. The vast majority of the bookings activity in the quarter was in higher education. So you see these universities really preparing to ramp up. It's a combination of integrated security platforms and the payments platform. And as you know, we have integration with the iPhone now for access to the campuses. And so they're certainly preparing, and it was just a great bookings quarter on that front for CBORD. Happy to do it. Rob? That's the working assumption. Yes. I appreciate the question. You're right. It's a wonderful business and a wonderful space that enjoys a 3 to 4x relative market share advantage to our principal competitor. So we have tremendous scale advantage in this Freight Match spot market for freight in North America. It is a marketplace. It's a 2-sided network. It's paid by both the carriers and the brokers. There's value on both sides of the equation for sure. The big thing that's happening in the space is the brokers are becoming more tech-enabled, right? So how do you match and connect shipments with fewer and fewer calls and sort of complete automation straight through? A dynamic that's very similar to our business in the life insurance, very similar to Vertafore, conceptually. How do you tech-enable the agencies to do their job? And that's precisely the product road map that DAT is endeavoring, right? So you'll have the high end of folks that are going to do a lot of this on their own. And then you have the very long tail of thousands and thousands brokers that are going to run on our technology to do that. It's part of the reason why the strength is in the market today. It strengthened the business today. It's also what we believe will happen when you can organize the spot market in a more efficient way with less friction cost to match a load, then the spot market will compete very favorably against the contracted market, which is much larger. So we believe there'll be a permanent market share shift into the spot market which will further benefit our business, the brokers, et cetera. So it's -- we're very bullish on this for the long term. Well, we -- I mean, we did an acquisition last year that works with the shippers to understand volumes and rates and pricing. And we have an integrated offering now that shares sort of -- that provides pricing between the contracted market and the spot market. So we have an increasing relationship with the shippers. But the brokers provide a high and legitimate value in this value chain, right? So I think there will always be shipper -- principally shipper to broker to carrier relationship, it's just going to be a more automated and seamless relationship."

            "name": "Rob Crisci",
            "content": "Hey, thanks, Neil, and congrats again on the Lightning winning the Stanley Cup. Turning to Page 6, looking at some of the key financial highlights for Q2. Total revenue increased 22% to $1.59 billion, another record for any Roper quarter. Q2 organic revenue growth was 7% versus last year's comp of minus 3%. All four segments performed well, with strong organic growth across our portfolio of software and product businesses. Q2 EBITDA grew 26% to $579 million, and EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points to 36.4%. Adjusted DEPS was $3.76, 28% above prior year and also above our Q2 guidance range of $3.61 to $3.65. Free cash flow was $409 million, up a very strong 30% versus last year. As a reminder, last year, we adjusted our Q2 cash flow to account for the income tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to 2020 delayed tax deadlines. Net working capital was negative 8%. We continue to benefit from Roper's transformation to a high recurring revenue, majority software business model that is structurally designed to consistently drive high cash conversion. Lastly, we have been laser-focused on debt reduction this year after last year's record capital deployment, and we continue to make great progress on that front with an additional $375 million paid down in Q2. So in summary, an excellent second quarter, wrapping up a very strong first half for Roper. Next slide. Turning to Page 7, an update to the charge we introduced last quarter showing our rapid deleveraging. Through the first half of 2021, we have now reduced our net debt by nearly $900 million, raising the total debt reduction to approximately $1.4 billion since completing the 2020 acquisition late last year. Our debt reduction, along with the meaningful contributions from our 2020 acquisitions, has enabled us to rapidly lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, from 4.7 to 3.8 in only six months. We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward, which positions us well for a return to meaningful capital deployment in the coming quarters. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to discuss our segment performance. Good morning, Deane. Yes, sure. Good morning, Deane. Yes, on margins, really, it's driven by Verathon and just that exceptional quarter last year. And so with the decline this year, a little bit lower. There's certainly some supply chain things going on everywhere like every other company, not really a meaningful impact for us. And I'll let Neil talk about the Verathon question. Not really. I think we laid out each of the segments and what we see for organic for the second half. It's really great results we're expecting. And Q3 and Q4, relatively similar margin dynamics. The leverage, as you know, as the businesses start to grow, especially the industrial and the processing, is always very strong on the rebound. And then the software businesses are always strong no matter where you are in any sort of a cycle. So we feel really good about the second half. And I'll just add to that, as you talk about MAS, you also have the medical products businesses that aren't Verathon, right, that were impacted negatively throughout COVID. Those are now really rebounding very strongly, and that's just beginning as we're getting to sort of more normalized world in the medical world outside of the Verathon issue. Yes. So in our guide, we're assuming a little bit lower than that because you still had Verathon very, very strong in the third quarter and then fourth quarter was more normalized. So we have built in the guidance a little bit down from last year, but better than Q2 from a year-over-year fee standpoint. Steve, there's a ton of seasonality. So Vertafore's Q1 is usually season of the best quarter. But you're right, it's just a few million dollars difference. And then the EPSi acquisition -- or integration with Strata is ongoing. So that's going very, very well. I think there are some customers that are choosing to go with Strata instead of EPSi, which is a wonderful thing as that thing is coming together. And so that, again, could give a couple of million dollars of revenue here and there that ends up in Strata versus EPSi. But overall, both of the deals are on track to our model, as Neil mentioned. Sure. Yes. So as you know, the second quarter has 2 federal tax payments. So it's always our lowest conversion quarter. Now as we talked about, there is the benefit from the Vertafore tax attribute which we've -- which helped us in the second quarter against the payroll tax headwind which we talked about last quarter. So if you net those 2 together, probably a $40 million benefit for the second quarter. And then for the second half of the year though, those things really cancel each other out. So there's really no benefit from that for the second half of the year or any sort of a headwind. So as you move forward, Q3 and Q4 conversion should be pretty normal to what we normally see, which is 80% plus when you look at EBITDA to free cash flow. Yes. I think 80% EBITDA to free cash flow conversion in the second half is kind of what we're expecting, and you can do the math. Yes. So we had about $35 million in the first half, and we're assuming about 25% in the second half and it's relatively split between Q3 and Q4. And the project continues, it's just sort of everything is slowing down. So we're continuing to work, and that's what -- if they can turn the switch tomorrow and that could speed up, but that's what we're assuming from a modeling standpoint."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you'll please turn to slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix to this presentation on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and our adjusted results consist of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue and related commission expense; and lastly, a gain on sale related to a minority investment in Sedaru. And now if you'll please turn to slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. For this morning's call, I'll start with a brief summary of this quarter's results and activities. Rob will then highlight our P&L performance and balance sheet metrics. I'll then walk through our segment details, our increased outlook for the year and our concluding comments. As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk to your questions towards the end. Next slide, please. As we turn to page 5, we got off to a better start than we expected. Business execution was strong across the portfolio and was also broad based. We are encouraged by seeing nice improvements across the vast majority of our software and product-based end markets. In addition, we continue to see accelerating software recurring revenue growth, growing approximately 6% on an organic basis. Importantly, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions led by Vertafore continued to perform very well versus our expectations. When you put this altogether, we experienced double-digit growth across virtually all financial metrics: revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. The growth in cash flow performance in the quarter allowed to continue our rapid leveraging with about $500 million in debt paydown during the quarter. Based on this encouraging start, we're increasing our outlook and guidance for the full year. And with that let me turn it over to Rob to review the financial details. Rob? \nRob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to page 6 and covering the Q1 financial highlights. Total revenue increased 13% to $1.53 billion which was an all-time record for any Roper quarter. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 1% versus last year's plus 4% pre-pandemic comp. EBITDA grew 20% to $561 million. EBITDA margin increased 220 basis points to 36.7% on really great incrementals across the portfolio. Adjusted DEPS was $3.60 18% above prior year. Free cash flow was $543 million up 54%. We continue to benefit from our business transformation to a more software-weighted model where working capital boosts cash flow as our growth accelerates. Our results were enhanced a bit by approximately $40 million of accelerated payments that were the result of wins at our UK-based CliniSys laboratory software business. Aided by our outstanding cash flow performance, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million in the quarter. More on that to follow. So in summary, a great start to 2021. Next slide. Turning to page 7, an update on our deleveraging. The charts on this page are a good preview for how we expect 2021 to look as we follow through on our commitment to reduce debt after our 2020 opportunistic capital deployment. As each quarter passes by we will benefit from meaningfully improved trailing EBITDA as the performance of last year's acquisitions rolls into Roper's financials. EBITDA is then further enhanced by our accelerating organic growth. Concurrently, our strong cash conversion allows us to apply our high levels of excess free cash flow toward consistent reduction of our debt. In the first quarter, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million. Over the first three months of the year, our EBITDA growth, combined with debt reduction, enabled us to lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 4.7 to 4.2. We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to discuss our segment performance.\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. As we turn to page 9, revenues in our application software segment were $578 million, up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were an impressive 44.9% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic, recurring revenue, which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment, increase approximately 6%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Of note, this quarter should be the last quarter of nonrecurring revenue declines, as we come across the COVID comp from last year. From a business unit perspective, Deltek continued its long string of great performance. As we expected, Deltek's recurring revenue grew nicely. Of particular importance, Deltek saw an increase to their perpetual revenue during the quarter, coming off a decently strong quarter a year ago. Also encouraging, was the nature of the bookings activity which was broad based across our architecture, engineering, creative and government contracting end markets. For reference, the professional services end markets tied to AEC and creative have been slow since the onset of COVID. Also CliniSys, our European lab software business, just crushed it during the quarter. As Rob mentioned, CliniSys had exceptionally strong cash flow, as they gained tremendous market share within the clinical lab consolidation occurring, within the United Kingdom. CliniSys has approximately 85% market share in the UK and is now recognized as one of four critical IT vendors for the entire National Health Service, just outstanding execution by the CliniSys team and congrats. We also saw thawing in the higher education markets that CBORD serves, certainly encouraging. Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continues to perform very well. Specific to Vertafore, we continue to be encouraged by their customers' comfort in having Roper as a long-term owner for the business. Also, Amy and her team have done a great job transitioning to Roper and our governance model. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment. This is based on the expectation for sustained levels of recurring revenue growth and the resumption of nonrecurring revenue growth. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we expect our growth to be a touch below high single digits due to our global lab software group coming off, across a challenging comp from a year ago, as they are instrumental standing up COVID testing on a global basis, a solid and encouraging quarter for sure. And with that, let's turn to our next slide please. Turning to page 10. Revenue in our network segment were $440 million, flat versus last year and down 3% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 40.9% in the quarter. Our software businesses in the segment about 65% of the revenues were up 4% on an organic basis. This revenue was broad based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 6%. Recurring revenue growth is underpinned by strong customer retention. Recurring revenues are also benefited by increasing network participation. At the business level, our Freight Match businesses both in the US and Canada continued to be solid growers for us. As a reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize and transact the trucking/shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses has been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers. We also continued to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect, as their network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner. And lastly, as it relates to our network software businesses, we saw improved end market activity, especially in the middle market for Foundry, our media and entertainment compositing software business. Our non-software businesses in this segment were down 13% for the quarter, a touch better than we anticipated. TransCore's New York project work continues and is tracking well. TransCore's tag volumes declined versus a year ago based on lower traffic volumes across the US. Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment with consistent high single-digit growth through the balance of the year for our network software businesses. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we anticipate our segment organic growth to be a touch below HSD, given TransCore should be stronger in the second half versus next quarter based on timing of project execution and tag shipments. All in all a solid outlook for the balance of the year. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11 revenues in our MAS segment were $381 million up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 34.8% in the quarter. As usual in this segment, we will profile the three macro parts medical products, Neptune and our industrial businesses. To start our medical product business has performed very well this quarter. Verathon continued its strength based on consistent factors: GlideScope unit placements and recurring consumables pull-through and continued momentum and share gains with our single-use bronchoscope product offering. What's also encouraging to see is the growth in their BladderScan product line. We believe this was based on a broader-based trend of hospitals resuming some normal level of clinical capital spending. We saw similar strength in our other medical product businesses as well. For instance Northern Digital had their best Q1's bookings quarter in history. This trend bodes well for the balance of the year. Neptune as expected declined in the quarter for the same reasons discussed in each of the last three quarters having limited access to indoor meters in the Northeast United States and Canada. However, we did see some easing of these restrictions in March and Neptune's customers are beginning to increase their maintenance schedules throughout Q2 and into the second half of the year. Finally our industrial businesses benefited from improvements in their end market conditions. For the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit growth for this segment. This is based on broadly improving conditions both in medical and industrial end markets and increases to access and indoor meter replacements at Neptune. This strength will be somewhat offset by the extraordinary prior year COVID demand at Verathon. We're encouraged by our expected high single-digit growth for the balance of the year. Now let's turn to our final segment Process Tech. As we turn to Page 12 revenues in our Process Technologies segment were $131 million down 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins hung in at 31% in the quarter. The short story here is, we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after nearly two years of declines. For instance, at CCC, we're seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and demand for field services to come back online. Also Greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing especially on an international basis. Cornell, continues to perform well for us. This is particularly partially based on market conditions but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected pumping solutions. As we look to the outlook for the balance of the year we see double-digit organic growth based on improving end market conditions and continued easing comps. Now please turn to Page 14 where I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. Based on strong Q1 performance and our increased confidence for the balance of the year we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $14.75 and $15 per share and organic growth to be in the 6% to 7% range. This 6% to 7% organic growth is against a 1% organic decline in 2020. This demonstrates that we have meaningfully improved on an organic basis since 2019. The compounding continues.  Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range. For the second quarter we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.61 and $3.65 and expect second quarter organic revenue growth to be in line with the full year organic growth rate. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Turning to Page 15 and our closing summary this was an encouraging start and we're raising our outlook for the year. We performed well across virtually every financial metric with double-digit increases in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. EBITDA margins expanded nicely and free cash flow grew 54% to $543 million, which enabled us to continue our rapid deleveraging in the quarter. Importantly, we are well positioned for continued double-digit compounding. We're seeing improving conditions across virtually all of our end markets. When combined with our leading market positions, we expect high-single-digit organic growth for the remainder of the year. As owners or prospective owners of Roper Tech, you should be encouraged by our increasing levels of recurring revenue and the stability of our recurring revenue growth. Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions are performing very well and Vertafore has proven to be an excellent addition to our growing portfolio of software businesses. We continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet and remain committed and focused on our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high-quality opportunities. As our balance sheet becomes more offensive towards the end of this year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment in our usual process-oriented and disciplined manner. In closing and as we turn to your questions, we recently announced that Amy Woods Brinkley will become our new Board Chair effective June 1. Amy has been a tremendous Board member since 2015 and will be a fantastic Board Chair. I certainly look forward to working with Amy and the full Board for many years to come. But, as we turn to your questions, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our outgoing Board Chair, Bill Prezzano. Bill has been a Roper Director since 1997 and has reached our mandatory Board retirement age. He served as our Lead Independent Chair, Director and became Board Chair during the CEO transition from Brian Jellison to myself. Bill has been a wonderful Board Chair, enabling a smooth CEO transition and the continued evolution of our strategy and business model. On a personal note, Bill has been a tremendous mentor to me, which I hope will continue on an informal basis for years to come. Bill, thank you for your years of service to Roper shareholders, I think the share price is around $16 when you started. And thank you for helping me become a better leader and Chief Executive Officer. With that, we'd like to open it up to your questions.\nOperator: We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nChristopher Glynn: So, strong margins across the board, I was curious. In particular, Application Software was particularly better than expected. I don't know, if Vertafore had some incremental revenue versus what you expected, but what kind of drove up the App Soft margins in the quarter?\nRob Crisci: Hey, Chris. Good morning. Yes, there's strength across those businesses. I think Neil mentioned CliniSys was strong, Sunquest had a nice quarter. Deltek, sort of perpetual license wins there. All that stuff comes in at really high incrementals, and that drove most of the margin performance.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And then, a question on acquisition philosophy. You've kind of highlighted financial profile and returns and characteristics over strategic end markets. But, it strikes that Vertafore and iPipeline two out of your three biggest deals ever, both kind of serve in the insurance marketplaces. I'm wondering if there's any emerging prioritization in types of end markets.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, Christopher, I appreciate the question, and the opportunity to talk about that. The short answer is no. I mean our M&A strategy, for 20 years, is centered on picking the best businesses and business models that we can identify from the range of opportunities in the marketplace. If you go back to really starting in 2011, you might have thought from 2011 to 2013, we're all about health care IT; and then maybe from 2014 to 2017 about professional services ERP; and then the last couple of years about insurance tech. But all of those steps are completely coincidental. We really just evaluate the range of opportunities and pick the very best business that we can find. \nOperator: The next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.\nRob Crisci: Good morning.\nDeane Dray: First question is, how would you characterize the software demand this quarter? It might be hard to parse this out, but how much might have been pent-up from the COVID shutdown kind of a catch-up versus a true recovery and resumption of growth? I'm not sure you can characterize it broadly, but maybe some individual examples within the businesses. Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I\u2019m -- I don't think there's much pent-up here from our call-downs to our businesses this year. So this quarter it's more of a -- more recovery story. For instance, we talked about in the prepared remarks about the professional services end markets that Deltek serves. Architecture engineering, creative agencies started to come back in the quarter which is great to see.  Vertafore was steady as she goes. They were not particularly impacted by the pandemic. Aderant law firms continued to proceed with their transition. We did see some recovery start in the education and health care markets at CBORD. The middle market at Foundry which is great to see as production -- live production begins and comes out of production into post production. It was really just a nice increasing sort of start to recovery.  And then anytime anybody asked a question about software, we got to talk about the recurring revenue stream. It was around 6% growth organically across the two segments and in total, which bodes well for the future. \nDeane Dray: That's great to hear. And then just a second question. Since it is such a high-profile project any updates on the New York City congestion tolling? I saw in the slide it says that work has continued, but any update there would be helpful? Thanks. \nNeil Hunn: Yes. Just the project continues. The customer continues to want us to get the project done so they can commence the discussions on how they're going to do the tolling and begin to start the tolling. Certainly, the most macro backdrop is more favorable now with the administration in the White House and Secretary Pete and all the -- that is all in a much more favorable position than it was just a quarter or two ago. So the project continues. \nOperator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe my first question just to try and circle back on to the margin aspect. So in Application Software, you did have a very substantial margin increase year-on-year in the first quarter. You've laid out some of the reasons why.  But maybe just help us understand sort of as we think about the balance of the year for that business and maybe for Roper firm-wide, what type of incremental margins or margin trajectory we should expect. Because it looks as if the sort of drop-through margin is maybe around 20% in the guide for the balance of the year. I just wanted to sort of check how you are thinking about that? \nRob Crisci: Yes. So I'll give a crack at that. On an EBITDA margin basis, right, I mean Vertafore is a higher-EBITDA-margin business. So that -- you're seeing that and we talked about when we bought the business, it's around a 50% or so a little below that EBITDA margin business. So that helps. I think on a core basis, it's going to be relatively consistent year-over-year for the rest of the businesses on an EBITDA margin basis. And that's conversion at 40% to 50%. And that's just consistent with what we see in these businesses as they grow. And as you know, they have great cash characteristics, very negative working capital. So the cash flow growth can often be even faster than the EBITDA growth. And so it's a great story there and I think we'll continue to see margins high into that segment. \nNeil Hunn: And Julian, this is Neil. Just to underscore one thing Rob said, I mean the incremental EBITDA margins for the year are 40% as he said. I just want to underscore again. \nRob Crisci: Yes. That's right. \nJulian Mitchell: Perfect. Thanks very much. And then second question, would really be around the -- in network software. How are you thinking about the -- leaving aside TransCore the sort of core piece of it you did have some big impacts there in network software last year from COVID in sort of health care food and media I think you had called out before. Maybe just clarify what pace of sort of top line acceleration you're seeing in some of those COVID-impacted areas and what kind of cyclical recovery if you like in network software you're experiencing. \nRob Crisci: Yes. So, the network software businesses are strong high single-digit organic for the rest of the year. That's the consistency in the recurring which we talked about has been growing all along. But then you do get a little bit of a bounce back in some of the markets. You mentioned Foundry and others. So, I think you're on the right track there. Neil do you want to add anything to that?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. Just to color on the three the health care entertainment and food. So, MHA is the health care business that was tied and indexed to patient and volumes going through long-term care, skilled nursing assisted living facilities, that's normalized. That business also has added products to its contract portfolio. So, that business is on its way to recovery as we speak. We talked about Foundry in the prepared remarks which is there's just tremendous content budget not surprising in the marketplace and all that content requires postproduction and we're a critical element in that post. And then finally iTrade, iTrade is going to be one of the longer recovery cycles for us. It'll be a second half this year and the next year as they're indexed partially to retail/food, but also partially to what I'll call institutional food which is think about that as restaurants, schools, universities, a little bit of stadiums. And that's going to come back on a longer recovery curve. \nOperator: The next question is from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi guys. Good morning. Just want to circle back on to Deane's question around -- I know he mentioned around the reopening kind of theme in Q2 and it sounds like you are seeing some green shoots. Just trying to reconcile for the balance of the year. It sounds like you guys are expecting a more, I would say, gradual recovery in some of those businesses. Any color from your customers in terms of are they still a little concerned about the COVID impact? Are they thinking maybe there could be some pent-up demand as we sort of exit this year? Any thoughts there?\nNeil Hunn: Well, we got to sort of run through the portfolio Allison in that regard. I think it'll be -- or I think our comments here will be around the product businesses as opposed to the software ones. First is the tag volumes at TransCore. I mean that's going to be a probably a second half of this year recovery cycle just based on when the tags were bought last year into this year and having the customers burn through existing inventory as traffic patterns come back on. We talked about medical products. We got the COVID headwind for a quarter or two at Verathon, but the other businesses definitely saw a palpable improvement in the capital purchases of their medical equipment in the quarter. And we got no sense if that was pent-up or onetime. We'll find out in the next quarter or two, but that was not the read-through from the conversations we had with our customers. In fact, NDI had record bookings in the quarter. As we go through the industrial businesses, Struers, we definitely saw an improvement across the portfolio of industrial businesses through the quarter with Struers having record March bookings which shows that there's some sort of gradual improvement there to continue. And then on the Process Technologies businesses there was just nice -- I would call that very similar to what we saw at Struers and industrial. March got better than February and February was better than January.\nAllison Poliniak: Great, that's helpful. And then a strong deleveraging in the quarter. You talked about an active pipeline maybe more comfort towards the end of the year. Any change to thinking just given the strong performance so far? Obviously, strong cash flow characteristics that you would have some comfort level of staying slightly above your comfort range at this point. Or are you still focused on getting that down in terms of the net debt leverage?\nRob Crisci: Yes, Allison, it was a great start to deleveraging for Q1. So, that certainly helped boost our ability to pay down the debt faster and we'll continue to do that throughout the year. And as Neil mentioned, we're making sure the pipeline is active and there are some exciting things that we're looking at in the early stages and we'll be ready to deploy capital at some point. But for right now, we're really focused on the deleveraging. \nOperator: The next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, good morning guys.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Hey Rob, just -- I'm going to pick on the guide a little bit. So, revenue for the year you're expecting 6% to 7%. It was kind of mid-single-digit-plus before -- came in pretty good into 1Q. Good margins. And we're kind of just passing through the 1Q beat essentially maybe a tad higher than that for the full year. So, like how would you kind of argue that? Are you seeing anything incrementally challenging? It sounds like you're -- everything seems to be at least on plan if not a bit above. So, just we want to think through the framework there?\nRob Crisci: Yeah, I think that's right. I think it was one quarter, right? We had a really nice first quarter. And we felt it prudent to raise the guide, because it certainly gives us more confidence for the rest of the year. But it was one quarter and this is an unusual environment where we're coming off of a sort of hopefully once-a-lifetime pandemic. And so we're trying to be balanced in the outlook and sort of what we do with the businesses.\nJoe Giordano: Yeah. That's fair. And maybe can you talk us through just like the structural differences between the lab software businesses in the US and in Europe, and how businesses in each region are like differently positioned and why CliniSys is able to do so well here?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. I mean, the -- in the US, the -- as we've talked about quite a bit, the lab was the first part of the hospital to become automated. And then 20 years later due to -- with the government stimulus there was the -- hospitals deployed electronic medical records. And then those EMRs -- the hospitals as a general matter appreciated and wanted the connectivity of the lab software to the EMR and that's how we had had sort of the competitive headwinds for four or five years at Sunquest. When you look at Europe, that dynamic does not exist. The health systems are different first of all. They're country driven. The -- there is not the concept of an EMR landscape on a country-by-country basis. It's very, very different. It's characterized by local providers, characterized by country-specific providers.  nd as a result CliniSys' lab software is not just -- we highlighted the UK wins and strengths in this quarter, but they've just been doing a great job pan-European in France in Benelux emerging presence in Germany, bought a small business last year in Spain to be able to consolidate the laboratory infrastructure across Europe. Each of the countries in their own way are going through a laboratory consolidation in a way to save money for the health system itself and we being the -- basically the only scaled provider that with the demonstrable success at scale and being able to win market share at a meaningful clip there.\nJoe Giordano: And just so I understand, what gives you confidence that sort of like integration of labs with the broader hospital systems is not something that's a near-term threat to the business?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. I think it's essentially you need -- the way that for instance the primary competitor in the US that we -- is Epic. Epic for instance is -- basically doesn't have a presence in Europe. And when they do, it's a country-specific presence. They might be in a very small country or small region of a country and it's sort of isolated there given that it's a country-specific decision process. And also there just isn't -- that competitive activity just isn't there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Blake Gendron from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBlake Gendron: Thanks, good morning. First question on free cash flow. The conversion from EBITDA has been extremely -- exceedingly strong over the last several quarters on top of already strong margins. How should we think about conversion going forward through the year, relative to what you accomplished in 4Q and 1Q? I'd imagine the recovery in nonrecurring software is helping the working capital profile. So really just wondering how sustainable that trend is as the recovery kind of moderates through the year?\nRob Crisci: Sure. So I think -- so in the first quarter right there's no federal tax payments. So that's always a high cash conversion quarter. So that normalizes more when we make the -- start making federal payments in Q2. But really as I mentioned a little bit earlier, I mean, it's great growth from the software businesses. They have negative working capital. Therefore, the cash performance is very strong. The more software growth you have, you drive working capital further negative. It's very structural part of the model. High conversion is embedded in everything that we do. So we expect that free cash flow conversion to continue to get better over time as we've improved the quality of our portfolio. So we feel good about the rest of the year and continue to have high cash conversion and continue that double-digit cash flow compounding that we all expect to achieve.\nBlake Gendron: Excellent. Just wanted to circle back on M&A. So plenty of puts and takes with potential US tax increases and yields moving higher. I'm wondering if you could help us think about these inputs in the context of historical private software pricing in the pipeline. Some of these changes come through taxes rise, yields rise. How would you expect asset pricing to evolve, or how has it evolved in the past? I think we've discussed this before about it being a net positive for Roper.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. We certainly believe balance that's the case. So, well obviously, when taxes went down rates are \u2013 sort of private prices went up a touch. I think the - it was 14 times, 15 times for Deltek and 16 times for PowerPlan and really the only difference in the market there was the tax change. So that gives you a sense of the order of magnitude. Maybe a couple of turns but it depends on what the magnitude of the tax change is. Relative to interest rates going up we think that does greatly benefit us in the compounding model. If you think as interest rates go up we're competing against private equity firms, who have a levered acquisition model. So as interest rates go up the amount of leverage they can put on a transaction goes down. And subsequently, the total equity that they put into a deal goes down and multiples compress more so with interest rates going up I think than what you see conversely with taxes. And then in our case, the majority of our acquisition proceeds come from our cash that we generate. And so we're relatively insensitive to interest rate where our competitors for acquisitions are. So in the long arc of time that's a good thing for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Steve. Thanks for joining in.\nSteve Tusa: Thanks for having me. Just to clarify on the answer before on kind of the degree of leverage you're comfortable with before doing a new deal is kind of three times, a bit of a line in the sand there, where you would get back down to below that before doing another deal, or maybe just talk about kind of that three times level and how that kind of plays into your thoughts?\nRob Crisci: Yes, sure. I wouldn't say a line in the sand. I think once you get into the low threes that \u2013certainly it's more reasonable. I think the \u2013 we spent a lot of time with the rating agencies, when we did our last couple of acquisitions. I think they understand the high quality of the cash flow that we have and our incredibly high cash conversion. And so it's really about how good our business model is, how fast we can pay down any leverage that we put on the business. I think we've demonstrated that time and time again and we can do it pretty quickly. So once we get into the low threes then I think we have the ability to deploy capital.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Great. And then just lastly when you kind of look out to next year are there any \u2013 you're obviously not going to have any deals here at least in the near term. But are there any moving parts and items from a headwinds perspective whether it's the Vertafore tax benefit or some of these Sunquest deals around COVID? How do those play out for next year? Do they generally offset \u2013 are they offset by growth in some of the other businesses? Maybe if there's anything mechanical that kind of happens next year that you want to call out?\nRob Crisci: So I'll \u2013 let me just hit a couple of things and then I think Neil wants to add on. But yes, you're right, there's this $100 million-plus tax benefit around Vertafore that we talked about that will hit throughout Q2 through Q4. We did not benefit from that in the first quarter. And then there's about $60 million or so of this payroll tax deferral which is a bad guy this year for the rest of the year, given that was part of the COVID rules that you can defer some of those payments. And there's always going to be pluses and minuses in sort of that part of the world, but I'll let Neil talk about some of the growth.\nNeil Hunn: Well, I think it's always appreciated in a quarter that we have here you highlight the headwinds going into next year Steve, so we appreciate that. But as a general matter year two, out of a pandemic should be pretty good.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Blanton from Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blanton: Hi. Hi, good morning. Congratulations. That's a great quarter and it looks like you're going to have a very good year. I just wanted to comment that so far there've been seven analysts and every one of them has been cut off before they finished with their second question. None of them said, thank you, and I'd like to ask the moderator to please stop doing that because that is really not a very good way to conduct a call. You need to allow dialogue with the management on the second question. Don't cut people off before they say thank you. Let them finish, please. I wanted to ask about the backlog of opportunities that you mentioned that you might get back to accessing it at the end of the year, as you start to deploy capital. Could you just say, a little more on the nature of that pipeline the size of the companies in there? Because as you get bigger, it's obviously important to find bigger and bigger companies in order to keep the growth rate constant. So could you just give us a little bit on that? And perhaps, characterize the kinds of markets those companies are in that you're looking at in the pipeline?\nNeil Hunn: Alex, it's Neil here. Appreciate the question and appreciate your opening comments. The \u2013 let me give you a broader view to the \u2013 to your question. First, why we're active now with our M&A pipeline is that, we \u2013 and we're meeting with companies is that every company of size that we bought from 2016 forward we met with roughly 9 months to 12 months at the earliest \u2013 at a minimum before buying the company. So we're establishing a relationship getting to know the management team, getting to know the business, and then sort of if you will have a running start when the business actually comes for sale. So we're active. And the work we're doing now is going to pay dividends 9, 12, 18 months from now in terms of deploying capital, and our ability to do that in companies that we have a high level of conviction in. To your question about doing bigger and bigger deals, I would beg to differ with that a little bit. When you look at our model over the next seven years, we have to deploy somewhere on a run rate basis $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year based on our cash flow and the leverage profile that we just talked about. And in doing so, when you're looking at the types of businesses that we look to buy, small market vertically focused, leading software-type or software-type business models, I think the sweet spot in that is going to be somewhere in the $750 million to $1.5 billion range. So we're talking about doing a couple-ish deals a year and then we'll always do a small number of tuck-ins or bolt-ons to the existing portfolio. So I think we can \u2013 at least for the next seven years on a per-year basis we don't have to do bigger and bigger deals to keep the growth rate at the sustained double-digit rate.\nAlex Blanton: But would you say that, these companies the margins and the cash flow and the EBITDA and so on are such that you can keep increasing those metrics like EBITDA margin and the operating margin and the gross margin, the way you've done for many, many years by buying companies that have margins that are above the corporate average? Can you keep doing that?\nRob Crisci: I think so. The answer to that is yes, Alex. So it's really about the target the businesses that we target right? Businesses that have higher organic growth than Roper has historically businesses that have very good margins often better than Roper at least at the same level now that we've improved ours over many, many years. And then we buy those businesses. They grow. We hope \u2013 we believe we can make them better. They accelerate growth. They generate more cash and you get this compounding effect. And so it's really the same strategy that \u2013 I appreciate you've followed us for a long time \u2013 we've had for \u2013 for over a decade now. And it's \u2013 the good news is as you get more and more into software and these types of opportunities we find more and more companies that fit that model that will allow us to continue to improve all those metrics for many, many more years to come. \nAlex Blanton: Right. Well, this has been the company's strategy since I started following it in 1992, when you went public. It's been a great ride. Thank you very much.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nRob Crisci: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.\nRichard Eastman: Yes. Yes. Good morning and thank you.\nRob Crisci: Hi, Richard.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Richard.\nRichard Eastman: Yes, Good morning. Just a question or two around the Application Software business. And when we look at the lab software business as part of that in aggregate around CliniSys and Sunquest, you've spoken nicely about CliniSys's share gains in Europe and the rationale for that. Could you just talk a little bit and maybe characterize the US business around Sunquest? Has Sunquest's share stabilized? And maybe post COVID what does the recovery environment look like for Sunquest domestically?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So Sunquest did -- I mean, they were benefited -- let's also -- let me back up. Let's not -- so you mentioned two companies CliniSys and Sunquest. We ought to include a third which is Data Innovations, which is a middleware business. They've -- they're very global business, but they're domiciled in the US. But specific to your question about Sunquest, the US laboratory business, they were benefited last year and in this quarter with the COVID tailwinds standing up COVID testing. They continued to invest in their public health offering and their molecular offering. The leadership team has done a nice job in that. So that's good news. The unfortunate part of that news is it just delayed the bottoming of this business, which we thought was going to be this year-ish if it weren't for COVID. Now it's going to be pushed out a year or two before that business sort of gets through all the known attrition and then is baselined from, which it can grow from.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. And how much of that lab software business now is domestic? When you put those three businesses together CliniSys, Sunquest and Data Innovation, how much is domestic versus international? Is it a 50-50\u2026\nNeil Hunn: I'm going to let Rob take a look at this. We might have to get back to you.\nRob Crisci : Yes. I might have to circle back. I mean, it's approaching probably 50-50 given the growth in the CliniSys business the fact the DI business is very global and the Sunquest business is mostly US. So as a group it's probably about half.\nRichard Eastman: I understand. And then just a follow-up question around measurement analytical and the process businesses. Could you just talk about pricing there? I know you usually allow your GMs to price according to margin targets and things. But can you talk about price and how proactive you've been able to be on the M&A business as well -- M&A as in Measurement & Analytical and the process side?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I think the characteristics of these businesses is they -- all Roper businesses is they price based on the values created. A great example, there is in our Hansen business where they've had a couple of innovations in their refrigeration valve business product line with coatings and some sensors to allow to identify clearly when it's been triggered, very low-cost increase to bill of materials, but massive increase to value. So we've seen very nice price increases on situations like that. On a like-for-like basis it's -- the businesses are agile. They've been very good at being able to push through any increase to the bill of materials kind of the supply chain and otherwise taking normal price. \nRichard Eastman: Okay. All right. Well, thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nRob Crisci: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now turn -- return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us. For this morning's call, I'll start with a brief summary of this quarter's results and activities. Rob will then highlight our P&L performance and balance sheet metrics. I'll then walk through our segment details, our increased outlook for the year and our concluding comments. As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk to your questions towards the end. Next slide, please. As we turn to page 5, we got off to a better start than we expected. Business execution was strong across the portfolio and was also broad based. We are encouraged by seeing nice improvements across the vast majority of our software and product-based end markets. In addition, we continue to see accelerating software recurring revenue growth, growing approximately 6% on an organic basis. Importantly, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions led by Vertafore continued to perform very well versus our expectations. When you put this altogether, we experienced double-digit growth across virtually all financial metrics: revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. The growth in cash flow performance in the quarter allowed to continue our rapid leveraging with about $500 million in debt paydown during the quarter. Based on this encouraging start, we're increasing our outlook and guidance for the full year. And with that let me turn it over to Rob to review the financial details. Rob? Thanks, Rob. As we turn to page 9, revenues in our application software segment were $578 million, up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were an impressive 44.9% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic, recurring revenue, which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment, increase approximately 6%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Of note, this quarter should be the last quarter of nonrecurring revenue declines, as we come across the COVID comp from last year. From a business unit perspective, Deltek continued its long string of great performance. As we expected, Deltek's recurring revenue grew nicely. Of particular importance, Deltek saw an increase to their perpetual revenue during the quarter, coming off a decently strong quarter a year ago. Also encouraging, was the nature of the bookings activity which was broad based across our architecture, engineering, creative and government contracting end markets. For reference, the professional services end markets tied to AEC and creative have been slow since the onset of COVID. Also CliniSys, our European lab software business, just crushed it during the quarter. As Rob mentioned, CliniSys had exceptionally strong cash flow, as they gained tremendous market share within the clinical lab consolidation occurring, within the United Kingdom. CliniSys has approximately 85% market share in the UK and is now recognized as one of four critical IT vendors for the entire National Health Service, just outstanding execution by the CliniSys team and congrats. We also saw thawing in the higher education markets that CBORD serves, certainly encouraging. Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continues to perform very well. Specific to Vertafore, we continue to be encouraged by their customers' comfort in having Roper as a long-term owner for the business. Also, Amy and her team have done a great job transitioning to Roper and our governance model. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment. This is based on the expectation for sustained levels of recurring revenue growth and the resumption of nonrecurring revenue growth. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we expect our growth to be a touch below high single digits due to our global lab software group coming off, across a challenging comp from a year ago, as they are instrumental standing up COVID testing on a global basis, a solid and encouraging quarter for sure. And with that, let's turn to our next slide please. Turning to page 10. Revenue in our network segment were $440 million, flat versus last year and down 3% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 40.9% in the quarter. Our software businesses in the segment about 65% of the revenues were up 4% on an organic basis. This revenue was broad based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 6%. Recurring revenue growth is underpinned by strong customer retention. Recurring revenues are also benefited by increasing network participation. At the business level, our Freight Match businesses both in the US and Canada continued to be solid growers for us. As a reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize and transact the trucking/shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses has been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers. We also continued to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect, as their network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner. And lastly, as it relates to our network software businesses, we saw improved end market activity, especially in the middle market for Foundry, our media and entertainment compositing software business. Our non-software businesses in this segment were down 13% for the quarter, a touch better than we anticipated. TransCore's New York project work continues and is tracking well. TransCore's tag volumes declined versus a year ago based on lower traffic volumes across the US. Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment with consistent high single-digit growth through the balance of the year for our network software businesses. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we anticipate our segment organic growth to be a touch below HSD, given TransCore should be stronger in the second half versus next quarter based on timing of project execution and tag shipments. All in all a solid outlook for the balance of the year. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11 revenues in our MAS segment were $381 million up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 34.8% in the quarter. As usual in this segment, we will profile the three macro parts medical products, Neptune and our industrial businesses. To start our medical product business has performed very well this quarter. Verathon continued its strength based on consistent factors: GlideScope unit placements and recurring consumables pull-through and continued momentum and share gains with our single-use bronchoscope product offering. What's also encouraging to see is the growth in their BladderScan product line. We believe this was based on a broader-based trend of hospitals resuming some normal level of clinical capital spending. We saw similar strength in our other medical product businesses as well. For instance Northern Digital had their best Q1's bookings quarter in history. This trend bodes well for the balance of the year. Neptune as expected declined in the quarter for the same reasons discussed in each of the last three quarters having limited access to indoor meters in the Northeast United States and Canada. However, we did see some easing of these restrictions in March and Neptune's customers are beginning to increase their maintenance schedules throughout Q2 and into the second half of the year. Finally our industrial businesses benefited from improvements in their end market conditions. For the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit growth for this segment. This is based on broadly improving conditions both in medical and industrial end markets and increases to access and indoor meter replacements at Neptune. This strength will be somewhat offset by the extraordinary prior year COVID demand at Verathon. We're encouraged by our expected high single-digit growth for the balance of the year. Now let's turn to our final segment Process Tech. As we turn to Page 12 revenues in our Process Technologies segment were $131 million down 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins hung in at 31% in the quarter. The short story here is, we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after nearly two years of declines. For instance, at CCC, we're seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and demand for field services to come back online. Also Greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing especially on an international basis. Cornell, continues to perform well for us. This is particularly partially based on market conditions but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected pumping solutions. As we look to the outlook for the balance of the year we see double-digit organic growth based on improving end market conditions and continued easing comps. Now please turn to Page 14 where I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. Based on strong Q1 performance and our increased confidence for the balance of the year we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $14.75 and $15 per share and organic growth to be in the 6% to 7% range. This 6% to 7% organic growth is against a 1% organic decline in 2020. This demonstrates that we have meaningfully improved on an organic basis since 2019. The compounding continues.  Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range. For the second quarter we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.61 and $3.65 and expect second quarter organic revenue growth to be in line with the full year organic growth rate. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Turning to Page 15 and our closing summary this was an encouraging start and we're raising our outlook for the year. We performed well across virtually every financial metric with double-digit increases in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. EBITDA margins expanded nicely and free cash flow grew 54% to $543 million, which enabled us to continue our rapid deleveraging in the quarter. Importantly, we are well positioned for continued double-digit compounding. We're seeing improving conditions across virtually all of our end markets. When combined with our leading market positions, we expect high-single-digit organic growth for the remainder of the year. As owners or prospective owners of Roper Tech, you should be encouraged by our increasing levels of recurring revenue and the stability of our recurring revenue growth. Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions are performing very well and Vertafore has proven to be an excellent addition to our growing portfolio of software businesses. We continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet and remain committed and focused on our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high-quality opportunities. As our balance sheet becomes more offensive towards the end of this year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment in our usual process-oriented and disciplined manner. In closing and as we turn to your questions, we recently announced that Amy Woods Brinkley will become our new Board Chair effective June 1. Amy has been a tremendous Board member since 2015 and will be a fantastic Board Chair. I certainly look forward to working with Amy and the full Board for many years to come. But, as we turn to your questions, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our outgoing Board Chair, Bill Prezzano. Bill has been a Roper Director since 1997 and has reached our mandatory Board retirement age. He served as our Lead Independent Chair, Director and became Board Chair during the CEO transition from Brian Jellison to myself. Bill has been a wonderful Board Chair, enabling a smooth CEO transition and the continued evolution of our strategy and business model. On a personal note, Bill has been a tremendous mentor to me, which I hope will continue on an informal basis for years to come. Bill, thank you for your years of service to Roper shareholders, I think the share price is around $16 when you started. And thank you for helping me become a better leader and Chief Executive Officer. With that, we'd like to open it up to your questions. Good morning. Hey, Christopher, I appreciate the question, and the opportunity to talk about that. The short answer is no. I mean our M&A strategy, for 20 years, is centered on picking the best businesses and business models that we can identify from the range of opportunities in the marketplace. If you go back to really starting in 2011, you might have thought from 2011 to 2013, we're all about health care IT; and then maybe from 2014 to 2017 about professional services ERP; and then the last couple of years about insurance tech. But all of those steps are completely coincidental. We really just evaluate the range of opportunities and pick the very best business that we can find. Good morning, Deane. Yes. I'm -- I don't think there's much pent-up here from our call-downs to our businesses this year. So this quarter it's more of a -- more recovery story. For instance, we talked about in the prepared remarks about the professional services end markets that Deltek serves. Architecture engineering, creative agencies started to come back in the quarter which is great to see.  Vertafore was steady as she goes. They were not particularly impacted by the pandemic. Aderant law firms continued to proceed with their transition. We did see some recovery start in the education and health care markets at CBORD. The middle market at Foundry which is great to see as production -- live production begins and comes out of production into post production. It was really just a nice increasing sort of start to recovery.  And then anytime anybody asked a question about software, we got to talk about the recurring revenue stream. It was around 6% growth organically across the two segments and in total, which bodes well for the future. Yes. Just the project continues. The customer continues to want us to get the project done so they can commence the discussions on how they're going to do the tolling and begin to start the tolling. Certainly, the most macro backdrop is more favorable now with the administration in the White House and Secretary Pete and all the -- that is all in a much more favorable position than it was just a quarter or two ago. So the project continues. And Julian, this is Neil. Just to underscore one thing Rob said, I mean the incremental EBITDA margins for the year are 40% as he said. I just want to underscore again. Yes. Just to color on the three the health care entertainment and food. So, MHA is the health care business that was tied and indexed to patient and volumes going through long-term care, skilled nursing assisted living facilities, that's normalized. That business also has added products to its contract portfolio. So, that business is on its way to recovery as we speak. We talked about Foundry in the prepared remarks which is there's just tremendous content budget not surprising in the marketplace and all that content requires postproduction and we're a critical element in that post. And then finally iTrade, iTrade is going to be one of the longer recovery cycles for us. It'll be a second half this year and the next year as they're indexed partially to retail/food, but also partially to what I'll call institutional food which is think about that as restaurants, schools, universities, a little bit of stadiums. And that's going to come back on a longer recovery curve. Well, we got to sort of run through the portfolio Allison in that regard. I think it'll be -- or I think our comments here will be around the product businesses as opposed to the software ones. First is the tag volumes at TransCore. I mean that's going to be a probably a second half of this year recovery cycle just based on when the tags were bought last year into this year and having the customers burn through existing inventory as traffic patterns come back on. We talked about medical products. We got the COVID headwind for a quarter or two at Verathon, but the other businesses definitely saw a palpable improvement in the capital purchases of their medical equipment in the quarter. And we got no sense if that was pent-up or onetime. We'll find out in the next quarter or two, but that was not the read-through from the conversations we had with our customers. In fact, NDI had record bookings in the quarter. As we go through the industrial businesses, Struers, we definitely saw an improvement across the portfolio of industrial businesses through the quarter with Struers having record March bookings which shows that there's some sort of gradual improvement there to continue. And then on the Process Technologies businesses there was just nice -- I would call that very similar to what we saw at Struers and industrial. March got better than February and February was better than January. Good morning Joe. Yeah. I mean, the -- in the US, the -- as we've talked about quite a bit, the lab was the first part of the hospital to become automated. And then 20 years later due to -- with the government stimulus there was the -- hospitals deployed electronic medical records. And then those EMRs -- the hospitals as a general matter appreciated and wanted the connectivity of the lab software to the EMR and that's how we had had sort of the competitive headwinds for four or five years at Sunquest. When you look at Europe, that dynamic does not exist. The health systems are different first of all. They're country driven. The -- there is not the concept of an EMR landscape on a country-by-country basis. It's very, very different. It's characterized by local providers, characterized by country-specific providers.  nd as a result CliniSys' lab software is not just -- we highlighted the UK wins and strengths in this quarter, but they've just been doing a great job pan-European in France in Benelux emerging presence in Germany, bought a small business last year in Spain to be able to consolidate the laboratory infrastructure across Europe. Each of the countries in their own way are going through a laboratory consolidation in a way to save money for the health system itself and we being the -- basically the only scaled provider that with the demonstrable success at scale and being able to win market share at a meaningful clip there. Yeah. I think it's essentially you need -- the way that for instance the primary competitor in the US that we -- is Epic. Epic for instance is -- basically doesn't have a presence in Europe. And when they do, it's a country-specific presence. They might be in a very small country or small region of a country and it's sort of isolated there given that it's a country-specific decision process. And also there just isn't -- that competitive activity just isn't there. Yes. We certainly believe balance that's the case. So, well obviously, when taxes went down rates are \u2013 sort of private prices went up a touch. I think the - it was 14 times, 15 times for Deltek and 16 times for PowerPlan and really the only difference in the market there was the tax change. So that gives you a sense of the order of magnitude. Maybe a couple of turns but it depends on what the magnitude of the tax change is. Relative to interest rates going up we think that does greatly benefit us in the compounding model. If you think as interest rates go up we're competing against private equity firms, who have a levered acquisition model. So as interest rates go up the amount of leverage they can put on a transaction goes down. And subsequently, the total equity that they put into a deal goes down and multiples compress more so with interest rates going up I think than what you see conversely with taxes. And then in our case, the majority of our acquisition proceeds come from our cash that we generate. And so we're relatively insensitive to interest rate where our competitors for acquisitions are. So in the long arc of time that's a good thing for us. Good morning, Steve. Thanks for joining in. Well, I think it's always appreciated in a quarter that we have here you highlight the headwinds going into next year Steve, so we appreciate that. But as a general matter year two, out of a pandemic should be pretty good. Alex, it's Neil here. Appreciate the question and appreciate your opening comments. The \u2013 let me give you a broader view to the \u2013 to your question. First, why we're active now with our M&A pipeline is that, we \u2013 and we're meeting with companies is that every company of size that we bought from 2016 forward we met with roughly 9 months to 12 months at the earliest \u2013 at a minimum before buying the company. So we're establishing a relationship getting to know the management team, getting to know the business, and then sort of if you will have a running start when the business actually comes for sale. So we're active. And the work we're doing now is going to pay dividends 9, 12, 18 months from now in terms of deploying capital, and our ability to do that in companies that we have a high level of conviction in. To your question about doing bigger and bigger deals, I would beg to differ with that a little bit. When you look at our model over the next seven years, we have to deploy somewhere on a run rate basis $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year based on our cash flow and the leverage profile that we just talked about. And in doing so, when you're looking at the types of businesses that we look to buy, small market vertically focused, leading software-type or software-type business models, I think the sweet spot in that is going to be somewhere in the $750 million to $1.5 billion range. So we're talking about doing a couple-ish deals a year and then we'll always do a small number of tuck-ins or bolt-ons to the existing portfolio. So I think we can \u2013 at least for the next seven years on a per-year basis we don't have to do bigger and bigger deals to keep the growth rate at the sustained double-digit rate. Thank you. Good morning, Richard. Yes. So Sunquest did -- I mean, they were benefited -- let's also -- let me back up. Let's not -- so you mentioned two companies CliniSys and Sunquest. We ought to include a third which is Data Innovations, which is a middleware business. They've -- they're very global business, but they're domiciled in the US. But specific to your question about Sunquest, the US laboratory business, they were benefited last year and in this quarter with the COVID tailwinds standing up COVID testing. They continued to invest in their public health offering and their molecular offering. The leadership team has done a nice job in that. So that's good news. The unfortunate part of that news is it just delayed the bottoming of this business, which we thought was going to be this year-ish if it weren't for COVID. Now it's going to be pushed out a year or two before that business sort of gets through all the known attrition and then is baselined from, which it can grow from. I'm going to let Rob take a look at this. We might have to get back to you. Yes. I think the characteristics of these businesses is they -- all Roper businesses is they price based on the values created. A great example, there is in our Hansen business where they've had a couple of innovations in their refrigeration valve business product line with coatings and some sensors to allow to identify clearly when it's been triggered, very low-cost increase to bill of materials, but massive increase to value. So we've seen very nice price increases on situations like that. On a like-for-like basis it's -- the businesses are agile. They've been very good at being able to push through any increase to the bill of materials kind of the supply chain and otherwise taking normal price. Thank you."

            "name": "Rob Crisci",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to page 6 and covering the Q1 financial highlights. Total revenue increased 13% to $1.53 billion which was an all-time record for any Roper quarter. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 1% versus last year's plus 4% pre-pandemic comp. EBITDA grew 20% to $561 million. EBITDA margin increased 220 basis points to 36.7% on really great incrementals across the portfolio. Adjusted DEPS was $3.60 18% above prior year. Free cash flow was $543 million up 54%. We continue to benefit from our business transformation to a more software-weighted model where working capital boosts cash flow as our growth accelerates. Our results were enhanced a bit by approximately $40 million of accelerated payments that were the result of wins at our UK-based CliniSys laboratory software business. Aided by our outstanding cash flow performance, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million in the quarter. More on that to follow. So in summary, a great start to 2021. Next slide. Turning to page 7, an update on our deleveraging. The charts on this page are a good preview for how we expect 2021 to look as we follow through on our commitment to reduce debt after our 2020 opportunistic capital deployment. As each quarter passes by we will benefit from meaningfully improved trailing EBITDA as the performance of last year's acquisitions rolls into Roper's financials. EBITDA is then further enhanced by our accelerating organic growth. Concurrently, our strong cash conversion allows us to apply our high levels of excess free cash flow toward consistent reduction of our debt. In the first quarter, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million. Over the first three months of the year, our EBITDA growth, combined with debt reduction, enabled us to lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 4.7 to 4.2. We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to discuss our segment performance. Hey, Chris. Good morning. Yes, there's strength across those businesses. I think Neil mentioned CliniSys was strong, Sunquest had a nice quarter. Deltek, sort of perpetual license wins there. All that stuff comes in at really high incrementals, and that drove most of the margin performance. Good morning. Yes. So I'll give a crack at that. On an EBITDA margin basis, right, I mean Vertafore is a higher-EBITDA-margin business. So that -- you're seeing that and we talked about when we bought the business, it's around a 50% or so a little below that EBITDA margin business. So that helps. I think on a core basis, it's going to be relatively consistent year-over-year for the rest of the businesses on an EBITDA margin basis. And that's conversion at 40% to 50%. And that's just consistent with what we see in these businesses as they grow. And as you know, they have great cash characteristics, very negative working capital. So the cash flow growth can often be even faster than the EBITDA growth. And so it's a great story there and I think we'll continue to see margins high into that segment. Yes. That's right. Yes. So, the network software businesses are strong high single-digit organic for the rest of the year. That's the consistency in the recurring which we talked about has been growing all along. But then you do get a little bit of a bounce back in some of the markets. You mentioned Foundry and others. So, I think you're on the right track there. Neil do you want to add anything to that? Yes, Allison, it was a great start to deleveraging for Q1. So, that certainly helped boost our ability to pay down the debt faster and we'll continue to do that throughout the year. And as Neil mentioned, we're making sure the pipeline is active and there are some exciting things that we're looking at in the early stages and we'll be ready to deploy capital at some point. But for right now, we're really focused on the deleveraging. Yeah, I think that's right. I think it was one quarter, right? We had a really nice first quarter. And we felt it prudent to raise the guide, because it certainly gives us more confidence for the rest of the year. But it was one quarter and this is an unusual environment where we're coming off of a sort of hopefully once-a-lifetime pandemic. And so we're trying to be balanced in the outlook and sort of what we do with the businesses. Sure. So I think -- so in the first quarter right there's no federal tax payments. So that's always a high cash conversion quarter. So that normalizes more when we make the -- start making federal payments in Q2. But really as I mentioned a little bit earlier, I mean, it's great growth from the software businesses. They have negative working capital. Therefore, the cash performance is very strong. The more software growth you have, you drive working capital further negative. It's very structural part of the model. High conversion is embedded in everything that we do. So we expect that free cash flow conversion to continue to get better over time as we've improved the quality of our portfolio. So we feel good about the rest of the year and continue to have high cash conversion and continue that double-digit cash flow compounding that we all expect to achieve. Yes, sure. I wouldn't say a line in the sand. I think once you get into the low threes that \u2013certainly it's more reasonable. I think the \u2013 we spent a lot of time with the rating agencies, when we did our last couple of acquisitions. I think they understand the high quality of the cash flow that we have and our incredibly high cash conversion. And so it's really about how good our business model is, how fast we can pay down any leverage that we put on the business. I think we've demonstrated that time and time again and we can do it pretty quickly. So once we get into the low threes then I think we have the ability to deploy capital. So I'll \u2013 let me just hit a couple of things and then I think Neil wants to add on. But yes, you're right, there's this $100 million-plus tax benefit around Vertafore that we talked about that will hit throughout Q2 through Q4. We did not benefit from that in the first quarter. And then there's about $60 million or so of this payroll tax deferral which is a bad guy this year for the rest of the year, given that was part of the COVID rules that you can defer some of those payments. And there's always going to be pluses and minuses in sort of that part of the world, but I'll let Neil talk about some of the growth. I think so. The answer to that is yes, Alex. So it's really about the target the businesses that we target right? Businesses that have higher organic growth than Roper has historically businesses that have very good margins often better than Roper at least at the same level now that we've improved ours over many, many years. And then we buy those businesses. They grow. We hope \u2013 we believe we can make them better. They accelerate growth. They generate more cash and you get this compounding effect. And so it's really the same strategy that \u2013 I appreciate you've followed us for a long time \u2013 we've had for \u2013 for over a decade now. And it's \u2013 the good news is as you get more and more into software and these types of opportunities we find more and more companies that fit that model that will allow us to continue to improve all those metrics for many, many more years to come. Thank you, Alex. Hi, Richard. Yes. I might have to circle back. I mean, it's approaching probably 50-50 given the growth in the CliniSys business the fact the DI business is very global and the Sunquest business is mostly US. So as a group it's probably about half. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Incoming Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Incoming Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Unless otherwise noted, we will discuss our results and guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense; a legal charge related to the settlement of the Boral versus Verathon patent litigation matter. The case related to the sale of certain Verathon products from 2004 through 2016, there are no future financial obligations for Verathon related to this matter. Next, transaction-related expenses for completed acquisitions, and lastly, we have adjusted our cash flow statement to exclude the cash taxes paid related to our divestiture activity. GAAP requires these payments to be classified as operating cash flow items even though they are related to divestitures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. As we turn to Page 4, we'll walk through our usual year-end agenda, highlights for the most recent quarter and full year, followed by color commentary for each of our segments and then the initiation of our 2023 guidance. Let's go and get started. Next slide, please.  As we heard on Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are First, we delivered another great year of strategic, operational and financial progress. To this end, we concluded our multiyear divestiture program, which was centered on improving the quality of remaining portfolio, namely emphasizing less cyclical, more asset-light and higher-growth businesses. In addition, we successfully deployed $4.3 billion towards market-leading and application-specific software businesses. More on this later, but we also continue to have substantial M&A firepower well north of $4 billion. Organically, we grew just shy of 10% for the year while simultaneously improving the underlying quality of the enterprise. During the course of the year, our businesses did a terrific job of innovating and capturing share, which leads us to our second main takeaway for today's call that we're well positioned for another solid year of performance in 2023. Our higher quality, less cyclical and more highly recurring nature of our portfolio will serve us well during 2023. Now as I hand the call over to our Incoming CFO, Jason Conley, let me take a moment and thank Rob Crisci for all he's done for Roper and for me. Rob has been a significant contributor to our success and an important member of our executive team with meaningful insights and contributions across a variety of topics, including our most recent portfolio repositioning.  We're excited to welcome Jason to his new role. Many of you know, Jason, for those of you who do not, Jason has been with Roper for 16 years. He started in corporate IR and FP&A, then the operating CFO at MHA or one of our businesses and most recently serving as Roper's Chief Accounting Officer.  Since he has returned to corporate, he has been a member of our capital allocation team and has attended every Board meeting. The team and I are excited to partner with Jason for the next leg of our evolution. So, with that, looking forward to the partnership, Jason, and thank you, Rob, for all of you done to make Roper better than when you joined. Jason, let me turn the call over to you, can walk through the fourth quarter and the full year financial summary. Jason?\nJason Conley: Thanks, Neil. I am very excited and incredibly grateful for the opportunity to work with you and the team in this new role. And of course, thanks, Rob, for your awesome partnership and mentorship over the years. It's been just a great experience working together.  So first, I'd like to introduce Brandon Cross as our new Principal Accounting Officer. Brandon joined Roper about five years ago, progressing to our Assistant Controller and more recently, has led and transformed our audit services function. He has significant M&A and integration experience. So this is a natural and well-earned promotion for him. Brandon, I look forward to working together in your new role.\nBrandon Cross: Thanks, Jason.\nJason Conley: If you indulge me, I'll rip on Roper for a few seconds. I've been blessed to help guide and execute our evolution from Roper Industries to Roper Technologies, which has been underpinned by our North Star belief that cash is the best measure of performance. And as we enter 2023, our best years are ahead of us. We have a family of market-leading businesses with durable growth drivers and terrific free cash flow margins. Further, the leadership teams and talent processes at our businesses are the best in the company's history. And finally, we have significant capacity to execute our proven and disciplined M&A strategy that I've been a part of for many years. I anticipate being quite active on the road this year. So for those on the call, I look forward to either meeting you or reconnecting in the coming months. All right. Let's get into the financials. Turning to Slide 6. We'll do a quick review of our Q4 performance. We capped off a solid year of growth with revenue of over $1.4 billion, which was 14% higher over prior year. Organic growth was 7% with strength across the portfolio, which was enhanced by 10% software recurring revenue growth. Acquisitions added eight points of growth, led by our Frontline business that closed in early October, and currency was a two-point headwind. EBITDA of $592 million, was up 17% over the prior year. We experienced strong operating leverage across the enterprise and improving gross margins in our TEP segment to finish out the year. DEPS came in at $3.92, which was 17% against prior year and $0.18 above the midpoint of our guidance range.  Next, we'll look at free cash flow. free cash flow. Free cash flow of $457 million was down 8% over the prior year. Excluding the Section 174 impact, we were down 3%. And factoring out a $30 million Vertafore tax benefit in 2021 that doesn't repeat, we're up about 3% to 4% in the quarter. Taking a broader view, you can see we compounded cash 11% over a four-year period, despite the Section 174 headwind, and we're well positioned for double-digit cash flow compounding going forward. Turning to Slide 7. We'll now do a quick overview of our Q4 segment results, as Neil will unpack more detail on the full year a bit later. We had a nice finish to a great year across the three segments. For Application Software, revenue was up 22% to $740 million, with organic growth of 7%. EBITDA margin increased to 45.6% in the quarter. We had strong SaaS bookings growth and overall solid net retention throughout the year, which is just naturally rolling through recurring revenue in the quarter. Growth was broad-based across the segment, aside from some delayed decision-making in the large government contract in space within Deltek. On margin, we had lower incentive-based SG&A and employee medical costs, so some favorability in the quarter. If you look at the full year margin of 44%, that's about where we would expect to be over a longer horizon. Our Network Software segment grew nicely in the quarter, with revenue up 9% to $350 million and EBITDA also up 9% to $189 million or 54% of revenue. Growth was led by our freight matching businesses, which continued driving higher ARPU from premium offerings to offset moderating carry activity as we expected.  Tech-enabled products revenue was $340 million and grew 5% organically in the quarter. Demand remained strong, and we had some orders that didn't get delivered toward the end of the quarter, which will benefit Q1. EBITDA grew 7% to $119 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 34.9% or 100 basis points over prior year, with strong operating leverage as the price cost dynamic was neutralized in the quarter. Turning to the full year 2022 performance on Slide 8. Revenue was 11% higher than prior year to $5.4 billion, with 9% organic growth. EBITDA was 12% better to nearly $2.2 billion, with EBITDA margin coming in at 40.4%. The of $14.28, was 15% over prior year and reflected strong P&L leverage against the 11% revenue growth. Notably, compared to our 2018 pre-divestiture financial profile, our revenue is about $175 million higher, while EBITDA is nearly $365 million higher. So, through a combination of organic growth and capital deployment, we've grown despite divesting about 40% of our 2018 revenue. And most importantly, the composition of our portfolio today positions us for higher and more durable growth going forward.  Free cash flow came in at about $1.5 billion, so down 7% versus prior year. It's a bit of the same situation as our fourth quarter with both the 2022 headwinds of Section 174 of nearly $100 million and the nonrepeating of the 2021 Vertafore tax benefit of $117 million. If we normalize for those items, free cash flow grew about 8%. We've had a bit of an inventory build within our tech segment as supply has become more available. This is not a new normal, and we certainly expect that to improve in 2023.  If we kind of take this up to a multiyear view, you can see we've compounded cash at 15% over a four-year period. And as we look forward, the impact from Section 174 will be fairly neutral, and we expect to convert plus or minus 80% of flow. So, we're clearly well positioned for double-digit growth. Turning to Slide 9. Let's take a look at our financial position. We certainly had a lot going on in Q4. On November 22, we completed the majority sale of our industrial businesses, which are now operating under the name Indicor and received $2.6 billion in upfront proceeds. Also, in the quarter, we paid $270 million, representing all taxes due related to the majority sale. So, this yielded us net proceeds of over $2.3 billion, a very good outcome here indeed. Related to our stake in Indicor, this is now appearing as an equity investment on our balance sheet. We will be updating the fair value of the equity investment each quarter going forward. To provide a clearer picture of our continuing operations, we will provide a non-GAAP adjustment for this fair value accounting and any tax expense related to this investment.  So just looking at our balance sheet, even after our $3.7 billion Frontline acquisition, which was completed in October, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 2.7 times. So, our solid leverage profile, coupled with strong free cash flow generation and an undrawn revolver of $3.5 billion, gives us $4 billion plus of M&A capacity. Clearly, we are very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment in 2023.  And with that, I will turn the call back over to Neil to go through our segment details. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Jason, and well done. Let's turn to Page 11 and walk through our 2022 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $2.64 billion, up 7% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 44.1%. Performance across this segment was just solid in 2022.  Vertafore, our software business that tech enables property and casualty insurance agencies accelerated their growth, led by continued strength in their enterprise class segment. In addition, the two Vertafore bolt-on acquisitions are strategically on point, integrated and performing well. As we've been discussing, SaaS migrations have been a key theme for us over the past few years, and 2022 was no different. Both Aderant and Deltek continued their SaaS migration momentum and both grew nicely based on solid customer adds and strong retention. Deltek was particularly strong in their private sector end markets. But as Jason mentioned, Deltek did see some slower decision-making specific to new bookings in the enterprise segment for their GovCon solutions. At our upcoming March 21 Investor Day, you'll get an opportunity to hear directly from the leaders at Vertafore, Deltek and Aderant about how they're competing and consistently winning in the market. As it relates to Power Plant, we liked what we saw last year. PowerPlan was strong given their refocused and narrowed strategy combined with a highly aligned team. As a result, PowerPlan crossed a meaningful milestone, launching a SaaS solution for their flagship product, tax fixed assets. Congrats to the team for a great 2022 and looking forward to more great things in 2023. 2022 is a very good year for application health care IT businesses as well. Strata's combination with EPSI has just been great. The integration is complete and the number of EPSI, the Strata has conversions and upsell, cross-sell are both meaningfully ahead of our deal expectations.  Clinisys and Data Innovations continue to win in the marketplace. The internal combination of Clinisys and Sunquest has rejuvenated and energized their high-performance culture, which is enabling the business to more effectively compete and win in the marketplace. Data Innovations continues to gain share and evolve to become the de facto standard as it relates to Lab Middleware. Finally, Frontline, our cornerstone 2022 acquisition is off to a solid start. We look forward to sharing the strategic and financial success of this business in the quarters and years to come.  I'd like to reiterate with what we started with. Performance here strategically, operationally and financially was just great in 2022. Very proud of the team and the performance. Congrats and thanks. Looking to the outlook for 2023, we expect to see organic growth in the mid-single-digit area based on our market positions and growth in recurring revenues.  Turning to Page 12. Revenues in 2022 for our Network Software segment were $1.38 billion, up 13% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were strong at 53.3%. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses were great in 2022.  Their exceptional growth is based on many factors, certainly favorable market conditions, but also continued product and network innovations as well as terrific product and package designs that drove increased value for the network participants. iPipeline and iTrade network were stellar performers throughout 2022 and benefited from having strong renewal and expansion activity. iPipeline like that a PowerPlan is benefiting from having a narrowed and more focused strategy, namely tech-enabling the life insurance and annuity distribution network. Moving to Foundry, which had another great year as part of Roper. Foundry continues to be the market-leading software in postproduction media entertainment. During 2022, Foundry's product innovations were impressive with several new features focused on ML-based automation. Starting in 2023, Foundry's flagship product Nuke will begin its subscription transition, so looking forward for solid progress on that front. Growth in our businesses that focus on alternate site health care was led by SHP and SoftWriters and importantly, retention rates across SHP, SoftWriters and MHA remained extremely high. Broadly, the performance across this segment was great. Congrats to the teams for this terrific year of financial performance. Turning to the outlook for 2023. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on broad and sustained growth across the group and a normalization of market conditions for freight and logistics applications. As we turn to Page 13, revenues in 2022 for our Tech-enabled Products segment were $1.35 billion, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment were 35.4% for the year. As expected, EBITDA margins expanded in the second half of the year as pricing and supply chain improvements flow through.  Let's start with Neptune, our water meter and technology product business. This past year was just terrific with very strong growth based on strong margin conditions, strong share gains and strong adoption of their static ultrasonic meter technology. In addition, Neptune launched their cellular connectivity solution and did a fantastic job migrating a large chunk of their customer base to their newest data management solution. Spectacular job Neptune, congrats you and your team.  Northern Digital, which is our precision measurement tech company, continued to see terrific demand for their optical and EM solutions. NDI benefits from having a strategy that is laser-focused on health care applications and an R&D capability that is unmatched in the industry. NDI's core tech is using countless life-saving procedures on a daily basis across the globe. Verathon turned in another solid year performance in 2022 as well. The growth is based on momentum across their video innovation and single-use bronchoscope product lines. As you saw in the press release, we did take the opportunity to clean up a legacy patent dispute. Make no mistake, the innovation capability at Verathon is nothing short of exceptional, and we cannot be more confident about their most recent product launches and the new concepts in the development pipeline. As it relates to the single-use rock space, we hope to see Verathon capture the number one market position in North America in 2023. Our outlook for the year in this segment is in the high single-digit area and is based on continued strength in backlog at Neptune as well as continued growth across our medical product businesses.  Specific to the first quarter, we do have easier comps versus a year ago. Now please turn to Page 15, and let's review our 2023 and Q1 guidance. For 2023, we're initiating our DEPS guidance to be in the range of $15.90 and $16.20. Underpinning this guidance is expected organic growth of 5% to 6% and a tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. Specific to the first quarter, we're establishing our DEPS guidance to be in the $3.80 to $3.84 range.  Now please turn with us to our final page, Page 16. As we turn to this page, we want to leave you with the same key points with which we started. First, 2022 was a year of great accomplishment for our teams and our enterprise. We grew revenue 11%, 9% on an organic basis. And we did this while continuing to increase the underlying quality of our revenue base. In fact, we delivered double-digit increases in our Software organic recurring revenue during 2022. EBITDA grew 12%. Our EBITDA margins expanded 20 basis points to 40.4%. Also, we successfully concluded our multiyear divestiture program and deployed $4.3 billion against our long-standing capital deployment strategy, headlined by Frontline Education.  The second key takeaway is that we're well positioned for double-digit cash flow compounding in 2023 based on our organic revenue growth outlook, contributions from our 2022 acquisition cohort and having well north of $4 billion of M&A capacity. To this end, we continue to be very active in the M&A markets. But as you saw during 2022 and as always, we will remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital.  Finally, and perhaps the most important, the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we've never been more excited about the future of enterprise. As we open up to your questions, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that we're hosting an Investor Day on Tuesday, March 21, in New York. We look forward to seeing many of you there.  So with that, let\u2019s open it up to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just start with the best wishes to Rob. I remember when he was a starting as a rookie Investor Relations professional and just wish him all the best. Thank you.\nRobert Crisci: Thank you, Deane, I appreciate it. It's been a great decade.\nDeane Dray: It's fabulous. And then, Jason, I think you've been on every one of our callbacks for the 16 years. So you're absolutely -- we know exactly who you are and your experience. And so congrats on the new role.\nJason Conley: Thanks, Deane. Appreciated. \nDeane Dray: All right. So for a question, maybe we can start with a bit of a macroeconomic sensitivity because you typically, you don't see much of this within Roper, but just called out the Deltek delayed decision-making, Neil, is there any change in the pace of like new customer adds or the migration, new logos? Anything that you would point to that perhaps there is some economic sensitivity reading through in that kind of the pace of business?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I think the -- if I take it at the highest level, we've been 8% to 10% organic. The last couple of years, obviously, are guiding a little bit below that for 2023. So I think you see it in our guidance model reading through as a general matter. If you take the Software businesses, our retention rates will stay very high. We expect that as to the intimacy and the criticality of our applications. So retention rates to be very high. But as our customers, I mean, across all these end markets, I mean, if there's macroeconomic sort of headwinds or slowdown, then they're going to be affected to some degree, so we expect customer expansion activity maybe a little bit of net new to be slowed a little bit. The Software businesses will be great. They'll grow for sure, but a little bit slower. From an end market perspective, we're in a number of end markets that are generally macro insensitive. There's a little bit, obviously, in our transportation business is that we called out on the call. That will be a little bit slower. But there's some hedges inside the portfolio. ConstructConnect should be good in the slower economic environment and also our medical product businesses as staffing levels and hospitals gets a little bit easier. Patient volume should come back and that should help those businesses. And then from a product, Neptune has got a gigantic amount of backlog, which will carry them through much of this year. So we feel pretty well set up. It doesn't mean that we're completely insensitive to macro, but relatively insensitive.\nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. And then let's just switch over to free cash flow and maybe I'll be accused of quibbling. The $161 million free cash flow conversion is still elite, but it did lag your five-year average. And I know there's some dynamics here, and you touched on them in the remarks, the Section 174 and the comparison from the tax benefit last year. Anything that on the working capital side or maybe the Frontline contribution because they're on a different school year, so maybe more of a third quarter collection. But is there any change in the seasonal tilt on free cash flow conversion?\nRobert Crisci: Yes, Deane, good question. I think you're spot on. So we typically convert on -- from an EBITDA to free cash flow will be in the 90s typically and Section 174. If we adjust for that, we are in the 80s. And so you're right. Frontline has a very seasonal sort of cash collection cadence. So the third quarters when all the renewals and upsells happen, so most of their cash comes in the third quarter. So in the fourth, you won't see that converting to cash from EBITDA. So that's exactly what you saw. So we're looking forward to next year and especially in the third quarter will be a little bit more weighted than normal.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s great. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re looking for. Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead. \nScott Davis: Good morning, guys. Congrats, Rob, and good luck, Jason, et cetera. I wish you guys well, but [indiscernible]. Jason you get to work a few more years with Neil. Good luck.\nJason Conley: Fair enough. \nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nScott Davis: I can say that, I guess. But anyways, I don't want to climb in a minutia here, but I know there's no one particular asset that moves the needle in a huge way. But can we walk back and talk a little bit about PowerPlan? I mean you mentioned the narrower product focus. I think, I heard you say, which didn't really understand what that meant. And the cloud rollout, again, like is that -- how relevant is that to the business? And -- but maybe if we just go back and you can explain to us again what kind of drives PowerPlan? And I'll just leave it there and leave it behind. \nNeil Hunn: I appreciate the opportunity to talk about, anyway our businesses, it's been a while since we've been able to do a double-click on PowerPlan. So just remind you what they do, right? So PowerPlan software and services live at the intersection of the financial system and the asset tracking system for these large utilities, investor-owned and public utilities. And when the PowerPlan software has a perfectly curated view of what the assets look like inside our customer base. When you have that perfectly curated view and these assets are constantly being updated and changed, they're not static, right? And so that's why you have to live between these two systems. And we have this perfectly curated view of what the assets are, then you get the most appropriate tax treatment you can, the most appropriate lease accounting and a series of other financial benefits associated with that. We bought the business. The business was doing that, but it was also reaching outside its core customer base and the core products I just described, looking for growth sort of in all the wrong places, if you will. And then we -- what we did when we did our strategy work with them going back probably a year, 1.5 years ago is the amount of opportunity inside the core of what they do was large enough to support the growth thesis for many years to come. So it's just refocusing back on the core. That's a common theme. We talked about that. I think you'll see that increasingly more inside of Ropers as we do our strategy work, right? So not getting too far away from the core and getting distracted. So that's what they've done. The first impact of that is they now have this 100% SaaS solution for their principal product fixed assets just released in Q4. And we're excited by that because as you lift and shift your customer base from an on-premise to a cloud solution, there's a tremendous value capture opportunity, and it will unlock some growth for the business.\nScott Davis: And can you get pricing in the process? Or is this just more about retention?\nNeil Hunn: No, that's the value unlock, right? So we're doing more for our customers with the SaaS solution, right? So we're not just hosting it. There's more features. You're on the latest release, where certainly, we know how to operate our software ourselves better than third parties. And so it's the efficiency and the uptime is higher. And as a result of all that, you do get price. We'll see we talked about there's roughly $900 million in legacy on-premise maintenance in our revenue base. And as that is lifting and shifting to the cloud over a long arc of time, that should lift and shift north of 2 times, right? So there's $1 billion of growth that's latent inside the portfolio as we lift and shift that on-premise maintenance to the cloud.\nScott Davis: Okay. I look forward to the Analyst Day. I'm going to pass it on. Thanks, guys. Congrats on another good year. See you on Analyst Day. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell at Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Thank you, Rob. And I look forward to working with you, Jason. So maybe my first question, just to try and home in a little bit more on the sort of macro framework in the guide. Maybe specifically, I think about 25% of your Software revenue is reoccurring and non-recurring, so maybe more cyclical kind of talk. Maybe just remind us sort of what the organic growth of those two in aggregate was last year and what you're dialing in for 2023 or any flavor of that? And then within Network Software specifically, transport and freight, it's almost 1.25 of the revenue. And you mentioned you're dialing in, I think, normalization was your phrase. Maybe just any finer point on what that means exactly of growth this year versus last?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So let me take -- let's take those, Jason, I take those in sequence. So I'll set up what the difference between recurring and reoccurring revenue is in our base. I'll let Jason talk about the relative growth rate, then we'll tackle the DAT freight question you're raising.  So just to level set what everybody is, if we have a recurring revenue is subscription, contractual recurring revenue, reoccurring revenue is principally located at our MHA business. We take a percentage of the drug and food spend that goes to the network and so it's not technically recurring, it's highly reoccurring. So it's not -- and that's probably the most -- one of the most stable parts of our portfolio, long-term care, health care, residents and buildings, consuming food and pharmaceuticals, right? So it's highly secure for lack of a better word. It's not transactional relative to a macroeconomic sort of situation. So I'll stop just in terms of framing recurring versus reoccurring. I'll let Jason take the relative growth rate question.\nJason Conley: Yes, sure, glad to. So MHA, as Neil mentioned, it's really about drug purchases from the pharmacies, and they have very strong retention in those businesses from a customer standpoint. We always sort of think about the business being at the -- maybe at the bottom end of the mid-single digits, maybe a little bit low singles. And that's sort of what we experienced this year, and that's kind of what we're baking in for next year.\nNeil Hunn: Great. Okay. Now let's take to your freight and logistics around DAT specifically. So to remind you, there's this tension between the cyclical freight dynamic and a secular push or a secular benefit that DAT and DAT's customers are experiencing relative to the spot market becoming a more efficient place to place freight. So there's tension between those two.  From a cyclical point of view, we expected and have seen the carrier side of the network reduce a little bit. And it's -- and we expect it to reduce over the course or shrink or get a little bit smaller over the course of this year. DAT grew through the 2019 freight recession. I think DAT has grown every year since 2010. So the business is talking about the rate of growth at DAT, not does it expand and contract. It tends to be much more stickier than that. As an early read, January is actually a little bit better. I mean the number of carriers in the network is sort of flattish through January and not declining. And the people in the industry that sort of call like the freight timing and if there's going to be a freight recession, I actually think there's a queuing for a large spring shipping season, mostly around -- this triggered by produce. And we might start to be seeing a little bit of that bleed in, but we'll have to see how the next couple of quarters play out.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you for the color. And then just within TEP, I understand the recurring piece is minimal there in its 99% product-related. Any flavor you'd give us on the sort of what you're seeing in medical versus Neptune for 2023, any major difference in kind of visibility between the 2two or the growth rate expected?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So we have the most visibility we've ever had at Neptune. That's right. The order volume continues to flow. The order duration, meaning the longer date orders continues to flow. And so we feel quite comfortable and good how 2023 is shaping for Neptune.  For medical products, there's actually -- I think we've talked about a few quarters ago, the reoccurring elements of Verathon became the largest part of the revenue stream. There's a lot of consumable pull-through in the capital equipment there. Northern Digital has a decently high amount of consumables that are pulled through that zip code [ph]. And so it is more procedure and patient driven. And we like I said a few minutes ago, we feel that were decently well set up there, but it's not in our base case.  So we saw 6% to 8% declines in patient volumes in the areas in which we service in 2022, all tied to hospital staffing levels. And we're cautiously optimistic that as the labor market solution, hospitals be able to staff and be able to see patient volumes pick back up the prior levels.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Steve Tusa at JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nSteve Tusa: Good morning. Congrats to all. Rob and Jason, I'm looking forward to working with you. Just on the free cash, you mentioned plus or minus 80% conversion to EBITDA. Obviously, the last couple of years have been a bit volatile around all these tax items. But in '21, I think you had a decent number of deferred revenue benefit on the cash flow statement. Maybe just give us a little bit of color looking into next year with concerns around the macro that can be a pretty big variable. I mean are you going to be around that 80% in '23? Or will you be kind of more in between what you did in '21 and '22, I think, adjusted around 70%? Maybe just a bit of color on the free cash, and then I have a follow-up on Frontline.\nJason Conley: Yes, happy to. No, I think we're feeling very good about the 80% Our deferred revenue, our renewals were really strong this quarter, and we felt good how it moved up sequentially, how was up year-over-year. And just what we're hearing from our businesses, we feel good about the renewals. And then we're going to have -- we expect -- I think I said on the call that we'll get some improvement on our inventory ratios next year. We had a little bit of build at the end of this year. Frontline will certainly help with our negative working capital profile. They're at negative 40%. Like I said, most of that will hit in the third quarter when all the renewals take place. Of course, if Section 174 gets repealed, this will be a home run year, but we're not banking on that for now.\nSteve Tusa: So like something in the $1.8 billion range for free cash for next year?\nJason Conley: I'll let you come to your math on that.\nNeil Hunn: Okay. We will.\nSteve Tusa: And then just Frontline, revenues roughly $95 million this quarter. Is that about right?\nJason Conley: No. They were somewhere in the '80s. We had a few days knocked off at the beginning of the quarter because we closed on the 4th.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. By the way, I really appreciate all the discussion on the businesses and looking forward to the Investor Day, learning more on this portfolio. So very helpful detail on the moving parts of all the different businesses.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nAllison Poliniak: Good morning. Just want to circle back on DAT. I know you talked about it growing historically through cycles, but it's certainly been an unusual one. A lot of new entrants here. Is there any risk to the retention rate should that spot rate not hold in terms of stabilization in some of those new entrants, I guess, can't survive? And then I guess along with that, that premium offering, in this type of uncertainty, does that drive maybe more increase or interest in that premium offering versus just to gain some visibility here in an uncertain market? Just any thoughts there?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So in terms of the number of -- when you say new entrants, I assume you're referring to the number of new carriers that are in the network as opposed to a competitive entry or the sort because there really are no new competitive entrants. Relative to the carriers, yes, I mean, it was -- it's been just a tremendous last couple of years, driven by the things we've talked about for a couple of years, which is the fluidity and the liquidity in the spot market, which is a secular tailwind and then obviously, a huge boom on the cyclical piece. We -- historically, when you look at like peak carriers to trough carriers through cycle, it sort of goes carriers declines by plus or minus 10%. We've assumed that it will decline by more than that in our guidance model because the buildup was unprecedented. But -- so that's sort of -- we think we have this conservatively planned in our outlook, but it's unprecedented ramp up leading up to this. We do take some early confidence in the carrier count in the first couple of weeks of January. So the fact that we're flattish versus continuing to see some declines is certainly encouraging, but it's only a handful of data points we want to see take together. In terms of the premium offering, I mean, DAT has just done a tremendous job creating product and package designs that have more value for all the network participants. It's helped drive some ARPU increases because there's more value that the participants are getting.\nJason Conley: So different packages, different features and functionality that they've upsold.\nNeil Hunn: That's right.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. No, that's helpful. And then just in terms of the M&A pipeline, are you still under the new portfolio, PE primarily your source of opportunities here? Have you expanded it? And if I guess if you have, are you looking -- I know CRI is your metric that is your foundation. But are you providing any other controls with maybe some new opportunities out there? Just any thoughts there?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. You're right. We've obviously historically sourced all. But in my time here, I think one meaningful deal from private equity. One was from a small founder or founder, and that has been sort of the pod in which we fish. But we're -- that's not exclusively where we have business development activities going on. We've always looked in public markets. We just haven't found anything that's been compelling from a value point of view yet. We'll continue to look there. You could see us get a little bit earlier in the cycle and try to compete a little bit more with private equity sort of half a click earlier in the company's life cycle. So when we did the Vertafore transaction and the Frontline transaction, many of our investors said, why didn't you buy it when the first you bought it from a private equity firm, you bought it from bought it. And so that's something that you could see us explore in the right situations. But still, all that being said, the predominance of what we're going to do is what we've done for the last 20 years, which is sort of lower risk of highly recurring software -- application software businesses from private equity.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Brent Hewitt with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nBrent Hewitt : Hi, thank you. And good morning. You noted that your adjusted EPS calculation will include the fair value accounting and tax impact of Indicor. But why would you not include the minority interest contribution as well? Just wondering what is the logical downside not including that, shouldn't it be a positive and growing contribution?\nJason Conley: Well, it's a calculation that's going to be based on many variables, right? It's mainly an accounting exercise. We don't think that it's going to -- we'd rather see the outcome when we do the exit. We think that's the better reflection of what the economics are going to be. We feel really good about what that's going to look like. We've worked with CD&R on a strategy there. They typically look at several multiples of return on investment, and that's what we're playing for upon exit.\nBrent Hewitt: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then in terms of price contribution in Q4, what did that look like? And then also how much pricing is embedded in your 2023 guidance?\nNeil Hunn: So price for us, I mean, it's an important lever to our growth algorithm, not just for '22 and '23, but all prior years and all forward years. Teasing out specifically how much is price is a very, very difficult thing across our 27 companies and rolling it up to a number that is meaningful. And so we're not going to share a specific number in that regard. I'll tell you the pricing, the value capture that we have, given what we do, the criticality of what we do, we've always had pricing power and pricing value capture and there's nothing different with that. Do you want to add anything to that, Jason? Perhaps, we go to the next question?\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Brendan Luke with Bernstein. Please go ahead. \nBrendan Luke: Good morning. Just wanted to take a quick look at macro, question here. I was wondering if you could offer any color on your exposure to construction end markets? And how that's playing into your growth expectations for FY '23. And I guess, specifically, I'd be curious around Deltek, ConstructConnect and Neptune as well.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So I appreciate the opportunity there. So let's just take it by those three. So ConstructConnect, to remind you what it is, right, so we have a near perfect database of all the construction -- commercial construction projects that are in the planning phase across North America. As a result, when -- it has a bit of countercyclical demand attached to it. So when there is a tremendous amount of new projects and you're a subcontractor general contract and building product manufacturing and business is flowing from everywhere, then you don't have to look too hard for what you're going to do next. When there's fewer projects, then you subscribe to the subscription service of ConstructConnect so you can identify what projects are coming down the pipe that you want to try to bid for and win. And so the ConstructConnect has been a modestly good performer for us over the years. We expect it to actually have a good run here in '23 as a result. Deltek does have -- it's been a strategic focus of Deltek. Deltek is 60% government contracting, 40% private sector and private sector. The smallest sliver is construction and we sell software to large contractors. That's what we do. That business, we -- in our prepared comments, we talked about how the private sector was very strong in Q4 for Deltek. We would expect and do anticipate some softening on the construction side for Deltek in 2023, and we think we have that fully covered in our guidance. And then Neptune, we believe strongly Neptune is not a cyclical business. As you sell water meters and water meter technology to the municipalities when they're -- they tend to have a budget for meters. When there is a large new residential new construction, then a higher percentage of the budget goes to install new meters. When there's fewer new starts, the budget stays the same, but they take the meters and they do the retrofits and trade outs of the aging fleet and infrastructure. So that is a general cross-cycle sort of view of Neptune, But then we're further -- our confidence is further buoyed by the fact that we have this just unprecedented amount of backlog at Neptune for 2023. So we think that Neptune will perform well for us this year.\nBrendan Luke: Very useful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Rob Mason at Baird. Please go ahead. \nRobMason: Yes, good morning. And congrats as well to Jason and Rob. Maybe just stick on the technology-enabled products area. I think the -- there was a mention of some products didn't ship in the quarter maybe got pushed. Just to step back, maybe update us where you think you are around supply chain just on the product side in your businesses? And then I'm curious what kind of impact that those deferral shipments might have had in the fourth quarter?\nNeil Hunn: Let me just set it up, and I'll hand it over to Jason. So in TEP, we talk obviously -- about Neptune, we talk about medical process. There's also a small cohort of RF product businesses [indiscernible] and RF Ideas. The fourth quarter was particularly brutal supply chain wise on those RF product businesses. And so with that, I'll give it to Jason to sort of talk through anything you'd like to.\nJason Conley: Yes. It wasn't significant. It was probably in the $5 million to $10 million range, and it was across a number of businesses. So I think we expect the first quarter for TEP to be up a little bit more than the rest of the year because of that and because of some of the easier comps. So maybe low double digits in the first quarter, but that's sort of the range. So yes, a lot of this is in the rearview. Of course, things do pop up here and there, but we're not hearing as much sort of meaningful impact in the quarters.\nNeil Hunn: And as a general matter, we're not the only ones that. But supply chain is generally, as Jason just said, improving and there's essentially the chip shortage and chip issues. There's more of a globally is just -- but we're not -- you're not just hearing that from us. We do think this -- the supply chain issues abate over '23.\nRob Mason: Sure, sure. Neil, you've made several references to Neptune through the call and share gains and the strength in your backlog. And that tends to be a business where share doesn't move around that dramatically. I'm just -- could you expound a little bit just on how what's going on there? What you've done, whether it relates to ultrasonic adoption or the introduction of cellular? Or is this a broader effort at Neptune that's driving that?\nNeil Hunn: Neptune has been just a steady and consistent share gainer made the whole time I've been here, right? I mean, for a decade. And the reasons for that are manifold, but they have a product orientation that starts with, they never want to strand their existing customers with technology. So for instance, this goes back to the prior iteration of communication software, but the proprietary protocols between mobile and fixed point, Neptune has a solution where if you're a municipality and you can have one fixed point, roaming points and still have some manual reads and the master data management software package in Neptune can ingest all that data and you don't strand a customer having to pick piece of technology for the totality of what they have to do. So it comes from a product orientation that starts with flexibility.  The second thing is the products are just well thought out for the long arc of what the customer wants to do. For instance, on the large commercial meters for ultrasonic, you have to be able to read high flow and low flow equally accurate our products do that. So think about a big hotel application, a trickle that happened 3 in the morning versus the high flow takes their showers in the morning, our ultrasonic meter will perfectly read the low flow and the high flow and the competitive products have to tend to be focused on one or the other for the precision. More so for that application when the ultrasonic -- the battery that drives the ultrasonic technology needs to be replaced. In our case, it's essentially a drop in battery, the competitors you have to cut the meter out and replace the meter. So it's small things -- it's seemingly small things like that, that help drive market share gains over a long arc of time.  Final thing I would say, in 2022, it was particularly beneficial for us because we had product availability throughout the totality of the year. And so some of our competitors were quoting year plus lead times. I think our lead times went from like 8 to 12 weeks. And so just some accounts that we typically have not had any presence in, they need meters, we can deliver meters, all of a sudden, you have presence and the opportunity to compete in that account. So that's helped gain some market share in the relative short term.\nRob Mason: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Alex Blanton Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead. \nAlexBlanton: Thank you. Good morning. First, I just want to say that I think your format for the slide presentation this time is probably the best ever. And I think you should stick with it. It's really a great presentation.\nNeil Hunn: Noted.\nAlex Blanton: Now most of my questions have been answered, but something came up from one of the other participants regarding the business that accumulates commercial construction plans. And Barry Sternick, who's the CEO of Starwood was on CNBC yesterday, saying that in his business and across the board really in commercial construction, as interest rates have gone up, people will complete the projects they have, but hold off on starting new ones. And so that's why he's looking for a big drop in commercial construction in the second half of this year because new projects are sliding. Do you see that in your statistics?\nNeil Hunn: So it's interesting. So I can add Zach -- ConstructConnect publishes, look at that quarterly, quarterly the macro of what they're seeing from a construction planning point of view, and I can have Zack for that to you. I have not read the -- personally, I've not read the most recent report yet, so I don't want to comment on its content, but we can send that to you.\nAlex Blanton: Okay. Because it would seem that if new construction projects are not being put into implementation, it would show up in those numbers, wouldn't it?\nNeil Hunn: So here's the countercyclical nature of that. And so if you have several hundred thousand construction workers, construction, small subcontracting firms ConstructConnect has tens of thousands of customers. So as those hundreds of thousands are looking for work, it only takes a small percentage of that cohort to become a customer of ours to exhibit countercyclical growth behavior, which is what's happened in every prior slowdown in the history that we've been able to observe with ConstructConnect.\nAlex Blanton: Okay. So you're really talking about your business and market share rather than the overall trend of that market.\nNeil Hunn: Correct.\nAlex Blanton: Yes. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we hope to see you all at our Investor Day on March 21 in New York.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

As we turn to Page 4, we'll walk through our usual year-end agenda, highlights for the most recent quarter and full year, followed by color commentary for each of our segments and then the initiation of our 2023 guidance. Let's go and get started. Next slide, please.  As we heard on Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are First, we delivered another great year of strategic, operational and financial progress. To this end, we concluded our multiyear divestiture program, which was centered on improving the quality of remaining portfolio, namely emphasizing less cyclical, more asset-light and higher-growth businesses. In addition, we successfully deployed $4.3 billion towards market-leading and application-specific software businesses. More on this later, but we also continue to have substantial M&A firepower well north of $4 billion. Organically, we grew just shy of 10% for the year while simultaneously improving the underlying quality of the enterprise. During the course of the year, our businesses did a terrific job of innovating and capturing share, which leads us to our second main takeaway for today's call that we're well positioned for another solid year of performance in 2023. Our higher quality, less cyclical and more highly recurring nature of our portfolio will serve us well during 2023. Now as I hand the call over to our Incoming CFO, Jason Conley, let me take a moment and thank Rob Crisci for all he's done for Roper and for me. Rob has been a significant contributor to our success and an important member of our executive team with meaningful insights and contributions across a variety of topics, including our most recent portfolio repositioning.  We're excited to welcome Jason to his new role. Many of you know, Jason, for those of you who do not, Jason has been with Roper for 16 years. He started in corporate IR and FP&A, then the operating CFO at MHA or one of our businesses and most recently serving as Roper's Chief Accounting Officer.  Since he has returned to corporate, he has been a member of our capital allocation team and has attended every Board meeting. The team and I are excited to partner with Jason for the next leg of our evolution. So, with that, looking forward to the partnership, Jason, and thank you, Rob, for all of you done to make Roper better than when you joined. Jason, let me turn the call over to you, can walk through the fourth quarter and the full year financial summary. Jason? Thanks, Jason, and well done. Let's turn to Page 11 and walk through our 2022 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $2.64 billion, up 7% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 44.1%. Performance across this segment was just solid in 2022.  Vertafore, our software business that tech enables property and casualty insurance agencies accelerated their growth, led by continued strength in their enterprise class segment. In addition, the two Vertafore bolt-on acquisitions are strategically on point, integrated and performing well. As we've been discussing, SaaS migrations have been a key theme for us over the past few years, and 2022 was no different. Both Aderant and Deltek continued their SaaS migration momentum and both grew nicely based on solid customer adds and strong retention. Deltek was particularly strong in their private sector end markets. But as Jason mentioned, Deltek did see some slower decision-making specific to new bookings in the enterprise segment for their GovCon solutions. At our upcoming March 21 Investor Day, you'll get an opportunity to hear directly from the leaders at Vertafore, Deltek and Aderant about how they're competing and consistently winning in the market. As it relates to Power Plant, we liked what we saw last year. PowerPlan was strong given their refocused and narrowed strategy combined with a highly aligned team. As a result, PowerPlan crossed a meaningful milestone, launching a SaaS solution for their flagship product, tax fixed assets. Congrats to the team for a great 2022 and looking forward to more great things in 2023. 2022 is a very good year for application health care IT businesses as well. Strata's combination with EPSI has just been great. The integration is complete and the number of EPSI, the Strata has conversions and upsell, cross-sell are both meaningfully ahead of our deal expectations.  Clinisys and Data Innovations continue to win in the marketplace. The internal combination of Clinisys and Sunquest has rejuvenated and energized their high-performance culture, which is enabling the business to more effectively compete and win in the marketplace. Data Innovations continues to gain share and evolve to become the de facto standard as it relates to Lab Middleware. Finally, Frontline, our cornerstone 2022 acquisition is off to a solid start. We look forward to sharing the strategic and financial success of this business in the quarters and years to come.  I'd like to reiterate with what we started with. Performance here strategically, operationally and financially was just great in 2022. Very proud of the team and the performance. Congrats and thanks. Looking to the outlook for 2023, we expect to see organic growth in the mid-single-digit area based on our market positions and growth in recurring revenues.  Turning to Page 12. Revenues in 2022 for our Network Software segment were $1.38 billion, up 13% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were strong at 53.3%. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses were great in 2022.  Their exceptional growth is based on many factors, certainly favorable market conditions, but also continued product and network innovations as well as terrific product and package designs that drove increased value for the network participants. iPipeline and iTrade network were stellar performers throughout 2022 and benefited from having strong renewal and expansion activity. iPipeline like that a PowerPlan is benefiting from having a narrowed and more focused strategy, namely tech-enabling the life insurance and annuity distribution network. Moving to Foundry, which had another great year as part of Roper. Foundry continues to be the market-leading software in postproduction media entertainment. During 2022, Foundry's product innovations were impressive with several new features focused on ML-based automation. Starting in 2023, Foundry's flagship product Nuke will begin its subscription transition, so looking forward for solid progress on that front. Growth in our businesses that focus on alternate site health care was led by SHP and SoftWriters and importantly, retention rates across SHP, SoftWriters and MHA remained extremely high. Broadly, the performance across this segment was great. Congrats to the teams for this terrific year of financial performance. Turning to the outlook for 2023. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on broad and sustained growth across the group and a normalization of market conditions for freight and logistics applications. As we turn to Page 13, revenues in 2022 for our Tech-enabled Products segment were $1.35 billion, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment were 35.4% for the year. As expected, EBITDA margins expanded in the second half of the year as pricing and supply chain improvements flow through.  Let's start with Neptune, our water meter and technology product business. This past year was just terrific with very strong growth based on strong margin conditions, strong share gains and strong adoption of their static ultrasonic meter technology. In addition, Neptune launched their cellular connectivity solution and did a fantastic job migrating a large chunk of their customer base to their newest data management solution. Spectacular job Neptune, congrats you and your team.  Northern Digital, which is our precision measurement tech company, continued to see terrific demand for their optical and EM solutions. NDI benefits from having a strategy that is laser-focused on health care applications and an R&D capability that is unmatched in the industry. NDI's core tech is using countless life-saving procedures on a daily basis across the globe. Verathon turned in another solid year performance in 2022 as well. The growth is based on momentum across their video innovation and single-use bronchoscope product lines. As you saw in the press release, we did take the opportunity to clean up a legacy patent dispute. Make no mistake, the innovation capability at Verathon is nothing short of exceptional, and we cannot be more confident about their most recent product launches and the new concepts in the development pipeline. As it relates to the single-use rock space, we hope to see Verathon capture the number one market position in North America in 2023. Our outlook for the year in this segment is in the high single-digit area and is based on continued strength in backlog at Neptune as well as continued growth across our medical product businesses.  Specific to the first quarter, we do have easier comps versus a year ago. Now please turn to Page 15, and let's review our 2023 and Q1 guidance. For 2023, we're initiating our DEPS guidance to be in the range of $15.90 and $16.20. Underpinning this guidance is expected organic growth of 5% to 6% and a tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. Specific to the first quarter, we're establishing our DEPS guidance to be in the $3.80 to $3.84 range.  Now please turn with us to our final page, Page 16. As we turn to this page, we want to leave you with the same key points with which we started. First, 2022 was a year of great accomplishment for our teams and our enterprise. We grew revenue 11%, 9% on an organic basis. And we did this while continuing to increase the underlying quality of our revenue base. In fact, we delivered double-digit increases in our Software organic recurring revenue during 2022. EBITDA grew 12%. Our EBITDA margins expanded 20 basis points to 40.4%. Also, we successfully concluded our multiyear divestiture program and deployed $4.3 billion against our long-standing capital deployment strategy, headlined by Frontline Education.  The second key takeaway is that we're well positioned for double-digit cash flow compounding in 2023 based on our organic revenue growth outlook, contributions from our 2022 acquisition cohort and having well north of $4 billion of M&A capacity. To this end, we continue to be very active in the M&A markets. But as you saw during 2022 and as always, we will remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital.  Finally, and perhaps the most important, the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we've never been more excited about the future of enterprise. As we open up to your questions, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that we're hosting an Investor Day on Tuesday, March 21, in New York. We look forward to seeing many of you there.  So with that, let's open it up to your questions. Yes. I think the -- if I take it at the highest level, we've been 8% to 10% organic. The last couple of years, obviously, are guiding a little bit below that for 2023. So I think you see it in our guidance model reading through as a general matter. If you take the Software businesses, our retention rates will stay very high. We expect that as to the intimacy and the criticality of our applications. So retention rates to be very high. But as our customers, I mean, across all these end markets, I mean, if there's macroeconomic sort of headwinds or slowdown, then they're going to be affected to some degree, so we expect customer expansion activity maybe a little bit of net new to be slowed a little bit. The Software businesses will be great. They'll grow for sure, but a little bit slower. From an end market perspective, we're in a number of end markets that are generally macro insensitive. There's a little bit, obviously, in our transportation business is that we called out on the call. That will be a little bit slower. But there's some hedges inside the portfolio. ConstructConnect should be good in the slower economic environment and also our medical product businesses as staffing levels and hospitals gets a little bit easier. Patient volume should come back and that should help those businesses. And then from a product, Neptune has got a gigantic amount of backlog, which will carry them through much of this year. So we feel pretty well set up. It doesn't mean that we're completely insensitive to macro, but relatively insensitive. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about, anyway our businesses, it's been a while since we've been able to do a double-click on PowerPlan. So just remind you what they do, right? So PowerPlan software and services live at the intersection of the financial system and the asset tracking system for these large utilities, investor-owned and public utilities. And when the PowerPlan software has a perfectly curated view of what the assets look like inside our customer base. When you have that perfectly curated view and these assets are constantly being updated and changed, they're not static, right? And so that's why you have to live between these two systems. And we have this perfectly curated view of what the assets are, then you get the most appropriate tax treatment you can, the most appropriate lease accounting and a series of other financial benefits associated with that. We bought the business. The business was doing that, but it was also reaching outside its core customer base and the core products I just described, looking for growth sort of in all the wrong places, if you will. And then we -- what we did when we did our strategy work with them going back probably a year, 1.5 years ago is the amount of opportunity inside the core of what they do was large enough to support the growth thesis for many years to come. So it's just refocusing back on the core. That's a common theme. We talked about that. I think you'll see that increasingly more inside of Ropers as we do our strategy work, right? So not getting too far away from the core and getting distracted. So that's what they've done. The first impact of that is they now have this 100% SaaS solution for their principal product fixed assets just released in Q4. And we're excited by that because as you lift and shift your customer base from an on-premise to a cloud solution, there's a tremendous value capture opportunity, and it will unlock some growth for the business. No, that's the value unlock, right? So we're doing more for our customers with the SaaS solution, right? So we're not just hosting it. There's more features. You're on the latest release, where certainly, we know how to operate our software ourselves better than third parties. And so it's the efficiency and the uptime is higher. And as a result of all that, you do get price. We'll see we talked about there's roughly $900 million in legacy on-premise maintenance in our revenue base. And as that is lifting and shifting to the cloud over a long arc of time, that should lift and shift north of 2 times, right? So there's $1 billion of growth that's latent inside the portfolio as we lift and shift that on-premise maintenance to the cloud. Yes. So let me take -- let's take those, Jason, I take those in sequence. So I'll set up what the difference between recurring and reoccurring revenue is in our base. I'll let Jason talk about the relative growth rate, then we'll tackle the DAT freight question you're raising.  So just to level set what everybody is, if we have a recurring revenue is subscription, contractual recurring revenue, reoccurring revenue is principally located at our MHA business. We take a percentage of the drug and food spend that goes to the network and so it's not technically recurring, it's highly reoccurring. So it's not -- and that's probably the most -- one of the most stable parts of our portfolio, long-term care, health care, residents and buildings, consuming food and pharmaceuticals, right? So it's highly secure for lack of a better word. It's not transactional relative to a macroeconomic sort of situation. So I'll stop just in terms of framing recurring versus reoccurring. I'll let Jason take the relative growth rate question. Great. Okay. Now let's take to your freight and logistics around DAT specifically. So to remind you, there's this tension between the cyclical freight dynamic and a secular push or a secular benefit that DAT and DAT's customers are experiencing relative to the spot market becoming a more efficient place to place freight. So there's tension between those two.  From a cyclical point of view, we expected and have seen the carrier side of the network reduce a little bit. And it's -- and we expect it to reduce over the course or shrink or get a little bit smaller over the course of this year. DAT grew through the 2019 freight recession. I think DAT has grown every year since 2010. So the business is talking about the rate of growth at DAT, not does it expand and contract. It tends to be much more stickier than that. As an early read, January is actually a little bit better. I mean the number of carriers in the network is sort of flattish through January and not declining. And the people in the industry that sort of call like the freight timing and if there's going to be a freight recession, I actually think there's a queuing for a large spring shipping season, mostly around -- this triggered by produce. And we might start to be seeing a little bit of that bleed in, but we'll have to see how the next couple of quarters play out. Yes. So we have the most visibility we've ever had at Neptune. That's right. The order volume continues to flow. The order duration, meaning the longer date orders continues to flow. And so we feel quite comfortable and good how 2023 is shaping for Neptune.  For medical products, there's actually -- I think we've talked about a few quarters ago, the reoccurring elements of Verathon became the largest part of the revenue stream. There's a lot of consumable pull-through in the capital equipment there. Northern Digital has a decently high amount of consumables that are pulled through that zip code [ph]. And so it is more procedure and patient driven. And we like I said a few minutes ago, we feel that were decently well set up there, but it's not in our base case.  So we saw 6% to 8% declines in patient volumes in the areas in which we service in 2022, all tied to hospital staffing levels. And we're cautiously optimistic that as the labor market solution, hospitals be able to staff and be able to see patient volumes pick back up the prior levels. Okay. We will. Yes. So in terms of the number of -- when you say new entrants, I assume you're referring to the number of new carriers that are in the network as opposed to a competitive entry or the sort because there really are no new competitive entrants. Relative to the carriers, yes, I mean, it was -- it's been just a tremendous last couple of years, driven by the things we've talked about for a couple of years, which is the fluidity and the liquidity in the spot market, which is a secular tailwind and then obviously, a huge boom on the cyclical piece. We -- historically, when you look at like peak carriers to trough carriers through cycle, it sort of goes carriers declines by plus or minus 10%. We've assumed that it will decline by more than that in our guidance model because the buildup was unprecedented. But -- so that's sort of -- we think we have this conservatively planned in our outlook, but it's unprecedented ramp up leading up to this. We do take some early confidence in the carrier count in the first couple of weeks of January. So the fact that we're flattish versus continuing to see some declines is certainly encouraging, but it's only a handful of data points we want to see take together. In terms of the premium offering, I mean, DAT has just done a tremendous job creating product and package designs that have more value for all the network participants. It's helped drive some ARPU increases because there's more value that the participants are getting. That's right. Yes. You're right. We've obviously historically sourced all. But in my time here, I think one meaningful deal from private equity. One was from a small founder or founder, and that has been sort of the pod in which we fish. But we're -- that's not exclusively where we have business development activities going on. We've always looked in public markets. We just haven't found anything that's been compelling from a value point of view yet. We'll continue to look there. You could see us get a little bit earlier in the cycle and try to compete a little bit more with private equity sort of half a click earlier in the company's life cycle. So when we did the Vertafore transaction and the Frontline transaction, many of our investors said, why didn't you buy it when the first you bought it from a private equity firm, you bought it from bought it. And so that's something that you could see us explore in the right situations. But still, all that being said, the predominance of what we're going to do is what we've done for the last 20 years, which is sort of lower risk of highly recurring software -- application software businesses from private equity. So price for us, I mean, it's an important lever to our growth algorithm, not just for '22 and '23, but all prior years and all forward years. Teasing out specifically how much is price is a very, very difficult thing across our 27 companies and rolling it up to a number that is meaningful. And so we're not going to share a specific number in that regard. I'll tell you the pricing, the value capture that we have, given what we do, the criticality of what we do, we've always had pricing power and pricing value capture and there's nothing different with that. Do you want to add anything to that, Jason? Perhaps, we go to the next question? Yes. So I appreciate the opportunity there. So let's just take it by those three. So ConstructConnect, to remind you what it is, right, so we have a near perfect database of all the construction -- commercial construction projects that are in the planning phase across North America. As a result, when -- it has a bit of countercyclical demand attached to it. So when there is a tremendous amount of new projects and you're a subcontractor general contract and building product manufacturing and business is flowing from everywhere, then you don't have to look too hard for what you're going to do next. When there's fewer projects, then you subscribe to the subscription service of ConstructConnect so you can identify what projects are coming down the pipe that you want to try to bid for and win. And so the ConstructConnect has been a modestly good performer for us over the years. We expect it to actually have a good run here in '23 as a result. Deltek does have -- it's been a strategic focus of Deltek. Deltek is 60% government contracting, 40% private sector and private sector. The smallest sliver is construction and we sell software to large contractors. That's what we do. That business, we -- in our prepared comments, we talked about how the private sector was very strong in Q4 for Deltek. We would expect and do anticipate some softening on the construction side for Deltek in 2023, and we think we have that fully covered in our guidance. And then Neptune, we believe strongly Neptune is not a cyclical business. As you sell water meters and water meter technology to the municipalities when they're -- they tend to have a budget for meters. When there is a large new residential new construction, then a higher percentage of the budget goes to install new meters. When there's fewer new starts, the budget stays the same, but they take the meters and they do the retrofits and trade outs of the aging fleet and infrastructure. So that is a general cross-cycle sort of view of Neptune, But then we're further -- our confidence is further buoyed by the fact that we have this just unprecedented amount of backlog at Neptune for 2023. So we think that Neptune will perform well for us this year. Let me just set it up, and I'll hand it over to Jason. So in TEP, we talk obviously -- about Neptune, we talk about medical process. There's also a small cohort of RF product businesses [indiscernible] and RF Ideas. The fourth quarter was particularly brutal supply chain wise on those RF product businesses. And so with that, I'll give it to Jason to sort of talk through anything you'd like to. And as a general matter, we're not the only ones that. But supply chain is generally, as Jason just said, improving and there's essentially the chip shortage and chip issues. There's more of a globally is just -- but we're not -- you're not just hearing that from us. We do think this -- the supply chain issues abate over '23. Neptune has been just a steady and consistent share gainer made the whole time I've been here, right? I mean, for a decade. And the reasons for that are manifold, but they have a product orientation that starts with, they never want to strand their existing customers with technology. So for instance, this goes back to the prior iteration of communication software, but the proprietary protocols between mobile and fixed point, Neptune has a solution where if you're a municipality and you can have one fixed point, roaming points and still have some manual reads and the master data management software package in Neptune can ingest all that data and you don't strand a customer having to pick piece of technology for the totality of what they have to do. So it comes from a product orientation that starts with flexibility.  The second thing is the products are just well thought out for the long arc of what the customer wants to do. For instance, on the large commercial meters for ultrasonic, you have to be able to read high flow and low flow equally accurate our products do that. So think about a big hotel application, a trickle that happened 3 in the morning versus the high flow takes their showers in the morning, our ultrasonic meter will perfectly read the low flow and the high flow and the competitive products have to tend to be focused on one or the other for the precision. More so for that application when the ultrasonic -- the battery that drives the ultrasonic technology needs to be replaced. In our case, it's essentially a drop in battery, the competitors you have to cut the meter out and replace the meter. So it's small things -- it's seemingly small things like that, that help drive market share gains over a long arc of time.  Final thing I would say, in 2022, it was particularly beneficial for us because we had product availability throughout the totality of the year. And so some of our competitors were quoting year plus lead times. I think our lead times went from like 8 to 12 weeks. And so just some accounts that we typically have not had any presence in, they need meters, we can deliver meters, all of a sudden, you have presence and the opportunity to compete in that account. So that's helped gain some market share in the relative short term. Noted. So it's interesting. So I can add Zach -- ConstructConnect publishes, look at that quarterly, quarterly the macro of what they're seeing from a construction planning point of view, and I can have Zack for that to you. I have not read the -- personally, I've not read the most recent report yet, so I don't want to comment on its content, but we can send that to you. So here's the countercyclical nature of that. And so if you have several hundred thousand construction workers, construction, small subcontracting firms ConstructConnect has tens of thousands of customers. So as those hundreds of thousands are looking for work, it only takes a small percentage of that cohort to become a customer of ours to exhibit countercyclical growth behavior, which is what's happened in every prior slowdown in the history that we've been able to observe with ConstructConnect. Correct."

            "name": "Jason Conley",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. I am very excited and incredibly grateful for the opportunity to work with you and the team in this new role. And of course, thanks, Rob, for your awesome partnership and mentorship over the years. It's been just a great experience working together.  So first, I'd like to introduce Brandon Cross as our new Principal Accounting Officer. Brandon joined Roper about five years ago, progressing to our Assistant Controller and more recently, has led and transformed our audit services function. He has significant M&A and integration experience. So this is a natural and well-earned promotion for him. Brandon, I look forward to working together in your new role. If you indulge me, I'll rip on Roper for a few seconds. I've been blessed to help guide and execute our evolution from Roper Industries to Roper Technologies, which has been underpinned by our North Star belief that cash is the best measure of performance. And as we enter 2023, our best years are ahead of us. We have a family of market-leading businesses with durable growth drivers and terrific free cash flow margins. Further, the leadership teams and talent processes at our businesses are the best in the company's history. And finally, we have significant capacity to execute our proven and disciplined M&A strategy that I've been a part of for many years. I anticipate being quite active on the road this year. So for those on the call, I look forward to either meeting you or reconnecting in the coming months. All right. Let's get into the financials. Turning to Slide 6. We'll do a quick review of our Q4 performance. We capped off a solid year of growth with revenue of over $1.4 billion, which was 14% higher over prior year. Organic growth was 7% with strength across the portfolio, which was enhanced by 10% software recurring revenue growth. Acquisitions added eight points of growth, led by our Frontline business that closed in early October, and currency was a two-point headwind. EBITDA of $592 million, was up 17% over the prior year. We experienced strong operating leverage across the enterprise and improving gross margins in our TEP segment to finish out the year. DEPS came in at $3.92, which was 17% against prior year and $0.18 above the midpoint of our guidance range.  Next, we'll look at free cash flow. free cash flow. Free cash flow of $457 million was down 8% over the prior year. Excluding the Section 174 impact, we were down 3%. And factoring out a $30 million Vertafore tax benefit in 2021 that doesn't repeat, we're up about 3% to 4% in the quarter. Taking a broader view, you can see we compounded cash 11% over a four-year period, despite the Section 174 headwind, and we're well positioned for double-digit cash flow compounding going forward. Turning to Slide 7. We'll now do a quick overview of our Q4 segment results, as Neil will unpack more detail on the full year a bit later. We had a nice finish to a great year across the three segments. For Application Software, revenue was up 22% to $740 million, with organic growth of 7%. EBITDA margin increased to 45.6% in the quarter. We had strong SaaS bookings growth and overall solid net retention throughout the year, which is just naturally rolling through recurring revenue in the quarter. Growth was broad-based across the segment, aside from some delayed decision-making in the large government contract in space within Deltek. On margin, we had lower incentive-based SG&A and employee medical costs, so some favorability in the quarter. If you look at the full year margin of 44%, that's about where we would expect to be over a longer horizon. Our Network Software segment grew nicely in the quarter, with revenue up 9% to $350 million and EBITDA also up 9% to $189 million or 54% of revenue. Growth was led by our freight matching businesses, which continued driving higher ARPU from premium offerings to offset moderating carry activity as we expected.  Tech-enabled products revenue was $340 million and grew 5% organically in the quarter. Demand remained strong, and we had some orders that didn't get delivered toward the end of the quarter, which will benefit Q1. EBITDA grew 7% to $119 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 34.9% or 100 basis points over prior year, with strong operating leverage as the price cost dynamic was neutralized in the quarter. Turning to the full year 2022 performance on Slide 8. Revenue was 11% higher than prior year to $5.4 billion, with 9% organic growth. EBITDA was 12% better to nearly $2.2 billion, with EBITDA margin coming in at 40.4%. The of $14.28, was 15% over prior year and reflected strong P&L leverage against the 11% revenue growth. Notably, compared to our 2018 pre-divestiture financial profile, our revenue is about $175 million higher, while EBITDA is nearly $365 million higher. So, through a combination of organic growth and capital deployment, we've grown despite divesting about 40% of our 2018 revenue. And most importantly, the composition of our portfolio today positions us for higher and more durable growth going forward.  Free cash flow came in at about $1.5 billion, so down 7% versus prior year. It's a bit of the same situation as our fourth quarter with both the 2022 headwinds of Section 174 of nearly $100 million and the nonrepeating of the 2021 Vertafore tax benefit of $117 million. If we normalize for those items, free cash flow grew about 8%. We've had a bit of an inventory build within our tech segment as supply has become more available. This is not a new normal, and we certainly expect that to improve in 2023.  If we kind of take this up to a multiyear view, you can see we've compounded cash at 15% over a four-year period. And as we look forward, the impact from Section 174 will be fairly neutral, and we expect to convert plus or minus 80% of flow. So, we're clearly well positioned for double-digit growth. Turning to Slide 9. Let's take a look at our financial position. We certainly had a lot going on in Q4. On November 22, we completed the majority sale of our industrial businesses, which are now operating under the name Indicor and received $2.6 billion in upfront proceeds. Also, in the quarter, we paid $270 million, representing all taxes due related to the majority sale. So, this yielded us net proceeds of over $2.3 billion, a very good outcome here indeed. Related to our stake in Indicor, this is now appearing as an equity investment on our balance sheet. We will be updating the fair value of the equity investment each quarter going forward. To provide a clearer picture of our continuing operations, we will provide a non-GAAP adjustment for this fair value accounting and any tax expense related to this investment.  So just looking at our balance sheet, even after our $3.7 billion Frontline acquisition, which was completed in October, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 2.7 times. So, our solid leverage profile, coupled with strong free cash flow generation and an undrawn revolver of $3.5 billion, gives us $4 billion plus of M&A capacity. Clearly, we are very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment in 2023.  And with that, I will turn the call back over to Neil to go through our segment details. Neil? Thanks, Deane. Appreciated. Fair enough. Yes, sure, glad to. So MHA, as Neil mentioned, it's really about drug purchases from the pharmacies, and they have very strong retention in those businesses from a customer standpoint. We always sort of think about the business being at the -- maybe at the bottom end of the mid-single digits, maybe a little bit low singles. And that's sort of what we experienced this year, and that's kind of what we're baking in for next year. Yes, happy to. No, I think we're feeling very good about the 80% Our deferred revenue, our renewals were really strong this quarter, and we felt good how it moved up sequentially, how was up year-over-year. And just what we're hearing from our businesses, we feel good about the renewals. And then we're going to have -- we expect -- I think I said on the call that we'll get some improvement on our inventory ratios next year. We had a little bit of build at the end of this year. Frontline will certainly help with our negative working capital profile. They're at negative 40%. Like I said, most of that will hit in the third quarter when all the renewals take place. Of course, if Section 174 gets repealed, this will be a home run year, but we're not banking on that for now. I'll let you come to your math on that. No. They were somewhere in the '80s. We had a few days knocked off at the beginning of the quarter because we closed on the 4th. So different packages, different features and functionality that they've upsold. Well, it's a calculation that's going to be based on many variables, right? It's mainly an accounting exercise. We don't think that it's going to -- we'd rather see the outcome when we do the exit. We think that's the better reflection of what the economics are going to be. We feel really good about what that's going to look like. We've worked with CD&R on a strategy there. They typically look at several multiples of return on investment, and that's what we're playing for upon exit. Yes. It wasn't significant. It was probably in the $5 million to $10 million range, and it was across a number of businesses. So I think we expect the first quarter for TEP to be up a little bit more than the rest of the year because of that and because of some of the easier comps. So maybe low double digits in the first quarter, but that's sort of the range. So yes, a lot of this is in the rearview. Of course, things do pop up here and there, but we're not hearing as much sort of meaningful impact in the quarters."

So we typically convert on -- from an EBITDA to free cash flow will be in the 90s typically and Section 174. If we adjust for that, we are in the 80s. And so you're right. Frontline has a very seasonal sort of cash collection cadence. So the third quarters when all the renewals and upsells happen, so most of their cash comes in the third quarter. So in the fourth, you won't see that converting to cash from EBITDA. So that's exactly what you saw. So we're looking forward to next year and especially in the third quarter will be a little bit more weighted than normal."

[Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Unless otherwise noted, we will discuss our results and guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense; transaction related expenses for completed acquisitions; and lastly we have adjusted our cash flow statement to exclude the cash taxes paid related to our divestiture activities. GAAP requires these payments to be classified as operating cash flow items even though they are related to divestitures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning everyone. As we turn to Page 4, we'll walk through our usual agenda highlights for the most recent quarter followed by color commentary for each of our segments and ending with our increased outlook for the year. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are, first, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance and we're further increasing our outlook for the year. Second, earlier this month, we acquired another leading niche software business, Frontline Education. Third, we continue to have substantial M&A firepower north of $4 billion. And fourth and perhaps the most important the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we've never been more excited about our future. As it relates to the operating and financial performance in the quarter, we're pleased that revenues grew 10% on an organic basis and that the strength was broad based across our three segments and that margin performance improved as well. Consistent with our commentary during the last several quarters, not only did we grow nicely in the quarter, but the quality of our underlying business also improved as we saw our software recurring revenue base grow 11% on an organic basis, more on Frontline in a moment. Based on the strength in Q3 and our expectations for Q4, we're increasing our organic growth outlook to north of 9% for the year. And for those reasons together with the addition of Frontline, we're increasing our full year DEPS guidance by $0.57 at the midpoint. And finally, we've been active in the M&A market. Over the last few months, we deployed just over $4 billion, $3.7 billion for Frontline and $300 million for two bolt-ons: one for Deltek and the other for Aderant. To this end, even after our reset $4 billion in capital deployment, we still have a large amount of available M&A Firepower, over $4 billion. We continue to be very active in the M&A markets, but as you saw in Q3 and as always, we will remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. Finally, we feel great about the improving quality of the portfolio and the associate financial and operating results. All of this is made possible by our incredibly committed and passionate teams and associates. Thank you to everyone. Turning to the next page. As previously announced, we're excited to introduce to you another niche application software leader, which we've added to the Roper portfolio, Frontline Education. Of note, we closed this transaction on October 4th. Frontline is a leading provider of SaaS software solutions targeted to the U.S. K-12 education market. Frontline is an exceptional business, which not surprisingly meets all our acquisition criteria, including being the clear leader that delivers administrative and HCM solutions purpose built for the K-12 market, having multiple durable growth drivers and a high single digit organic growth outlook, high recurring revenue north of 90%, great casual characteristics and a passionate high quality team. While early days, we're delighted to welcome Frontline to the Roper family, where we will be their permanent home going forward. This is just another great fit relative to our capital deployment and corporate strategy, not only to increase the scale of our enterprise, but the quality as well. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 7, we want to take a moment and highlight the recent transformation of Roper and our higher quality portfolio. To that end, the vast majority of our 27 businesses save for their smaller size could be a highly successful standalone leading vertical software or tech enabled product company. Each of our 27 businesses are leaders in their respective niche markets. Our businesses serve the mission critical needs of our customers and have intimate relationships with them. Our market leadership purpose-built software solutions and customer intimacy are the basis for our long-term competitive advantage. Next is our higher level of organic growth. This is no accident. We have raised the performance expectation for each of our businesses to structurally improve their long-term organic growth capabilities. We're doing this in a balance sheet and margin friendly way. A large component of the organic growth story is a higher level of recurring revenue within each of our companies, approaching 60% for the enterprise and about 75% for our software businesses. In addition, our businesses are blessed with business models that generate high levels of free cash flow, a result of their operational efficiency, margin levels and customer prepaid orientation of their balance sheets. Today, our portfolio is 75% software and 25% medical and water products. We are meaningfully less cyclical today versus 2018 given the markets we serve, healthcare, legal, education, government contracting, utilities and food to name some of our larger ones and our fixed subscription versus volume-based revenue model. To put today's portfolio in perspective, in 2018 roughly 40% of our company was either highly cyclical or project-oriented. Today, these market dynamics essentially no longer exists for us. When we reflect on this portfolio transition, we've never been more excited for the future of Roper given our increased quality, higher growth and more resilient portfolio companies. With that, let me turn the call over to Rob to walk you through our financial summary and our balance sheet position. Rob?\nRob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning everyone. Turn to Page 8 and covering our Q3 financial highlights. As a reminder, as Zack said, all financial results are on a continuing operations basis. Total revenue increased 10% to $1.35 billion. The FX headwind was $20 million or 1.6% and was offset by acquisition contributions. Notably, our mix of business has shifted meaningfully toward more domestic revenue post the announced majority sale of our industrial businesses. The U.S. now represents approximately 85% of our revenue helping to shield our results from the impacts of any currency fluctuations. Q3 organic revenue increased 10% with broad-based strength across each of our three reporting segments: Application Software grew 7%, Network Software grew 10% and Technology Enabled Products grew a robust 15% organically. EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points to 41.1%, resulting in 12% EBITDA growth. Adjusted DEPS was $3.67, well above our guidance range and 18% higher than last year. Q3 adjusted free cash flow was $353 million, which was 9% above prior year. Excluding the Section 174 tax law change we discussed last quarter, quarterly free cash flow grew 17%. In the quarter, we made $157 million of additional tax payments related to our recent divestitures. Per our normal convention, those payments have been adjusted out of our reported cash flow, so overall, an excellent third quarter, as Neil said, and great momentum heading into Q4. Next slide. Turn to Page 9, looking at our strong financial position. We did complete the Frontline acquisition early in the fourth quarter, utilizing a combination of our balance sheet cash and a draw on our revolving credit facility. As of today, our draw and revolver balance sits at $2.2 billion. We expect to fully pay down the revolver balance with the proceeds from our industrial sale, which should close late in the fourth quarter. So after taking into account the receipt of those industrial transaction proceeds, we'd expect to end the year with a net debt to EBITDA ratio pro forma for our recent acquisitions in the mid-2s. Our consistently strong cash generation quickly refreshes our capacity for capital deployment. So looking forward, we remain active on the M&A front and we have the ability to deploy an additional $4 billion plus of capital now through the end of 2023. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to review our segment performance.\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 11 and walk through our 3Q highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $644 million, up 7% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 43.6%. Across this segment, we saw recurring revenue, which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment increased 8% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was broad and it's been quite consistent for several quarters running. As we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Vertafore, who had another great quarter of bookings growth, revenue growth and margin performance. Vertafore continues to see success in their software solutions targeted to the PNC insurance market with particular strength in the enterprise class market segment. Across both Deltek and Aderant, we continue to see solid new customer adds and nice momentum and migration towards their SaaS solutions. Also in the quarter we acquired TIP Technologies for Deltek, a leading software provider servicing the GovCon manufacturing and QA market and viGlobal for Aderant, a leading human resources and recruiting software tool for global law firms. CBORD, our nutrition and access management software business had strength across both education and healthcare and end markets. CliniSys and Data Innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. CliniSys continued its market share gains across Europe and DI continues to demonstrate product market fit by gaining share of wallet across large healthcare systems. Strata continues to be solid for us as evidenced by strong new customer adds, cross-selling and renewal activity. Finally, Frontline will be reported in this segment starting in Q4. Looking at the outlook for the final quarter of the year, we expect to see organic growth in the 6% to 8% area. Turning to Page 12. Revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $347 million, up 10% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 54.5%. The 10% organic growth in this segment is underpinned by 16% growth in recurring revenue. As we dig into business specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continue to be fantastic. The marketing conditions while slowing a touch on the carrier side of the network remained favorable, these businesses saw nice new customer adds and ARPU increases during the quarter. Moving to foundry, our software business that enables live-action filming and computer-generated graphics to be combined in a single frame \u2013 frame again demonstrated their financial strength. Net retention was very strong and ARR grew in the strong double digits again. Foundry's success is rooted in their fast-paced innovation capability and favorable long-term market conditions. Growth in our businesses that focus on alternate site healthcare was led by SHP and SoftWriters and importantly retention rates across each of these businesses remained extremely high. Finally, iTrade, our network food supply chain business and iPipeline, our life insurance SaaS business that tech enables the quoting and underwriting processes, each had solid customer additions, which helped drive strong ARR growth in the quarter. Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect to see 8% to 10% organic growth for this segment. As we turn to Page 13, revenues in our tech-enabled products segment were $360 million, up 15% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment increased nicely to 37.2% in the quarter. It's very nice to see 15% organic growth in the quarter and easing supply chain challenges. While supply chain challenges remain, we experienced demonstrable easing conditions especially as it relates to chips and chipsets. We are cautiously optimistic conditions will continue to improve. Let's start with Neptune, which once again set records for orders and quarter end backlog. For a few quarters running, Neptune has been able to gain market share by successfully maintaining industry leading product lead times while simultaneously launching new products both in terms of cellular connectivity and static meter reading technology. To this end, Neptune continues to experience accelerating demand that are static meter solutions. Verathon was simply strong. They grew nicely in the quarter driven by momentum across all three components of their product portfolio: bladder volume measurement, video innovation and single use bronchoscopes. As it relates to Northern Digital, they set a new record for quarterly revenues as they experience continued strong demand for their precision measurement solutions. Our outlook for the final quarter of the year is 5% to 7% organic growth for this segment as we have a more difficult comp heading into Q4. Now, please turn to Page 15 and let's review our updated and increased outlook for the balance of the year. As a reminder, last quarter, we increased our adjusted DEPS outlook to be between $13.46 and $13.62. We are now once again increasing our guidance to be between $14.09 and $14.13, an increase of $0.57 at the mid-point. This increase in guidance is driven by our strong third quarter performance and the momentum we carry in Q4, together with the addition of Frontline Education. Embedded in this guidance is full year organic growth of 9% plus an increase from 8% to 9% organic growth guidance discussed last quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we're establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.72 and $3.76. Now we're concluding comments and we'll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 16, we want to leave you with the same key points with which we started. First, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance, and we are increasing our outlook for the year. Second, we acquired another leading knit software business, Frontline Education. Third, we continue to have substantial M&A firepower north of $4 billion. And fourth, perhaps the most important, the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming ever more visible. As it relates to our strong start, we grew revenues organically by 10% and EBITDA by 12%. We're lifting our full year organic growth and DEPS guidance based on the factors previously discussed. Regarding capital deployment, we have been active. Over the past couple months we deployed just over $4 billion. To this end, our prudence and patience are being rewarded through the identification of selections of these high quality assets. We continue to have a large amount of available M&A capacity north of $4 billion. We continue to be very active in the M&A markets, but as you saw in Q3, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. Finally, and perhaps the most important, the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we have never been more excited about the future of our enterprise. As we turn to your questions, let us remind everyone that our strategy is the same. We compound cash flow by acquiring and growing niche market leading technology businesses. This is what we've done for over 20 years and will continue to do. In addition, our value creation and governance model remains unchanged. We operate a portfolio of market-leading businesses and defensible niches. Each of our businesses has high levels of recurring revenue, strong margin, and competes based on customer intimacy, which yields highly resilient, organic growth rates. We operate a highly decentralized operating structure that focuses on long-term business building. Our culture sets a very high bar for performance and focuses on continually improving. We are all paid to grow, which reinforces our culture of transparency, nimbleness, and humility. Finally, we redeployed the vast majority of our capital to acquire the next great business. We do this with centralized corporate resources in a highly disciplined, thoughtful, and analytical manner. This strategy unchanged, delivers compounded and superior long-term shareholder value. So thanks for joining us this morning, and with that, let's open up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, good morning Deane.\nRob Crisci: Good morning Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, I know we're not seeing it in any of your reported numbers today with all this upside, but had there been any changes in customer behavior on the software side, given the uncertain macro, whether it's velocity of new contracts, orders, customer adds, anything kind of below the radar screen?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, Deane, nothing in a meaningful sustained manner. Right? So I think we attribute that first to the markets that we serve. Right? So think about customers in healthcare, education, insurance, food, government contracting, utilities I mean, the macro forces generally are lessened or less impactful in those end markets. ARRs, I think, they are up the double digits 10%. So that's always a leading indicator of the strength. But there is certainly quarter-to-quarter there can be some noise. And so last quarter we're looking at, for instance, PowerPlan minus off some softening, but that recovered this quarter. And so it's not to say there is not pockets of things we look at, but nothing in a sustained manner at this stage.\nDeane Dray: That's great to hear. And as a follow-up can you expand on this initiative to structurally improve the longer term organic growth rates of the businesses? And just so we're clear, part of your acquisition criteria has never been to buy the fastest top line growing companies because that just doesn't fit the kind of where you are looking for these unicorns that have high barriers to entry that private equity is not going to take public. So you've never been focused on the real, sexy top line growth, but what is the target when you say kind of long-term improvement in organic growth?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, I draw you back. This is the same thing we've been talking about since really over the last four or five years since we became COO and CEO and the team we have in place today. So, we historically \u2013 long history this \u2013 we've said this is a GDP plus a little bit grower, and as we've restructured the portfolio and as we've talked about here increased the expectation outlook for more organic out of existing portfolio, now it's mid-single digits certainly through cycle. And we are always looking to continue to improve that. We've talked at NASOM [ph] about the desire to improve the organic growth outlook through our governance system of our businesses, thinking about how to do strategy right, where to play and how to win, how to execute that strategy in a process in discipline manner, and then how to build team and talent to sort of use that as a long-term competitive advantage. We've been at this with the portfolio for three or four years, and we're starting to see some signs of improvement. So, we're encouraged, but it's an ongoing body of work that never ends.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Davis at Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning guys.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, Scott.\nRob Crisci: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Great results as usual. It probably sounds like a broken record after kind of a decade of that. But I was hoping for a little bit of a play-by-play on frontline. Were there the same kind of number of people that showed up for the auction, was there less, was it a little less competitive, the same? Just a little bit of a play-by-play will be helpful.\nNeil Hunn: Sure. Appreciate the opportunity to talk about that. I'll tell you, you never have perfect information. And so this is using all of our inputs and reading the tea leaves to really understand what happened. In the process the seller here Thoma had some bespoke reasons they needed to get liquidity from an asset they chose this one. They happened to time it in the market where private equity bidders had a difficult time bidding because there was not, or has not been a private leverage loan market. And so in that result, the process was thinner competitively, meaningfully thinner competitively and that's why we believe we are able to get a very fair price for the asset. So the process dynamics were a little bit different. And just another example of sort of the patience and our commitment to investment grade leverage and the conservative posture of our financial policy enables us to sort of move nimbly when an opportunity presents itself.\nScott Davis: Got you. That's helpful. And can you give us, just as a follow-up, just a little bit of sense of magnitude of price in your 10% growth number this quarter? Is it a third, a half, something that you can give us just a sense of what component that was?\nNeil Hunn: It's very difficult for us to sort of bifurcate volume and price. Keep in mind we're 75% software. Inside software the growth algorithm of every one of our software businesses, you would trip a little bit. There is price baked in every year to sort of offset \u2013 mostly if not all of attrite. When you're cross-selling and upselling it to the customer base that gives it to your net retention and you are adding new customers to get the total growth. And so pricing and value capture is just completely native to the inner workings of the pricing model inside a software. And it's not \u2013 and it would be generally consistent with the past. I mean, there may be a little bit more prices, labor has gone up in the software model. As it relates to the product businesses, our product businesses have done a fabulous job of essentially passing the cost increases through with the margin to our customers. As you know that lags a little bit. It showed up in margins this quarter in [indiscernible]. That will continue to bleed out over the next several quarters as the backlog that was built early in the years is shipped. And so the teams have done a nice job with that.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, good morning guys.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, good morning.\nRob Crisci: Good morning.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, just to follow kind of on Deane's question, we are starting to see like at least announcements about layoffs at tech companies and these kind of things as their business starts to slow. Obviously the businesses you have very different. But if you were to start extrapolating those type of announcements down to permeate throughout the broader economy, like how do you like play that scenario with your businesses? Like, okay, we're seeing this and that means this much impact to some of these software businesses and here is what we do and here is how we kind of think about that. Like, kind of like run us through that playbook.\nNeil Hunn: Yes, so, it is company specific, right. So every company is going to adjust as their market demands. As a general matter as large tech employment softens I view that as a good thing for our business because it makes it easier for us to hire the labor and talent that we need to hire. Here is point one. Point two, is keep in mind what we do for our customers. Right? We are selling and delivering to them the thing they need to run their business. So we are mission-critical to what they do and our pricing model is vastly fixed subscription. So it's not volume or transaction based. So we should be relatively muted to sort of short cycle fluctuations and the macroeconomic indicators. And so a little bit better labor environment, I think, is unbalanced a good thing for us.\nJoe Giordano: And then as you think about going forward in M&A, just given where the stock is derated, we haven't been in a situation where some of the dealers you might look at or hire multiples than Roper itself. So, like how are you kind of thinking about actionability of certain things just given where the stock trades?\nNeil Hunn: We're always focused on improving both the scale and the quality of the enterprise. It's been 20 years, it will be the next 20 years and finding the best asset at the best prices we can find. And there is no difference in that going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning. \nChristopher Glynn: Was curious on the NSS margin seem to step out a bit nicely very strong incrementals. I just want to kind of discuss if there is a mixed shift there that's kind of episodic or kind of sticky.\nRob Crisci: Yes. Hey Chris, it's Rob. I don't think anything really to call out. I mean, we had really strong organic growth with these software businesses that comes through with great incremental. So I'm just looking back to the margins. Last year, I think, we ended last year at 54 in the fourth quarter we were 54.5 EBITDA here. So yes, no, I think, it was a nice quarter performance, probably similar for the fourth quarter in terms of EBITDA margin for the segment.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And thinking about frontline accretion, if we take the $175 million of EBITDA maybe that's $160 million EBITDA and then there's might be some net interest increase expected there. So just curious how to put that together.\nRob Crisci: Yes, that's right. So for the fourth quarter we've got about $40 million of EBITDA in for Frontline. And there is about $24 million, excuse me, of incremental interest. If you look at where we were before to now, as I mentioned earlier, we did draw on the revolver and so we're paying the revolver interest for much of the fourth quarter than we're assuming that the industrial sale closes late in the quarter and then that interest expense would go away. So I think the math on that is about $0.12 of our sort of $0.57 guidance increase was Frontline.\nJason Conley: Depreciation is about $7 million or $8 million a year.\nRob Crisci: Yes. Thanks Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back to Network Software in terms of the top line, because I think you've had now sort of six quarters consecutive of around double digit organic sales growth. And I was curious to what extent it's the same one or two businesses driving that consistently or is it kind of different horses pulling it along at different times and kind of the leadership is changing? And any thoughts on the next few quarters, which businesses you see driving the Network Software organic growth?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, sure. I'll take a crack at it and then ask Rob if he wants to correct or amplify anything I say. So it's been a pretty consistent set of performance across the various businesses. We've talked for many quarters about the strength of U.S. Canadian freight match, right? It's just been fantastic for us. It continues to be good. For the last two or three quarters, we've talked two quarters this quarter and last quarter we've talked about how \u2013 the rate of growth is slowing a little bit, but it's still very good. Even this quarter there was a strong number of new career ads, so we would expect that to sort of slow down a bit over the course of the next year. The other businesses, Foundry, SoftWriters, iTrade, SHPI pipeline are just solid performers that have been very consistent and generally don't have that macro sort of tailwind that the freight match businesses have had. So we wouldn't expect any meaningful change from those businesses. Anything you want to add or comment?\nRob Crisci: No, I think that's fair.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. And then just on Technology Enabled Products, you have had issues like most manufacturers from cost inflation, from supply chain challenges for some time. Those are starting to ease it looks like. So maybe help us understand what you are assuming for the pace of those supply chain challenges easing? And then assuming you've got volume growth ahead, easier supply chain and inflation, what kind of operating leverage should we expect in the TEP segment, not so much next quarter, but let's say next 12 months?\nNeil Hunn: I'll take the first couple \u2013 excuse me, parts of that question around supply chain pacing and improvement and let Rob comment about the OP leverage or EBITDA leverage there. So, just to set the context for us the supply chain, we have been modestly gated from shipping in a one or two of the businesses for short periods of time but for the most part it's been about \u2013 we've been able to ship, but it's been about a higher component cost and expedited logistics in order to sort of both inbound and outbound the products. This quarter demonstrably supply chain especially around chips improved intra-quarter. We went into the quarter assuming it's going to be difficult and it meaningfully improved during the quarter. So it's our expectation that that part of supply chain element continues to ease Q4 and beyond. There's still a little bit of challenges around the certain components principally come out of China, think motors and things like that, that are still have longer lead times, but those appear to be abating as well. We don't assume that happens per se in Q4. As it relates to the price and sort of pushing that through, we talked about a little bit before the companies have been very good at taking price increases to offset the component price or cost increases, but it lags by a handful of \u2013 not a handful, a couple quarters between you take the order and when you deliver the order and that started showing up this quarter.\nRob Crisci: Yes. I'll just add to that. There's great momentum here. Neptune has been performing really, really well. Neil talked about how they're \u2013 they're still seeing great orders and great backlog and great momentum and so that should \u2013 that should certainly carry forward. So with the supply chain issues easing as Neil mentioned, I mean, leverage here I think it was 50% EBITDA leverage in the quarter. We should be north of 40% leverage over the long-term as these businesses continue to grow strong organically and so that would tick-up the EBITDA margins a little bit in that segment.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Just on, ongoing back to the front line so if that adds like $0.12 in your, I think your sequential increase in earnings is I don't know, like $0.07 or something like that. Yes, what's the, I know it's only down modestly but maybe sometimes you have an increase in the fourth quarter. I think obviously seasonality has changed a bit, but anything else kind of moving around or is everything generally just kind of flat from 3Q to 4Q EPS?\nRob Crisci: Yes. I think if you look at the guide the tap volume, revenue is a little lower fourth quarter versus third quarters. You mentioned some supply chain ease and some stuff shifted \u2013 shifted a little bit earlier. Other than that, I think you're right. I mean it's just \u2013 it's a much different portfolio, right? We don't have the seasonality with all the energy businesses with the big fourth quarter, that's just \u2013 that those businesses have been divested.\nSteve Tusa: Right. And then just for free cash flow can you just baseline us on fourth quarter or just for the year? What you guys would've, I know you don't guide but we're getting close to the end of the year; maybe you could just baseline us on what you expect for the fourth quarter and deferred revenue is actually pretty negative in the quarter what's going on there?\nRob Crisci: Yes. So I mean, cash flow should be strong in the fourth quarter. Obviously, setting aside the fact that we're still making payments on the divestitures it's always our best working capital quarter on deferred revenue. In the fourth quarters when we get most of our renewals for the software businesses, that's usually the best quarter for that as well. So it's usually a very good working capital quarter. And then if you look forward we certainly don't guide cash flow, but we are really, really well positioned for great cash conversion next year as we get these cash tax payments behind us and now we have a portfolio with even better working capital characteristics, and so we feel great about our abilities to continue to compound cash flow moving forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. Good morning.\nAllison Poliniak: Just want to go back to the network software businesses and particularly easily, look you touched on freight matching and then iTradeNetwork both businesses, which I would've thought had pretty strong market share historically. Could you maybe talk to with the new customer ads, are those markets evolving for you or is it something that Roper is doing specifically to capture share in there? Just any thoughts.\nNeil Hunn: So yes, each one is different between the freight match, the North American DAT freight match business, and iTrade on what they're doing all their product and go-to-market strategy. Rather the DAT, I would \u2013 there's a lot that we could unpack and delighted to talk to you about this on a call down or a more longer form way but the short version is they've done a terrific job on both their freight match product and their analytics product and then creating product tiers based on the value the customer wants to sort of buy into. At DAT also something like 75% of the bookings today are through their e-commerce channel where three years ago or five years ago, it was zero. So they've really removed the barriers to do business with them and when you look at the ARPU increases like 70% of the ARPU increase has been because customers have elected to a higher package because there's been more value to sort of get from the network. So they've done a wonderful job that's bespoke and unique to DAT like it is for all 27 businesses that iTrade. The go-to-market motion there has been the \u2013 it's been mostly the same but this over the course of probably about a year-and-a-half ago, the company released a new product offering to enable the supplier part of the network to do easier trading with the buy side of the network is the simplest way I could describe it. So think of it as like a lighter weight supply chain management software tool for half of the network and it's just been \u2013 it's a very consistent booking, so over the last four or five quarters as it's been released.\nAllison Poliniak: Great, thanks. And then just as we think of that organic, recurring revenue in the software businesses that has been quite strong. Do we assume a similar level of the recurring revenue growth as we look to our Q4 numbers? Just any thoughts there?\nNeil Hunn: You want to comment?\nRob Crisci: Yes.\nNeil Hunn: Q4 or recurring?\nRob Crisci: Yes. Should be \u2013 should be similar that that we've seen. That the trends there continue to be very positive overall on recurring revenue for sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Hey Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So guys, at the beginning a bunch of questions on the, just a long-term growth rates for your businesses and clearly like the portfolios evolved a lot over time and I think last quarter we talked about 6% long-term growth. I was just wondering as you kind of look at the 27 companies that now make up broker; are there businesses that you expect to grow, let's call it high-single, the low-double digits over time because of where they are in their maturity? And if there are, could you maybe just talk through some of those?\nRob Crisci: Yes. I think the place to start right is the removal of the cyclicality, right? So if you look at where Roper is now is as we mentioned earlier, it's a very different portfolio because we don't have that 40% of Roper that was projects and cyclicality back to 2018. So that, so now you don't have the situation where you might have something that grows 15% one-year and then goes down 15% the next year. So really the whole portfolio is sort of plus or minus mid-single digit organic and in a bad year something might be up 2% or 3% and in a great year it could certainly be double digits. And I'll let Neil expand on that.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. What I would maybe add three points to that, Joe. One is it's, when you look at the 27 companies it's a very tight distribution in terms of the growth rate. There's not \u2013 it's not a bar bill where you got 10 companies growing 2% and 10 companies growing 15% of averages into something different. It's a very tight, I think the only two acquisitions we've done, we've announced as a high-single digit organic growth business. Everything else has been mid-singles and we're working to improve that. So as a general matter, think of it as a mid-single digit through cycle organic growth portfolio that is \u2013 has all the casual characteristics you'd want to see with that. We'd see operating leverage occur, so that's going to translate to a little bit more cash growth organically. And then you got to layer on top of that the M&A flywheel. So we feel very comfortable. We have a mid-teen sort of cash flow compounding growth algorithm that's embedded in our strategy.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That's super helpful. And then I guess my following question, I hadn't historically thought of you guys as being potentially a big beneficiary of some of the stimulus packages that have been passed. And so as an example, like the K-12 education stimulus funding but then as you're talking about seaboard and now there's this, this acquisition with Frontline, I'm just wondering like, do you guys see yourselves as a beneficiary of some of these stimulus measures where we actually haven't seen a lot of that spending yet come through and perhaps we'll start to see some of that in 2023?\nNeil Hunn: We think the answer is no. We're not in any meaningful way or even in a minor way a beneficiary of the stimulus or COVID funds. For instance, with Frontline we studied that extensively during a diligence process and while the K-12 districts certainly on-boarded stimulus and COVID dollars, the vast, vast majority of those funds, the one-time funds were spent on one-time type items principally getting for instance student to device ratios to one-to-one for instance. They were districts were super hesitant to buy a recurring software package with one-time money. So Frontline we don't believe in any meaningful way was a beneficiary that we think that's a good thing goes to the durability of the growth drivers of the business. Seaboard, same thing, there's what Seaboard does, I mean it's about food and management for these K-12 and higher Ed facilities and at campuses as well as access management and integrated security and they have not been a meaningful beneficiary. So no is a short answer.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brendan Luecke with Alliance Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Luecke: Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my question. A few quick ones on the M&A environment. So you have been \u2013 you haven't been shy in the path levering up for big deals. Has your target leverage ratio changed all with the higher rate environment?\nNeil Hunn: No. The leverage ratio is completely independent of the rate environment.\nBrendan Luecke: Okay, great. And then it within a higher rate environment, do you feel you have an advantage over PE funds, particularly with the IPO market dried up?\nRob Crisci: We've long said that higher interest rates are, we believe are a \u2013 we're a benefactor of that. 70% for the reasons that 70% to 80% of our capital that we deploy is from our internally generated cash flow. Obviously 20% to 30% is from the balance sheet. So we're versus private equity who are competing against 50-plus percent of what they deploy in may be every deal is variable rate debt at the moment. So they are much more indexed and their values are much more indexed to shorter term rates than anything that we would see.\nNeil Hunn: And very high yield...\nRob Crisci: \u2026and very high yield.\nNeil Hunn: And that those markets have been closed.\nRob Crisci: So we think we're beneficiaries in a higher rate environment because one would think over time, if these rates are sustained and that's a big, if they're sustained, then you'd see valuations adjust accordingly, and so we think that's our view on that. We've been very consistent of that view for a long time.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Alex Blanton at Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blanton: Good morning. Monitoring around my second question, would you wait until I say thank you before you cut off my mic please?\nZack Moxcey: Yes, sir no problem.\nAlex Blanton: The first question is in the tech enabled segment you had a 15% growth. What portion of that was just due to supply chain catch catching up on things that had been delayed because of the supply chain?\nRob Crisci: Alex, that's a hard one to give you a level precision. I will tell you we did better in the quarter because the supply chain got better. I mean, Verathon had a lot of things that had to go exactly right and they \u2013 most reverse what they did. Neptune did a nice job as well. Northern Digital did a great job. So a chunk of the beat would certainly be attributed to that.\nAlex Blanton: Yes. Okay. And secondly on the acquisition front in the past when you've made a big acquisition like this, you've had a pause in your acquisition pace until you transition into the new company and get things squared away. What do you expect to do this time? You have $4 billion in dried powder. Would you expect to use some of that or a lot of that or a little of that in the coming year?\nRob Crisci: Yes, Alex so there's certainly no need for a pause to deliver because our leverage rates are still relatively low because we are benefiting from the fact that we did these divestitures and we're still really redeploying those proceeds in addition to our normal cadence. So really no reason to pause. So we're very active in the M&A markets. Today we'll remain active. We might do deals very soon. It might take us a couple quarters as Neil mentioned, we're going to be very, very patient. But we're certainly going to remain active and there's not going to be any sort of a pause in that activity. Like you've seen after some of the larger deals where we did lever up and we're in a situation where we sort of had to take some time to reduce the leverage.\nAlex Blanton: And there's a good backlog of companies to supply that you're looking at?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. The market is, the number of deals then and processes that are in slide are quite large, yes.\nAlex Blanton: Okay. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: You're welcome. Thanks Alex.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now turn back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remark.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference is now concluded and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may not expect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thanks, Zack, and good morning everyone. As we turn to Page 4, we'll walk through our usual agenda highlights for the most recent quarter followed by color commentary for each of our segments and ending with our increased outlook for the year. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are, first, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance and we're further increasing our outlook for the year. Second, earlier this month, we acquired another leading niche software business, Frontline Education. Third, we continue to have substantial M&A firepower north of $4 billion. And fourth and perhaps the most important the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we've never been more excited about our future. As it relates to the operating and financial performance in the quarter, we're pleased that revenues grew 10% on an organic basis and that the strength was broad based across our three segments and that margin performance improved as well. Consistent with our commentary during the last several quarters, not only did we grow nicely in the quarter, but the quality of our underlying business also improved as we saw our software recurring revenue base grow 11% on an organic basis, more on Frontline in a moment. Based on the strength in Q3 and our expectations for Q4, we're increasing our organic growth outlook to north of 9% for the year. And for those reasons together with the addition of Frontline, we're increasing our full year DEPS guidance by $0.57 at the midpoint. And finally, we've been active in the M&A market. Over the last few months, we deployed just over $4 billion, $3.7 billion for Frontline and $300 million for two bolt-ons: one for Deltek and the other for Aderant. To this end, even after our reset $4 billion in capital deployment, we still have a large amount of available M&A Firepower, over $4 billion. We continue to be very active in the M&A markets, but as you saw in Q3 and as always, we will remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. Finally, we feel great about the improving quality of the portfolio and the associate financial and operating results. All of this is made possible by our incredibly committed and passionate teams and associates. Thank you to everyone. Turning to the next page. As previously announced, we're excited to introduce to you another niche application software leader, which we've added to the Roper portfolio, Frontline Education. Of note, we closed this transaction on October 4th. Frontline is a leading provider of SaaS software solutions targeted to the U.S. K-12 education market. Frontline is an exceptional business, which not surprisingly meets all our acquisition criteria, including being the clear leader that delivers administrative and HCM solutions purpose built for the K-12 market, having multiple durable growth drivers and a high single digit organic growth outlook, high recurring revenue north of 90%, great casual characteristics and a passionate high quality team. While early days, we're delighted to welcome Frontline to the Roper family, where we will be their permanent home going forward. This is just another great fit relative to our capital deployment and corporate strategy, not only to increase the scale of our enterprise, but the quality as well. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 7, we want to take a moment and highlight the recent transformation of Roper and our higher quality portfolio. To that end, the vast majority of our 27 businesses save for their smaller size could be a highly successful standalone leading vertical software or tech enabled product company. Each of our 27 businesses are leaders in their respective niche markets. Our businesses serve the mission critical needs of our customers and have intimate relationships with them. Our market leadership purpose-built software solutions and customer intimacy are the basis for our long-term competitive advantage. Next is our higher level of organic growth. This is no accident. We have raised the performance expectation for each of our businesses to structurally improve their long-term organic growth capabilities. We're doing this in a balance sheet and margin friendly way. A large component of the organic growth story is a higher level of recurring revenue within each of our companies, approaching 60% for the enterprise and about 75% for our software businesses. In addition, our businesses are blessed with business models that generate high levels of free cash flow, a result of their operational efficiency, margin levels and customer prepaid orientation of their balance sheets. Today, our portfolio is 75% software and 25% medical and water products. We are meaningfully less cyclical today versus 2018 given the markets we serve, healthcare, legal, education, government contracting, utilities and food to name some of our larger ones and our fixed subscription versus volume-based revenue model. To put today's portfolio in perspective, in 2018 roughly 40% of our company was either highly cyclical or project-oriented. Today, these market dynamics essentially no longer exists for us. When we reflect on this portfolio transition, we've never been more excited for the future of Roper given our increased quality, higher growth and more resilient portfolio companies. With that, let me turn the call over to Rob to walk you through our financial summary and our balance sheet position. Rob? Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 11 and walk through our 3Q highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $644 million, up 7% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 43.6%. Across this segment, we saw recurring revenue, which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment increased 8% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was broad and it's been quite consistent for several quarters running. As we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Vertafore, who had another great quarter of bookings growth, revenue growth and margin performance. Vertafore continues to see success in their software solutions targeted to the PNC insurance market with particular strength in the enterprise class market segment. Across both Deltek and Aderant, we continue to see solid new customer adds and nice momentum and migration towards their SaaS solutions. Also in the quarter we acquired TIP Technologies for Deltek, a leading software provider servicing the GovCon manufacturing and QA market and viGlobal for Aderant, a leading human resources and recruiting software tool for global law firms. CBORD, our nutrition and access management software business had strength across both education and healthcare and end markets. CliniSys and Data Innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. CliniSys continued its market share gains across Europe and DI continues to demonstrate product market fit by gaining share of wallet across large healthcare systems. Strata continues to be solid for us as evidenced by strong new customer adds, cross-selling and renewal activity. Finally, Frontline will be reported in this segment starting in Q4. Looking at the outlook for the final quarter of the year, we expect to see organic growth in the 6% to 8% area. Turning to Page 12. Revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $347 million, up 10% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 54.5%. The 10% organic growth in this segment is underpinned by 16% growth in recurring revenue. As we dig into business specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continue to be fantastic. The marketing conditions while slowing a touch on the carrier side of the network remained favorable, these businesses saw nice new customer adds and ARPU increases during the quarter. Moving to foundry, our software business that enables live-action filming and computer-generated graphics to be combined in a single frame \u2013 frame again demonstrated their financial strength. Net retention was very strong and ARR grew in the strong double digits again. Foundry's success is rooted in their fast-paced innovation capability and favorable long-term market conditions. Growth in our businesses that focus on alternate site healthcare was led by SHP and SoftWriters and importantly retention rates across each of these businesses remained extremely high. Finally, iTrade, our network food supply chain business and iPipeline, our life insurance SaaS business that tech enables the quoting and underwriting processes, each had solid customer additions, which helped drive strong ARR growth in the quarter. Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect to see 8% to 10% organic growth for this segment. As we turn to Page 13, revenues in our tech-enabled products segment were $360 million, up 15% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment increased nicely to 37.2% in the quarter. It's very nice to see 15% organic growth in the quarter and easing supply chain challenges. While supply chain challenges remain, we experienced demonstrable easing conditions especially as it relates to chips and chipsets. We are cautiously optimistic conditions will continue to improve. Let's start with Neptune, which once again set records for orders and quarter end backlog. For a few quarters running, Neptune has been able to gain market share by successfully maintaining industry leading product lead times while simultaneously launching new products both in terms of cellular connectivity and static meter reading technology. To this end, Neptune continues to experience accelerating demand that are static meter solutions. Verathon was simply strong. They grew nicely in the quarter driven by momentum across all three components of their product portfolio: bladder volume measurement, video innovation and single use bronchoscopes. As it relates to Northern Digital, they set a new record for quarterly revenues as they experience continued strong demand for their precision measurement solutions. Our outlook for the final quarter of the year is 5% to 7% organic growth for this segment as we have a more difficult comp heading into Q4. Now, please turn to Page 15 and let's review our updated and increased outlook for the balance of the year. As a reminder, last quarter, we increased our adjusted DEPS outlook to be between $13.46 and $13.62. We are now once again increasing our guidance to be between $14.09 and $14.13, an increase of $0.57 at the mid-point. This increase in guidance is driven by our strong third quarter performance and the momentum we carry in Q4, together with the addition of Frontline Education. Embedded in this guidance is full year organic growth of 9% plus an increase from 8% to 9% organic growth guidance discussed last quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we're establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.72 and $3.76. Now we're concluding comments and we'll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 16, we want to leave you with the same key points with which we started. First, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance, and we are increasing our outlook for the year. Second, we acquired another leading knit software business, Frontline Education. Third, we continue to have substantial M&A firepower north of $4 billion. And fourth, perhaps the most important, the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming ever more visible. As it relates to our strong start, we grew revenues organically by 10% and EBITDA by 12%. We're lifting our full year organic growth and DEPS guidance based on the factors previously discussed. Regarding capital deployment, we have been active. Over the past couple months we deployed just over $4 billion. To this end, our prudence and patience are being rewarded through the identification of selections of these high quality assets. We continue to have a large amount of available M&A capacity north of $4 billion. We continue to be very active in the M&A markets, but as you saw in Q3, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. Finally, and perhaps the most important, the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we have never been more excited about the future of our enterprise. As we turn to your questions, let us remind everyone that our strategy is the same. We compound cash flow by acquiring and growing niche market leading technology businesses. This is what we've done for over 20 years and will continue to do. In addition, our value creation and governance model remains unchanged. We operate a portfolio of market-leading businesses and defensible niches. Each of our businesses has high levels of recurring revenue, strong margin, and competes based on customer intimacy, which yields highly resilient, organic growth rates. We operate a highly decentralized operating structure that focuses on long-term business building. Our culture sets a very high bar for performance and focuses on continually improving. We are all paid to grow, which reinforces our culture of transparency, nimbleness, and humility. Finally, we redeployed the vast majority of our capital to acquire the next great business. We do this with centralized corporate resources in a highly disciplined, thoughtful, and analytical manner. This strategy unchanged, delivers compounded and superior long-term shareholder value. So thanks for joining us this morning, and with that, let's open up to your questions. Hey, good morning Deane. Yes, Deane, nothing in a meaningful sustained manner. Right? So I think we attribute that first to the markets that we serve. Right? So think about customers in healthcare, education, insurance, food, government contracting, utilities I mean, the macro forces generally are lessened or less impactful in those end markets. ARRs, I think, they are up the double digits 10%. So that's always a leading indicator of the strength. But there is certainly quarter-to-quarter there can be some noise. And so last quarter we're looking at, for instance, PowerPlan minus off some softening, but that recovered this quarter. And so it's not to say there is not pockets of things we look at, but nothing in a sustained manner at this stage. Yes, I draw you back. This is the same thing we've been talking about since really over the last four or five years since we became COO and CEO and the team we have in place today. So, we historically \u2013 long history this \u2013 we've said this is a GDP plus a little bit grower, and as we've restructured the portfolio and as we've talked about here increased the expectation outlook for more organic out of existing portfolio, now it's mid-single digits certainly through cycle. And we are always looking to continue to improve that. We've talked at NASOM [ph] about the desire to improve the organic growth outlook through our governance system of our businesses, thinking about how to do strategy right, where to play and how to win, how to execute that strategy in a process in discipline manner, and then how to build team and talent to sort of use that as a long-term competitive advantage. We've been at this with the portfolio for three or four years, and we're starting to see some signs of improvement. So, we're encouraged, but it's an ongoing body of work that never ends. Hey, Scott. Sure. Appreciate the opportunity to talk about that. I'll tell you, you never have perfect information. And so this is using all of our inputs and reading the tea leaves to really understand what happened. In the process the seller here Thoma had some bespoke reasons they needed to get liquidity from an asset they chose this one. They happened to time it in the market where private equity bidders had a difficult time bidding because there was not, or has not been a private leverage loan market. And so in that result, the process was thinner competitively, meaningfully thinner competitively and that's why we believe we are able to get a very fair price for the asset. So the process dynamics were a little bit different. And just another example of sort of the patience and our commitment to investment grade leverage and the conservative posture of our financial policy enables us to sort of move nimbly when an opportunity presents itself. It's very difficult for us to sort of bifurcate volume and price. Keep in mind we're 75% software. Inside software the growth algorithm of every one of our software businesses, you would trip a little bit. There is price baked in every year to sort of offset \u2013 mostly if not all of attrite. When you're cross-selling and upselling it to the customer base that gives it to your net retention and you are adding new customers to get the total growth. And so pricing and value capture is just completely native to the inner workings of the pricing model inside a software. And it's not \u2013 and it would be generally consistent with the past. I mean, there may be a little bit more prices, labor has gone up in the software model. As it relates to the product businesses, our product businesses have done a fabulous job of essentially passing the cost increases through with the margin to our customers. As you know that lags a little bit. It showed up in margins this quarter in [indiscernible]. That will continue to bleed out over the next several quarters as the backlog that was built early in the years is shipped. And so the teams have done a nice job with that. Hey, good morning. Yes, so, it is company specific, right. So every company is going to adjust as their market demands. As a general matter as large tech employment softens I view that as a good thing for our business because it makes it easier for us to hire the labor and talent that we need to hire. Here is point one. Point two, is keep in mind what we do for our customers. Right? We are selling and delivering to them the thing they need to run their business. So we are mission-critical to what they do and our pricing model is vastly fixed subscription. So it's not volume or transaction based. So we should be relatively muted to sort of short cycle fluctuations and the macroeconomic indicators. And so a little bit better labor environment, I think, is unbalanced a good thing for us. We're always focused on improving both the scale and the quality of the enterprise. It's been 20 years, it will be the next 20 years and finding the best asset at the best prices we can find. And there is no difference in that going forward. Good morning. Yes, sure. I'll take a crack at it and then ask Rob if he wants to correct or amplify anything I say. So it's been a pretty consistent set of performance across the various businesses. We've talked for many quarters about the strength of U.S. Canadian freight match, right? It's just been fantastic for us. It continues to be good. For the last two or three quarters, we've talked two quarters this quarter and last quarter we've talked about how \u2013 the rate of growth is slowing a little bit, but it's still very good. Even this quarter there was a strong number of new career ads, so we would expect that to sort of slow down a bit over the course of the next year. The other businesses, Foundry, SoftWriters, iTrade, SHPI pipeline are just solid performers that have been very consistent and generally don't have that macro sort of tailwind that the freight match businesses have had. So we wouldn't expect any meaningful change from those businesses. Anything you want to add or comment? I'll take the first couple \u2013 excuse me, parts of that question around supply chain pacing and improvement and let Rob comment about the OP leverage or EBITDA leverage there. So, just to set the context for us the supply chain, we have been modestly gated from shipping in a one or two of the businesses for short periods of time but for the most part it's been about \u2013 we've been able to ship, but it's been about a higher component cost and expedited logistics in order to sort of both inbound and outbound the products. This quarter demonstrably supply chain especially around chips improved intra-quarter. We went into the quarter assuming it's going to be difficult and it meaningfully improved during the quarter. So it's our expectation that that part of supply chain element continues to ease Q4 and beyond. There's still a little bit of challenges around the certain components principally come out of China, think motors and things like that, that are still have longer lead times, but those appear to be abating as well. We don't assume that happens per se in Q4. As it relates to the price and sort of pushing that through, we talked about a little bit before the companies have been very good at taking price increases to offset the component price or cost increases, but it lags by a handful of \u2013 not a handful, a couple quarters between you take the order and when you deliver the order and that started showing up this quarter. Hey, good morning, Steve. Yes. Good morning. So yes, each one is different between the freight match, the North American DAT freight match business, and iTrade on what they're doing all their product and go-to-market strategy. Rather the DAT, I would \u2013 there's a lot that we could unpack and delighted to talk to you about this on a call down or a more longer form way but the short version is they've done a terrific job on both their freight match product and their analytics product and then creating product tiers based on the value the customer wants to sort of buy into. At DAT also something like 75% of the bookings today are through their e-commerce channel where three years ago or five years ago, it was zero. So they've really removed the barriers to do business with them and when you look at the ARPU increases like 70% of the ARPU increase has been because customers have elected to a higher package because there's been more value to sort of get from the network. So they've done a wonderful job that's bespoke and unique to DAT like it is for all 27 businesses that iTrade. The go-to-market motion there has been the \u2013 it's been mostly the same but this over the course of probably about a year-and-a-half ago, the company released a new product offering to enable the supplier part of the network to do easier trading with the buy side of the network is the simplest way I could describe it. So think of it as like a lighter weight supply chain management software tool for half of the network and it's just been \u2013 it's a very consistent booking, so over the last four or five quarters as it's been released. You want to comment? Q4 or recurring? Hey Joe. Yes. What I would maybe add three points to that, Joe. One is it's, when you look at the 27 companies it's a very tight distribution in terms of the growth rate. There's not \u2013 it's not a bar bill where you got 10 companies growing 2% and 10 companies growing 15% of averages into something different. It's a very tight, I think the only two acquisitions we've done, we've announced as a high-single digit organic growth business. Everything else has been mid-singles and we're working to improve that. So as a general matter, think of it as a mid-single digit through cycle organic growth portfolio that is \u2013 has all the casual characteristics you'd want to see with that. We'd see operating leverage occur, so that's going to translate to a little bit more cash growth organically. And then you got to layer on top of that the M&A flywheel. So we feel very comfortable. We have a mid-teen sort of cash flow compounding growth algorithm that's embedded in our strategy. We think the answer is no. We're not in any meaningful way or even in a minor way a beneficiary of the stimulus or COVID funds. For instance, with Frontline we studied that extensively during a diligence process and while the K-12 districts certainly on-boarded stimulus and COVID dollars, the vast, vast majority of those funds, the one-time funds were spent on one-time type items principally getting for instance student to device ratios to one-to-one for instance. They were districts were super hesitant to buy a recurring software package with one-time money. So Frontline we don't believe in any meaningful way was a beneficiary that we think that's a good thing goes to the durability of the growth drivers of the business. Seaboard, same thing, there's what Seaboard does, I mean it's about food and management for these K-12 and higher Ed facilities and at campuses as well as access management and integrated security and they have not been a meaningful beneficiary. So no is a short answer. No. The leverage ratio is completely independent of the rate environment. And very high yield... And that those markets have been closed. Yes. The market is, the number of deals then and processes that are in slide are quite large, yes. You're welcome. Thanks Alex."

            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Good morning everyone. Turn to Page 8 and covering our Q3 financial highlights. As a reminder, as Zack said, all financial results are on a continuing operations basis. Total revenue increased 10% to $1.35 billion. The FX headwind was $20 million or 1.6% and was offset by acquisition contributions. Notably, our mix of business has shifted meaningfully toward more domestic revenue post the announced majority sale of our industrial businesses. The U.S. now represents approximately 85% of our revenue helping to shield our results from the impacts of any currency fluctuations. Q3 organic revenue increased 10% with broad-based strength across each of our three reporting segments: Application Software grew 7%, Network Software grew 10% and Technology Enabled Products grew a robust 15% organically. EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points to 41.1%, resulting in 12% EBITDA growth. Adjusted DEPS was $3.67, well above our guidance range and 18% higher than last year. Q3 adjusted free cash flow was $353 million, which was 9% above prior year. Excluding the Section 174 tax law change we discussed last quarter, quarterly free cash flow grew 17%. In the quarter, we made $157 million of additional tax payments related to our recent divestitures. Per our normal convention, those payments have been adjusted out of our reported cash flow, so overall, an excellent third quarter, as Neil said, and great momentum heading into Q4. Next slide. Turn to Page 9, looking at our strong financial position. We did complete the Frontline acquisition early in the fourth quarter, utilizing a combination of our balance sheet cash and a draw on our revolving credit facility. As of today, our draw and revolver balance sits at $2.2 billion. We expect to fully pay down the revolver balance with the proceeds from our industrial sale, which should close late in the fourth quarter. So after taking into account the receipt of those industrial transaction proceeds, we'd expect to end the year with a net debt to EBITDA ratio pro forma for our recent acquisitions in the mid-2s. Our consistently strong cash generation quickly refreshes our capacity for capital deployment. So looking forward, we remain active on the M&A front and we have the ability to deploy an additional $4 billion plus of capital now through the end of 2023. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to review our segment performance. Good morning Deane. Good morning. Good morning. Yes. Hey Chris, it's Rob. I don't think anything really to call out. I mean, we had really strong organic growth with these software businesses that comes through with great incremental. So I'm just looking back to the margins. Last year, I think, we ended last year at 54 in the fourth quarter we were 54.5 EBITDA here. So yes, no, I think, it was a nice quarter performance, probably similar for the fourth quarter in terms of EBITDA margin for the segment. Yes, that's right. So for the fourth quarter we've got about $40 million of EBITDA in for Frontline. And there is about $24 million, excuse me, of incremental interest. If you look at where we were before to now, as I mentioned earlier, we did draw on the revolver and so we're paying the revolver interest for much of the fourth quarter than we're assuming that the industrial sale closes late in the quarter and then that interest expense would go away. So I think the math on that is about $0.12 of our sort of $0.57 guidance increase was Frontline. Yes. Thanks Jason. No, I think that's fair. Yes. I'll just add to that. There's great momentum here. Neptune has been performing really, really well. Neil talked about how they're \u2013 they're still seeing great orders and great backlog and great momentum and so that should \u2013 that should certainly carry forward. So with the supply chain issues easing as Neil mentioned, I mean, leverage here I think it was 50% EBITDA leverage in the quarter. We should be north of 40% leverage over the long-term as these businesses continue to grow strong organically and so that would tick-up the EBITDA margins a little bit in that segment. Yes. I think if you look at the guide the tap volume, revenue is a little lower fourth quarter versus third quarters. You mentioned some supply chain ease and some stuff shifted \u2013 shifted a little bit earlier. Other than that, I think you're right. I mean it's just \u2013 it's a much different portfolio, right? We don't have the seasonality with all the energy businesses with the big fourth quarter, that's just \u2013 that those businesses have been divested. Yes. So I mean, cash flow should be strong in the fourth quarter. Obviously, setting aside the fact that we're still making payments on the divestitures it's always our best working capital quarter on deferred revenue. In the fourth quarters when we get most of our renewals for the software businesses, that's usually the best quarter for that as well. So it's usually a very good working capital quarter. And then if you look forward we certainly don't guide cash flow, but we are really, really well positioned for great cash conversion next year as we get these cash tax payments behind us and now we have a portfolio with even better working capital characteristics, and so we feel great about our abilities to continue to compound cash flow moving forward. Yes. Yes. Should be \u2013 should be similar that that we've seen. That the trends there continue to be very positive overall on recurring revenue for sure. Yes. I think the place to start right is the removal of the cyclicality, right? So if you look at where Roper is now is as we mentioned earlier, it's a very different portfolio because we don't have that 40% of Roper that was projects and cyclicality back to 2018. So that, so now you don't have the situation where you might have something that grows 15% one-year and then goes down 15% the next year. So really the whole portfolio is sort of plus or minus mid-single digit organic and in a bad year something might be up 2% or 3% and in a great year it could certainly be double digits. And I'll let Neil expand on that. We've long said that higher interest rates are, we believe are a \u2013 we're a benefactor of that. 70% for the reasons that 70% to 80% of our capital that we deploy is from our internally generated cash flow. Obviously 20% to 30% is from the balance sheet. So we're versus private equity who are competing against 50-plus percent of what they deploy in may be every deal is variable rate debt at the moment. So they are much more indexed and their values are much more indexed to shorter term rates than anything that we would see. ...and very high yield. So we think we're beneficiaries in a higher rate environment because one would think over time, if these rates are sustained and that's a big, if they're sustained, then you'd see valuations adjust accordingly, and so we think that's our view on that. We've been very consistent of that view for a long time. Alex, that's a hard one to give you a level precision. I will tell you we did better in the quarter because the supply chain got better. I mean, Verathon had a lot of things that had to go exactly right and they \u2013 most reverse what they did. Neptune did a nice job as well. Northern Digital did a great job. So a chunk of the beat would certainly be attributed to that. Yes, Alex so there's certainly no need for a pause to deliver because our leverage rates are still relatively low because we are benefiting from the fact that we did these divestitures and we're still really redeploying those proceeds in addition to our normal cadence. So really no reason to pause. So we're very active in the M&A markets. Today we'll remain active. We might do deals very soon. It might take us a couple quarters as Neil mentioned, we're going to be very, very patient. But we're certainly going to remain active and there's not going to be any sort of a pause in that activity. Like you've seen after some of the larger deals where we did lever up and we're in a situation where we sort of had to take some time to reduce the leverage."

[Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. During the quarter, Roper announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in our industrial businesses. Results for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, the numbers shown in this presentation are on a continuing operations basis. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense income tax restructuring expense associated with the pending sale of our industrial businesses. And lastly, we have adjusted our cash flow statement to exclude the cash taxes paid related to our 2021 divestitures. GAAP requires these payments to be classified as operating cash flow items even though they are related to the divestitures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This morning, we'll start by reviewing our second quarter highlights and financial results then we'll review our segment detail and our increase out for the year then get to your questions. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are first, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance, and we're increasing our outlook for the year; second, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to divest the majority stake of our industrial businesses; and third, we have north of 7 billion of available M&A firepower. Looking at the second quarter, we continue to be pleased with the quality of execution across our enterprise. This quarter is characterized by having very strong order activity and solid organic growth of 11%. Of particular importance, our growth was quite broad-based across our three segments. Consistent with our commentary during the last several quarters, not only did we grow nicely within the quarter, but the quality of the underlying businesses also improved as we saw our software recurring revenue base grow 12% on an organic basis. In addition to our strong software growth, our product businesses performed very well in the quarter, experiencing very high levels of demand and record levels of backlog. Once we complete the divestiture of the majority interest of our industrial businesses, the quality of our portfolio will be significantly improved across several dimensions. First, we will be meaningfully less cyclical with about 75% of our portfolio being software and the balance being medical and water products. Second, we'll have higher levels of recurring revenue with 80% of our software revenue being recurring in nature. Also, a large percentage of our product revenue is reoccurring in nature, such as Neptune's replacement demand and our medical product consumables. And third, we'll be even more asset-light given a vastly improved working capital profile one that generates significant increasing amount of cash as we continue to grow. And finally, with the closing of our industrial divestiture, which we anticipate will occur later this year, we'll have north of $7 billion of M&A capacity. We are very active in the M&A markets, but also remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. We are confident in our ability to deploy this capital wisely, which in turn will further improve both the quality and scale of our enterprise. We are proud of our operating team for their execution, a very solid quarter. Now let me turn the call to Rob, who will walk through our financial summary. Rob?\nRob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 6, here, we want to briefly cover our Q2 performance compared to our guidance, including the industrial businesses now reported as part of discontinued operations due to the pending sale. On that apples-to-apples basis, our Q2 of $3.95 compares quite favorably to our guidance of $3.80 to $3.84, an $0.11 beat at the high end of our guidance, a very strong quarter. Next slide. Turning to Page 7 and covering the Q2 financial highlights. Here, we will review some of the key financial metrics on a continuing operations basis which is our reporting basis for earnings and guidance moving forward. Total revenue increased 10% to $1.31 billion. Organic revenue increased 11% with strength across each of our three reporting segments. Application Software grew 7% organically as our two largest businesses, Deltek and Vertafore continue to perform very well. Network software grew 15% led by continued exceptional performance at our freight matching businesses. Finally, our new technology-enabled products segment grew 13% organically, aided by an excellent quarter from Neptune. EBITDA margin was 39.3%, resulting in EBITDA increasing 10% to $515 million. DEPS on a continuing ops basis was 3.43%, 16% higher than last year. Net working capital is now negative 17% of Q2 annualized revenue as a result of our higher quality portfolio. Q2 adjusted free cash flow was $252 million, which was 19% below prior year, but still represent a 17% three-year CAGR versus 2019. Notably, like many technology companies, our cash flow was negatively impacted by the Section 174 R&D capitalization change that took effect for 2022. We paid $49 million in Q2 related to Section 174, and we expect to pay an additional $50 million for Section 174 in the second half. Importantly, this tax law change only impacts the timing of when the taxes are due, and not the overall amount of tax owed or our tax rate. Additionally, in the quarter, we made tax payments related to the gains on the 2021 divestitures of TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy. Per our normal convention, those payments have been adjusted out of our cash flow. Finally, we are very pleased to announce the completion of our new five-year $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. We are grateful for our bank group and their continued support, and I personally like to thank Shannon O'Callaghan next to me for the excellent work in leading the process for Roper. So in summary, with a $3 billion cash balance, our new revolver in place, and the future proceeds from the closing of our industrial sale later this year, we are very well positioned for meaningful capital deployment. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil.\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Congrats to you and your team for upsizing and extending our revolver, especially in these market conditions. As we turn to Page 9, we summarize for you our go-forward portfolio of 26 businesses arrayed across three segments: application software, network software and tech-enabled products. In the 8-K issued a few weeks ago, we provided historical annual and quarterly financial disclosures on this segmented basis. Also for the first time, we're breaking down our revenues by type. As you see, 61% of our total revenue and 82% of our software revenues are recurring or reoccurring in nature. 74% of our total revenues are software related. For several quarters, we've communicated how the quality of our revenue stream continues to improve. You can see this point well illustrated here. Our 11% organic growth is underpinned by a 12% growth in our software recurring revenue base. Further, you can see the breadth of the growth, growth in software and products. Our strategy for nearly two decades now has been to improve the quality of our enterprise, and this is clearly reflected on this page. We cannot be more excited for our future. Let's turn to Page 10 and walk through the 2Q highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $627 million, up 7% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 43.1%. Across this segment, we saw recurring revenue which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment increased 8% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was quite broad. As we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Deltek. The Deltek team posted another great quarter of strength across all end market serves with particular strength in their construction contractor end market. In addition, Deltek continues to gain momentum, driving adoption to their cloud-based product offerings. Vertafore had an excellent quarter, which was highlighted by strong ARR bookings activity and revenue growth. Also during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of MGA Systems. This tuck-in acquisition enhances Vertafore's ability to compete and win in the managed general agent segment of the property and casualty insurance ecosystem. CliniSys and Data Innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. CliniSys continued its market share gains in the U.K.; DI continues to demonstrate product market fit by gaining share of wallet across large health systems and the VA. Strata continues to be super solid for us. The acquisition of EPSI has been exceedingly strong as Strata has successfully lifted and shifted many EPSI customers to the Strata cloud-based offering. At the same time, Stratic continues to improve the legacy EPSI product release and support capability. We remain committed to meeting the EPSI and Strata customers where they are. Finally, Aderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, extending their share gains in the large loss space. Aderant continues to see an acceleration of SaaS booking activity driving substantial increases in the recurring revenue base. Looking to the outlook for the second half of 2022 in this segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit growth for the balance of the year, driven by continued ARR momentum. Turning to Page 11, revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $343 million, up 15% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 52%. The 15% organic growth in this segment is underpinned by 19% growth in recurring revenue. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continued to be exceptional. The market conditions while slowing a touch on the carrier side of the network continue to be favorable. During the recent surge in transportation volumes, the market share of the ecosystem represented by the spot market increased as it became easier to transact volumes in the spot market compared to the contracted market. We believe this is a secular trend that DAT will benefit from over a multiyear arc. In addition, DAT continues to do a nice job of increasing revenue per user by both adding features and improving value capture. Finally, over a longer arc planning horizon, our freight matching businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the further digitization of the spot freight market. Moving to foundry, our software business that enables live-action filming and computer-generated graphics to be combined in a single frame continued their recent financial strength. Net retention is north of 110% and ARR grew double digits again. Foundry success is rooted in their fast-paced innovation capability and favorable long-term market conditions. ITrade our network food supply chain business and our pipeline, our life insurance SaaS business that tech enables the quoting and underwriting processes, each had solid customer additions, which helped drive strong era growth in the quarter. Finally, our businesses, which focus on alternate site health care, namely skilled nursing, assisted living and home health grew nicely in the quarter despite their customers' growth being constrained by staffing shortages. Proud of the execution here. Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment, driven by continued recurring revenue momentum and moderating growth for our freight match businesses. As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our tech-enabled products segment were $340 million, up 13% on an organic basis despite the very challenging supply chain environment. EBITDA margins for this segment were 34.9% in the quarter. Let's start with Neptune, which had record orders, revenue and quarter ending backlog. For a few quarters running, Neptune has been able to gain market share by being successful in keeping product lead times at industry-leading terms and releasing new products, both in terms of cellular connectivity and static meter reading technology. As a fun fact, Neptune turns 50 later this quarter and next year will mark our 20-year ownership anniversary, a great run so far with an even better forward view. Congrats Hunn to you and your team for building such a great company. Verathon, Northern Digital and each of our medical product franchises continue to see very strong ordering activity but were hampered by a variety of supply chain challenges during the quarter. That said, the teams are executing exceptionally well, and we remain confident in our ability to execute through these challenges. Looking over the horizon, each of our medical product businesses are benefactors of secular tailwinds, namely the increased demand for single-use devices and the aging of the population. As it relates to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single-digit growth for this segment, underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain challenges. Now please turn to Page 14, and let's review our updated and increased outlook for the balance of the year. As a reminder, last quarter, we increased our adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $15.50 and $15.75, which included $2.30 from our industrial businesses. Given our agreement to divest our industrial businesses, we are removing the $2.30 million from our guidance model going forward. So on a new curtailing ops basis, our previous guidance equates to $13.20 to $13.45. Based on our strong Q2 and second half visibility, we're now increasing our continuing ops guidance to be between 13 46 and 13 62. Embedded in this guidance is full year organic growth of 8% to 9%, again, on a continuing ops basis. As we look to the third quarter, we're establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.42 and 3.46. Now our concluding comments and we'll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 15, we want to leave you with the same three points with which we started. First, we had a strong quarter of performance, and we're increasing the outlook for the full year. Second, we took strategic actions to invest a majority stake in our industrial businesses. And third, we have a tremendous amount of M&A firepower north of $7 billion. As it relates to our strong start, we grew revenues organically 11%, EBITDA 10% and DEPS 16%, and free cash flow has grown 17% on a three-year compounded basis. We are lifting our full year organic growth in DEPS guidance based on the factors outlined during the call, specifically strong recurring revenue growth and a record demand for our product businesses. Finally, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have a highly active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We have north of $7 billion of M&A available firepower. As mentioned at the start of today's call, our high levels of activity are equally matched with our patience and discipline, and we remain confident in our ability to deploy this capital to further improve the quality and scale of our enterprise, just as we've done over the past two decades. Finally, kudos to Rob and Shannon and the finance team for increasing the size and term of our $3.5 billion revolver. As we turn to your questions, let us remind everyone that our strategy is the same: We compound cash flow by acquiring and growing niche market-leading technology businesses. This is what we've done for over 20 years and will continue to do so. In addition, our value creation and governance model remains unchanged. We operate a portfolio of market-leading businesses and defensible niches. Each of our businesses has high levels of recurring revenue, strong margins and compete based on customer intimacy, which yields highly resilient organic growth rates. We operate a highly decentralized operational structure that focuses on long-term business building. Our culture sets a very high bar for performance and focuses on continually improving. We are all paid to grow, which reinforces our culture of transparency, nimbleness and humility. Finally, we redeployed the vast majority of our capital to acquire the next great business. We do this with a centralized corporate resource team in a highly disciplined, thoughtful and analytical manner. This strategy, unchanged, delivers compounded and superior long-term shareholder value. So thanks for joining us this morning. And with that, let's open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Yes, thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Congrats on the first earnings report under the new look, Roper.\nNeil Hunn: No, thank you.\nDeane Dray: If we could start, I really like the new breakout on revenue on Page 9 as well as Page 19 in the appendix, which shows you the same information broken out by segment. How do you expect that mix to change over the next couple of years, especially in the conversion and migration to SaaS?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, Deane. So really, the -- in the recurring line, that 54% line on Page 9, embedded in that line is both the on-premise maintenance and the SaaS. And so the migration will happen inside of that line. Now what we'll see is, it'll -- as that happens, we get an uplift from the on-prem maintenance to the SaaS because you're delivering more value -- and so you'll see sort of a long-term multi-multiyear tailwind in that line, but it happens and the conversion happens within that singular line.\nDeane Dray: Okay, that's helpful. And then for Rob, look, we're all kind of calibrating the Section 174 and the impact, and I'm glad you added that one sentence that says it doesn't change the total amount. It just changed the timing of the tax payments -- just clarify how that plays out for the course of the year and the comps for next year. And then is there -- on the working capital that negative 17%, is that the new run rate based upon the new earnings and mix for Roper going forward? And is there still upside to that?\nRob Crisci: Yes, yes. So on working capital, yes, I mean, the 17% is the run rate. I think there is upside, right? We expect to grow these software businesses as they continue to grow, they'll generate more cash and work capital should get more negative over time. Yes, on 174, it is -- it will be a total $100 million headwind for this year. So, it's basically around $25 million a quarter we paid. As you know, we make two tax payments in the second quarter, that's why it was 49% in the quarter. Yes. So, obviously, there's been a lot said about this. The law could change at some point, and then we'd get that money back. So, it's really just -- you look at the same deductions over time, but certainly, now you have to wait for the deductions basically.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: So I wanted to talk about the new segment a little bit in the medical products. Talk seeing if you could break out some of the supply chain impacts on margins the revenue gating aspect and any abnormal kind of levels of backlog, how you'd characterize that, how let's think about it.\nRob Crisci: Yes. So the performance was very good. So we're certainly, like everyone else who sells products, have some supply chain issues. I mean backlog is I think, double if you look where we are this year versus the same time last year. So there's plenty of opportunity to continue to grow the revenue. A little bit of margin impact. We think that gets a little bit better in the second half. I think our business has done a great job of pushing through price. And so that takes some time to start to sell the products at a higher price versus the cost, so I think that's a little bit better over time. But everyone is managing it really, really well. So, we feel really good about our operations.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And for a follow-up, if you look at Slide 12, the tech-enabled products, the EBITDA margins are down about 5.5 points Q2 this year versus 2020 second quarter. Just can you talk just conceptually about that bridge, what that gap represents?\nRob Crisci: Yes, so 2020 was an outlier because of the big Verathon quarter with the -- in the heart of COVID. So that's when Verathon had that just extremely strong growth as we're trying to fight the virus. And so, I think probably '19 is a little bit more normalized from a margin standpoint, but we do think that those margins should tick up over time.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Day with Cornelius.\nScott Davis: I wanted to talk a little bit about price. Is there -- is there -- I imagine the price escalators in the SaaS, -- is it -- is there some sort of basis like CPI? Is it half a CPI? I mean, can you give us just a little bit kind how you think how price gets passed through and those things?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So there's -- and price -- if you're -- obviously, you're specifically talking about software. I mean, there's the way you sort of capture price and value capture and software is a little bit different than the product. So in the software, you're right, for the all that subscription and maintenance is generally tied to a CPI plus a touch -- which is -- so we were able to see price. The other thing that's just also just naturally embedded in the software business is price. I mean, it's a part of the growth algorithm in each and every year. The customers are used to taking price. And obviously, with inflation, interest rates higher, then there'll be a little bit more price. The offset to that is the cost structure in the software businesses increase through increasing labor wages, but it happens over a longer arc of time, and it's less spiky than what you see in the product businesses. So naturally, as the pipeline of that is you get a nice matchup of the increase of labor cost with the pricing on the software part of our business.\nScott Davis: And is there a difference in kind of pricing when you think about recurring versus non-recurring? It's kind of Dean's question. I was a little confused in your answer, and maybe just because I only had one cup of coffee, but -- is there a difference -- I mean you mentioned you kind of add more value and you get a little bit more price, but go back and talk to me like I'm three-year old.\nNeil Hunn: No, so apologies if I was confusing. So there's two issues we're talking about. So on price, on software; if you're a well-run software company, you're taking price on both the cost of the software in a perpetual world and the maintenance on that. So you move them up in tandem, where you don't end up in sort of a challenging thing that some software companies do that ends up being a bad thing is they only take price up on the maintenance and not the initial software. Our companies take them up in tandem, so they stay together. So that's the pricing point. Dean's point was asking about what's the relationship between on-premise maintenance, which we get paid once we deliver the perpetual software and SaaS and the SaaS shift. And so as we migrate or lift and shift a customer from on-premise to our cloud, as you're doing that, you're delivering more value, not only hosting the application and all the security, you're also delivering the most recent versions or keeping them on the most recent version so they take advantage of the most recent features and you're just generally eliminating sort of the headaches of running the software for the client. Because of that value bundle of SaaS, you are able to capture more value, oftentimes, 2x on a recurring basis or a touch more. So it's -- that's about the value proposition of moving to the cloud versus your straight question of what happens in a price increase environment for the software.\nRob Crisci: And just to give you a sense, we're roughly 75% subscription and 25% in maintenance today. So we're still -- we're already largely in the cloud. There's roughly $200 million of license revenue that would go away over time and convert to that subscription revenue that Neil mentioned. But as you know with us, that's a long period of time, driven by the customers. And so it's a really good story, I think, on the recurring revenue line.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: So now you've gone through the GIG code change and all this. I'm just curious, Neil, Rob, what's your initial kind of conversations were with the new cohort of investors that you'll likely talk to now? And what were some of the things that maybe some initial pushback you're getting from them some things that they like and how have those discussions kind of overall have gone so far?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I would say the GICS code change, it's not like this light switch that's happened or all of a sudden, every conversation we're having with the buy-side is a different person. In fact, it's quite the opposite. I mean, it's a slow evolutionary sort of change here. We've been to a singular software conference where we had half a dozen conversations. They were generally the same conversation we have with our legacy shareholder base, which is what's your business model, what's your flywheel and what are the risks, what's the durability and quite similar. A little bit -- a little discussion, obviously, on growth a little bit on the cash flow dynamics of the business, a little bit of the business model mix between recurring, non-recurring, but they're the same questions really.\nRob Crisci: I was just saying a lot of excitement, right? Because I think as we said at that conference, we were at intra-quarter that we're the fourth largest application software company, I think, in the S&P 500. And a lot of these analysts are just getting to know us, and I think they're really excited when they look at our past and our future prospects. So we're excited to expand to a new shareholder race while, of course, also making sure that our current shareholder base is continually happy with their investment in Roper.\nJoe Giordano: So when you think about M&A, does the divestment like -- is there a step change function that happened internally with DRI that makes finding new companies that clear the threshold harder I'm guessing just mathematically taking out the industrial businesses, make CRI higher or more negative or however you want to look at it. And then like maybe you could have slotted in a business that previously could have improved the profile of Roper, but maybe now that business might not meet the threshold. Is that accurate? Or is it just not material enough to worry about?\nNeil Hunn: It's not material enough to worry about, but let me tell you why. I mean, -- the -- for essentially my entire almost 11 years I've been here, we've looked at the same cohort of targets, which are wonderful asset-light software businesses. And that's the cohort we're looking at now, right? So, it's just -- it's not about becoming even more asset-light once yours asset lines we are. It's about staying as asset light as we are. That's why the universe of targets is plentiful.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: On that network software business, understanding that freight matching sort of the growth and sort of the moderation there, could you maybe talk to the balance of the businesses in that segment in terms of the overall combined? Is it mid- to high single-digit growth? I'm just trying to understand the impact that the freight match had on it.\nRob Crisci: Yes, most of the businesses in that segment are normally sort of mid-single-digit organic businesses that occasionally do higher than that, very rarely do lower than that. And so, I think as you get into the second half of the year, those are sort of doing what they do, and then you just have a little bit of moderation in the freight matching growth.\nAllison Poliniak: And then just kind of pulling on to that last M&A question, certainly, the software is a focus in terms of M&A. What about tech-enabled products? Is there anything you guys are kind of looking at that we may be clear that hurdle or is it sort of off the table there at this point?\nNeil Hunn: No, it's definitely not off the table. It has not been off the table. We just haven't actioned anything there in quite a while. So if it's an asset-light tech-enabled product than business that is a leader in a small market, the competitive forces are stable, sort of all of our criteria, then it's definitely something we would look at.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the software business. First off, in terms of freight match, help us understand the cyclicality of that business. There's been a lot of scary stories about freight recessions all year long in the U.S. How should we expect that business to perform in that type of macro? And I guess NSS has enjoyed fantastic operating leverage. We see the margins going up to the low 50s in Q2. What's the risk to that sort of incremental margin, if you like, from freight match rolling? And then any color in application software about the license business? Again there were some questions after the SAP update earlier this week.\nNeil Hunn: So let me take the DAT One and the application software license one, and I'll let Rob talk about the margins if that's okay in NSS. So on DAT, DAT grew through the 2019 freight recession. But it has been just spectacular the last couple of years at DAT for two reasons. There's certainly a cyclical tailwind it's had, there's also a secular tailwind that it's enjoyed. The secular tailwind endures. That's why the business is able to sort of grow through in '19. And principally, in summary version, that secular tailwind is that the spot freight markets are just a more liquid, less -- easier to transact end market today than it was two years, three years, five years ago. So you see that the spot market -- market share of the total freight increasing over this time mark, and that's been a benefactor of DAT and its customers, and that's going to continue. As DAT in the market, it will continue period, but then it may accelerate over the next five-plus years as we further tech-enable the broker's business model, right? As it relates to the license -- excuse me, the perpetual license activity in application software, it's solid orders in the first half and in the quarter. I think we're maybe modestly different than like an SAP because our price points are much, much lower, right? I mean our -- something like that. So, we're not -- these are -- we're important and we're sizable for our customers. But these are -- our price points, I mean, a big deal for us is a $1 million, $2 million, $3 million deal, not multiples of that. So Rob, do you want to...\nRob Crisci: Yes. Then on the margins, I would not be concerned that margins would take a step backwards growth were to slow there. I mean, these are businesses that sort of all have those structural EBITDA margins in that 50% plus range. And so, I'd expect that to continue even if growth were to slow a little.\nJulian Mitchell: And then maybe sort of following up more for Rob this line. Just you have an out this big divestment, you've got restated numbers out there. How should we think about any changes from here around or changes in the sort of go-forward run rate for things like tax rate in the P&L? Maybe corporate costs and then kind of free cash flow conversion. Any changes in those three metrics as we look at the sort of new go-forward Roper?\nRob Crisci: Yes. There shouldn't be any meaningful changes in terms of tax rate. I think in terms of conversion, I mean, clearly, there's a lot of noise around cash taxes this yearas we've been talking about, and that's sort of part of the price to pay also when you do these transactions that we think are the best thing to do for the Company in the long term. So I think if you look forward to next year and beyond, I mean, our free cash flow conversion should be at the levels it's been historically and probably a little bit better because we have even more negative working capital. Just better quality portfolio, less cyclicality. And so, I think the cash flow conversion should get a little bit better over time. And corporate, yes, I mean I think the run rate that you see now sort of worth continuing ops is the right run rate moving forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Just a question on the cash. I know you guys don't guide on cash, but usually it gets on kind of an underlying basis, seasonally better in the third and the fourth. Anything changed from that perspective? And any kind of color on how you'd expect it to kind of bounce back here in the third and the fourth from second quarter levels. It's a little bit lumpy in the first and second quarter.\nRob Crisci: Yes, I think that's right. So seasonally, fourth quarter is always our best working capital quarter because that's when you're getting a lot of the renewals in software. So we would expect working capital to be a pretty good guy in the second half. And we sort of talked about the cash tax situation. And I think everything else is performing really well to generate a lot of cash.\nSteve Tusa: And then on the revenue side, when you think about your recurring, is there on the accounting there in 606, do you book a percentage of those deals, the three-year, three-year type of deals? Do you book a percentage of those upfront as per the 606 accounting? I know you have different businesses in there, so maybe they behave differently from an accounting perspective. But is there an element of that in the revenue there?\nJason Conley: Yes. Steve, this is Jason Conley. A lot of the term licenses, there's a portion of that that does get recognized upfront, so multiyear term license is very small for us. Only a couple of businesses have that. And then our perpetual licenses are also booked upfront as part of 606, a portion of it.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Maybe just the first question on this new portfolio going forward, how do I think about like the right long-term organic growth rate for this business over time? I think we've historically kind of thought about your legacy businesses kind of like somewhere in that 4% to 5% type organic growth rate. I'm just wondering if this business is going to achieve healthier growth longer term.\nNeil Hunn: So it's -- when we did the -- announced the transaction with the Industrial and Process businesses, we showed a chart that showed the long-term growth rate -- historical long-term growth rate of the go-forward portfolio is about 6%. So, that's where we would expect at the baseline, and then obviously, we work every day to try to make that better. But right now, that we would sort of say 6% to the new norm.\nJoe Ritchie: And then I guess this whole this whole conversion from on-prem to your SaaS business, it seems like you guys are well on your way there. I'm just curious like how much is that kind of like added to the growth rate in recent years? And then that extra, call it, I don't know if it's an additional 20% to 25% that you are expected to convert, how do we think about that as kind of like an added benefit that you'll continue to see in the coming years?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. It's been, as we said for a while, it's been a modest growth driver. And just to go through it for a minute, there's the good guy and there's a bad guy, right? So the bad guy is if you're in a year where you're selling a perpetual deal, let's say it's a $1 million deal. You booked the vast majority of that revenue in that year. If that deal converts to a subscription or a SaaS deal, maybe that's I mean maybe that's priced at, I don't know, $300,000 a year, plus or minus. So in that end year, there's a $700,000 bad guy between the upfront license versus the SaaS, and that's assuming you booked the SaaS deal on January 1. So there's a little bit of a bad guide when that happens. But what is overwhelmed that for us to a slight net positive is the lifting and shifting of our large installed base of maintenance customers. So as you take the -- in this same example, if you have a cohort of customers paying you $300,000 a year, you're going to lift and ship them into the cloud in the plus or minus $600,000 a year. So you get that and that nets out to be a slight good guide. We've gotten many years of that dynamic. Even if I had to guess, it's 7 to 10 years of that dynamic because we're not forcing our customers to migrate. We're very much in the posture of meeting our customers where they are relative to wanting to do this. And that's why it will take a while to do it.\nRob Crisci: Yes. I'll just add that every business is on a different sort of phase of this journey, right? I mean many businesses have been SaaS in the very beginning, and they're always 100% SaaS. Other businesses were mainly on-prem like an Aderant. That's really the one business we have talked about where really their customers are really starting to move to the cloud. Deltek has been a mix over time. Most of the rest of the businesses are really kind of already SaaS, at least several businesses that we bought the last four or five years.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Real Research.\nJeff Sprague: I guess as we're transitioning to software, I'll just ask an annoying industrial question. Just going back to the deal itself and the structure there are some additional detail on that 8-K, obviously, that wasn't -- certainly wasn't clear to me at the time the deal was announced. And what's still not clear to me is what the back end might look like for you guys on this deal, right? With CD&R paying $829 million for 51% of the equity, and then with new debt on the deal of 1.950 billion I mean it looks like the enterprise value is 3.6 billion an 11x multiple, right? If you guys have taken 2.6 out upfront, it's very unclear how we think about the back end.\nNeil Hunn: So, the way that we would think about it, I'll just -- I'll put it through the lens of our new partner, right? So by the way, the maths went through, we would say it's correct, right? And so, it was that 3.5, 3.6 is the enterprise value upfront, that's 11x this year, 13.5x last year. In terms of EBITDA more like in that 13 range if you look over the last five years, given the cyclicality We, too, so the amount of capital that CD&R put in is basically equal to our amount of capital, still in the business. CD&R's business model is to drive a 3x-plus money-on-money return over their investment horizon. So if we and they are successful, then you get a triple of our stub of equity, right? It's sort of a framing of how to think that. So maybe there's a couple of billion plus or minus of upside in addition to getting the liquidity on the 800 or 900 million that we have there. So call it, $2.5 billion to $3 billion on the back end if underscore and capitalize if things go successful over the next five or so years.\nJeff Sprague: Is that based on the premise that they actively do other things with the business? For example, other M&A in the business, and wouldn't that dilute you or would you participate in kind of incremental investments in the business to get it ready for eventual sale?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So we're totally aligned -- two questions in there, right? So the implied is around the growth thesis of the Company. So we're completely aligned with our partner on the growth thesis. It centers on continuing to invest in the organic growth that we've been doing with these businesses for the last four or so years and then building it at sort of a capital deployment or M&A flywheel or repeat of a flywheel. Without getting into the details of how the Company is going to execute that because it's still very much being formed, but at the highest level, this is a -- one, it's a cash generative asset, right? So the goal for all of us is to run a levered asset and use that leverage in the cash generation as a primary source of funding. So you don't have a dilutive effect. If there is a transaction where CDR is going to kick in equity, then we have the option to consider that. And we'll make that a deal-by-deal sort of decision. We think it's in the best interest of our shareholders. And so, yes, there could be a little bit of dilution, but that dilution is sort of somewhat factored into the math that I gave you before.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird.\nRob Mason: Just first, a technical question around the guidance. So, the core growth guidance for the year is eight to nine. Did that change versus where it would have been on an apples-to-apples basis three months ago?\nRob Crisci: I would say slightly higher, maybe like 0.5% or so. But I mean it's -- I think we are seven to nine in our last guide and the businesses we divested were slightly higher. Those go away, and we've raised eight to nine. So, I think it's a little bit of a net raise, but not by a lot.\nRob Mason: Where would you slot that increase within the segments -- the three segments now?\nRob Crisci: So I'd say the biggest business that has a better outlook is Neptune. They're just doing incredibly well, as we said in the prepared remarks in their second half, given their backlog, given their ability to execute and deliver to their customers. It looks really, really strong. So that's really the one I think that's gotten quite a bit better. Everything else I'd say is about the same as we had it three months ago.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.\nAlex Blanton: Yes, I just wanted to look at this $2.30 per minute. What was that in the first quarter?\nRob Crisci: Yes, it was about $0.50 in the first quarter and what $0.52 in the second quarter.\nAlex Blanton: And then what is your guidance for that for the third quarter?\nRob Crisci: So, we're not guiding it by quarter, right, because it's in disc ops, but it's 230 for the full year. So generally, the fourth quarter is the best quarter for those businesses given the cyclicality and the oil and gas markets.\nAlex Blanton: Yes. Well, the thing was I was trying to work out what the total would have been with that in there for the rest of the year quarter-by-quarter. But I guess I can do it with what you just said. I'd like to talk about the future and the future is acquisitions, of course. How does that look now? What's the pipeline like how far are you along in putting the work to $7 billion? What are you working on? What kinds of things are you working on? Just give us some color on that because I think that really is what is going to give investors confidence.\nNeil Hunn: I appreciate the question and the opportunity to address it. So it's been a very above-average level of activity really for this year. Obviously, we've not posted anything of size, just a couple of small tuck-ins. We're being -- while we have $7 billion, we're continued to be just ridiculously selective as we've always been. We run this sort of -- we have our criteria. We stay committed to the criteria. There's a lot of analytics, there's a tremendous amount of discipline and a ton of patients. And the reason we have that posture is we're making decisions to put companies in the portfolio, which we view as a forever staying. And so every deal matters, everyone's got to be right and everyone has got to meet the criteria. And so -- but we're super busy, and we'll continue to sort of keep this posture and to grow the quality and the scale of the enterprise. But we -- there's no timetable on that. We're just going to we're going to do the right deal at the time in which it presents itself.\nAlex Blanton: But do you think that you'll be able to do some this year?\nNeil Hunn: We would like to be -- we would like to do it. But again, there's no timetable. There's no clock ticking in the back of mine or this team, or our Board's head about we have to get X dollars deployed by X date. So I think that leads to bad decision making, but it's an active market. So, the odds are we'll get something done this year, but we'll just have to see how...\nRob Crisci: Yes, yes, just we're very active working on a lot of different projects like we always are. So, we're certainly very active.\nAlex Blanton: And just characterize the pipeline of how many businesses are available compared with the past. And what are the prices like compared with the past and so on.\nNeil Hunn: Yes, so I mentioned it's -- we never want to quantify the number of deals either by number or dollar size in a pipeline. We think it's -- for us is it sufficient or not. And so it's clearly sufficient. I said at the beginning of your question, it's been an above-average level of activity for this year. Valuations, hey, it's, high-quality assets are still highly priced. I mean that's a bit of the reason why we're being patient. And we'll just -- we believe that market comes to us over time, and so we remain patient for the right company with the right characteristics at the right price.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for dialing in, and you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This morning, we'll start by reviewing our second quarter highlights and financial results then we'll review our segment detail and our increase out for the year then get to your questions. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are first, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance, and we're increasing our outlook for the year; second, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to divest the majority stake of our industrial businesses; and third, we have north of 7 billion of available M&A firepower. Looking at the second quarter, we continue to be pleased with the quality of execution across our enterprise. This quarter is characterized by having very strong order activity and solid organic growth of 11%. Of particular importance, our growth was quite broad-based across our three segments. Consistent with our commentary during the last several quarters, not only did we grow nicely within the quarter, but the quality of the underlying businesses also improved as we saw our software recurring revenue base grow 12% on an organic basis. In addition to our strong software growth, our product businesses performed very well in the quarter, experiencing very high levels of demand and record levels of backlog. Once we complete the divestiture of the majority interest of our industrial businesses, the quality of our portfolio will be significantly improved across several dimensions. First, we will be meaningfully less cyclical with about 75% of our portfolio being software and the balance being medical and water products. Second, we'll have higher levels of recurring revenue with 80% of our software revenue being recurring in nature. Also, a large percentage of our product revenue is reoccurring in nature, such as Neptune's replacement demand and our medical product consumables. And third, we'll be even more asset-light given a vastly improved working capital profile one that generates significant increasing amount of cash as we continue to grow. And finally, with the closing of our industrial divestiture, which we anticipate will occur later this year, we'll have north of $7 billion of M&A capacity. We are very active in the M&A markets, but also remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. We are confident in our ability to deploy this capital wisely, which in turn will further improve both the quality and scale of our enterprise. We are proud of our operating team for their execution, a very solid quarter. Now let me turn the call to Rob, who will walk through our financial summary. Rob? Thanks, Rob. Congrats to you and your team for upsizing and extending our revolver, especially in these market conditions. As we turn to Page 9, we summarize for you our go-forward portfolio of 26 businesses arrayed across three segments: application software, network software and tech-enabled products. In the 8-K issued a few weeks ago, we provided historical annual and quarterly financial disclosures on this segmented basis. Also for the first time, we're breaking down our revenues by type. As you see, 61% of our total revenue and 82% of our software revenues are recurring or reoccurring in nature. 74% of our total revenues are software related. For several quarters, we've communicated how the quality of our revenue stream continues to improve. You can see this point well illustrated here. Our 11% organic growth is underpinned by a 12% growth in our software recurring revenue base. Further, you can see the breadth of the growth, growth in software and products. Our strategy for nearly two decades now has been to improve the quality of our enterprise, and this is clearly reflected on this page. We cannot be more excited for our future. Let's turn to Page 10 and walk through the 2Q highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $627 million, up 7% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 43.1%. Across this segment, we saw recurring revenue which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment increased 8% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was quite broad. As we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Deltek. The Deltek team posted another great quarter of strength across all end market serves with particular strength in their construction contractor end market. In addition, Deltek continues to gain momentum, driving adoption to their cloud-based product offerings. Vertafore had an excellent quarter, which was highlighted by strong ARR bookings activity and revenue growth. Also during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of MGA Systems. This tuck-in acquisition enhances Vertafore's ability to compete and win in the managed general agent segment of the property and casualty insurance ecosystem. CliniSys and Data Innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. CliniSys continued its market share gains in the U.K.; DI continues to demonstrate product market fit by gaining share of wallet across large health systems and the VA. Strata continues to be super solid for us. The acquisition of EPSI has been exceedingly strong as Strata has successfully lifted and shifted many EPSI customers to the Strata cloud-based offering. At the same time, Stratic continues to improve the legacy EPSI product release and support capability. We remain committed to meeting the EPSI and Strata customers where they are. Finally, Aderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, extending their share gains in the large loss space. Aderant continues to see an acceleration of SaaS booking activity driving substantial increases in the recurring revenue base. Looking to the outlook for the second half of 2022 in this segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit growth for the balance of the year, driven by continued ARR momentum. Turning to Page 11, revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $343 million, up 15% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 52%. The 15% organic growth in this segment is underpinned by 19% growth in recurring revenue. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continued to be exceptional. The market conditions while slowing a touch on the carrier side of the network continue to be favorable. During the recent surge in transportation volumes, the market share of the ecosystem represented by the spot market increased as it became easier to transact volumes in the spot market compared to the contracted market. We believe this is a secular trend that DAT will benefit from over a multiyear arc. In addition, DAT continues to do a nice job of increasing revenue per user by both adding features and improving value capture. Finally, over a longer arc planning horizon, our freight matching businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the further digitization of the spot freight market. Moving to foundry, our software business that enables live-action filming and computer-generated graphics to be combined in a single frame continued their recent financial strength. Net retention is north of 110% and ARR grew double digits again. Foundry success is rooted in their fast-paced innovation capability and favorable long-term market conditions. ITrade our network food supply chain business and our pipeline, our life insurance SaaS business that tech enables the quoting and underwriting processes, each had solid customer additions, which helped drive strong era growth in the quarter. Finally, our businesses, which focus on alternate site health care, namely skilled nursing, assisted living and home health grew nicely in the quarter despite their customers' growth being constrained by staffing shortages. Proud of the execution here. Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment, driven by continued recurring revenue momentum and moderating growth for our freight match businesses. As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our tech-enabled products segment were $340 million, up 13% on an organic basis despite the very challenging supply chain environment. EBITDA margins for this segment were 34.9% in the quarter. Let's start with Neptune, which had record orders, revenue and quarter ending backlog. For a few quarters running, Neptune has been able to gain market share by being successful in keeping product lead times at industry-leading terms and releasing new products, both in terms of cellular connectivity and static meter reading technology. As a fun fact, Neptune turns 50 later this quarter and next year will mark our 20-year ownership anniversary, a great run so far with an even better forward view. Congrats Hunn to you and your team for building such a great company. Verathon, Northern Digital and each of our medical product franchises continue to see very strong ordering activity but were hampered by a variety of supply chain challenges during the quarter. That said, the teams are executing exceptionally well, and we remain confident in our ability to execute through these challenges. Looking over the horizon, each of our medical product businesses are benefactors of secular tailwinds, namely the increased demand for single-use devices and the aging of the population. As it relates to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single-digit growth for this segment, underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain challenges. Now please turn to Page 14, and let's review our updated and increased outlook for the balance of the year. As a reminder, last quarter, we increased our adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $15.50 and $15.75, which included $2.30 from our industrial businesses. Given our agreement to divest our industrial businesses, we are removing the $2.30 million from our guidance model going forward. So on a new curtailing ops basis, our previous guidance equates to $13.20 to $13.45. Based on our strong Q2 and second half visibility, we're now increasing our continuing ops guidance to be between 13 46 and 13 62. Embedded in this guidance is full year organic growth of 8% to 9%, again, on a continuing ops basis. As we look to the third quarter, we're establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.42 and 3.46. Now our concluding comments and we'll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 15, we want to leave you with the same three points with which we started. First, we had a strong quarter of performance, and we're increasing the outlook for the full year. Second, we took strategic actions to invest a majority stake in our industrial businesses. And third, we have a tremendous amount of M&A firepower north of $7 billion. As it relates to our strong start, we grew revenues organically 11%, EBITDA 10% and DEPS 16%, and free cash flow has grown 17% on a three-year compounded basis. We are lifting our full year organic growth in DEPS guidance based on the factors outlined during the call, specifically strong recurring revenue growth and a record demand for our product businesses. Finally, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have a highly active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We have north of $7 billion of M&A available firepower. As mentioned at the start of today's call, our high levels of activity are equally matched with our patience and discipline, and we remain confident in our ability to deploy this capital to further improve the quality and scale of our enterprise, just as we've done over the past two decades. Finally, kudos to Rob and Shannon and the finance team for increasing the size and term of our $3.5 billion revolver. As we turn to your questions, let us remind everyone that our strategy is the same: We compound cash flow by acquiring and growing niche market-leading technology businesses. This is what we've done for over 20 years and will continue to do so. In addition, our value creation and governance model remains unchanged. We operate a portfolio of market-leading businesses and defensible niches. Each of our businesses has high levels of recurring revenue, strong margins and compete based on customer intimacy, which yields highly resilient organic growth rates. We operate a highly decentralized operational structure that focuses on long-term business building. Our culture sets a very high bar for performance and focuses on continually improving. We are all paid to grow, which reinforces our culture of transparency, nimbleness and humility. Finally, we redeployed the vast majority of our capital to acquire the next great business. We do this with a centralized corporate resource team in a highly disciplined, thoughtful and analytical manner. This strategy, unchanged, delivers compounded and superior long-term shareholder value. So thanks for joining us this morning. And with that, let's open it up to your questions. No, thank you. Yes, Deane. So really, the -- in the recurring line, that 54% line on Page 9, embedded in that line is both the on-premise maintenance and the SaaS. And so the migration will happen inside of that line. Now what we'll see is, it'll -- as that happens, we get an uplift from the on-prem maintenance to the SaaS because you're delivering more value -- and so you'll see sort of a long-term multi-multiyear tailwind in that line, but it happens and the conversion happens within that singular line. Yes. So there's -- and price -- if you're -- obviously, you're specifically talking about software. I mean, there's the way you sort of capture price and value capture and software is a little bit different than the product. So in the software, you're right, for the all that subscription and maintenance is generally tied to a CPI plus a touch -- which is -- so we were able to see price. The other thing that's just also just naturally embedded in the software business is price. I mean, it's a part of the growth algorithm in each and every year. The customers are used to taking price. And obviously, with inflation, interest rates higher, then there'll be a little bit more price. The offset to that is the cost structure in the software businesses increase through increasing labor wages, but it happens over a longer arc of time, and it's less spiky than what you see in the product businesses. So naturally, as the pipeline of that is you get a nice matchup of the increase of labor cost with the pricing on the software part of our business. No, so apologies if I was confusing. So there's two issues we're talking about. So on price, on software; if you're a well-run software company, you're taking price on both the cost of the software in a perpetual world and the maintenance on that. So you move them up in tandem, where you don't end up in sort of a challenging thing that some software companies do that ends up being a bad thing is they only take price up on the maintenance and not the initial software. Our companies take them up in tandem, so they stay together. So that's the pricing point. Dean's point was asking about what's the relationship between on-premise maintenance, which we get paid once we deliver the perpetual software and SaaS and the SaaS shift. And so as we migrate or lift and shift a customer from on-premise to our cloud, as you're doing that, you're delivering more value, not only hosting the application and all the security, you're also delivering the most recent versions or keeping them on the most recent version so they take advantage of the most recent features and you're just generally eliminating sort of the headaches of running the software for the client. Because of that value bundle of SaaS, you are able to capture more value, oftentimes, 2x on a recurring basis or a touch more. So it's -- that's about the value proposition of moving to the cloud versus your straight question of what happens in a price increase environment for the software. Yes. I would say the GICS code change, it's not like this light switch that's happened or all of a sudden, every conversation we're having with the buy-side is a different person. In fact, it's quite the opposite. I mean, it's a slow evolutionary sort of change here. We've been to a singular software conference where we had half a dozen conversations. They were generally the same conversation we have with our legacy shareholder base, which is what's your business model, what's your flywheel and what are the risks, what's the durability and quite similar. A little bit -- a little discussion, obviously, on growth a little bit on the cash flow dynamics of the business, a little bit of the business model mix between recurring, non-recurring, but they're the same questions really. It's not material enough to worry about, but let me tell you why. I mean, -- the -- for essentially my entire almost 11 years I've been here, we've looked at the same cohort of targets, which are wonderful asset-light software businesses. And that's the cohort we're looking at now, right? So, it's just -- it's not about becoming even more asset-light once yours asset lines we are. It's about staying as asset light as we are. That's why the universe of targets is plentiful. No, it's definitely not off the table. It has not been off the table. We just haven't actioned anything there in quite a while. So if it's an asset-light tech-enabled product than business that is a leader in a small market, the competitive forces are stable, sort of all of our criteria, then it's definitely something we would look at. So let me take the DAT One and the application software license one, and I'll let Rob talk about the margins if that's okay in NSS. So on DAT, DAT grew through the 2019 freight recession. But it has been just spectacular the last couple of years at DAT for two reasons. There's certainly a cyclical tailwind it's had, there's also a secular tailwind that it's enjoyed. The secular tailwind endures. That's why the business is able to sort of grow through in '19. And principally, in summary version, that secular tailwind is that the spot freight markets are just a more liquid, less -- easier to transact end market today than it was two years, three years, five years ago. So you see that the spot market -- market share of the total freight increasing over this time mark, and that's been a benefactor of DAT and its customers, and that's going to continue. As DAT in the market, it will continue period, but then it may accelerate over the next five-plus years as we further tech-enable the broker's business model, right? As it relates to the license -- excuse me, the perpetual license activity in application software, it's solid orders in the first half and in the quarter. I think we're maybe modestly different than like an SAP because our price points are much, much lower, right? I mean our -- something like that. So, we're not -- these are -- we're important and we're sizable for our customers. But these are -- our price points, I mean, a big deal for us is a $1 million, $2 million, $3 million deal, not multiples of that. So Rob, do you want to... So it's -- when we did the -- announced the transaction with the Industrial and Process businesses, we showed a chart that showed the long-term growth rate -- historical long-term growth rate of the go-forward portfolio is about 6%. So, that's where we would expect at the baseline, and then obviously, we work every day to try to make that better. But right now, that we would sort of say 6% to the new norm. Yes. It's been, as we said for a while, it's been a modest growth driver. And just to go through it for a minute, there's the good guy and there's a bad guy, right? So the bad guy is if you're in a year where you're selling a perpetual deal, let's say it's a $1 million deal. You booked the vast majority of that revenue in that year. If that deal converts to a subscription or a SaaS deal, maybe that's I mean maybe that's priced at, I don't know, $300,000 a year, plus or minus. So in that end year, there's a $700,000 bad guy between the upfront license versus the SaaS, and that's assuming you booked the SaaS deal on January 1. So there's a little bit of a bad guide when that happens. But what is overwhelmed that for us to a slight net positive is the lifting and shifting of our large installed base of maintenance customers. So as you take the -- in this same example, if you have a cohort of customers paying you $300,000 a year, you're going to lift and ship them into the cloud in the plus or minus $600,000 a year. So you get that and that nets out to be a slight good guide. We've gotten many years of that dynamic. Even if I had to guess, it's 7 to 10 years of that dynamic because we're not forcing our customers to migrate. We're very much in the posture of meeting our customers where they are relative to wanting to do this. And that's why it will take a while to do it. So, the way that we would think about it, I'll just -- I'll put it through the lens of our new partner, right? So by the way, the maths went through, we would say it's correct, right? And so, it was that 3.5, 3.6 is the enterprise value upfront, that's 11x this year, 13.5x last year. In terms of EBITDA more like in that 13 range if you look over the last five years, given the cyclicality We, too, so the amount of capital that CD&R put in is basically equal to our amount of capital, still in the business. CD&R's business model is to drive a 3x-plus money-on-money return over their investment horizon. So if we and they are successful, then you get a triple of our stub of equity, right? It's sort of a framing of how to think that. So maybe there's a couple of billion plus or minus of upside in addition to getting the liquidity on the 800 or 900 million that we have there. So call it, $2.5 billion to $3 billion on the back end if underscore and capitalize if things go successful over the next five or so years. Yes. So we're totally aligned -- two questions in there, right? So the implied is around the growth thesis of the Company. So we're completely aligned with our partner on the growth thesis. It centers on continuing to invest in the organic growth that we've been doing with these businesses for the last four or so years and then building it at sort of a capital deployment or M&A flywheel or repeat of a flywheel. Without getting into the details of how the Company is going to execute that because it's still very much being formed, but at the highest level, this is a -- one, it's a cash generative asset, right? So the goal for all of us is to run a levered asset and use that leverage in the cash generation as a primary source of funding. So you don't have a dilutive effect. If there is a transaction where CDR is going to kick in equity, then we have the option to consider that. And we'll make that a deal-by-deal sort of decision. We think it's in the best interest of our shareholders. And so, yes, there could be a little bit of dilution, but that dilution is sort of somewhat factored into the math that I gave you before. I appreciate the question and the opportunity to address it. So it's been a very above-average level of activity really for this year. Obviously, we've not posted anything of size, just a couple of small tuck-ins. We're being -- while we have $7 billion, we're continued to be just ridiculously selective as we've always been. We run this sort of -- we have our criteria. We stay committed to the criteria. There's a lot of analytics, there's a tremendous amount of discipline and a ton of patients. And the reason we have that posture is we're making decisions to put companies in the portfolio, which we view as a forever staying. And so every deal matters, everyone's got to be right and everyone has got to meet the criteria. And so -- but we're super busy, and we'll continue to sort of keep this posture and to grow the quality and the scale of the enterprise. But we -- there's no timetable on that. We're just going to we're going to do the right deal at the time in which it presents itself. We would like to be -- we would like to do it. But again, there's no timetable. There's no clock ticking in the back of mine or this team, or our Board's head about we have to get X dollars deployed by X date. So I think that leads to bad decision making, but it's an active market. So, the odds are we'll get something done this year, but we'll just have to see how... Yes, so I mentioned it's -- we never want to quantify the number of deals either by number or dollar size in a pipeline. We think it's -- for us is it sufficient or not. And so it's clearly sufficient. I said at the beginning of your question, it's been an above-average level of activity for this year. Valuations, hey, it's, high-quality assets are still highly priced. I mean that's a bit of the reason why we're being patient. And we'll just -- we believe that market comes to us over time, and so we remain patient for the right company with the right characteristics at the right price."

            "name": "Rob Crisci",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 6, here, we want to briefly cover our Q2 performance compared to our guidance, including the industrial businesses now reported as part of discontinued operations due to the pending sale. On that apples-to-apples basis, our Q2 of $3.95 compares quite favorably to our guidance of $3.80 to $3.84, an $0.11 beat at the high end of our guidance, a very strong quarter. Next slide. Turning to Page 7 and covering the Q2 financial highlights. Here, we will review some of the key financial metrics on a continuing operations basis which is our reporting basis for earnings and guidance moving forward. Total revenue increased 10% to $1.31 billion. Organic revenue increased 11% with strength across each of our three reporting segments. Application Software grew 7% organically as our two largest businesses, Deltek and Vertafore continue to perform very well. Network software grew 15% led by continued exceptional performance at our freight matching businesses. Finally, our new technology-enabled products segment grew 13% organically, aided by an excellent quarter from Neptune. EBITDA margin was 39.3%, resulting in EBITDA increasing 10% to $515 million. DEPS on a continuing ops basis was 3.43%, 16% higher than last year. Net working capital is now negative 17% of Q2 annualized revenue as a result of our higher quality portfolio. Q2 adjusted free cash flow was $252 million, which was 19% below prior year, but still represent a 17% three-year CAGR versus 2019. Notably, like many technology companies, our cash flow was negatively impacted by the Section 174 R&D capitalization change that took effect for 2022. We paid $49 million in Q2 related to Section 174, and we expect to pay an additional $50 million for Section 174 in the second half. Importantly, this tax law change only impacts the timing of when the taxes are due, and not the overall amount of tax owed or our tax rate. Additionally, in the quarter, we made tax payments related to the gains on the 2021 divestitures of TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy. Per our normal convention, those payments have been adjusted out of our cash flow. Finally, we are very pleased to announce the completion of our new five-year $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. We are grateful for our bank group and their continued support, and I personally like to thank Shannon O'Callaghan next to me for the excellent work in leading the process for Roper. So in summary, with a $3 billion cash balance, our new revolver in place, and the future proceeds from the closing of our industrial sale later this year, we are very well positioned for meaningful capital deployment. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil. Yes, yes. So on working capital, yes, I mean, the 17% is the run rate. I think there is upside, right? We expect to grow these software businesses as they continue to grow, they'll generate more cash and work capital should get more negative over time. Yes, on 174, it is -- it will be a total $100 million headwind for this year. So, it's basically around $25 million a quarter we paid. As you know, we make two tax payments in the second quarter, that's why it was 49% in the quarter. Yes. So, obviously, there's been a lot said about this. The law could change at some point, and then we'd get that money back. So, it's really just -- you look at the same deductions over time, but certainly, now you have to wait for the deductions basically. Yes. So the performance was very good. So we're certainly, like everyone else who sells products, have some supply chain issues. I mean backlog is I think, double if you look where we are this year versus the same time last year. So there's plenty of opportunity to continue to grow the revenue. A little bit of margin impact. We think that gets a little bit better in the second half. I think our business has done a great job of pushing through price. And so that takes some time to start to sell the products at a higher price versus the cost, so I think that's a little bit better over time. But everyone is managing it really, really well. So, we feel really good about our operations. Yes, so 2020 was an outlier because of the big Verathon quarter with the -- in the heart of COVID. So that's when Verathon had that just extremely strong growth as we're trying to fight the virus. And so, I think probably '19 is a little bit more normalized from a margin standpoint, but we do think that those margins should tick up over time. And just to give you a sense, we're roughly 75% subscription and 25% in maintenance today. So we're still -- we're already largely in the cloud. There's roughly $200 million of license revenue that would go away over time and convert to that subscription revenue that Neil mentioned. But as you know with us, that's a long period of time, driven by the customers. And so it's a really good story, I think, on the recurring revenue line. I was just saying a lot of excitement, right? Because I think as we said at that conference, we were at intra-quarter that we're the fourth largest application software company, I think, in the S&P 500. And a lot of these analysts are just getting to know us, and I think they're really excited when they look at our past and our future prospects. So we're excited to expand to a new shareholder race while, of course, also making sure that our current shareholder base is continually happy with their investment in Roper. Yes, most of the businesses in that segment are normally sort of mid-single-digit organic businesses that occasionally do higher than that, very rarely do lower than that. And so, I think as you get into the second half of the year, those are sort of doing what they do, and then you just have a little bit of moderation in the freight matching growth. Yes. Then on the margins, I would not be concerned that margins would take a step backwards growth were to slow there. I mean, these are businesses that sort of all have those structural EBITDA margins in that 50% plus range. And so, I'd expect that to continue even if growth were to slow a little. Yes. There shouldn't be any meaningful changes in terms of tax rate. I think in terms of conversion, I mean, clearly, there's a lot of noise around cash taxes this yearas we've been talking about, and that's sort of part of the price to pay also when you do these transactions that we think are the best thing to do for the Company in the long term. So I think if you look forward to next year and beyond, I mean, our free cash flow conversion should be at the levels it's been historically and probably a little bit better because we have even more negative working capital. Just better quality portfolio, less cyclicality. And so, I think the cash flow conversion should get a little bit better over time. And corporate, yes, I mean I think the run rate that you see now sort of worth continuing ops is the right run rate moving forward. Yes, I think that's right. So seasonally, fourth quarter is always our best working capital quarter because that's when you're getting a lot of the renewals in software. So we would expect working capital to be a pretty good guy in the second half. And we sort of talked about the cash tax situation. And I think everything else is performing really well to generate a lot of cash. Yes. I'll just add that every business is on a different sort of phase of this journey, right? I mean many businesses have been SaaS in the very beginning, and they're always 100% SaaS. Other businesses were mainly on-prem like an Aderant. That's really the one business we have talked about where really their customers are really starting to move to the cloud. Deltek has been a mix over time. Most of the rest of the businesses are really kind of already SaaS, at least several businesses that we bought the last four or five years. I would say slightly higher, maybe like 0.5% or so. But I mean it's -- I think we are seven to nine in our last guide and the businesses we divested were slightly higher. Those go away, and we've raised eight to nine. So, I think it's a little bit of a net raise, but not by a lot. So I'd say the biggest business that has a better outlook is Neptune. They're just doing incredibly well, as we said in the prepared remarks in their second half, given their backlog, given their ability to execute and deliver to their customers. It looks really, really strong. So that's really the one I think that's gotten quite a bit better. Everything else I'd say is about the same as we had it three months ago. Yes, it was about $0.50 in the first quarter and what $0.52 in the second quarter. So, we're not guiding it by quarter, right, because it's in disc ops, but it's 230 for the full year. So generally, the fourth quarter is the best quarter for those businesses given the cyclicality and the oil and gas markets. Yes, yes, just we're very active working on a lot of different projects like we always are. So, we're certainly very active."

As usual, we will start with our quarterly highlights followed by a segment by segment overview, then go through our increased outlook for guidance expectations and leave plenty of time to address your questions. Next slide please. As we turn to page 5, the main takeaways from today\u2019s call are first, we continue to increase the quality, predictability and durability of the underlying business models and revenue streams. Second, we continue to deliver strong organic growth and operating results enabling us to increase our organic growth outlook and desk guidance through the year. And third, we have substantial M&A capacity given our rapid de-leveraging and completion of our TransCore divestiture. As it relates to the first quarter, we are delighted to report another strong quarter of execution and positive momentum across the portfolio. Specifically, we grew revenue on an organic basis 11% in the quarter. This growth was broad based across each of our four segments. Not only did we grow nicely in the quarter, but the quality of the underlying business also improved as we saw double-digit organic increases and a recurring revenue base. In addition to our strong software growth, our product businesses performed quite nicely in the quarter as well experiencing very high levels of demand and record levels of backlog. Also during the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our project based TransCore business. As you will know we now have $3.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. When combined with our borrowing capacity we have over $5 billion of available capital deployment fire power which when deployed will further help drive cash flow and shareholder value compounding. So with this, definitely a solid start to the year. Now, let me turn the call to Rob, who will walk through our financial summary. Rob?\nRob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to page 6 and covering some of the Q1 financial highlights. Total revenue increased 11% to $1.53 billion. As Neil mentioned, organic revenue also increased 11% with broad base strength across our four reporting segments. Application software grew 9% organically, network software grew 16%, our MAS segment grew 7% and finally, our smallest segment Process Technologies was up 18%. EBITDA margin was 37.8% for the quarter, resulting in EBITDA increasing 8% to $577 million. Notably, that $577 million of Q1 EBITDA on a continuing operations basis is actually higher than the Q1 EBITDA we reported last April when we still owned and of course consolidated TransCore and the other two divested businesses. Adjusted DEPS for the quarter was $3.77, which was well above our guidance range of $3.63 to $3.67. Free cash flow was $459 million with solid EBITDA cash conversion of 80%. That's above the Q1 conversion levels we experienced in 2019 and 2020, but below last year is exceptionally strong Q1 conversion of 96%. To that end, there are two discrete cash items that combined to create an $80 million Q1 headwind versus prior year. As discussed on last April's call, last year's Q1 included $40 million of accelerated payments to CliniSys. Furthermore, this year\u2019s Q1 reflects a $40 million increase in incentive compensation as a result of our strong 2021 performance compared to the pandemic year of 2020. So stepping back, we are of course focused on long term compounding here at Roper. In the three blue bars at the bottom of our page, you can see our three year compounding from Q1 2019 for revenue EBITDA, and free cash flow was 10%, 13% and 17%, respectively. So in summary, an excellent start to the year. Next slide, turning to page 7, which is an update on our financial position. Turning to the balance sheet, as Neil mentioned, we have a very large cash balance, which is the result of closing the transport divestiture during the quarter and receiving the gross proceeds. We have yet to pay the approximately $650 million of taxes related to the divestitures, which will be paid during the final three quarters of 2022. As of March 31, as Neil mentioned, our cash balance stood at $3.2 billion, which brings our net debt down to $4.2 billion, or approximately 1.9 times our TTM EBITDA from continuing ops. So with our healthy combination of balance sheet cash, continued strong free cash flow generation, and our investment grade leverage capacity, we are very well positioned to deploy $5 billion or more of capital. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to cover our segments in greater detail.\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to page 9 and walk through the Q1 highlights for application software segment. Revenues here were $632 million up 9% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 44.1%. Across this segment, we saw recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for the segment increased 10% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, cross selling activity, and new customer ads. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was quite broad. As we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Vertafore. Vertafore had an excellent quarter, which was highlighted by strong air our bookings activity and revenue growth. In addition, during the quarter Vertafore released its new commercial submissions product line. To remind everyone Vertafore strategy is to help tech enable the workflows for their P&C agent customers. This new product is a meaningful step in this direction, as it allows agents to quote multiple carriers in it\u2019s simple automated workflow. Great stuff from the Vert 14. Turning to Deltek, they posted another great quarter with strength across all end markets served. Deltek continues to gain momentum driving adoption to their cloud-based product offerings. Deltek also continues to be benefited by having favorable, secular tailwinds. CliniSys and data innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. Specifically CliniSys continued its market share gains in the U.K. As reminder, CliniSys is one of four strategic IT vendors to the National Health Service. DI was awesome in the quarter with continued strength driven by their direct go-to-market approach and large wins within the VA system. Aderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, extending their share gains and the large law space. Also in the quarter, licensing activity tied to seat expansions was very strong. They also continue to see meaningful shift towards our cloud offerings driving substantial increases to the recurring revenue base. Strata whose cloud-based software helps hospitals plan budget and manage their operations continues to execute their cross selling strategy with TTM net retention north of 110%. Of note, we're in the midst of an orderly leader transition at Strata. Dan Michelson, who has led Strata for the last 10 years is retiring. As an element of Roper\u2019s talent offense, Strata has been developing its next CEO, John Martinez for the past several years. As part of John's development, he started in the CFO function, then led commercial and go-to-market functions, and then became the Company COO. Strata\u2019s future is secure given the successful succession planning. Big thanks to Dan for all your leadership and accomplishments at Strata. John, we are super confident with you at the helm. Your new role is well earned, congrats. Finally, PowerPlan posted a strong double digit growth quarter driven by recurring revenue ads and higher services utilization. They also have a substantial new product roadmap slated for this year, which we're looking forward to discussing on subsequent calls. Looking to the outlook for 2022 on the segment, we expect to see mid-single digit growth for the balance of the year, driven by continued strong ARR momentum. With that, let's turn to the next slide. Turning to page 10. As a reminder, the financial performance for this segment, as well as the next two MAS and PT are shown on a continuing ops basis. Revenue in the first quarter for a network segment was $369 million up 16% on organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong 51.2%. The 16% organic growth is underpinned by 16% growth in recurring revenue, which is roughly 80% of the segment's revenue base. As we dig into business specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continue to be super strong during the quarter, the market conditions continue to be quite favorable, which led to record levels of Network ads again, especially on the carrier side of the network. In addition, DAT continues to do a nice job of increasing revenue per user by both adding features and improving value capture. Over a longer arc of time, our freight matching businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the digitization of the spot freight markets. Moving the foundry, our software business that enables the combination of Live Action Filming and computer generated graphics to being applied into a single frame had record bookings revenue and EBITDA for the first quarter. Net retention is north of 110% and ARR grew double digits. Foundry success is rooted in their fast paced innovation capability and favorable long term market conditions. iTrade, our network food supply chain business and iPipeline our life insurance SaaS business helping to tech enable the quoting and underwriting processes each had strong customer additions, which helped drive strong ARR growth in the quarter. Finally, RFIDs had record orders with growth coming from secure print and identity management applications. Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single digit organic growth for this segment, driven by a combination of strong recurring revenue momentum and favorable market tailwinds. Kindly turn to the next slide. As we turn to page 11, revenues and our MAF segment were $392 million up 7% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 31.5% for the quarter. Again, these results are in a continuing off spaces. Before getting into business specific details across this segment, demand continues to be very strong and product backlogs continue to be at record levels. Also, each of these businesses are navigating the current supply chain complexities. While margins were in line with their expectations, they were negatively impacted versus prior year, and are impacted by the availability and pricing of raw material components as well as expediting freight costs. As our businesses increase, price actions take hold throughout the year, margins should improve as we get into the second half. As it relates to our business specific commentary, we'll start with Neptune, which had record orders, revenue and quarter ending backlog. Neptune has been able to gain market share by being successful and keeping product lead times at industry leading terms and releasing new products, both in terms of cellular connectivity, and static meter reading technology. Verathon, Northern Digital and each of our medical product franchises remained super solid. Verathon continues to see strong demand and market share gains in their single use Bronchoscope category, and NDI sees the same in both our optical and electromechanical measurement capabilities. These businesses are beneficiaries of long term and favorable market tailwinds. As it relates to our industrial businesses, demand throughout the quarter was quite strong given the improvement end market and capital spending conditions. As it relates to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single digit growth for this segment underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain environment. Net net, we expect a very strong balance of the year for this group, for the balance of the year for this group. Now let's turn to our final segment Process Tech. As you turn to page 12, revenue on our Process Tech segment were $134 million in Q1 up 18% on an organic basis, EBITDA margins were 32.5% in the quarter. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The story here is we continue to see improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment, and very strong demand. Cornell continues to perform well for us delivering record orders and backlog in the quarter. The strength is partially based on market conditions but also based on Cornell's product innovation, as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected pumping solutions and the share gains they're joining as a result of their niche focused go-to-market teams. Also, our upstream oil and gas businesses saw strength in the quarter. Similar to that of our MAS product businesses, these businesses are also being impacted by supply chain challenges but continue to navigate well into the issues. As we return to the outlook for the balance of 2022, we expect high teens organic growth based on strong levels of backlog and solid market conditions. Now please turn to page 14. And we'll talk through our 2022 increased guidance outlook. Based on a solid start to Q1, strong growth in our software, recurring revenue base and record levels of product demand and backlog we are increasing our full year 2022 DEPS guidance to be in the range of $15.50 and $15.75 up from our original guidance of $15.25 and $15.55. Underpinning this DEPS guidance is our increased organic revenue growth expectation of 7% to 9% for the year. We expect the steady tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. As we look to the second quarter we\u2019re establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.80 and $3.84 again on a continuing ops basis. Now our concluding comments and we'll get to your question. As we turn to page 15 in our closing remarks, we want to leave you with the same three points we started with; one, as we grow, we are increasing the quality of the underlying business and business model. Two, we had a strong start to the year and three we have substantial M&A capacity available to us. As relates to our strong start, we grew revenues organically 11% and EBITDA 8%. More so we have grown our cashflow 17% on a three year compounded basis. We are lifting our full year organic growth and DEPS guidance based on the factors outlined during this call. Specifically strong recurring revenue growth, record demand for product businesses and generally favorable market conditions  Finally, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have an active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We have north of 5 billion of available M&A firepower. So as we turn to your questions, we would like to highlight that our inaugural ESG report was published to our website earlier today. This report outlines our commitment to ESG and our sustainability principles. And with that, let's open it to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nChristopher Glynn: Yes, I was curious about the double digit recurring software revenue in aggregate. I forget what the comparison was. But I don't think it was particularly light. So just curious about, were you surprised by that metric in the quarter, and any implications on how the overall execution and strategic throughput is flowing?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, thanks for the question. As we look back over the recurring revenue, overall growth over the last five quarters, I think, four or the five have been in the double -- low double digits. And so we were not surprised by it. But it certainly encouraged by strength, also encouraged by the breadth of the converse of the strength that wasn't isolated in one or two businesses really quite broad based against everything. And, and we also just as a Q1 there was a lighter comp from a year ago.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay, thanks. And for my follow up, just curious, as you look at the pipeline, curious, if any comments on the mix of platform deals, versus bolt on variety if they're both well represented?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, they're certainly both well represented. If you go back over, I think the last 15 years, something like 90% of the capital deployed at Ropers, done on platform deals intent on bolt-ons. It's not a budget; it's just a historical reference to platform versus bolt-on\u2019s. If we were guessing it might feel a little bit more towards bolt-on\u2019s in the next 10 years, because we have more things to bolt things into. But the preponderance of the capital deployment will be on platform deals and the pipeline is, is well weighted across both of those.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning Dean\nDeane Dray: Hey, can you start with process technologies, this is where if we were going to see big pressures on the industrial side, supply chain really didn't see that it came through, especially on an organic revenue growth, but just can you give us any specifics regarding the supply chain challenges? And where is there a big ramp? Are you seeing it yet in CapEx that would greater focus on increasing U.S. shale?\nRob Crisci: Yes. Hey, Dean, it's Rob. Yes, so we're still seeing, of course the impact, like everyone else of supply chain. I mean, you can see it in our MAS segment, probably more so than in process. But the businesses have done a really, really good job of working through it. And so, that allows us to have, great organic growth, and then, the, the margins, which were downloaded in MAS on supply chain should incrementally improve moving forward. So, I think overall, the businesses are doing a great job of handling what everyone else is, is also having to deal with.\nNeil Hunn: Dean, this is Neil. The only thing I'd add to that we said it a number of times in the prepared remarks is the level of order activity throughout the quarter in the backlog. We entered the quarter with and left the quarter with or just are quite robust to give us quite a bit of confidence for the balance of the year.\nDeane Dray: That's all good to hear. And then on the M&A front, you've got the balance sheet fully reloaded, but they're what's the tone of the market right now has with so much macro uncertainty. Are sellers just holding back now is there any pause in activity and just what's the expectations over the next couple of quarters?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, hard to predict you know exactly how things will unfold in the near term. But the activity in the market and the activity that we're involved with is, is very high, at or above where it's been on. If you looked at the last five years, sort of average pace, we're at or above that, in terms of the number of deals we're seeing and never imagined meetings we're doing, the number of processes were involved in, ultimately, how many of those transact, based on uncertainty on the valuation market is still very much to be determined, but encouraged by the level of activity currently in the market?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKiran Patel-O'Connor: Hi, this is Kiran Patel-O'Connor on for Julian. So just looking at operating leverage for 2022. I know you guys had previously talked about approximately 40%. Is that, do you still feel good about that number. And where do you think we should land for Q2?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, I think that's, that's a pretty good number for the year, overall for the company, we're still looking at sort of the EBITDA margins relatively flat year-over-year. And so again, it\u2019s sort of a little bit improvement throughout the year, as some of the supply chain stuff, starts to get a little bit better. Again, the software businesses with this really strong organic growth, you get great leverage there. And it's really about are reinvesting in order to make sure there's more growth in the future. So our businesses are reinvesting at a pretty high level, which, which is great to see. And that will continue to drive more organic. And that's really, what moves you up from 40% or 45%, leverage or 50% or whatever it is, is really about the investments that we continue to make.\nKiran Patel-O'Connor: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Mason: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just so you think about your product centric businesses, both in the U.S. and Process Tech again, you've said it that you expect some sequential improvement as we go through the year in revenue with supply chain helping out some, but could you tease out how much of the revenue growth sequentially is coming from better supply chain versus perhaps price eating a little more, you made the reference in MAS? So that was one question and just around supply chain, what specifically gets better? I mean, is it around chips, electronics or is it other components, and just want to drill into that a little bit?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, it's Neil, let me take a take a crack at both of those price versus volume, if you will, and then the nature of or characterize the supply chain challenges. And maybe ask Rob if he has any follow up behind that. So on the price versus volume, it's very hard for us to track with precision, how much of the revenue rolled up at the Roper level in the product businesses is price versus units. That said, we would characterize it that, we put a lot we there's every one of our companies is taken pricing action or actions. We\u2019re certainly not the back, the backstop for global inflation. So we're passing that to our customers. But it does take time for that price to get in. And so for instance in Q1, in the MAF segment, there was a bit of margin pressure, because a lot of the revenue booked was from orders that were in the fourth quarter or the second half of last year that was at a lower price point than the orders that are booked this year. So it takes a little bit of time for that pricing to get into the system. But that's more of a commentary about margins than it is about revenue growth it's just hard to break out. As it relates to characterizing the supply chain challenges. It's not a thing, and it's not even a thing at a company. A company might have a chip problem for a quarter or a few months, and then it might become a glass problem for computer screens. And it might become a caster problem for cart. I mean it really is a little bit of a whack a mole at the individual company level and nothing sort of Pan Roper that we would characterize it as a single supply chain the threat if you will. Rob, anything you want to add to that?\nRob Crisci: Yes, so for me, yes, we had 7%, organic in Q1 and we're calling for HFD for the rest of the year. So I mean, really gradual improving. We've got very strong order performance. We've got of course record backlogs, that great book-to-bill. And so again, a little bit of improvement, we're not assuming that the supply chain improves dramatically anytime soon.\nRob Mason: I see. Okay, that's helpful. And just as a follow up, again, you made the comments that your industrial focus businesses continue to see some good strength through the end of the quarter, but I know you don't have a lot of international or European exposure specifically but Struers is one business that touches that area, just specifically to Europe. I was just curious what you saw as you finished out the quarter and into April?\nNeil Hunn: So Struers was had a great quarter, as they saw, I mean, Struers is tied partially to global industrial GDP and also global auto. And so Struers really picked up nicely because of the auto -- the global automotive -- automotive demand. All markets are strong as Struers ex-China for instance in the quarter. So, anything you want to add more broadly on Europe, but\u2026\nRob Crisci: No, I mean, I think overall, we're seeing still seeing pretty good strength across the across the world.\nOperator: My next question comes from Andrew Shlosh with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Shlosh: Hey, good morning, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nAndrew Shlosh: So, I can appreciate the color around these supply chain challenges. And obviously, that's not unique to you. But when we think about margins and measurement and analytical and process, from Q1 to Q2, just given the commentary you've given us, do you think that margins would be flattish sequentially, Q1 to Q2 in both of those segments? Or do you even think we could see some expansion there?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, I think sequentially a little bit of expansion, Q1 to Q2, not a tonne.\nAndrew Shlosh: Okay, that makes sense. And on Vertafore, you kind of started to strike there. Do you know how much that business was up in the quarter?\nRob Crisci: We know precisely how much that business is up in the quarter.\nNeil Hunn: Yes, as we as we said, when we bought that business, it's a solid, mid-single digit organic or growth business. And it's certainly done that since we've owned it.\nRob Crisci: It was better than that better than meaningfully better mid singles in a quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nJoe Giordano: Sorry, I had to jump on this. So apologies if this was asked, just curious in the, like, the overall M&A landscape right now just given what's going on in the market? Like, are you seeing more of a willingness of maybe private companies to sell now? Or are they still trying to like, hey, we'll get back to where we were like, what's the mind-set of a seller now? And where are you like are things more or less actionable than they were, like three months ago?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So what we see is the mark, the activity level, the number of processes, the number of companies that were that we're meeting with the number of diligence streams is, is above trend level, in terms of the that level of activity. I think it's still your question is still yet to be ultimately determined. I think we'll know more over the course of the next quarter or two, as we see if these processes actually conclude, based on if they're willing to accept the price where the market is. And so a little bit of a partial answer to your question, I think we just need a little bit of time for that to unfold.\nJoe Giordano: And you guys obviously made a lot of portfolio moves within the last year, maybe some very company specific opportunities. But as you look at your total portfolio, you'd see more opportunities, still ahead of you to kind of prune and kind of find more appropriate owners if you don't think you're the right one for some of the businesses.\nNeil Hunn: If you just take that question, and you're sort of elevated a touch, I mean, our strategy has been for 20 years and continues to be how do we increase not just the size of the business, but more importantly, the quality of the business, that's it. That is the whole punch line of our cash return on investment model was how do you improve the quality? And so we've been doing that for 20 years on the buy side, recurring revenue, organic growth, less cyclicality, more asset lightness. As you saw in the last, really three years, there's been a little bit on the sell side. And so the management team and the board looks our charter is to do that is to improve the quality of the business, principally through the buy side and here recently on the sell side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Good morning, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Congrats on the execution this quarter.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nSteve Tusa: Can you guys just give a little more color on how free cash flow should trend over the course of the year, maybe a little bit of a high? No, you're not giving like explicit guidance there. I might have missed it. I was on another call. But maybe there's some high level guide on cash.\nNeil Hunn: Yes, so sure. So high level total cash flow is going to be driven by organic revenue and organic EBITDA growth first, which is looking great for this year. And then basically timing of capital deployment and how big the deals are. And so that's why we don't guide free cash flow because we're always going to be, it's always been based on what's our what our total deployment, which of course, we are very patient disciplined. And as we mentioned on Q1, the performance on a conversion basis was very good versus history, obviously lower than last year, given the one timers that we outlined earlier on call.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So I guess you're saying that it depends on what kind of deals you do ultimately where the cash ends up, like decreasing?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, so the Roper model, right is about double digit long term cash flow, compounding the combination of organic growth and capital deployment. So in 20, we grew up free cash flow 15% in 21, it was 19%. If you look at the three year Q1 CAGR, it's 17%. And so we'll continue to do that moving forward is a combination of organic and capital deployment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blanton: Thank you. Moderator, may I ask you, please don't cut me off until I say thank you at the end of my second question. I think that's the best procedure for these Q&A's. The first question is about compressors, controls. Could you give us an update on how that's going? And what the outlook is there? And what's backlog is?\nNeil Hunn: Sure, so CCC have very good quarter coming off a great Q4. Order growth was nothing short of spectacular in Q1. We in for infact, it was the largest Q1 in a decade for Greenfield activity at CCC.\nAlex Blanton: And does this have to do with the oil price?\nNeil Hunn: No, I mean, think of CCC as much longer cycle than that. I mean, these are, for the most part gigantic infrastructure LNG projects that are planned out in some cases, Greenfield decade out. And so there was just a lot of, in this case, a lot of Greenfield activity. And then further if you want to just break you simplify CCC, you basically have a services book in the business and the projects, services for callbacks, meaning coming in for maintenance with strong services for new commission's meaning tied to new activity was strong. We just talked about how Greenfield project work was very good orders and brownfields been consistent. So it's on sort of on the two by two grid. All four part of that of boxes are green for CCC in the quarter.\nAlex Blanton: Doing more LNG projects to take gas to Europe would help you, is that correct?\nNeil Hunn: As a general matter if there's yes. I mean, if there's LNG compression happening, CCC is benefited by that.\nAlex Blanton: Okay. Second question is regarding the $5 billion. Could you just reassure us that there are businesses out there to be acquired that are large enough? That are of the kind that Roper has traditionally purchased, that are large enough to enable your growth to continue at the past rig for how long?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, I appreciate the question. I mean, that's always an important investor question. And the answer is a resoundingly yes. We've talked about the size of our broad pipeline. It's it's very, very large, there are many opportunities. We'll have no issue continue to compound and cash flow for many, many more years, based on the availability. Now, the challenge, as we talked about, right is sort of valuations, which remain relatively elevated compared to history. And so the idea is to do the best deal for the best price and by the highest quality business. And so we're working hard on that. But no, we're, we're in no way concerned about the availability of assets. We were very, very busy working on many things, and we feel great about our chances to be very successful.\nAlex Blanton: And these are the same kinds of qualities that you've been able to acquire in the past.\nNeil Hunn: Yes, you're very similar. If you look at our last dec yes, our last decade of acquisitions, right decade plus, it's very similar call asset quality to all those businesses, the Vertafore,, the Deltek, and all the great things we've done.\nAlex Blanton: Okay, thank you.\nNeil Hunn: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thanks, Zach and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. As I'm sure many of you have already noticed we are introducing Roper's new logo on today's call. Our new logo better reflects our transformation journey while paying honor and respect to our legacy. As a fun fact [ph] our legacy logo was first introduced in 1977. So with that let's turn to Page 4 and review today's agenda. As usual, we will start with our quarterly highlights followed by a segment by segment overview, then go through our increased outlook for guidance expectations and leave plenty of time to address your questions. Next slide please. As we turn to page 5, the main takeaways from today's call are first, we continue to increase the quality, predictability and durability of the underlying business models and revenue streams. Second, we continue to deliver strong organic growth and operating results enabling us to increase our organic growth outlook and desk guidance through the year. And third, we have substantial M&A capacity given our rapid de-leveraging and completion of our TransCore divestiture. As it relates to the first quarter, we are delighted to report another strong quarter of execution and positive momentum across the portfolio. Specifically, we grew revenue on an organic basis 11% in the quarter. This growth was broad based across each of our four segments. Not only did we grow nicely in the quarter, but the quality of the underlying business also improved as we saw double-digit organic increases and a recurring revenue base. In addition to our strong software growth, our product businesses performed quite nicely in the quarter as well experiencing very high levels of demand and record levels of backlog. Also during the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our project based TransCore business. As you will know we now have $3.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. When combined with our borrowing capacity we have over $5 billion of available capital deployment fire power which when deployed will further help drive cash flow and shareholder value compounding. So with this, definitely a solid start to the year. Now, let me turn the call to Rob, who will walk through our financial summary. Rob? Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to page 9 and walk through the Q1 highlights for application software segment. Revenues here were $632 million up 9% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 44.1%. Across this segment, we saw recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for the segment increased 10% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, cross selling activity, and new customer ads. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was quite broad. As we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Vertafore. Vertafore had an excellent quarter, which was highlighted by strong air our bookings activity and revenue growth. In addition, during the quarter Vertafore released its new commercial submissions product line. To remind everyone Vertafore strategy is to help tech enable the workflows for their P&C agent customers. This new product is a meaningful step in this direction, as it allows agents to quote multiple carriers in it's simple automated workflow. Great stuff from the Vert 14. Turning to Deltek, they posted another great quarter with strength across all end markets served. Deltek continues to gain momentum driving adoption to their cloud-based product offerings. Deltek also continues to be benefited by having favorable, secular tailwinds. CliniSys and data innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. Specifically CliniSys continued its market share gains in the U.K. As reminder, CliniSys is one of four strategic IT vendors to the National Health Service. DI was awesome in the quarter with continued strength driven by their direct go-to-market approach and large wins within the VA system. Aderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, extending their share gains and the large law space. Also in the quarter, licensing activity tied to seat expansions was very strong. They also continue to see meaningful shift towards our cloud offerings driving substantial increases to the recurring revenue base. Strata whose cloud-based software helps hospitals plan budget and manage their operations continues to execute their cross selling strategy with TTM net retention north of 110%. Of note, we're in the midst of an orderly leader transition at Strata. Dan Michelson, who has led Strata for the last 10 years is retiring. As an element of Roper's talent offense, Strata has been developing its next CEO, John Martinez for the past several years. As part of John's development, he started in the CFO function, then led commercial and go-to-market functions, and then became the Company COO. Strata's future is secure given the successful succession planning. Big thanks to Dan for all your leadership and accomplishments at Strata. John, we are super confident with you at the helm. Your new role is well earned, congrats. Finally, PowerPlan posted a strong double digit growth quarter driven by recurring revenue ads and higher services utilization. They also have a substantial new product roadmap slated for this year, which we're looking forward to discussing on subsequent calls. Looking to the outlook for 2022 on the segment, we expect to see mid-single digit growth for the balance of the year, driven by continued strong ARR momentum. With that, let's turn to the next slide. Turning to page 10. As a reminder, the financial performance for this segment, as well as the next two MAS and PT are shown on a continuing ops basis. Revenue in the first quarter for a network segment was $369 million up 16% on organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong 51.2%. The 16% organic growth is underpinned by 16% growth in recurring revenue, which is roughly 80% of the segment's revenue base. As we dig into business specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continue to be super strong during the quarter, the market conditions continue to be quite favorable, which led to record levels of Network ads again, especially on the carrier side of the network. In addition, DAT continues to do a nice job of increasing revenue per user by both adding features and improving value capture. Over a longer arc of time, our freight matching businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the digitization of the spot freight markets. Moving the foundry, our software business that enables the combination of Live Action Filming and computer generated graphics to being applied into a single frame had record bookings revenue and EBITDA for the first quarter. Net retention is north of 110% and ARR grew double digits. Foundry success is rooted in their fast paced innovation capability and favorable long term market conditions. iTrade, our network food supply chain business and iPipeline our life insurance SaaS business helping to tech enable the quoting and underwriting processes each had strong customer additions, which helped drive strong ARR growth in the quarter. Finally, RFIDs had record orders with growth coming from secure print and identity management applications. Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single digit organic growth for this segment, driven by a combination of strong recurring revenue momentum and favorable market tailwinds. Kindly turn to the next slide. As we turn to page 11, revenues and our MAF segment were $392 million up 7% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 31.5% for the quarter. Again, these results are in a continuing off spaces. Before getting into business specific details across this segment, demand continues to be very strong and product backlogs continue to be at record levels. Also, each of these businesses are navigating the current supply chain complexities. While margins were in line with their expectations, they were negatively impacted versus prior year, and are impacted by the availability and pricing of raw material components as well as expediting freight costs. As our businesses increase, price actions take hold throughout the year, margins should improve as we get into the second half. As it relates to our business specific commentary, we'll start with Neptune, which had record orders, revenue and quarter ending backlog. Neptune has been able to gain market share by being successful and keeping product lead times at industry leading terms and releasing new products, both in terms of cellular connectivity, and static meter reading technology. Verathon, Northern Digital and each of our medical product franchises remained super solid. Verathon continues to see strong demand and market share gains in their single use Bronchoscope category, and NDI sees the same in both our optical and electromechanical measurement capabilities. These businesses are beneficiaries of long term and favorable market tailwinds. As it relates to our industrial businesses, demand throughout the quarter was quite strong given the improvement end market and capital spending conditions. As it relates to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single digit growth for this segment underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain environment. Net net, we expect a very strong balance of the year for this group, for the balance of the year for this group. Now let's turn to our final segment Process Tech. As you turn to page 12, revenue on our Process Tech segment were $134 million in Q1 up 18% on an organic basis, EBITDA margins were 32.5% in the quarter. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The story here is we continue to see improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment, and very strong demand. Cornell continues to perform well for us delivering record orders and backlog in the quarter. The strength is partially based on market conditions but also based on Cornell's product innovation, as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected pumping solutions and the share gains they're joining as a result of their niche focused go-to-market teams. Also, our upstream oil and gas businesses saw strength in the quarter. Similar to that of our MAS product businesses, these businesses are also being impacted by supply chain challenges but continue to navigate well into the issues. As we return to the outlook for the balance of 2022, we expect high teens organic growth based on strong levels of backlog and solid market conditions. Now please turn to page 14. And we'll talk through our 2022 increased guidance outlook. Based on a solid start to Q1, strong growth in our software, recurring revenue base and record levels of product demand and backlog we are increasing our full year 2022 DEPS guidance to be in the range of $15.50 and $15.75 up from our original guidance of $15.25 and $15.55. Underpinning this DEPS guidance is our increased organic revenue growth expectation of 7% to 9% for the year. We expect the steady tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. As we look to the second quarter we're establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.80 and $3.84 again on a continuing ops basis. Now our concluding comments and we'll get to your question. As we turn to page 15 in our closing remarks, we want to leave you with the same three points we started with; one, as we grow, we are increasing the quality of the underlying business and business model. Two, we had a strong start to the year and three we have substantial M&A capacity available to us. As relates to our strong start, we grew revenues organically 11% and EBITDA 8%. More so we have grown our cashflow 17% on a three year compounded basis. We are lifting our full year organic growth and DEPS guidance based on the factors outlined during this call. Specifically strong recurring revenue growth, record demand for product businesses and generally favorable market conditions  Finally, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have an active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We have north of 5 billion of available M&A firepower. So as we turn to your questions, we would like to highlight that our inaugural ESG report was published to our website earlier today. This report outlines our commitment to ESG and our sustainability principles. And with that, let's open it to your questions. Good morning. Yes, thanks for the question. As we look back over the recurring revenue, overall growth over the last five quarters, I think, four or the five have been in the double -- low double digits. And so we were not surprised by it. But it certainly encouraged by strength, also encouraged by the breadth of the converse of the strength that wasn't isolated in one or two businesses really quite broad based against everything. And, and we also just as a Q1 there was a lighter comp from a year ago. Yes, they're certainly both well represented. If you go back over, I think the last 15 years, something like 90% of the capital deployed at Ropers, done on platform deals intent on bolt-ons. It's not a budget; it's just a historical reference to platform versus bolt-on's. If we were guessing it might feel a little bit more towards bolt-on's in the next 10 years, because we have more things to bolt things into. But the preponderance of the capital deployment will be on platform deals and the pipeline is, is well weighted across both of those. Good morning Dean Dean, this is Neil. The only thing I'd add to that we said it a number of times in the prepared remarks is the level of order activity throughout the quarter in the backlog. We entered the quarter with and left the quarter with or just are quite robust to give us quite a bit of confidence for the balance of the year. Yes, hard to predict you know exactly how things will unfold in the near term. But the activity in the market and the activity that we're involved with is, is very high, at or above where it's been on. If you looked at the last five years, sort of average pace, we're at or above that, in terms of the number of deals we're seeing and never imagined meetings we're doing, the number of processes were involved in, ultimately, how many of those transact, based on uncertainty on the valuation market is still very much to be determined, but encouraged by the level of activity currently in the market? Yes, I think that's, that's a pretty good number for the year, overall for the company, we're still looking at sort of the EBITDA margins relatively flat year-over-year. And so again, it's sort of a little bit improvement throughout the year, as some of the supply chain stuff, starts to get a little bit better. Again, the software businesses with this really strong organic growth, you get great leverage there. And it's really about are reinvesting in order to make sure there's more growth in the future. So our businesses are reinvesting at a pretty high level, which, which is great to see. And that will continue to drive more organic. And that's really, what moves you up from 40% or 45%, leverage or 50% or whatever it is, is really about the investments that we continue to make. Yes, it's Neil, let me take a take a crack at both of those price versus volume, if you will, and then the nature of or characterize the supply chain challenges. And maybe ask Rob if he has any follow up behind that. So on the price versus volume, it's very hard for us to track with precision, how much of the revenue rolled up at the Roper level in the product businesses is price versus units. That said, we would characterize it that, we put a lot we there's every one of our companies is taken pricing action or actions. We're certainly not the back, the backstop for global inflation. So we're passing that to our customers. But it does take time for that price to get in. And so for instance in Q1, in the MAF segment, there was a bit of margin pressure, because a lot of the revenue booked was from orders that were in the fourth quarter or the second half of last year that was at a lower price point than the orders that are booked this year. So it takes a little bit of time for that pricing to get into the system. But that's more of a commentary about margins than it is about revenue growth it's just hard to break out. As it relates to characterizing the supply chain challenges. It's not a thing, and it's not even a thing at a company. A company might have a chip problem for a quarter or a few months, and then it might become a glass problem for computer screens. And it might become a caster problem for cart. I mean it really is a little bit of a whack a mole at the individual company level and nothing sort of Pan Roper that we would characterize it as a single supply chain the threat if you will. Rob, anything you want to add to that? So Struers was had a great quarter, as they saw, I mean, Struers is tied partially to global industrial GDP and also global auto. And so Struers really picked up nicely because of the auto -- the global automotive -- automotive demand. All markets are strong as Struers ex-China for instance in the quarter. So, anything you want to add more broadly on Europe, but... Good morning. Yes, I think sequentially a little bit of expansion, Q1 to Q2, not a tonne. Yes, as we as we said, when we bought that business, it's a solid, mid-single digit organic or growth business. And it's certainly done that since we've owned it. Good morning. Yes. So what we see is the mark, the activity level, the number of processes, the number of companies that were that we're meeting with the number of diligence streams is, is above trend level, in terms of the that level of activity. I think it's still your question is still yet to be ultimately determined. I think we'll know more over the course of the next quarter or two, as we see if these processes actually conclude, based on if they're willing to accept the price where the market is. And so a little bit of a partial answer to your question, I think we just need a little bit of time for that to unfold. If you just take that question, and you're sort of elevated a touch, I mean, our strategy has been for 20 years and continues to be how do we increase not just the size of the business, but more importantly, the quality of the business, that's it. That is the whole punch line of our cash return on investment model was how do you improve the quality? And so we've been doing that for 20 years on the buy side, recurring revenue, organic growth, less cyclicality, more asset lightness. As you saw in the last, really three years, there's been a little bit on the sell side. And so the management team and the board looks our charter is to do that is to improve the quality of the business, principally through the buy side and here recently on the sell side. Good morning, Steve. Thank you. Yes, so sure. So high level total cash flow is going to be driven by organic revenue and organic EBITDA growth first, which is looking great for this year. And then basically timing of capital deployment and how big the deals are. And so that's why we don't guide free cash flow because we're always going to be, it's always been based on what's our what our total deployment, which of course, we are very patient disciplined. And as we mentioned on Q1, the performance on a conversion basis was very good versus history, obviously lower than last year, given the one timers that we outlined earlier on call. Yes, so the Roper model, right is about double digit long term cash flow, compounding the combination of organic growth and capital deployment. So in 20, we grew up free cash flow 15% in 21, it was 19%. If you look at the three year Q1 CAGR, it's 17%. And so we'll continue to do that moving forward is a combination of organic and capital deployment. Sure, so CCC have very good quarter coming off a great Q4. Order growth was nothing short of spectacular in Q1. We in for infact, it was the largest Q1 in a decade for Greenfield activity at CCC. No, I mean, think of CCC as much longer cycle than that. I mean, these are, for the most part gigantic infrastructure LNG projects that are planned out in some cases, Greenfield decade out. And so there was just a lot of, in this case, a lot of Greenfield activity. And then further if you want to just break you simplify CCC, you basically have a services book in the business and the projects, services for callbacks, meaning coming in for maintenance with strong services for new commission's meaning tied to new activity was strong. We just talked about how Greenfield project work was very good orders and brownfields been consistent. So it's on sort of on the two by two grid. All four part of that of boxes are green for CCC in the quarter. As a general matter if there's yes. I mean, if there's LNG compression happening, CCC is benefited by that. Yes, I appreciate the question. I mean, that's always an important investor question. And the answer is a resoundingly yes. We've talked about the size of our broad pipeline. It's it's very, very large, there are many opportunities. We'll have no issue continue to compound and cash flow for many, many more years, based on the availability. Now, the challenge, as we talked about, right is sort of valuations, which remain relatively elevated compared to history. And so the idea is to do the best deal for the best price and by the highest quality business. And so we're working hard on that. But no, we're, we're in no way concerned about the availability of assets. We were very, very busy working on many things, and we feel great about our chances to be very successful. Yes, you're very similar. If you look at our last dec yes, our last decade of acquisitions, right decade plus, it's very similar call asset quality to all those businesses, the Vertafore,, the Deltek, and all the great things we've done. You're welcome."

            "name": "Rob Crisci",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to page 6 and covering some of the Q1 financial highlights. Total revenue increased 11% to $1.53 billion. As Neil mentioned, organic revenue also increased 11% with broad base strength across our four reporting segments. Application software grew 9% organically, network software grew 16%, our MAS segment grew 7% and finally, our smallest segment Process Technologies was up 18%. EBITDA margin was 37.8% for the quarter, resulting in EBITDA increasing 8% to $577 million. Notably, that $577 million of Q1 EBITDA on a continuing operations basis is actually higher than the Q1 EBITDA we reported last April when we still owned and of course consolidated TransCore and the other two divested businesses. Adjusted DEPS for the quarter was $3.77, which was well above our guidance range of $3.63 to $3.67. Free cash flow was $459 million with solid EBITDA cash conversion of 80%. That's above the Q1 conversion levels we experienced in 2019 and 2020, but below last year is exceptionally strong Q1 conversion of 96%. To that end, there are two discrete cash items that combined to create an $80 million Q1 headwind versus prior year. As discussed on last April's call, last year's Q1 included $40 million of accelerated payments to CliniSys. Furthermore, this year's Q1 reflects a $40 million increase in incentive compensation as a result of our strong 2021 performance compared to the pandemic year of 2020. So stepping back, we are of course focused on long term compounding here at Roper. In the three blue bars at the bottom of our page, you can see our three year compounding from Q1 2019 for revenue EBITDA, and free cash flow was 10%, 13% and 17%, respectively. So in summary, an excellent start to the year. Next slide, turning to page 7, which is an update on our financial position. Turning to the balance sheet, as Neil mentioned, we have a very large cash balance, which is the result of closing the transport divestiture during the quarter and receiving the gross proceeds. We have yet to pay the approximately $650 million of taxes related to the divestitures, which will be paid during the final three quarters of 2022. As of March 31, as Neil mentioned, our cash balance stood at $3.2 billion, which brings our net debt down to $4.2 billion, or approximately 1.9 times our TTM EBITDA from continuing ops. So with our healthy combination of balance sheet cash, continued strong free cash flow generation, and our investment grade leverage capacity, we are very well positioned to deploy $5 billion or more of capital. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to cover our segments in greater detail. Yes. Hey, Dean, it's Rob. Yes, so we're still seeing, of course the impact, like everyone else of supply chain. I mean, you can see it in our MAS segment, probably more so than in process. But the businesses have done a really, really good job of working through it. And so, that allows us to have, great organic growth, and then, the, the margins, which were downloaded in MAS on supply chain should incrementally improve moving forward. So, I think overall, the businesses are doing a great job of handling what everyone else is, is also having to deal with. Yes, so for me, yes, we had 7%, organic in Q1 and we're calling for HFD for the rest of the year. So I mean, really gradual improving. We've got very strong order performance. We've got of course record backlogs, that great book-to-bill. And so again, a little bit of improvement, we're not assuming that the supply chain improves dramatically anytime soon. No, I mean, I think overall, we're seeing still seeing pretty good strength across the across the world. We know precisely how much that business is up in the quarter. It was better than that better than meaningfully better mid singles in a quarter."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our Safe-Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, the financial impacts associated with our minority investments in Indicor and Certinia. And lastly, transaction-related expenses associated with our completed acquisitions. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our quite good 2023 fourth quarter and full-year results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 5, let's look at today's agenda. This morning, I'll start by walking through our full-year highlights and then we'll turn to commenting on our most recent acquisition, Procare Solutions. Jason will then go through our quarterly results, both in aggregate and at the segment level, share our annual results and review our strong balance sheet position, then I'll pick up and discuss our segment level annual results, our 2024 outlook, wrap up, and turn to your questions. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the two key takeaways for today's call are; first, we delivered a very strong 2023; and second, we remain well-positioned and are carrying positive momentum into 2024. As we look back on the full-year, we're proud of what the organization accomplished. From a financial perspective, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth, with free cash flow margins at 32%. Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned with 8% organic revenue growth. Jason will cover this in a few minutes, but Q4 was strong as well with 13% total revenue growth and 8% organic revenue growth. Also during the year, we deployed $2.1 billion in the high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. As we all know, last year was a challenged year relative to available acquisition opportunities, given that I'm super-proud of our team's ability to grind through the market conditions and successfully convert two outstanding value-creation M&A opportunities. Given all this, we entered this year with positive momentum. We continue to see strong demand for our mission-critical solutions. As a reminder, each of our businesses is a leader in their respective market and delivers system of record, network critical or vital and-or lifesaving technologies. As a result, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions. Also as we head into 2024, we have meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions, Syntellis, Replicon, and Procare. It is important to highlight these additions to our portfolio of businesses also improved the underlying quality of our enterprise in terms of reoccurring revenue mix and organic growth profile. Finally, we continue to be very active in the M&A market, in environment that we expect to be notably improved in 2024 with a strong balance sheet and a large pipeline of attractive opportunities. So, a strong '23 and solid momentum both organic and inorganic behind us as we enter 2024. Now please turn to the next page, Page 6, where I will discuss our most recent acquisition, Procare Solutions. Procare Solutions is a fantastic addition to the Roper portfolio. Let's start with the fundamentals. We're paying $1.75 billion net of $110 million tax benefit for the business. We expect Procare to contribute about $260 million of revenue and $95 million of EBITDA for the 12 months ended Q1 '25. Procare will be accretive to our free cash flow in '24 and to our adjusted DEPS in '25. We will fund the acquisition with a portion of our $3.5 billion revolver, and we'll report Procare in our Application Software segment and expect the deal to close this quarter. Procare meets all our longstanding acquisition criteria, leader in a smaller market, delivers mission-critical verticalized software solutions, competes based on customer intimacy, operates in asset-light business model, and is led by a skilled passionate leadership team. What' incrementally different for us is the maturing leader nature of this company. As we outlined during our Investor Day last year, our corporate strategy leans on implementing two modest improvements. First, continue to improve our long-term sustainable organic growth rate. And second, capture more value from our capital appointment capacity. Relative to additional capital deployment value capture, we are focusing on doing a higher proportion of bolt-on activity as evidenced by last year's capital deployment records and adding higher-growth or maturing leader business profiles to our enterprise. Procare is a prototypical maturing leader archetype, meeting all our longstanding criteria that I mentioned above, but as structurally faster growth business that possesses the opportunity to improve margins as the top-line scales. For Procare, we expect mid-teens top-line growth with improving margins from an already strong position for the years to come. Let's talk about what the company does. Procare is the leading provider of mission-critical and purpose-built software to 37,000 owners and operators of early childhood education centers which they used to run their business. The software provides all the needed functionality to run the childcare center ranging from parents and family engagement, staff and teachers scheduling, classroom management, tuition billing and payment processing. The market itself is quite attractive. And in the midst of a long-term secular tailwind of young dual income families seeking higher levels of early childhood education versus daycare. In addition, like most industries, this one is undergoing long-term tech-enablement. Given these factors, this market is growing annually in the low double digits area. As mentioned, Procare is the leading player with a 1.5 times through all their market-share advantage in this space given their super compelling value proposition that combines both software and the integrated payment capabilities. Given this, Procare has very high gross retention and compelling net retention as well. Finally, from a extensive due diligence of the business, we are encouraged by the fact that Procare has multiple strategic and operating pathways available to deliver mid-teens growth and long-term margin expansion. Net-net, this is a highly compelling value creation opportunity for Roper, and our shareholders. And to Joanne, your leadership team and all the Procare family, welcome to Roper. So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you so you can walk-through our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as our very strong financial position. Jason?\nJason Conley: Great. Thanks, Neil. I'll walk-through the enterprise and segment results for Q4, and enterprise results for the full-year along with a review of our balance sheet. Starting with Q4 on Slide 7. We had an excellent finish to a strong year, revenue over $1.6 billion was 13% over prior year, led by 8% organic growth with acquisitions adding four points and less than a point of currency benefit. Organic outperformance was led by our TEP segment, highlighted by Neptune and Verathon. Gross margin of 69.7% was down 30 basis points versus prior year given the higher mix coming from our TEP segment. EBITDA grew 11% to $659 million with EBITDA margin coming in at a solid 40.8%. With the offsetting impact of interest and taxes, this translated into DEPS growth of 11% to $4.37, above our guidance range of $4.28 to $4.32. Also from a cash perspective, free cash flow finished strong at $596 million, up 30% over prior year. This was in-line with our expectations with a good renewal season across our software businesses. We turn to Slide 8, I'll briefly click into the segment performance in Q4. Application Software delivered revenue growth of 15% over prior year to $852 million with organic growth contributing seven points and the balance coming primarily from our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. EBITDA margin of 43.2% in the quarter was below prior year's high watermark of 45.6%, which as we discussed last year, was driven by lower incentive-based compensation. Network Software was up 3% to $363 million with EBITDA up 10% to $208 million. As we have discussed before, our freight matching businesses are navigating a drawdown of carriers, following exceptional marketplace growth over 2021 and 2022, which is mixing down the growth rate for the segment. However, our business leaders DAT and Loadlink have aligned the cost base with reduced carrier subscribers to still drive solid EBITDA growth in the quarter. Our TEP segment grew by 17% in the quarter to $399 million with EBITDA of 13% to a $134 million. Growth was led by exceptional performance at Neptune, with continued increasing demand for ultrasonic technologies and overall favorable market conditions. Also Verathon continued its remarkable growth with strengthened single-use products across Laryngoscopy and Bronchoscopy. EBITDA margin of 33.6% was down from prior year given some one-time investments and incentive compensation in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, I'll walk through our full-year 2023 performance. As Neil just mentioned, revenue was just under $6.2 billion, up 15% over prior year with organic growth of 8% and acquisitions contributing seven points, mainly Frontline and Syntellis. Looking at a three-year revenue CAGR on this slide, similar to 2023, it's also at 15%. Further, the organic -- average organic growth rate over the three-year period has been about 8%. So as Neil mentioned, we benefited from some market conditions over that time period. EBITDA of just over $2.5 billion was up 16% over prior year yielding EBITDA margin of 40.6%. Our three-year EBITDA over this period was also up 16%. So the story remains the same at Roper. We own and continually grow a portfolio of high gross margin businesses and generally convert EBITDA -- growth to EBITDA in the 45% range, which allows for ample investment back into the business for future sustainable growth. Free cash flow for the year was just shy of $2 billion, which represents a 32% margin and is coincidentally up 32% over 2022. Full-year contribution from our Frontline acquisition and excellent performance across the enterprise drove this result, underpinned by strong renewals, favorable DSO and improving inventory turns. Of note, our net working capital as a percent of annualized revenue was negative 19% in Q4 to the new record for Roper. Importantly, over a three-year period, we have compounded cash flow at 16%. Our consistent focus on growing cash flow and the strength of our new portfolio following our divestitures demonstrates a solid base from which to continue our long-term growth algorithm. To that end, we expect free cash flow margin to be 30% or more in 2024. With that, we can flip to Slide 10 to discuss our strong financial position. From a liquidity standpoint, we finished the year with $3.14 billion available on our revolver, with over $200 million of cash. Regarding leverage, we brought down net-debt to EBITDA from 2.7 times at the beginning of 2023, to a year end figure of 2.4 times despite deploying $2.1 billion towards acquisitions. We expect to close on Procare later in Q1 and will utilize our revolver to fund the transaction. So this will be our pro-forma leverage to about 3 times. Our solid balance sheet coupled with strong cash generation gives us capacity to deploy $4 billion or more of capital, while remaining committed to our solid investment-grade rating. Since our October call, deal activity has demonstrably increased with a corresponding lift in asset quality. That said, our market optimism remains balanced by our disciplined process in patient posture. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Neil to talk about our full-year segment performance and the indications for 2024. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 12, let's look-back on the year for our Application Software segment. Total revenues grew 21% and organic revenues grew 6% to $3.19 billion, while EBITDA margins remained strong at 43.7%. Within the segment, results were consistent with strength at Deltek, Aderant, Vertafore, Strata and Frontline. Deltek continued to see strong gains in our SaaS solutions, especially in the private sector markets. As discussed throughout the year, the GovCon market was tempered given all the uncertainty regarding government spending, notwithstanding Deltek delivered mid-single-digit organic growth for the year. In addition, they continue to innovate and add capabilities during times of uncertainty, which is a hallmark of Roper strategy, highlighted by the bolt-ons of Replicon and ProPricer. ProPricer, a smaller transaction about $80 million purchase price that closed late last year and delivers the leading contract pricing solutions and software for government contractors and federal agencies, an ideal strategic fit for Deltek's cost point product family. Aderant was just amazing last year. They had record bookings and significant adoption of their anchor SaaS solutions and add-on products. Also, Aderant is one of the leaders within Roper and the legal software market as it relates to productizing generative AI solutions within their product stack. Great job by Chris, Rossi, and the entire team at Aderant. Continuing on, Vertafore was solid with strong ARR gains throughout the year. Additionally, Vertafore made great strides with our product strategy deployment and the MGA systems bolt-on is trending well-ahead of our investment case. Strata also was quite good last year, both in terms of organic ARR gains, and their acquisition and integration work associated with Syntellis. Finally, Frontline executed well, delivering strong retention and cash flow during the year. As I mentioned earlier, we will report Procare solutions in this segment and expect the deal to close this quarter. As it relates to our 2024 outlook for this segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Please turn with us to Page 13. Full-year organic revenue for our Network segment grew 5% to $1.44 billion and margins were strong at 55.2%. We'll start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which both grew in the year despite the year long muted freight market conditions. Similar to that of Deltek, both businesses continue to innovate during the sluggish market with particularly interesting Gen AI innovations at DAT to help combat industry fraud. Pipeline delivered record bookings and had very strong customer retention and expansion activity, leading to strong ARR growth. Foundry, our post-production media and entertainment software business muscled through the year given the writers and actors strikes and made meaningful progress in the transition to a full subscription revenue model. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong throughout the year as census levels and senior care facilities improved. As it relates to our full-year 2024 guide for the segment, we expect to see low-single digit organic revenue growth based on the expectation of continued muted freight market conditions, but with continued strong EBITDA margin performance. Now please turn to Page 14 and let's review our TEPs segment's results. Organic revenues for the year grew 15% to $1.55 billion and EBITDA margins remain consistent at 35.3%. As we look back over the year, we entered the year with a high degree of supply-chain uncertainty. During the year, the vast majority of these uncertainties are resolved and our business has done a tremendous job of capturing the opportunity. As we exit '23 and look to '24, we do not see meaningful supply chain constraints. As usual, we'll start with Neptune, our water meter and technology business. Neptune was just great and continues to see strong demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters, and increasing adoption of their meter meter data management software. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete. Verathon was awesome as well for the year. Verathon was strong across all three of their product families, ultrasonic, bladder volume measurement, video-assisted intubation and single-use Bronchoscopy. As. As a reminder Verathon's reoccurring single-use offerings now make up about 55% of the business' annual revenue stream. Just an amazing product and business execution journey to both scale and improve the underlying quality of the business. Finally, our RF product businesses, Inovonics and rf IDEAS did a terrific job managing through their supply chain challenges and delivered very strong 2023 financial performance. Looking to our 2024 guidance for this segment, we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for the full-year, and the expectation that Q1 will grow in the mid-teens area. Now please turn with us to Page 16. This morning, we're establishing our 2024 full-year and first quarter guidance. For the full-year, which includes the impact of Procare solutions, we expect to see total revenue growth between 11% and 12%. On an organic basis, we expect to see full-year 2024 revenue grow between 5% and 6%. And finally, we expect to see full-year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $17.85 - $18.15, which includes about $0.10 to $0.15 of DEPS dilution associated with the Procare deal. Assumed in this guidance, the tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. We want to take a moment, set our guide in context of our long-term strategy and execution model. To remind everyone, historically we operate at a 5% to 6% organic growth portfolio. Our strategy and ambition to structurally improve organic growth rate to be in the 8% to 9% area. Over the last three years, we grew 8%, 9% and 8% on an organic basis. So these years were benefited to some extent from certain market conditions. As such, our view is our current course and speed of organic growth rate is in the 7% to 7.5% area. We are very pleased with our progress to date and continue to work to achieve organic growth aspirations. As it relates to organic revenue outlook for '24, we enter the year mindful of two factors; continued subdued large customer activity in our Application Software segment and our freight matching businesses within our Network segment being below trend based on our expectations for continued muted freight market conditions. As it relates to the first quarter, we expect to see adjusted DEPS in the range of $4.30 and $4.34. Now please turn with us to Page 17, and then we'll look-forward to your questions. As per our custom, we'll will conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. One, we delivered another great year performance. And two, we have continued positive momentum heading into 2024. Relative to 2023s performance, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth, with free cash flow margins also at 32%. Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned by 8% organic revenue growth. Importantly, free cash flow was growing 16% on a three-year compounded basis and we delivered our first-ever quarter of a $1 billion of software recurring and reoccurring revenues, quite an important milestone for enterprise. In addition, we deployed $2.1 billion towards high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-ons of Syntellis and Replicon, and year we're deploying capital was structurally challenged and we did so at very compelling values, leading the strong value creation for shareholders. As we enter 2024, we do so with strong momentum. We continue to see robust demand for our mission-critical solutions, a strong outlook for organic growth. Also, you can count on Roper to improve the underlying business quality as we scale our enterprise. Adding to the momentum for the year are the contributions from our 2023 acquisition cohort and last week's announcement of Procare Solutions. Finally, we are well-positioned to continue our capital deployment execution. We remain very active in the M&A market and environment that expect to be notably improved in 2024. We do this with a strong balance sheet, a large pipeline of attractive opportunities and unwavering levels of patience and discipline. Now as we turn to your questions and if you can flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel. We'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve the organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow in the mid-teens area over the long arc of time . So with that, thank you for your continued interest in Roper, and let's open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Can we just start with Procare, and it's interesting. This is the first time I recall where you made a deal announcement and I had not one but two people at RBC Research contact me and say, hi, that they were you're active customers. And so -- and they show them the apps on their phone and it was really interesting to see that dynamic. And my question here is, I'm really glad that you highlighted how they're a maturing leader and within that category. And what surprises me is how much growth there is, I mean, low-single digit, maybe a low-double-digit to mid-teens. As you start to see that type of growth, might the private equity sellers have a bias, where maybe that's a public company exit, that's always been the kind of adage if you go for these more orphan businesses, there is no public company exit, they're more apt to sell to you at a reasonable price. If you start looking at some of these growth to your businesses like Procare, even at a maturing leader category, might that stretch the multiples because the private equity players might have a public company exit in mind? So maybe we can start there.\nNeil Hunn: Yes, so I think -- first, appreciate the comments on Procare. I think there's like 80,000 five-star ratings in the app store. So your colleagues are a couple of many about the liking the application and the engagement with their kids in their early childhood education centers. Relative to the question about the IPO is a competitor, I mean maybe on some transactions, but most of what we're going to look at are going to be sub-scale for the IPO market. The TAM here is sub $1 billion, that's not a very IPO-able type market. So this is again small market leader. The market is growing low-double digits that we talked about, which underpins the mid-teens growth rate we're underwriting to hear. In terms of valuation in multiples, I think we're just in a world where sellers, especially private equity sellers understand the cost of capital, where the world is. They have constraints from their LPs. They need to get liquidity back to them. They can't raise new funds without it. And so, I mean, it's hard to guess with this asset would have traded for 12 months to 18 months ago, but substantially -- substantially higher on a multiple basis. So we think for the moment the valuations are coming to us because of the market for us that we just talked about.\nJason Conley: I think in this current environment liquidity is really key. So, if you do an IPO, you don't get your liquidity right away. So I think that's pretty important\nDeane Dray: And this might be more of a nuance, but at your Analyst Day you talked about a willingness to look at businesses that might be at an earlier stage of development. And is -- on that spectrum, this Procare is a maturing leader. Is that something you could have acted sooner on? And when Jason talked about the level of activity, how -- within the funnel are there businesses that are at that earlier-stage that might look attractive?\nNeil Hunn: I think Procare is like a perfect example by earlier stage, right? So these are not early-stage companies. They are earlier than what we've typically acquired in the past. So they meet all of our criteria. I have to emphasize that every time we talk about maturing leaders. So it's a leader in a small market. The base, the competition is understood and observable in the marketplace. The relative market share advantage this company has is particularly interesting. So those are common traits of everything we've always acquired. In this case, the market is growing a little bit faster and the underlying business model -- margins are going to scale as the business grows. So that's the earlier part of what we're talking about. Historically, we would have maybe waited by Procare until the next trade, the one after, the one that just occurred. And so when we look at the model of this over a long arc, it's just much more value for our shareholders to do this type of transaction. In terms of the pipeline, it is as Jason said in his comments, as I said in my comments, just a noticeable change in activity since our last call in the marketplace for some of the reasons that we talked about, and it's a variety of opportunities. I mean, we know we're leaning into doing more bolt-ons, so there's a fair amount of bolt-on activity in there. That's a lot of what Jan and her team are working to build, and then there's a fair number of these emerging, maturing leader, excuse me, maturing leader type profiles and will just ask them, we'll be patient and disciplined to figure out the right ones for us.\nDeane Dray: That's all great to hear. Thanks. Congratulations.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just following up on Procare. If you could clarify a little bit just the financial impact. I think you said maybe $0.10 to $0.15 hit for the year in that guide. So maybe just sort of clarify around that. Is it kind of a smaller hit in Q1 because of the timing of the deal close and then we just spread the rest out over the balance? Any thoughts on kind of the seasonality of the Procare business and then how quickly you'll get that sort of related debt down?\nJason Conley: Yes, sure, Julian. So we expect to close in March. That's sort of our assumption right now. So the way that plays out is of the $0.15, maybe $0.02 in the first quarter. So we expect for the calendar year around $75 million of EBITDA. And then we'll obviously from an interest perspective, we'll reload on the revolver, which is going to be at around 6%. And so, and obviously, and so that will cast out through the rest of the year. So that's how you get to your $0.10, $0.15 for the year. In terms of seasonality, not a ton of seasonality for the business. And then, of course, it's growing nicely. So that's sort of works through any aberrations you'd have between quarters\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just homing in on Network Software for a second. So you have that sort of softness in the freight markets, just been sort of well understood for some time. Foundry was also weak for some of last year. So are we thinking that in the context of that low single-digit organic growth guide for the year in Network Software, just trying to understand are you assuming kind of a slower start and then a pickup in the back half? Or it's a steady sort of 3% growth rate dialed in, Just like how you exited 2023?\nNeil Hunn: I'll take the first to that and then ask Jason if he wants to add any color. So you're right, the call -- I mean the principal driver of the growth rates in this range for '24 is DAT & Link and freight matching businesses. Foundry had, as we talked about, had a tough '23 with the actors and writers strike. On top of that, they started that migration to a full subscription model. And so, '24 will be a bit muted for Foundry as well, but that's a small relative to the impact of DAT and the Canadian Freight Match businesses. We've assumed sort of muted conditions throughout the whole year. There certainly are market prognosticators that are suggesting a second-half pickup. We've not assumed that in our model. We want to see it before we load it in, and that's our core assumption relative to the Freight Match businesses hitting that.\nJulian Mitchell: That's right. Great. Thank you\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Curious just to get the thoughts on organic growth in '24, obviously you've taken a pretty meaningful step down from what you did last year. And maybe if you can explain that in the initial guide and what you're baking in for the overall guide for '24?\nNeil Hunn: Sure. I mean it's -- I'll just comment and share a few of the thoughts, we said in the prepared remarks, right? So the our long-term aspirations are to grow organically in that 8% to 9% range and we believe we have the possibility to do that. It's going to take a few more years to get into that run-rate. That's the aspiration of what we're all working towards both in the group executives and all the operating teams across the company. As you know, the last three years there was an 8%, 9%, 8% throughout that whole period of time. We said those were benefited by some market tailwinds, some back from the pandemic, you know, a raging freight market, things like that. Supply chain sort of bottlenecks and releases. And that was sort of in the last three years. So as we look at this year compared to history and then also, or the possible in the arc, we think our current course and speed is in the 7% to 7.5% range organic growth through all that noise. So as we compare, we're doing in '24 against all that, it really is two simple reconciling factors. One is, we just talked about in the last question. The freight markets being slow. Our expectation for them to be slow throughout the whole year. And as we talked about for a few quarters last year in our Application Software segment, there was notably less large customer activity, like enterprise class customer activity. Deltek, a little bit, we talked about Frontline. A little bit of smaller business called Data Innovations, which all makes sense. The large companies anticipating a slowdown. They just got cautious in their buying behavior. The good news is, Deltek ended Q4 with a fair amount of momentum. I think they're up low-double-digit, either high single low-double digits in the quarter. So they exited with a fair amount of momentum, it's one data point. We want to see a few of those thrown together. And so we're -- those are the two reconciling items, the freight slowdown, expectation slowdown in large activity in Application. That's embedded in our model and those are reconciling factors between last year and where we are this year and also pretty much a reconciling factor between where we are this year and where we think we are from a run rate.\nBrent Thill: Great. Thank you\nNeil Hunn: Yes.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, I wanted to pick off on the last answered and maybe contextualize a bit more the outlook specifically for Application Software. Appreciate the comments on subdued activity with large accounts. Do you happen to maybe have the trend in Enterprise bookings and then any other forecasting considerations to call out, because I guess I'm trying to reconcile the good step up at year end against the mid-single outlook, but that might just be related to the planning kind of assumptions you just mentioned, Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I think the step up at the year, I mean Deltek was strong in Q4. And it's one data point. The pipeline looks attractive. The pipeline for Frontline looks attractive at both the Enterprise and SMB portion of their business, but we've been through the better part of three, four quarters where the Enterprise activity was slow and we're just not going to underwrite that in our guidance at the moment.\nJason Conley: In terms of Enterprise bookings, they were up low single digits, which is consistent for the full-year this year and sort of consistent with what we've said all year long around -- around just lower activity at the Enterprise level\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, great. And then I wanted to ask, there is some exogenous events like you mentioned Foundry. I think they communicated that they are now exclusively subscriptions here in 2024. You also have a lot of other businesses that have big on-prem maintenance streams that can get a multiplier over time. So there's things that are hurting and helping I suppose. Do you have a sense on a blended and net basis what this might be contributing to the model in 2024? And when you think about growth improving from the 7% to 7.5% range, what these types of items might ultimately mean over the next couple of years?\nJason Conley: So I can take the first part of that, Joe, and then maybe Neil can take the second. So in terms of the Application Software, we still expect it to be strong in mid singles. I think nonrecurring revenue will still kind of be flattish. We still expect that sort of shift to SaaS to continue and that's kind of been a small headwind for us throughout in the last couple years, but it's been overcome by the things we talked about, which was Enterprise bookings, which we didn't get-in '23. So, again, recurring is going be strong. Nonrecurring will be flattish. If Deltek picks up in '24, especially in the large GovCon Enterprise, there could be upside in the year because a lot of those customers are still buying on-premise licenses. So that could be an opportunity, but we didn't bake any of that into our guidance. And then when we look at Network, recurring will clearly be down low-single digits just based on DAT & Loadlink, at least based on our current assumptions. And to your point, I think nonrecurring will be fairly muted as well because we'll still be -- will be at the last point of that conversion of Foundry off license to subscription. So they didn't -- they didn't mandate that in '23. They will mandate in '24, so we'll be digesting that last piece there. And then on the 7%, Neil...\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I think just more longer-term on the SaaS migration. We have a little bit over $900 million and an on-premise maintenance. That -- as that converts, it converts -- is our recent history, the last two or three or four years it is north of two times on an ARR basis as it converts from on-premise maintenance to SaaS and cloud. So when we do that, it's actually going -- we believe historically it's been a bit of a net growth driver. While we might -- we will convert perpetual licenses which are end period one-time revenue to SaaS and that's a classic J-curve. The companies that are undergoing this transition, we're going to convert this $900 plus million of maintenance at a clip that will overwhelm that J-curve effect. So we believe it's a net growth driver. Foundry is a bit unique, in that they are making a, just a -- almost like a day-one pivot and their business model shift, and the other companies are doing more of a migratory approach\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That's all helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: An our next question today comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to turn to tech-enabled products. Obviously, a strong year. As we think about that guide, Neptune and Verathon are certainly big components of that growth. Does that kind of diverge to some extent as one start to appease the other, it seems like there's a lot of development at Verathon that can drive some of that. Just any thoughts there?\nNeil Hunn: So I mean both, and as we talked about, both Neptune and Verathon were just great. And last year both grew faster than the segment. Obviously, they are a predominant element of the segment. We believe that the long-term growth rate at Neptune is probably in the high single digits area. And we believe that the long-term organic growth rate of Verathon is probably a bit higher than that. It's -- we want -- we want to believe that it's going to be a low double digits. We want to see a couple more years of that, some more R&D productivity. We're super encouraged by the pipeline of R&D and the momentum they have in the market across the three product categories. So that's where we expect the long-term growth rates to be there.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then just following up on the M&A side of things, leverage at 3 times, obviously strong cash flow generator. But it sounds like the pipeline is incredibly active with quality transactions. What's the comfort level in terms of going above that range? Is there a way to think through that, just any thoughts? Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: Yes, I mean, we're always -- our long-term policy is between 3 times to 3.5 times. If you look back to 2015, '16, you can never be right at that level, some you go above it and come below it. It's always this this process and where do you draw a line through those swings. We're going to just -- we're business model pickers. As you know, we're going to continue to look for the very best businesses at the most attractive valuations that meet all of our criteria, and then we'll look for the best way to finance those from that point. We certainly understand, I think acutely risk, both risk in the businesses, risk in the capital structure, and that's a big part of how we think about deploying capital and how we value assets.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nChristopher Glynn: I had a question about the TEP segment. So you commented on the supply chain issues from the last couple of years are resolved. So curious if you are seeing some nice benefits emerge from production planning and if that drive some natural margin and productivity tailwinds that we should see in the margins in 2024?\nNeil Hunn: Well, I think scaling certainly helps. We've added a fair amount of capacity at Neptune. We've added supplier capacity at Verathon. We've added supplier capacity at the rf IDEAS -- the RF products businesses. And certainly were not the similar for most companies. The supply chain operations teams are going from a -- from a model that was focused in the last three or four years on resiliency to maybe a more balanced between resiliency and sort of just-in-time, which certainly will help with inventory turns and asset velocity. So we do think there's a little bit of money trapped in inventory for us, so will be more of working capital advantage if we can execute on that plan. In terms of margins, I'll look to Jason. I think it's probably more just scaling infrastructure. I mean, what we -- our cost of goods is so low relative to industrial type companies that the input cost are a fraction of the cost structure of our Enterprise, but your thoughts about that?\nJason Conley: Yes, no, I think we'll have leverage that, that will be a little bit above what the EBITDA margin is for the business. I mean, you do have some of the growth that we're seeing is in single-use products, which are great because they have a lot of recurring revenue -- reoccurring revenue. But they come at a little bit of a lower margin. And then when Neptune grows, it has a little bit of impact to the segment too. So, I would expect leverage to be consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years just based on those factors.\nChristopher Glynn: Great, thanks. And then about the aspiration to 8% to 9% organic growth and driving things higher, certainly understand you have a lot of coordination of experts and best practices across the enterprise. What would you characterize this top of the list businesses with particular action plan opportunities in that respect?\nNeil Hunn: So, we appreciate the question, right? So we started this portfolio of 5% to 6% growth. We're in a point of, we think 7% to 7.5% on the way to 8% to 9%. So we've made a fair amount of progress over the last four or five years. It's less about which company. It's more about the process and discipline across all 27, now going into 28 companies. And you've heard us talk about this on repeat in the past, but it's just if anything were consistent. So it's about how do each of our businesses design a strategy in terms of where to play and how to win, and where they have the right to win for durable long-term growth. The second thing is, then how do you process enables the execution of that strategy so that you're on repeat. We can use our long-term forever ownership period as a long-term competitive advantage. So as we stack capabilities that become enduring, then we can outpace our competitors. And then third, is how do we run a talent offense, where we use talent as a long-term competitive advantage. We've talked a lot about the upgrade at the field leadership level over the last three or four years. The expectation for performance is much higher, much, much higher. The alignment of our compensation is tighter to that expectation. And so it's all three acting in unison, that you get the Verathon's that a decade ago were low-single digit growers and now hopefully low double-digit growers. You take businesses like Deltek, they have the mid and they come solidly mid-plus or maybe they can inch in the high singles over time. So it's about every business doing a little bit better on a sustainable basis.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks, Neil.\nNeil Hunn: You bet.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hi guys, good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nJoe Giordano: Hi, like, on DAT, obviously the free market is weak. Can you just -- I know we've talked about that relationship Kind of being somewhat inverse in weak markets where they actually tend to do better. Is that -- like just to put a finer point on that. Is that more like on negative inflections in the market where it kind of spikes and then if it's like prolong weakness, that it ultimately is forced to like trickle into DAT? is that how we should really think about that?\nNeil Hunn: So DAT dynamics are a little bit different than what you described. DAT is when the freight markets are very strong, DAT grows in-line or maybe ahead of that strength. When the freight markets are weaker, they tend to slow down and then they sort of -- so therefore if you looked at their growth, it's more like stairstep type growth in this particular case, because we're coming off such a search for a couple of three years, it's a little bit more exaggerated. The dynamic that you're describing perfectly describes our ConstructConnect business, which is the construction analytics business, where -- when you think about building product manufacturers and contractors and subcontractors, subscribed or content about what commercial real estate buildings are in the process of being planned and built, they want to look for where their next jobs are going to come from. So in the construction markets, real estate markets are white hot and contractors are fully subscribed years out. You the value of our information is less when the market slows and their backlog is standing, then the value of what we offer is much higher. So we tend to have a little bit of a countercyclical sort of demand driver inside the ConstructConnect. We go by the way, Matt and his team for their ConstructConnect are working to balance out and have done a good job. So hopefully the go-forward will be up in up that markets and up-and-down markets. But that's the -- that's what our product strategy is trying to execute.\nJoe Giordano: That's good color. Just a -- like a broader question. Obviously, we're getting like more-and-more layoff announcements, like I guess that companies across the spectrum from tech to UPS. So how are you guys, like in your discussions with your customers. And what's the most recent kind of read they're having on where head count stands and what the implications are for your businesses there that somewhat dependent on that?\nNeil Hunn: I think unfortunately our read across the macro market is in a great win, right, because we operate at these relatively insulated end-markets, government contractors, property and casualty insurance, or brokerages where employment is higher, life insurance where employment is higher, healthcare where employment is higher, education where employment seems stable if not higher, right? We're in the sort of relatively isolated protected end-markets where the macro swings aren't -- don't impact that much. It doesn't have that much impact on the way we drive compliance bookings across our portfolio. I will say for labor market generally loosening up. It's been advantageous for us. We're also been able to not just fully staff at our business level, but use this opportunity to last probably 12 months plus to significantly upgrade talent across the organization.\nJoe Giordano: Fair enough. Thanks, guys\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist. Please go ahead\nTerry Tillman: Yes. Can you all hear me okay?\nNeil Hunn: Hi, Terry. Good morning\nTerry Tillman: Hi, good morning, everyone, and thanks for fitting me in as well. Maybe just one question for you. I guess it's for you, Neil, is what we've seen with our vertical SaaS companies and even horizontal SaaS companies in the past, when they get those customers on the new modern architecture, it really can start to reduce the friction to buy those other add-on modules. And so what I'm curious about is, you just called out some of your businesses in the past like Deltek that have seen improving growth. Anything you can share around net revenue retention from those customers that move to cloud? And I know it's still early days, but is there a propensity to buy those add-on modules? Does it speed up? Does it quick in? And that's just one of these things that could be a cumulative benefit over time, and also help on that organic growth. And then I had a follow-up\nNeil Hunn: Super. Appreciate that question. The short answer is categorically yes. And we see that -- first when you when you do the lift and shift from a legacy product to the current cloud-delivered product, there is a -- there is migratory benefits as we talked about Strata as a good example. Same-store sales, 2 to 2.5 times uplift. But then while they're doing that, the checkbooks open and they buy more modules at that moment where total ARR goes up over 3 times and they lift and shift their customer base. Same can be said, saw a different metrics, Aderant, Vertafore, etc. And so, what you're talking about is one of the principal benefits both to the customer and to us, our companies for delivering cloud-delivered, SaaS deliver software, which is being able to be on the most recent release. So, be able to take advantage of all the R&D innovation and more easily be able to take additional products because the delivery mechanism is faster and the implementations are more smooth. So you're exactly right , we're seeing it across the portfolio and expect to see a lot more of that in the years to come.\nTerry Tillman: That's great. I appreciate that. And I guess just a follow-up question. And I know you want to be careful and not revealing too much. But if the M&A environment does start opening up more and there's more shots on goal and just more things that are interesting, albeit, taking into account your discipline, I'm curious just bigger-picture, usually it's vertical SaaS, but what about interesting niche horizontal SaaS solutions? Whether it's back-office or kind of middle office or front office and/or second secondarily the idea of maybe software companies with a meaningful payments business. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: So, as we always said we're going to be business model pickers. The reason, historically we've been attracted to vertical, small market verticalized software businesses is because the basis of competition needs to be able to be understood and observed. We want to be able to compete based on both the value proposition of the product but also the intimacy with the customer and the customer relationship. The vast majority of our companies. Their customers want us to win, right, that we are so integral to what they do, they want us to win there always giving us input and feedback about how to be better how to deliver more value to them. And so it's those dynamics that we look for. There were certainly some nichey horizontal type things that meet those criteria, but not a lot. Right. A lot of the horizontal have gigantic TAM to compete on the base of an algorithm. There's very little loyalty to the company. So those types of things will never invested in. Relative to your comment about. Payments business models are we have a variety of business models, software, there's on-prem their SaaS. We just bought a business that is the integration of SaaS, software and payments. Where you have deep embedded integration with what the company does and products do with the payment stream. And so it's a business model , we're open-minded to the business model construct as long as there is immense amount of durability embedded in the business model.\nTerry Tillman: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexander Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go-ahead. Good morning, thanks. May I have some questions on. Broker. And. The first one is\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alexander Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead\nAlexander Blanton: Good morning, thanks. May I have some questions on. Broker. And. The first one is. You've indicated that is not accretive to. Adjusted EPS. Well, this year. Yes, and if not, then there is some dilution. How much is that you might have mentioned that earlier, I might not have caught it\nJason Conley: Yes, hi, Alex, it's Jason. So we assume around 75 million of EBITDA. And then the interest is going to be. 1.6 billion at, Call-IT, 6%, which is our revolver, our current revolver rate. And so that's how you get to your calendar dilution number. What is that number in EPS. $0.10 to $0.15\nAlexander Blanton: Okay. So that accounts. For the shortfall. And. In the. Guidance versus consensus tender. Did you say $0.10 to $0.15. Per diluted, okay. Now going-forward, if you're. Growing at double-digits. Mid-teens. That implies you're going to get some pretty. Good. Accretion. In 2025, correct\nJason Conley: Absolutely, yes. We're looking for. Is it the accretion after 24 and it will come to like said it's grown mid-teens. Very good cash conversion dynamics. Have a little bit of a tax benefit this year and next year. And couple of years out after that. So, feeling good about. Contribution to our, to our growth going-forward\nAlexander Blanton: Now can you give us an idea of what. The total available market is in their business. And I assume it's all domestic. At this point. And how do they look compared with that. In other words, what's your market-share or approximate. I mean I just. I understand that the leading provider, but it looks like it might be a fragmented market\nJason Conley: So the TAM today is about $750 million. It's growing about 10% a year. Yes. So you can do the math on what we said that's in the next 12 months-to March 25, it's 260, so you've got to grow the market at 10%, do the math. On their current market-share and their relative market-share position. So, their size relative to their next largest competitor is about 1.5 times. The market we would characterize as having a number of legacy technology players and pro care and the principal competitor are generally re-platforming. The market from a technology perspective\nAlexander Blanton: Okay. Finally. In that market. There are different sizes to the. The. Groups that you might be. Serving there are nursery schools, for example, that have several 100. Students. And there are small ones that are much smaller. Where do you fit-in that. Do you are you aiming at the. Or serving the smallest schools as a larger ones or both\nNeil Hunn: Really appreciate the opportunity to address this question, because one of the aspects of the business that we like quite a bit. So. The way that we segment the market are basically, enterprise, mid and single operators. So 10-plus centers, one to 10 centers and a single operator center. Pro is the demonstrable leader relative market-share advantaged substantially higher than the 1.5 times at both the enterprise and the mid. And the growth rates and the enterprise and the mid is actually growing faster than the overall market. So the markets the segments where broker also is highly compete very well in the single operator. I don't want to. Comment on that. They compete very effectively there as well. But the strongest and have the largest market-share in the enterprise and mid, which means that as the market consolidates ever so slowly over-time that accretes to our advantage\nAlexander Blanton: Okay. And finally, is there any foreign business there available, or are you looking to get into that or not\nNeil Hunn: Yes. International is not a meaningful part of the business today. It is certainly something that we will consider in the long-term strategic outlook for the business, but not something and probably the near-term because there's so much opportunity domestically to get after.\nAlexander Blanton: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nNeil Hunn: I appreciate the questions and have a great one.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks\nZack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We look-forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our quite good 2023 fourth quarter and full-year results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 5, let's look at today's agenda. This morning, I'll start by walking through our full-year highlights and then we'll turn to commenting on our most recent acquisition, Procare Solutions. Jason will then go through our quarterly results, both in aggregate and at the segment level, share our annual results and review our strong balance sheet position, then I'll pick up and discuss our segment level annual results, our 2024 outlook, wrap up, and turn to your questions. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the two key takeaways for today's call are; first, we delivered a very strong 2023; and second, we remain well-positioned and are carrying positive momentum into 2024. As we look back on the full-year, we're proud of what the organization accomplished. From a financial perspective, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth, with free cash flow margins at 32%. Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned with 8% organic revenue growth. Jason will cover this in a few minutes, but Q4 was strong as well with 13% total revenue growth and 8% organic revenue growth. Also during the year, we deployed $2.1 billion in the high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. As we all know, last year was a challenged year relative to available acquisition opportunities, given that I'm super-proud of our team's ability to grind through the market conditions and successfully convert two outstanding value-creation M&A opportunities. Given all this, we entered this year with positive momentum. We continue to see strong demand for our mission-critical solutions. As a reminder, each of our businesses is a leader in their respective market and delivers system of record, network critical or vital and-or lifesaving technologies. As a result, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions. Also as we head into 2024, we have meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions, Syntellis, Replicon, and Procare. It is important to highlight these additions to our portfolio of businesses also improved the underlying quality of our enterprise in terms of reoccurring revenue mix and organic growth profile. Finally, we continue to be very active in the M&A market, in environment that we expect to be notably improved in 2024 with a strong balance sheet and a large pipeline of attractive opportunities. So, a strong '23 and solid momentum both organic and inorganic behind us as we enter 2024. Now please turn to the next page, Page 6, where I will discuss our most recent acquisition, Procare Solutions. Procare Solutions is a fantastic addition to the Roper portfolio. Let's start with the fundamentals. We're paying $1.75 billion net of $110 million tax benefit for the business. We expect Procare to contribute about $260 million of revenue and $95 million of EBITDA for the 12 months ended Q1 '25. Procare will be accretive to our free cash flow in '24 and to our adjusted DEPS in '25. We will fund the acquisition with a portion of our $3.5 billion revolver, and we'll report Procare in our Application Software segment and expect the deal to close this quarter. Procare meets all our longstanding acquisition criteria, leader in a smaller market, delivers mission-critical verticalized software solutions, competes based on customer intimacy, operates in asset-light business model, and is led by a skilled passionate leadership team. What' incrementally different for us is the maturing leader nature of this company. As we outlined during our Investor Day last year, our corporate strategy leans on implementing two modest improvements. First, continue to improve our long-term sustainable organic growth rate. And second, capture more value from our capital appointment capacity. Relative to additional capital deployment value capture, we are focusing on doing a higher proportion of bolt-on activity as evidenced by last year's capital deployment records and adding higher-growth or maturing leader business profiles to our enterprise. Procare is a prototypical maturing leader archetype, meeting all our longstanding criteria that I mentioned above, but as structurally faster growth business that possesses the opportunity to improve margins as the top-line scales. For Procare, we expect mid-teens top-line growth with improving margins from an already strong position for the years to come. Let's talk about what the company does. Procare is the leading provider of mission-critical and purpose-built software to 37,000 owners and operators of early childhood education centers which they used to run their business. The software provides all the needed functionality to run the childcare center ranging from parents and family engagement, staff and teachers scheduling, classroom management, tuition billing and payment processing. The market itself is quite attractive. And in the midst of a long-term secular tailwind of young dual income families seeking higher levels of early childhood education versus daycare. In addition, like most industries, this one is undergoing long-term tech-enablement. Given these factors, this market is growing annually in the low double digits area. As mentioned, Procare is the leading player with a 1.5 times through all their market-share advantage in this space given their super compelling value proposition that combines both software and the integrated payment capabilities. Given this, Procare has very high gross retention and compelling net retention as well. Finally, from a extensive due diligence of the business, we are encouraged by the fact that Procare has multiple strategic and operating pathways available to deliver mid-teens growth and long-term margin expansion. Net-net, this is a highly compelling value creation opportunity for Roper, and our shareholders. And to Joanne, your leadership team and all the Procare family, welcome to Roper. So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you so you can walk-through our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as our very strong financial position. Jason? Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 12, let's look-back on the year for our Application Software segment. Total revenues grew 21% and organic revenues grew 6% to $3.19 billion, while EBITDA margins remained strong at 43.7%. Within the segment, results were consistent with strength at Deltek, Aderant, Vertafore, Strata and Frontline. Deltek continued to see strong gains in our SaaS solutions, especially in the private sector markets. As discussed throughout the year, the GovCon market was tempered given all the uncertainty regarding government spending, notwithstanding Deltek delivered mid-single-digit organic growth for the year. In addition, they continue to innovate and add capabilities during times of uncertainty, which is a hallmark of Roper strategy, highlighted by the bolt-ons of Replicon and ProPricer. ProPricer, a smaller transaction about $80 million purchase price that closed late last year and delivers the leading contract pricing solutions and software for government contractors and federal agencies, an ideal strategic fit for Deltek's cost point product family. Aderant was just amazing last year. They had record bookings and significant adoption of their anchor SaaS solutions and add-on products. Also, Aderant is one of the leaders within Roper and the legal software market as it relates to productizing generative AI solutions within their product stack. Great job by Chris, Rossi, and the entire team at Aderant. Continuing on, Vertafore was solid with strong ARR gains throughout the year. Additionally, Vertafore made great strides with our product strategy deployment and the MGA systems bolt-on is trending well-ahead of our investment case. Strata also was quite good last year, both in terms of organic ARR gains, and their acquisition and integration work associated with Syntellis. Finally, Frontline executed well, delivering strong retention and cash flow during the year. As I mentioned earlier, we will report Procare solutions in this segment and expect the deal to close this quarter. As it relates to our 2024 outlook for this segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Please turn with us to Page 13. Full-year organic revenue for our Network segment grew 5% to $1.44 billion and margins were strong at 55.2%. We'll start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which both grew in the year despite the year long muted freight market conditions. Similar to that of Deltek, both businesses continue to innovate during the sluggish market with particularly interesting Gen AI innovations at DAT to help combat industry fraud. Pipeline delivered record bookings and had very strong customer retention and expansion activity, leading to strong ARR growth. Foundry, our post-production media and entertainment software business muscled through the year given the writers and actors strikes and made meaningful progress in the transition to a full subscription revenue model. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong throughout the year as census levels and senior care facilities improved. As it relates to our full-year 2024 guide for the segment, we expect to see low-single digit organic revenue growth based on the expectation of continued muted freight market conditions, but with continued strong EBITDA margin performance. Now please turn to Page 14 and let's review our TEPs segment's results. Organic revenues for the year grew 15% to $1.55 billion and EBITDA margins remain consistent at 35.3%. As we look back over the year, we entered the year with a high degree of supply-chain uncertainty. During the year, the vast majority of these uncertainties are resolved and our business has done a tremendous job of capturing the opportunity. As we exit '23 and look to '24, we do not see meaningful supply chain constraints. As usual, we'll start with Neptune, our water meter and technology business. Neptune was just great and continues to see strong demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters, and increasing adoption of their meter meter data management software. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete. Verathon was awesome as well for the year. Verathon was strong across all three of their product families, ultrasonic, bladder volume measurement, video-assisted intubation and single-use Bronchoscopy. As. As a reminder Verathon's reoccurring single-use offerings now make up about 55% of the business' annual revenue stream. Just an amazing product and business execution journey to both scale and improve the underlying quality of the business. Finally, our RF product businesses, Inovonics and rf IDEAS did a terrific job managing through their supply chain challenges and delivered very strong 2023 financial performance. Looking to our 2024 guidance for this segment, we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for the full-year, and the expectation that Q1 will grow in the mid-teens area. Now please turn with us to Page 16. This morning, we're establishing our 2024 full-year and first quarter guidance. For the full-year, which includes the impact of Procare solutions, we expect to see total revenue growth between 11% and 12%. On an organic basis, we expect to see full-year 2024 revenue grow between 5% and 6%. And finally, we expect to see full-year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $17.85 - $18.15, which includes about $0.10 to $0.15 of DEPS dilution associated with the Procare deal. Assumed in this guidance, the tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. We want to take a moment, set our guide in context of our long-term strategy and execution model. To remind everyone, historically we operate at a 5% to 6% organic growth portfolio. Our strategy and ambition to structurally improve organic growth rate to be in the 8% to 9% area. Over the last three years, we grew 8%, 9% and 8% on an organic basis. So these years were benefited to some extent from certain market conditions. As such, our view is our current course and speed of organic growth rate is in the 7% to 7.5% area. We are very pleased with our progress to date and continue to work to achieve organic growth aspirations. As it relates to organic revenue outlook for '24, we enter the year mindful of two factors; continued subdued large customer activity in our Application Software segment and our freight matching businesses within our Network segment being below trend based on our expectations for continued muted freight market conditions. As it relates to the first quarter, we expect to see adjusted DEPS in the range of $4.30 and $4.34. Now please turn with us to Page 17, and then we'll look-forward to your questions. As per our custom, we'll will conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. One, we delivered another great year performance. And two, we have continued positive momentum heading into 2024. Relative to 2023s performance, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth, with free cash flow margins also at 32%. Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned by 8% organic revenue growth. Importantly, free cash flow was growing 16% on a three-year compounded basis and we delivered our first-ever quarter of a $1 billion of software recurring and reoccurring revenues, quite an important milestone for enterprise. In addition, we deployed $2.1 billion towards high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-ons of Syntellis and Replicon, and year we're deploying capital was structurally challenged and we did so at very compelling values, leading the strong value creation for shareholders. As we enter 2024, we do so with strong momentum. We continue to see robust demand for our mission-critical solutions, a strong outlook for organic growth. Also, you can count on Roper to improve the underlying business quality as we scale our enterprise. Adding to the momentum for the year are the contributions from our 2023 acquisition cohort and last week's announcement of Procare Solutions. Finally, we are well-positioned to continue our capital deployment execution. We remain very active in the M&A market and environment that expect to be notably improved in 2024. We do this with a strong balance sheet, a large pipeline of attractive opportunities and unwavering levels of patience and discipline. Now as we turn to your questions and if you can flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel. We'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve the organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow in the mid-teens area over the long arc of time . So with that, thank you for your continued interest in Roper, and let's open it up to your questions. Good morning, Deane. Yes, so I think -- first, appreciate the comments on Procare. I think there's like 80,000 five-star ratings in the app store. So your colleagues are a couple of many about the liking the application and the engagement with their kids in their early childhood education centers. Relative to the question about the IPO is a competitor, I mean maybe on some transactions, but most of what we're going to look at are going to be sub-scale for the IPO market. The TAM here is sub $1 billion, that's not a very IPO-able type market. So this is again small market leader. The market is growing low-double digits that we talked about, which underpins the mid-teens growth rate we're underwriting to hear. In terms of valuation in multiples, I think we're just in a world where sellers, especially private equity sellers understand the cost of capital, where the world is. They have constraints from their LPs. They need to get liquidity back to them. They can't raise new funds without it. And so, I mean, it's hard to guess with this asset would have traded for 12 months to 18 months ago, but substantially -- substantially higher on a multiple basis. So we think for the moment the valuations are coming to us because of the market for us that we just talked about. I think Procare is like a perfect example by earlier stage, right? So these are not early-stage companies. They are earlier than what we've typically acquired in the past. So they meet all of our criteria. I have to emphasize that every time we talk about maturing leaders. So it's a leader in a small market. The base, the competition is understood and observable in the marketplace. The relative market share advantage this company has is particularly interesting. So those are common traits of everything we've always acquired. In this case, the market is growing a little bit faster and the underlying business model -- margins are going to scale as the business grows. So that's the earlier part of what we're talking about. Historically, we would have maybe waited by Procare until the next trade, the one after, the one that just occurred. And so when we look at the model of this over a long arc, it's just much more value for our shareholders to do this type of transaction. In terms of the pipeline, it is as Jason said in his comments, as I said in my comments, just a noticeable change in activity since our last call in the marketplace for some of the reasons that we talked about, and it's a variety of opportunities. I mean, we know we're leaning into doing more bolt-ons, so there's a fair amount of bolt-on activity in there. That's a lot of what Jan and her team are working to build, and then there's a fair number of these emerging, maturing leader, excuse me, maturing leader type profiles and will just ask them, we'll be patient and disciplined to figure out the right ones for us. Thank you. I'll take the first to that and then ask Jason if he wants to add any color. So you're right, the call -- I mean the principal driver of the growth rates in this range for '24 is DAT & Link and freight matching businesses. Foundry had, as we talked about, had a tough '23 with the actors and writers strike. On top of that, they started that migration to a full subscription model. And so, '24 will be a bit muted for Foundry as well, but that's a small relative to the impact of DAT and the Canadian Freight Match businesses. We've assumed sort of muted conditions throughout the whole year. There certainly are market prognosticators that are suggesting a second-half pickup. We've not assumed that in our model. We want to see it before we load it in, and that's our core assumption relative to the Freight Match businesses hitting that. Sure. I mean it's -- I'll just comment and share a few of the thoughts, we said in the prepared remarks, right? So the our long-term aspirations are to grow organically in that 8% to 9% range and we believe we have the possibility to do that. It's going to take a few more years to get into that run-rate. That's the aspiration of what we're all working towards both in the group executives and all the operating teams across the company. As you know, the last three years there was an 8%, 9%, 8% throughout that whole period of time. We said those were benefited by some market tailwinds, some back from the pandemic, you know, a raging freight market, things like that. Supply chain sort of bottlenecks and releases. And that was sort of in the last three years. So as we look at this year compared to history and then also, or the possible in the arc, we think our current course and speed is in the 7% to 7.5% range organic growth through all that noise. So as we compare, we're doing in '24 against all that, it really is two simple reconciling factors. One is, we just talked about in the last question. The freight markets being slow. Our expectation for them to be slow throughout the whole year. And as we talked about for a few quarters last year in our Application Software segment, there was notably less large customer activity, like enterprise class customer activity. Deltek, a little bit, we talked about Frontline. A little bit of smaller business called Data Innovations, which all makes sense. The large companies anticipating a slowdown. They just got cautious in their buying behavior. The good news is, Deltek ended Q4 with a fair amount of momentum. I think they're up low-double-digit, either high single low-double digits in the quarter. So they exited with a fair amount of momentum, it's one data point. We want to see a few of those thrown together. And so we're -- those are the two reconciling items, the freight slowdown, expectation slowdown in large activity in Application. That's embedded in our model and those are reconciling factors between last year and where we are this year and also pretty much a reconciling factor between where we are this year and where we think we are from a run rate. Yes. Yes. I think the step up at the year, I mean Deltek was strong in Q4. And it's one data point. The pipeline looks attractive. The pipeline for Frontline looks attractive at both the Enterprise and SMB portion of their business, but we've been through the better part of three, four quarters where the Enterprise activity was slow and we're just not going to underwrite that in our guidance at the moment. Yes. I think just more longer-term on the SaaS migration. We have a little bit over $900 million and an on-premise maintenance. That -- as that converts, it converts -- is our recent history, the last two or three or four years it is north of two times on an ARR basis as it converts from on-premise maintenance to SaaS and cloud. So when we do that, it's actually going -- we believe historically it's been a bit of a net growth driver. While we might -- we will convert perpetual licenses which are end period one-time revenue to SaaS and that's a classic J-curve. The companies that are undergoing this transition, we're going to convert this $900 plus million of maintenance at a clip that will overwhelm that J-curve effect. So we believe it's a net growth driver. Foundry is a bit unique, in that they are making a, just a -- almost like a day-one pivot and their business model shift, and the other companies are doing more of a migratory approach So I mean both, and as we talked about, both Neptune and Verathon were just great. And last year both grew faster than the segment. Obviously, they are a predominant element of the segment. We believe that the long-term growth rate at Neptune is probably in the high single digits area. And we believe that the long-term organic growth rate of Verathon is probably a bit higher than that. It's -- we want -- we want to believe that it's going to be a low double digits. We want to see a couple more years of that, some more R&D productivity. We're super encouraged by the pipeline of R&D and the momentum they have in the market across the three product categories. So that's where we expect the long-term growth rates to be there. Yes, I mean, we're always -- our long-term policy is between 3 times to 3.5 times. If you look back to 2015, '16, you can never be right at that level, some you go above it and come below it. It's always this this process and where do you draw a line through those swings. We're going to just -- we're business model pickers. As you know, we're going to continue to look for the very best businesses at the most attractive valuations that meet all of our criteria, and then we'll look for the best way to finance those from that point. We certainly understand, I think acutely risk, both risk in the businesses, risk in the capital structure, and that's a big part of how we think about deploying capital and how we value assets. Good morning. Well, I think scaling certainly helps. We've added a fair amount of capacity at Neptune. We've added supplier capacity at Verathon. We've added supplier capacity at the rf IDEAS -- the RF products businesses. And certainly were not the similar for most companies. The supply chain operations teams are going from a -- from a model that was focused in the last three or four years on resiliency to maybe a more balanced between resiliency and sort of just-in-time, which certainly will help with inventory turns and asset velocity. So we do think there's a little bit of money trapped in inventory for us, so will be more of working capital advantage if we can execute on that plan. In terms of margins, I'll look to Jason. I think it's probably more just scaling infrastructure. I mean, what we -- our cost of goods is so low relative to industrial type companies that the input cost are a fraction of the cost structure of our Enterprise, but your thoughts about that? So, we appreciate the question, right? So we started this portfolio of 5% to 6% growth. We're in a point of, we think 7% to 7.5% on the way to 8% to 9%. So we've made a fair amount of progress over the last four or five years. It's less about which company. It's more about the process and discipline across all 27, now going into 28 companies. And you've heard us talk about this on repeat in the past, but it's just if anything were consistent. So it's about how do each of our businesses design a strategy in terms of where to play and how to win, and where they have the right to win for durable long-term growth. The second thing is, then how do you process enables the execution of that strategy so that you're on repeat. We can use our long-term forever ownership period as a long-term competitive advantage. So as we stack capabilities that become enduring, then we can outpace our competitors. And then third, is how do we run a talent offense, where we use talent as a long-term competitive advantage. We've talked a lot about the upgrade at the field leadership level over the last three or four years. The expectation for performance is much higher, much, much higher. The alignment of our compensation is tighter to that expectation. And so it's all three acting in unison, that you get the Verathon's that a decade ago were low-single digit growers and now hopefully low double-digit growers. You take businesses like Deltek, they have the mid and they come solidly mid-plus or maybe they can inch in the high singles over time. So it's about every business doing a little bit better on a sustainable basis. You bet. Good morning. So DAT dynamics are a little bit different than what you described. DAT is when the freight markets are very strong, DAT grows in-line or maybe ahead of that strength. When the freight markets are weaker, they tend to slow down and then they sort of -- so therefore if you looked at their growth, it's more like stairstep type growth in this particular case, because we're coming off such a search for a couple of three years, it's a little bit more exaggerated. The dynamic that you're describing perfectly describes our ConstructConnect business, which is the construction analytics business, where -- when you think about building product manufacturers and contractors and subcontractors, subscribed or content about what commercial real estate buildings are in the process of being planned and built, they want to look for where their next jobs are going to come from. So in the construction markets, real estate markets are white hot and contractors are fully subscribed years out. You the value of our information is less when the market slows and their backlog is standing, then the value of what we offer is much higher. So we tend to have a little bit of a countercyclical sort of demand driver inside the ConstructConnect. We go by the way, Matt and his team for their ConstructConnect are working to balance out and have done a good job. So hopefully the go-forward will be up in up that markets and up-and-down markets. But that's the -- that's what our product strategy is trying to execute. I think unfortunately our read across the macro market is in a great win, right, because we operate at these relatively insulated end-markets, government contractors, property and casualty insurance, or brokerages where employment is higher, life insurance where employment is higher, healthcare where employment is higher, education where employment seems stable if not higher, right? We're in the sort of relatively isolated protected end-markets where the macro swings aren't -- don't impact that much. It doesn't have that much impact on the way we drive compliance bookings across our portfolio. I will say for labor market generally loosening up. It's been advantageous for us. We're also been able to not just fully staff at our business level, but use this opportunity to last probably 12 months plus to significantly upgrade talent across the organization. Thank you. Hi, Terry. Good morning Super. Appreciate that question. The short answer is categorically yes. And we see that -- first when you when you do the lift and shift from a legacy product to the current cloud-delivered product, there is a -- there is migratory benefits as we talked about Strata as a good example. Same-store sales, 2 to 2.5 times uplift. But then while they're doing that, the checkbooks open and they buy more modules at that moment where total ARR goes up over 3 times and they lift and shift their customer base. Same can be said, saw a different metrics, Aderant, Vertafore, etc. And so, what you're talking about is one of the principal benefits both to the customer and to us, our companies for delivering cloud-delivered, SaaS deliver software, which is being able to be on the most recent release. So, be able to take advantage of all the R&D innovation and more easily be able to take additional products because the delivery mechanism is faster and the implementations are more smooth. So you're exactly right , we're seeing it across the portfolio and expect to see a lot more of that in the years to come. So, as we always said we're going to be business model pickers. The reason, historically we've been attracted to vertical, small market verticalized software businesses is because the basis of competition needs to be able to be understood and observed. We want to be able to compete based on both the value proposition of the product but also the intimacy with the customer and the customer relationship. The vast majority of our companies. Their customers want us to win, right, that we are so integral to what they do, they want us to win there always giving us input and feedback about how to be better how to deliver more value to them. And so it's those dynamics that we look for. There were certainly some nichey horizontal type things that meet those criteria, but not a lot. Right. A lot of the horizontal have gigantic TAM to compete on the base of an algorithm. There's very little loyalty to the company. So those types of things will never invested in. Relative to your comment about. Payments business models are we have a variety of business models, software, there's on-prem their SaaS. We just bought a business that is the integration of SaaS, software and payments. Where you have deep embedded integration with what the company does and products do with the payment stream. And so it's a business model , we're open-minded to the business model construct as long as there is immense amount of durability embedded in the business model. Really appreciate the opportunity to address this question, because one of the aspects of the business that we like quite a bit. So. The way that we segment the market are basically, enterprise, mid and single operators. So 10-plus centers, one to 10 centers and a single operator center. Pro is the demonstrable leader relative market-share advantaged substantially higher than the 1.5 times at both the enterprise and the mid. And the growth rates and the enterprise and the mid is actually growing faster than the overall market. So the markets the segments where broker also is highly compete very well in the single operator. I don't want to. Comment on that. They compete very effectively there as well. But the strongest and have the largest market-share in the enterprise and mid, which means that as the market consolidates ever so slowly over-time that accretes to our advantage Yes. International is not a meaningful part of the business today. It is certainly something that we will consider in the long-term strategic outlook for the business, but not something and probably the near-term because there's so much opportunity domestically to get after. I appreciate the questions and have a great one."

            "name": "Jason Conley",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Neil. I'll walk-through the enterprise and segment results for Q4, and enterprise results for the full-year along with a review of our balance sheet. Starting with Q4 on Slide 7. We had an excellent finish to a strong year, revenue over $1.6 billion was 13% over prior year, led by 8% organic growth with acquisitions adding four points and less than a point of currency benefit. Organic outperformance was led by our TEP segment, highlighted by Neptune and Verathon. Gross margin of 69.7% was down 30 basis points versus prior year given the higher mix coming from our TEP segment. EBITDA grew 11% to $659 million with EBITDA margin coming in at a solid 40.8%. With the offsetting impact of interest and taxes, this translated into DEPS growth of 11% to $4.37, above our guidance range of $4.28 to $4.32. Also from a cash perspective, free cash flow finished strong at $596 million, up 30% over prior year. This was in-line with our expectations with a good renewal season across our software businesses. We turn to Slide 8, I'll briefly click into the segment performance in Q4. Application Software delivered revenue growth of 15% over prior year to $852 million with organic growth contributing seven points and the balance coming primarily from our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. EBITDA margin of 43.2% in the quarter was below prior year's high watermark of 45.6%, which as we discussed last year, was driven by lower incentive-based compensation. Network Software was up 3% to $363 million with EBITDA up 10% to $208 million. As we have discussed before, our freight matching businesses are navigating a drawdown of carriers, following exceptional marketplace growth over 2021 and 2022, which is mixing down the growth rate for the segment. However, our business leaders DAT and Loadlink have aligned the cost base with reduced carrier subscribers to still drive solid EBITDA growth in the quarter. Our TEP segment grew by 17% in the quarter to $399 million with EBITDA of 13% to a $134 million. Growth was led by exceptional performance at Neptune, with continued increasing demand for ultrasonic technologies and overall favorable market conditions. Also Verathon continued its remarkable growth with strengthened single-use products across Laryngoscopy and Bronchoscopy. EBITDA margin of 33.6% was down from prior year given some one-time investments and incentive compensation in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, I'll walk through our full-year 2023 performance. As Neil just mentioned, revenue was just under $6.2 billion, up 15% over prior year with organic growth of 8% and acquisitions contributing seven points, mainly Frontline and Syntellis. Looking at a three-year revenue CAGR on this slide, similar to 2023, it's also at 15%. Further, the organic -- average organic growth rate over the three-year period has been about 8%. So as Neil mentioned, we benefited from some market conditions over that time period. EBITDA of just over $2.5 billion was up 16% over prior year yielding EBITDA margin of 40.6%. Our three-year EBITDA over this period was also up 16%. So the story remains the same at Roper. We own and continually grow a portfolio of high gross margin businesses and generally convert EBITDA -- growth to EBITDA in the 45% range, which allows for ample investment back into the business for future sustainable growth. Free cash flow for the year was just shy of $2 billion, which represents a 32% margin and is coincidentally up 32% over 2022. Full-year contribution from our Frontline acquisition and excellent performance across the enterprise drove this result, underpinned by strong renewals, favorable DSO and improving inventory turns. Of note, our net working capital as a percent of annualized revenue was negative 19% in Q4 to the new record for Roper. Importantly, over a three-year period, we have compounded cash flow at 16%. Our consistent focus on growing cash flow and the strength of our new portfolio following our divestitures demonstrates a solid base from which to continue our long-term growth algorithm. To that end, we expect free cash flow margin to be 30% or more in 2024. With that, we can flip to Slide 10 to discuss our strong financial position. From a liquidity standpoint, we finished the year with $3.14 billion available on our revolver, with over $200 million of cash. Regarding leverage, we brought down net-debt to EBITDA from 2.7 times at the beginning of 2023, to a year end figure of 2.4 times despite deploying $2.1 billion towards acquisitions. We expect to close on Procare later in Q1 and will utilize our revolver to fund the transaction. So this will be our pro-forma leverage to about 3 times. Our solid balance sheet coupled with strong cash generation gives us capacity to deploy $4 billion or more of capital, while remaining committed to our solid investment-grade rating. Since our October call, deal activity has demonstrably increased with a corresponding lift in asset quality. That said, our market optimism remains balanced by our disciplined process in patient posture. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Neil to talk about our full-year segment performance and the indications for 2024. Neil? I think in this current environment liquidity is really key. So, if you do an IPO, you don't get your liquidity right away. So I think that's pretty important Yes, sure, Julian. So we expect to close in March. That's sort of our assumption right now. So the way that plays out is of the $0.15, maybe $0.02 in the first quarter. So we expect for the calendar year around $75 million of EBITDA. And then we'll obviously from an interest perspective, we'll reload on the revolver, which is going to be at around 6%. And so, and obviously, and so that will cast out through the rest of the year. So that's how you get to your $0.10, $0.15 for the year. In terms of seasonality, not a ton of seasonality for the business. And then, of course, it's growing nicely. So that's sort of works through any aberrations you'd have between quarters In terms of Enterprise bookings, they were up low single digits, which is consistent for the full-year this year and sort of consistent with what we've said all year long around -- around just lower activity at the Enterprise level So I can take the first part of that, Joe, and then maybe Neil can take the second. So in terms of the Application Software, we still expect it to be strong in mid singles. I think nonrecurring revenue will still kind of be flattish. We still expect that sort of shift to SaaS to continue and that's kind of been a small headwind for us throughout in the last couple years, but it's been overcome by the things we talked about, which was Enterprise bookings, which we didn't get-in '23. So, again, recurring is going be strong. Nonrecurring will be flattish. If Deltek picks up in '24, especially in the large GovCon Enterprise, there could be upside in the year because a lot of those customers are still buying on-premise licenses. So that could be an opportunity, but we didn't bake any of that into our guidance. And then when we look at Network, recurring will clearly be down low-single digits just based on DAT & Loadlink, at least based on our current assumptions. And to your point, I think nonrecurring will be fairly muted as well because we'll still be -- will be at the last point of that conversion of Foundry off license to subscription. So they didn't -- they didn't mandate that in '23. They will mandate in '24, so we'll be digesting that last piece there. And then on the 7%, Neil... Yes, no, I think we'll have leverage that, that will be a little bit above what the EBITDA margin is for the business. I mean, you do have some of the growth that we're seeing is in single-use products, which are great because they have a lot of recurring revenue -- reoccurring revenue. But they come at a little bit of a lower margin. And then when Neptune grows, it has a little bit of impact to the segment too. So, I would expect leverage to be consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years just based on those factors. Yes, hi, Alex, it's Jason. So we assume around 75 million of EBITDA. And then the interest is going to be. 1.6 billion at, Call-IT, 6%, which is our revolver, our current revolver rate. And so that's how you get to your calendar dilution number. What is that number in EPS. $0.10 to $0.15 Absolutely, yes. We're looking for. Is it the accretion after 24 and it will come to like said it's grown mid-teens. Very good cash conversion dynamics. Have a little bit of a tax benefit this year and next year. And couple of years out after that. So, feeling good about. Contribution to our, to our growth going-forward So the TAM today is about $750 million. It's growing about 10% a year. Yes. So you can do the math on what we said that's in the next 12 months-to March 25, it's 260, so you've got to grow the market at 10%, do the math. On their current market-share and their relative market-share position. So, their size relative to their next largest competitor is about 1.5 times. The market we would characterize as having a number of legacy technology players and pro care and the principal competitor are generally re-platforming. The market from a technology perspective"

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to page two. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to page three. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indicor, transaction and restructuring-related expenses associated with our completed acquisitions, and lastly, a gain from the sale of non-operating assets. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to page four, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our third quarter results with you this morning, which like each of the first two quarters this year were quite good. As we turn to page four, let's look at today's agenda. As usual, we'll start with the most recent quarter's financial highlights then Jason will discuss our results. After that, we'll turn to our segment specific discussion and wrap up outlining our increased 2023 enterprise guidance. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to page five, the four main takeaways for today's call are first, we continue to perform at a high level operationally, delivering another quarter of very strong financial results, definitively demonstrating the quality of our portfolio of businesses, our leaders and our governance system; second, we continue to be very active on the M&A front, deploying about $2 billion over last quarter; third, we're increasing our full year guidance; and fourth, we remain very well positioned for further disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to the first takeaway, our continued strong performance, we saw total revenue growth 16% and organic revenue growth 6%. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we continue to not only scale our enterprise, but also simultaneously improve as underlying quality and recurring revenue base with organic software recurring revenue growing high single-digits in the quarter. Importantly, the cash. As we've been highlighting throughout the year, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow growing 19% for the most recent TTM period and 77% in the quarter. Turning to our second main takeaway, the deployment of $2 billion over last quarter was led by our acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon, both of which are bolt-ons for Strata and Deltek, respectively. These are each strategically interesting bolt-ons and are highly compelling from a value creation perspective as we're able to buy these businesses for about 14 times next year's EBITDA. More on these in a bit. In addition, in the quarter, we made a $125 million minority investment in Certinia, a professional services automation software business. We're excited to partner with Haveli and General Atlantic Ventures to deploy the value creation thesis associated with this unique opportunity. Third, we're increasing our full year total revenue growth to be 14% plus, increasing our organic revenue growth to be 7% plus and increasing our full year debt guidance to be in the range of $16.62 to $16.66 or up $0.21 at the midpoint versus our previous guidance of $16.36 to $16.50. And fourth, we continue to be very well positioned for further capital deployment by having over $4 billion of M&A firepower. We remain very active in the market as we evaluate and diligence in many attractive opportunities. So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through our third quarter results and our very strong financial position. Jason?\nJason Conley: Thanks, Neil, and good morning to those that have joined our call, and thank you for your interest in Roper. Turning to slide six, I'll take you through our third quarter enterprise results in a bit more detail. Revenue of $1.56 billion was 16% over prior year, with 6% organic growth and a 9% contribution from acquisitions, led by Frontline. As Neil mentioned, organic software recurring revenue growth was in the high single-digit area. This was led by strength in customer expansion and net new logos across our enterprise software businesses. Additionally, our product businesses continued to deliver with 10% organic growth in the quarter, highlighted by Neptune and Verathon. Revenue converted nicely through EBITDA, with EBITDA of $652 million or 18% over prior year. Margin expanded in the quarter to 41.7%, with EBITDA operating leverage of 46%. This all translated to depths of $4.32 versus our guidance of $4.16 to $4.20. Of note, our recent acquisitions had minimal impact on earnings this quarter. We expect DEPS accretion from these deals in 2024 as we pay down the revolver and benefit from full synergy realization. Free cash flow was very strong in the quarter and came in line with our expectations. We generated $625 million of free cash flow, which is up $272 million over prior year. As a reminder, our Frontline business delivers most of its free cash flow in the third quarter. So that, plus a terrific organic contribution drove the significant growth. Looking at cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, as shown on the slide, provides a more relevant comparison. With the frontline renewals tucked into the third quarter, our TTM free cash flow was $1.82 billion, which is up 19% over the prior TTM period. With the expectation for a strong Q4, we're on track to deliver north of 30% free cash flow margins in 2023. Taking a broader view, our TTM free cash flow has compounded 16% over a three-year period, which is in line with EBITDA growth. In summary, our focus on compounding cash flow is evident in our results and will continue to guide us into the future. Next slide on page seven here. Taking a look at our financial position, we ended the quarter with net debt of $6.6 billion, including about $900 million drawn on our revolver. With trailing EBITDA of over $2.4 billion, this leaves us with net leverage of about 2.7 times. Looking forward, we have capacity to deploy $4 billion or more over the foreseeable period even after deploying $2 billion in the third quarter. As always, cash flow growth optimization guides our strategic choices. So while our balance sheet may be primed, we will be disciplined and patient when it comes to capital deployment. To that end, private markets are slowly falling with activity picking up over the last quarter. With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to go through the segment results and outlook. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to page nine. And before we walk through our segment details, we'd like to start with an overview of our acquisition of Syntellis and the combination with our Strata business. To remind everyone, Strata has been part of Roper for eight years as a leader in delivering SaaS-based financial planning, decision support and performance analytics solutions to US hospitals and health systems. Syntellis is a leading provider of SaaS-based enterprise performance management and data solutions to hospitals, higher education and financial institutions. As many of you know, US-based hospitals and health systems continue to face intense pressure from macro market trends, challenges resulting from care setting shifts, reimbursement rates, lagging rising costs and labor staffing issues. The combined Strata and Syntellis business will uniquely be able to help health systems address these difficult financial and operational challenges. Together, the enterprise has relationships with about 70% of the country's health systems. Stand-alone, Syntellis meets all our acquisition criteria, a leader in a niche market, delivers mission-critical application-specific solutions, is an HSD organic growth business and operates an extremely asset-light business model. Taken together with Strata, it only gets more attractive in terms of the combined customer base, the combined product offering, the combined financial profile and the combined future product development opportunities. For 2024, we expect Syntellis to deliver about $185 million of revenue and about $90 million of EBITDA inclusive of cost synergies. Of note, this EBITDA is $5 million higher than at the time of our deal announcement. Considering the $1.25 billion net purchase price, the valuation is about 14 times next year's EBITDA and will only improve from there. Operationally, the teams have moved quite expeditiously and are ahead of schedule relative to the near-term value creation plan, having implemented about 85% of the cost synergy opportunities within the first 45 days. In addition, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Finally, the new combined leadership team headed by Strata's CEO, John Martino, are turning their strategic attention to new combined product development ideas. Net-net, this is a highly compelling value creation opportunity for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, let's now turn to page 10 and walk through our Application Software segment. Third quarter revenues for Application Software segment were $803 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins increased to 44.6% in the quarter. We'll start with Deltek. Deltek was solid in the quarter with sustained momentum in their SMB channel and the private sector solutions. They continue to see sluggish activity in their GovCon Enterprise segment given the backdrop of federal government spending uncertainty. Retention rates across the entirety of Deltek remain high. Importantly, over the last couple of months, Deltek released a Gen AI-enabled data collection capability for the GovWin IQ business, an LLM based processing features for their Vantagepoint product. It's good to see further adoption of Gen AI within the portfolio. Also in the quarter, as we outlined on last quarter's call, Deltek closed the acquisition of Replicon, albeit about a month later than anticipated. To remind you, Replicon is a market-leading timekeeping and workforce management SaaS solution focused on professional services firms and is highly complementary to Deltek's strategy. We continue to expect Replicon to contribute north of $70 million of revenue and $24 million of EBITDA next year. Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms, continues to excel and deliver a very strong quarter. In the quarter, Aderant saw record third quarter bookings and continued success in the adoption and cross-sell of their SaaS solutions. Also and importantly, during the quarter, Aderant continue to mature and gain market traction with their Generative AI-enabler MADDI. Aderant's most recent Gen AI product release enables passive fee earner time entry assistance through Aderant's iTimekeep product line. Great to see this rapid product innovation at Aderant. Vertafore, our software business that tech enables property and casualty insurance agencies continues to be a great business for us with solid performance across our core P&C business and their recent MGA solutions bolt-on. Strata, independent from the Syntellis acquisition was strong in the quarter and continued to gain market adoption of their leading decision support and financial planning solutions. Finally, Frontline had strong customer renewal season and delivered significant cash flow, as Jason mentioned, to the enterprise in the quarter. Looking to the final quarter of the year, we expect to see organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit area for the segment. Turning to page 11. Third quarter revenues for our Network Software segment were $364 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 56.3%. Let's start with our US and Canadian freight matching businesses DAT and Loadlink, both of which grew in the quarter despite the continued challenges across the broader freight and logistics markets. Over the last quarter or two, these businesses have done a fantastic job of baselining their cost structures while continuing to invest in new product development. This led to strong segment margins in the quarter. Relative to product development, and as we highlighted a touch last quarter, DAT launched Gen AI-enabled solutions, among other initiatives targeted to combat freight industry fraud, which is a problem that plagues the entire industry. Within the first month of release, DAT has made a significant dent in fraudulent activity and DAT's customers have noticed and recognized this great accomplishment. This is a shiny example of why and how Roper businesses continue to innovate through and across macroeconomic cycles, which enables us to consistently deliver on market and customer opportunities ultimately leading to market share gains. Turning to our iPipeline. Our network software business that tech enabled the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities. iPipeline continues to execute at a high level and gain market share. In the quarter, they had very nice ARR gains driven by strong retention and customer expansion activity. This growth is directly attributable to iPipeline's strategy that is laser-focused on their core life insurance and annuity customer base. We talked about this concept during our Investor Day earlier in the year. A closely held value of Roper in our businesses is a notion that we compete and win based on customer intimacy. Customer intimacy requires focus and strategic choice. iPipeline over the last two to three years has excelled at this, the concept of focus on the core and choice, which enables further market share gains. Great job, team. Foundry, our media and entertainment postproduction software business continued their business model transition to a subscription model and is ahead of plan in that regard. Though industry demand was temporarily paused given both the Hollywood writers and actor strikes. Notwithstanding, Foundry continues to innovate their product offering and will aggressively compete for customer wallet share in the coming months as the actor Strike results. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid and the business has benefited by having improved census and skilled nursing assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels and patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. For the final quarter of the year, we expect to see low single-digit growth for this segment based on continued challenging freight market conditions and the actor strike impact on foundry. Now let's turn to page 12 and walk through our TEP segment. Revenues in the quarter were $396 million, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were strong at 36.5% in the quarter. We'll start with Neptune, our water meter and technology business. Neptune delivered another fantastic quarter of operational and financial performance. As has been the case for several quarters, Neptune continues to see strong demand and momentum for the residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters and increasing adoption for their meter data management software. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete, given this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles. Verathon was awesome in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth and tremendous operational execution. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across the reoccurring single-use products both Bronchoscope or Bflex and video innovation or GlideScope as well as BladderScan capital purchases. A group of smaller businesses here Inovonics, IPA and rf IDEAS were fantastic as they were last quarter substantially working through a series of nagging supply chain challenges. Relative to the final quarter of the year, we expect to see low double-digit organic growth for this segment. Now please turn to page 14, and let's go through our increased 2023 guidance. Based on our strong third quarter performance, we're raising our full year 2023 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and adjusted debts. For 2023, we now expect total revenue growth to be 14% plus, an increase from about 13% last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full year organic revenue outlook to be in a 7% plus ZIP code an increase from about 7% last quarter and 5% to 6% in our original guide for the year. As a result of our improved revenue outlook, we're increasing our DEPS guidance for the year to be in the range of $16.62 and $16.66 up from our prior guidance of $16.36 to $16.50. Assumed in this guidance is the tax rate trending to the high end of our 21% to 22% range. For the fourth quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $4.28 and $4.32. Now please turn over to page 15 and then we'll look forward to answering your questions. We want to leave you with the same four points with which we started. First, we delivered yet another solid quarter. In the third quarter, revenues increased 16% to $1.56 billion. This growth was underpinned with 6% organic revenue growth and high single-digit organic software recurring revenue growth. In addition, EBITDA margins were notably strong at 41.7% and cash flow was outstanding, growing 77% in the quarter and 19% on a TTM basis. Second, we successfully deployed $2 billion of capital in the quarter, led by the bolt-ons of Syntellis and Replicon. These two deals will deliver about $115 million of EBITDA next year and are priced about 14 times next year's EBITDA, quite compelling. Third, based on the strong quarter performance, the recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers were increasing our full year total and organic revenue growth outlook and increasing our full year DEPS outlook to be between $16.62 and $16.66. And finally, notwithstanding this quarter's $2 billion of deployment, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we've been discussing over the past several quarters, we have a very large pipeline of opportunities, though, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure the continued optimal deployment of our available capital, just as we did with the Syntellis and Replicon acquisitions. We firmly believe that patients as is always the case with capital deployment will be rewarded. Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to share an exciting addition to the Roper executive team. During the quarter, Janet Glazer joined our team and is leading our acquisition cultivation and corporate development outreach efforts. Janet will partner with our M&A resources, our corporate leadership team and several of our business units to increase our forward-leaning posture with private equity sponsors and their businesses. Most recently, Janet was a global sector leader and portfolio manager at Fidelity. We're super excited that Janet has joined our leadership team and welcome aboard. As we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel. We'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy, yet we close our businesses on how to structurally improve their growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focus on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow in the mid-teens area over a long arc of time. So with that, thank you for your continued interest in Roper and let's open it up to your questions.\nOperator: We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to focus on the network software business for a second. One question really trying to put a finer point on how much of a headwind in that Q4 sales guide you have from the freight markets what sort of pace of decline or softness there? And is foundry more of a sort of rear-view month of October type headwind? And then was there anything onetime in the network software margins in Q3 that made them so high?\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Julian. Thanks for the question. So I'll try and take it in reverse order. The margins I tried to cover in my prepared remarks how DAT and Loadlink have just done a great job in Q2 and Q3, aligning the cost structure of where the business is today. And so they're actually a little bit ahead of where they wanted to be in that regard. So that's what drove the margins. Relative to Foundry, it's very much in Q4. I mean, there's still much -- very much is an actor strike for Foundry in post-production. They need content flowing through the pipeline. And right now, writers are writing, but actors aren't acting. The general consensus that will sort of resolve itself in Q4, but one never knows. Then the pipelines will build and sort of leading into maybe the second half of Q1 and Q2, Foundry's demand will sort of get back to normal levels. So it's sort of as a Q3, Q4, maybe Q1 impacting. Relative to DAT and Loadlink, I'll remind just DAT has just been remarkable over the last couple of years. It's really been abnormal growth. It's been exceptional. DAT has a super long history of being very steady and growing. They grew in the quarter. They continued to innovate, you know, in October here. We've seen sort of we're bouncing along the bottom, if you will, maybe a slight uptick in the first handful of weeks in October. Who knows if that sort of started the trend or just some of the yellow sort of, you know, capacity coming into a different part of the market and reshaping. But we expect normal behavior for DAT. It's just we've got to wait about get off the bottom here in terms of the industry freight volumes. Anything you want to add to that, Jason?\nJason Conley: No, I think that's right. I mean, the abnormality, if you do a straight line from 2019, you'd see the business has been up substantially, right? So we have sort of this exceptional growth. A lot of carriers come in the market, they're exiting out. And you know, again, it's just been a good steady growth for us over the last 20 years absent, you know, sort of this exceptional period. And just back on Foundry, I would say that what we've observed is the gross retention of the business has been extremely strong. We have moved to a subscription model this year, and so that gives customers pause on if they get off maintenance, they're going to have to come back on a subscription. So we feel good to once the actor strike is done, that's -- that business is going to pick back up next year, hopefully.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. And then just a quick follow-up. It sounds like Syntellis off to a strong start. But maybe my question on Certinia more, you know, maybe a slightly unusual structure for Roper to go into this minority interest approach, you know, given the attributes when you bring something in-house. So maybe just sort of explain why you went for this structure. And any sense of the scale of Certinia or the size of that business?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. So we're partners with Haveli principally in -- the Haveli partners, we know quite well. It was one of the founders of Vista and then the person who led the tech practice at Bain came together joined Haveli. So the long history of both of them as individuals. They actually approached us to see if we can lend some of our expertise to the situation. So we're intrigued by being able to help. We're intrigued by the value creation opportunity here. It's a very compelling value-creation opportunity. And then we'll also learn a thing or two along the way. I mean, this is a smart group of people that have a long history of doing this type of transaction. It's a unique opportunity, Julian, as you mentioned. We're not looking to do a lot more of things like this. This is not the beginning of like a large book of minority investments. We'll continue to be opportunistic, but it's not going to be anything. It's going to be few and far between in terms of our pacing and volume on this. And the scale, I think we're on at the private business, so we'll sort of keep the scale of the business sort of in the private domain.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nJason Conley: Good morning.\nAllison Poliniak: Going back to the technology-enabled products, it seems like certainly a tick-up in terms of where you were expecting the second half of this year. I know you mentioned Neptune and Verathon. But any specific vertical driving sort of that outperformance in the sector, in the space?\nJason Conley: I think sort of market-based.\nNeil Hunn: Oh, sorry, but you broke up just on the very end there, Allison. So I would say -- so yeah, just to reiterate it, sort of Neptune is, I mean, it is a bit market-based in that, that market continues to be, you know, very healthy. The customers are -- ordering patterns are consistent and robust, lots of backlog carrying into next year. So there's market share gains and product advantage we have and also a cooperative market for sure. You know, with Verathon, the market dynamic is moving towards single-use in the category in bronchoscope from reusables because of infection control. So it's a market that is definitely a growth market that we are very soon to be the number one player in knock on wood, maybe this quarter. And so, that's market related, but just tremendous execution by the team, both go-to-market and product. I mean, tons of product vitality. And then also in the segment, we have a couple -- we mentioned a couple of smaller RF product businesses. That's less market and more just clearing through just a mountain of supply chain problems that plague the businesses for many -- a few quarters. And second quarter and third quarter are great in that regard to those businesses.\nAllison Poliniak: Understood. And then just turning to M&A. You mentioned sort of those private markets starting to fall. Can you maybe -- you know, talk through sort of the multiples that you're starting to see there? Are they as attractive as what we've just seen this past quarter? Or do they still need to come in a little bit here? Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, that's really the question. The -- so this -- it's like a -- the market Jason sort of referred to it as like a coiled spring. I mean, there is a tremendous amount of activity like forming activity, investment bankers, pipelines are filling processes are starting. There's increasing pressure from the LPs onto the sponsors to start thinking about getting some liquidity back to them. The sponsor is starting to think about raising new funds, which they need liquidity to do that. So there's a lot of the precursor activity that is required to see transactions come back into the market. The question still remains about the bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers. Here still -- the number of printed deals to date is still small, right? So this is -- and we anticipate -- well, we know there's going to be more opportunities. We don't yet know where they're going to clear. We continue to be super patient. You know, the market is coming to us. We don't have to chase the market. If we can find very compelling value opportunities like Replicon and Syntellis will do them. If we don't, we'll remain patient.\nAllison Poliniak: Understood. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nJason Conley: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, first, congrats on hiring Janet. I've known her many years. I think she'll be a great addition to the team. So congrats.\nNeil Hunn: Thanks for saying that. We're looking at her, she's sort of an -- she's not on the back script, we're looking at her, and she's a blushing. So she's got to be great as part of the team for sure.\nDeane Dray: That's fabulous. All right. So, first, I wanted to go back more of a macro question. Had there been any changes at the margin and customer decision-making? You know, the pace of new logos, you called out Deltek, which is understandable given their government service side, some of the uncertainties there, but just kind of broad-brush, are you seeing any changes in customer behavior?\nNeil Hunn: So it's played out as we anticipated over the course of the year. It's really been a mixed bag. Just look at one company in Deltek, strong across SMB, both on the government contracting and private sector, professional services markets, strong at the enterprise level for PS, less strong on the government contracting side at the enterprise level. So it really is a mixed bag. In that case, it's less macro related and more tied to the uncertainty around what's happening to the federal government and budgets and what's going on there. You see strength across iPipeline. You see strength at Aderant. Those are very healthy customer bases. So it really is a mixed bag. Obviously, the weakness at DAT given that we just talked about with just where freight markets are, so it's really a collection of bespoke things than it is sort of a broad brush macro across the portfolio.\nDeane Dray: All right. That's good to hear. And then second question on maybe more of an update on Gen AI. It was interesting that you called out several initiatives at the companies are pursuing DAT and Aderant. Are these mostly bottom-up initiatives by the companies? Or is there anything from the headquarter side, maybe you're getting some expertise to help identify opportunities? And you know maybe give us a sense of how penetrated it is today within Roper and what kind of adoption might you see a year from now just to kind of -- it sounds like you're playing more offense here in this and would love some insights. Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: Sure. Yeah. So we're definitely playing offense here. We think this is a transformational technology, right? It's not a trendy paradigm or hyping a fab. We think this is a foundational technology that will change the way we all live our personal lives and this will be conducted over the course of the next five years to 10 years, right? So that's our view on the technology of Gen AI and large language models, et cetera. So what we're doing is really a combination of top-down bottoms-up, if you will. From a top-down perspective, Deane, we've organized -- we deputized, I should say, a couple of our group executives, Satish Maripuri and Mike Corkery, to lead an education series across a variety of topics around Gen AI for our companies. So we've done a series of Zoom meetings, you know, three or four. We've got five or six still to go. They're spaced out every three weeks or four weeks around, that started with what is Gen AI, and it's evolving more and more into how do you deploy methods of deployment, where and how in the organization you deploy it both in productivity and new product ideas. So the hope with that is that it's -- it spurns this creative thinking across the 18,000 people at Roper. Think about how to impact our customers positively, how to impact our operations positively. So ultimately, it will be a bottoms-up, groundswell of ideas, but we're accelerating the learning, if you will. Ultimately, we might do a couple other things that center around, you know, contracts with some of the larger players or deployment models for cybersecurity, and safety and security purposes. But as with Roper, all the good ideas will be generated bottoms-up from the field and the leadership team and the employee base.\nDeane Dray: Great to hear. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Thank you. In the slides, you make the distinction that organic software growth, the recurring software growth that's already in the high single-digits. And then, of course, your reported organic is 5%. I guess the question is that generally going to be the spread you would expect just given professional services and probably license attrition over time? And then is that spread expected to be consistent in the foreseeable future?\nJason Conley: Hey, Joe, it's Jason. I would say that -- there always will be a spread. It was probably a little bit more pronounced this quarter just because we had some deals in AS push out, and we have -- you know, we talked about Foundry going from, you know, perpetual to subscription. So yeah, there always will be a spread. It's -- like I said, it's probably a little bit more pronounced than the third quarter though.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, thanks for that. And then I wanted to go back a couple of quarters ago now you mentioned that AS had ramping services capacity that was to support strong bookings in your health care assets. I'm wondering if you can maybe just provide an update on maybe whether those awards have gone live. And then in the broader healthcare apparatus, you know, what are you seeing there? Obviously, you're increasing exposure there now via M&A I guess, how does maybe organic growth as a profile stand relative to the AS broader segment?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. So relative to the professional services ramp build, that was principally at our laboratory -- global laboratory business, Clinisys. They've done just a tremendous job competing and winning in the UK, in the French market, in the Benelux region, they tend to be larger installs, and they did a nice job there. It also is around power plan, were that -- I think their second quarter services bookings was the largest services bookings quarter in the company's history, if my memory serves me correctly. So the deals have sort of formed in the capacity is in the process being utilized. So good operational sort of foresight from those two businesses. And then relative to health care exposure, I mean, it's with Syntellis. I mean, it's a stand-alone high single-digit growth business. Our Strata business was a little bit better than that over our ownership period. And the companies -- the combined company, now they've got the most of the cost synergy work is super excited about the new product development ideas they have to further monetize both the customer base and persona. I mean, we have 70% of the health systems as customers with the persona of the CFO, which is -- it's not just the same customer, but the same persona between the two companies, and we're very excited about what that can do.\nJoe Vruwink: That's, great. Thank you very much.\nNeil Hunn: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Good morning, everybody.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, Scott. Good morning.\nScott Davis: Yeah. Good morning. Guys, when you compete -- when you're doing a more bolt-on-ish deal in this kind of rate environment, are you competing against a different type of competitor in these things versus maybe a year or two ago? Sort of less PE shop showing up? And you're just kind of trying to get a sense of sort of just less competition overall for those types of transactions.\nNeil Hunn: So what I would say is -- as a general matter, we're still competing against the sponsor community, though the depth of the field is a little thinner. In the case of Syntellis, it was really a proprietary deal. And we haven't seen many proprietary deals in a long time, right? I mean, in a more frothy market, even if you were the most likely owner of an asset, the seller would run a market check. And in this case, we're able to just sort of cut through all that and reach a deal that made sense to both parties. So maybe in that regard, I mean, the competition is a little thinner, but it's the same set of characters.\nScott Davis: Okay. Make sense. Not much to pick on a very solid quarter overall. But can you give us a sense of materiality of kind of the foundry, you know, just the strike impact and everything? If foundry wasn't in the mix, would growth have been higher than the 5% segment growth?\nJason Conley: Yeah, I'd say a little bit. I mean, it's -- you know, for the second half, it's like single-digit revenue impact relative to our last guide.\nScott Davis: Okay.\nJason Conley: Mid-singles.\nScott Davis: Okay. All right. Good. All right. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. Good to hear from you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist. Please go ahead.\nTerry Tillman: Yes, thanks for taking my questions, and good morning, gentlemen. The first question is on Frontline. If I'm not mistaken, you know, you have this important renewal season. We saw the strong cash flow in the quarter. I'm curious, those are important kind of milestones when they're renewing and you get the cash flow. But what happens and what did you see with expansion or interest in expanding products or modules, adding more seats, taking pricing? And then the second part of my first question is just how is new business growth going in Frontline?\nNeil Hunn: Okay. So Frontline, as we mentioned, I mean, it was just a good first year. The renewals and we're right on plan. Consistent with last year, gross retention was in line with historical and net retention. So relative to the upsell, cross-selling was in line with historical rates, sort of 103, 104 is very consistent in the quarter for Frontline for net retention. So steady as she goes. It just goes to the criticality of what Frontline does for the customers in which they serve. Again, they empower the Frontline of education. So it's good. In terms of the new cross-selling or excuse me, net new customers, it's been very good on the sort of the run rate business at Frontline. Actually a little bit better than prior years. And then as it goes with the lot of small numbers, there's a handful of large deals that Frontline normally gets in any given year. The larger deals have been a little slower to show up this year. They're still in the pipeline. They're just starting to push into the right, but we're talking about three to five deals in the course of a year. It -- it's just a lot of small numbers. So we're not reading too much into that. Hard to recall a macro or a lack of execution. It's just a small number of deals.\nTerry Tillman: Okay, thanks for that, Neil. And I guess, just my follow-up is on Neptune. You know, do you foresee this momentum continuing into '24? And how much should we hang our hat on this meter data management product? I mean, does that move to the needle? Does it have a good attach rate? Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. So Neptune has got a lot of backlog carrying next year. Obviously, we've got to go through our planning process for all of our companies and understand the puts and takes. But we expect Neptune to have another good year as a general matter, just given the momentum in the backlog, the market positioning, the capacity they have, the competitive advantage they have. Relative to master -- data management and the software, it's been an important part of this business, you know, as we have more technology on the meter to get more data off the meters and do and push more capability to the theaters, you have to be able to start process a gigantic volume of data to be able to put it into a billing system or cash collection system. And so we have a pretty decent size and highly capable software group at Neptune that didn't exist 10 years ago that deals with this and it's a growing part of the business. It's always -- it's a smaller part of the business, but it's a fast-growing part of the business. One worthy to call out in the quarter. So I appreciate the question.\nTerry Tillman: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning, all. So a lot has been asked. I was curious about some language in the press release that guidance doesn't include, obviously, future acquisitions or divestitures. You've had a pretty broad stroke of divestiture over a couple of year period recently passed by. So curious if that -- the intent on putting that word in the press release.\nNeil Hunn: I think it's just standard language, Christopher. And so nothing to read into that.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay, great. Thank you. That's all I got.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, good morning, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nJason Conley: Good morning.\nJoe Giordano: Hey. So on M&A, like if we're going into like kind of a more murky kind of macro environment here, a little bit more uncertain, I get why it would kind of open up those markets a little bit. But do these large like larger-scale bolt-ons become incrementally more attractive to you in -- like times like this just because you kind of know the markets more, you probably have kind of more certainty around an outcome than like, you know, bringing in something that perhaps is an adjacency or something that you're just less familiar with in general?\nNeil Hunn: Well, Joe, I would say, yes and no to that. I would -- I mean, first of all, times of uncertainty relative to our capital deployment, our history and pattern recognition says, those are great times for us, right? If you go back to like the pandemic, we do Vertafore. Like in the late summer of 2020, it was an -- it's a terrific business for us, a great asset for us, our largest deal because of our balance sheet strength and our flexibility, we were in business when nobody else was and the sellers need to sell. Frontlines, very different reasons last year, very similar. Syntellis, I mean, it's opportunity in this uncertainty. So we like that. Now as it relates to going to be deployed to a platform or bolt-on, we've built over 20 years, the ability to understand -- be a great, if you will, humbly a business picker. And part of that is understanding the markets and understand the competitive advantages. But in that, we're looking for stability, right? We're looking for stable competitive forces, observable competitive forces, small markets, clear leadership position, high gross and net retention, that's a formula for stability which -- from which to grow from. And so if we see things like that and these uncertain times, we'll certainly lean into that. At the same time, as we talked about at our Investor Day, for our capital deployment strategy, we are trying to lean in to do more bolt-on activity because they've historically been the best value-creative deals we've done, they help our businesses once they turn organic grow faster. That's a gigantic part of what we brought Janet in to do to help lead that part of our investment strategy. And so, we'll do either, but you understand sort of the dynamic between the -- the interplay between the two.\nJoe Giordano: Yeah, that makes sense. And then just last, we still don't have a speaker of the house, we may have a government shutdown coming at the end of the year. What are the implications of something like that on Deltek's business?\nNeil Hunn: I think all of that is factored into the current environment. I think the large government -- the enterprise class government contractors based on just the uncertainty have -- or just are being very cautious in their activity. They've been cautious over, you know, fits and starts this year. So I think it's baked in. It's certainly reflected in our balance of the outlook for this year, sort of continued uncertainty. And this but the good news is this will eventually clear itself and then the government to get you back to spending, and that will be a catalyst for Deltek.\nJoe Giordano: Great, thanks. And I'll just echo Deane's. I'll just echo Deane's comments and great hire on Janet. We'll miss her as a client, but a good home for her and a great hire for you guys. Thanks guys.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, Steve. Good morning to you.\nSteve Tusa: Congrats to Janet as well. Yeah. Can you guys just, obviously, great cash in the quarter, I guess, you know, you guys have talked about the seasonality here. How do we kind of think about the 4Q from a working capital perspective now? Like how should we look at history? And you know is there anything that kind of gives back when it comes to Frontline in the fourth quarter? Like what do -- how do we think about working capital? Should we expect another strong working capital performance similar to what we just saw in the third quarter, like history you know?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. I mean before Frontline, Q4 was our -- you know, our strongest quarter of the year. You know, we have a lot of large renewals at our enterprise software businesses. We expect it to be strong again this year. I mean, I don't think Frontline is going to really give back. They're just not going to give, right? They'll be kind of flattish on cash. So we feel good about sort of the -- you know, the fourth quarter and how it's going to close out the year. We still expect to be north of 30% free cash flow margins for this year. And so, Q3 was obviously strong, and we expect the same in Q4.\nSteve Tusa: And anything else year-over-year in Q4 from a cash tax timing perspective or outside of working capital we have to be aware of?\nNeil Hunn: Not really. Yeah.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. So effectively, net income growth and then some working capital benefits?\nNeil Hunn: Right.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Great. And then just following up on the environment and enterprise software. You guys mentioned there's like there's pockets of softening. I think can you just clarify like what you're just seeing broadly there from customers into '24. It just seems like the economy is mixed, but a lot of the software businesses out there holding up really well. How would you guys kind of characterize the environment maybe a little bit deeper there?\nNeil Hunn: I mean, I think it's -- again, just to remind everybody, right, I mean we've got a business model that's like built on durability, right? So it's very highly incurring. What we do is mission-critical. So we're not on the fringe, generally speaking, something that can be turned off and on. We're just -- we're system of record. You know, we operate sort of the freight markets like our customers need our software that leads to high retention. There's pricing, that's routine in the growth algorithm. Most of the cyclicality has been taken out of the business. And so this is -- the macro is it's a very durable set of businesses. So we're talking about a point or two here or there relative to the impact of all of this. There isn't -- we talked quite a bit getting rid of this call, Steve, about is there some broad brush pan room for macroeconomic impact. And what we say is what we said from the beginning of the year is we just expected from our January call that software would be a little slower because generally you're not going to buy new large software with uncertainty in the market. So the impact on our growth algorithm is gross retention should is -- we expect that it is a little bit higher. Cross-selling and up-selling should be a little bit lower because you're not going to grow as much with your customers and then we're not so. Our net retention is going to net out to be in the same area code as it always has been. And then you're not going to sell as many large new things and that's essentially what's played out across the enterprise, but there's pockets of differences. You've got a ton of strength at Aderant. You have a little bit of weakness in GovCon at Deltek. You've got strength you know at -- you know and help me with -- iPipeline, sorry, tons of strength in iPipeline, improving strength at ConstructConnect, but then you have the DAT headwind. So it really is a mixed bag of things.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Okay. Great color. Thanks a lot.\nNeil Hunn: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, good morning, guys and congrats to you both, Janet. I look forward to reconnecting sometime in the near future. Just my first question, maybe just talking on the bolt-ons for a second. So clearly highlighted Syntellis and Replicon today. As you look across your portfolio, where do you see the most opportunity to potentially bolt-on?\nNeil Hunn: So we're in the early stages of doing that, right? So we don't want what we do not and we will not do is do a center-led process from Sarasota and say to any one of our companies, here's something you should buy. We're not going to do that. We will not do that. What we are going to do is we're asking the vast, vast majority of our businesses as they go through their strategic planning cycle to have both an organic and an inorganic strategy. And so, as we go through that vetting exercise, we'll build -- we'll understand the strategic areas of expansion and then we'll have the discussion should it be organic or inorganic. From there, we'll then forward lean to figure out the inorganic opportunities and then go from there. So that's the process. As a general matter, I think, the larger businesses are the most obvious ones. We'll start Deltek, you know, Frontline, Vertafore, but it's not limited to the largest one. I mean, Strata was sort of an average or a mean-size business for us, if you will, and there was a very compelling opportunity. I think we'll ultimately have, if you will, again, the vast majority, maybe as many as 20 of our 27 companies will have some inorganic growth strategy. Whether or not we execute against that, is a whole another thing, but at least we'll have strategies formed across the vast majority of the portfolio.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That's helpful, Neil. And I guess maybe just a follow-on question. As you think about renewal rates, you mentioned Frontline. So I think 3Q tends to be more like a -- the typical quarter where you'd see more renewals for Frontline. Across your portfolio, does it tend to be more weighted around like the fourth quarter? Or just any color you can give us on, you know, I guess, the confidence in your retention rate staying very high going into next year?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. Joe, you know, our fourth quarter is a very strong renewal season for us at Deltek, Vertafore, and Aderant. So -- but I'd say, you know, it is balanced across the year, but more in the fourth quarter. And obviously with Frontline in the third quarter, that's changed the dynamic there. But we expect strong renewals. You know, we had our operating calls this quarter and the renewal process has already kicked off for the fourth quarter for these businesses, and you know, we're hearing positive feedback.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. Thanks guys.\nNeil Hunn: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: Hi. Good morning, all. Congrats on a nice quarter.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you. Good morning.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, just wanted to come back to ConstructConnect. I think in the previous comment you said improving strength. I was just hoping you put a finer point on that improving activity. And just particularly given the -- some of the incoming data on construction is a little bit weaker, higher rates and so on. So I'd just be curious what you're seeing there.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. So just to remind everybody, Construct Connect is the leader in commercial construction informatics. So in this data set is used in the planning stages of construction. So once they shovel goes in the ground, that's a different part of the industry and one in which we do not compete. So it's actually -- when -- so think of it if you're a contractor or a building product manufacturer and there's so much work to do that you have a backlog and you're not responding to RFPs. That's the environment we've been in for the last handful of years. It actually has a dampening demand driver for our business. When business is harder to find, there's fewer projects than the contractors are having to work harder and find opportunities. That plays into the strength of ConstructConnect. So, to the first point why we're seeing some improving strength there is because the market's coming to us, it tends to have countercyclical demand drivers. But we have to -- when we talk about ConstructConnect, we got to talk about the operational improvements that have happened in the business with Matt Strazza and his team at ConstructConnect. They're doing a tremendous job taking complexity out of this business, having a go-to-market motion that's more efficient, having a product motion that's more efficient, having a marketing message that's more efficient. And so when the market's coming to us, we are doing a better job capturing that demand. So, it's a combination of both market and operations.\nBrett Linzey: Got it. I appreciate the color. And then just the last question on the margin outlook. Understand you don't want to give full guidance here in October for next year, but just thinking about the moving pieces, you know, the mixed differences in the business, is there a framework to think about in terms of you know percent margin expansion, incremental margins and particularly within network software, I mean, do we build off these high levels for next year?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, I mean, I think it's a little early to talk about margins for next year, but I mean, broadly, you know, 45% operating leverage is sort of what our long-term model is, and we've been you know, close to that this year. I think you're probably right, though on network, it'll be maybe a little bit above that next year, but it's still too early to tell.\nBrett Linzey: Got it. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBrad Hewitt: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nJason Conley: Good morning.\nBrad Hewitt: So I noticed that Tim Haddock, your VP of Acquisitions, is on the board of Certinia. Is there anything to read through there in terms of potentially seeing that relationship with Certinia evolve and deepen over time?\nNeil Hunn: I wouldn't read too much into that. We have a board member and a board observer, and part of us delivering our knowledge, if you will, to that enterprise and also learning from the enterprise comes partially through the board interaction. And so I would not read anything into that other than Tim was the one who helped shepherd the process. He had the relationships. Obviously, the MA team leads the Diligence. And so he's just a name board member. I wouldn't read anything into that. This is one step into a second-step transaction.\nBrad Hewitt: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe switching gears. In terms of free cash flow conversion, you guys have typically targeted conversion of about 80% of EBITDA and historically you've executed on that. But now, following the Indicor sale, just curious if you guys have kind of reassessed that number and whether there's scope to kind of outperform on that from a longer-term perspective.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, I mean, I think I've said for about a year, you know, we kind of looked at things as kind of a margin, so as a percent of revenue. And being north of 30% of revenue on free cash flow is kind of the right way to think about it. You know, with EBITDA, obviously, with interest rates changing, it's -- you know, it's good to look at it in a certain point of time. And over time, that can change. So percent of revenue is sort of how we think about it. North of 30% is our target.\nBrad Hewitt: Appreciate it.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zach Moxie for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our third quarter results with you this morning, which like each of the first two quarters this year were quite good. As we turn to page four, let's look at today's agenda. As usual, we'll start with the most recent quarter's financial highlights then Jason will discuss our results. After that, we'll turn to our segment specific discussion and wrap up outlining our increased 2023 enterprise guidance. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to page five, the four main takeaways for today's call are first, we continue to perform at a high level operationally, delivering another quarter of very strong financial results, definitively demonstrating the quality of our portfolio of businesses, our leaders and our governance system; second, we continue to be very active on the M&A front, deploying about $2 billion over last quarter; third, we're increasing our full year guidance; and fourth, we remain very well positioned for further disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to the first takeaway, our continued strong performance, we saw total revenue growth 16% and organic revenue growth 6%. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we continue to not only scale our enterprise, but also simultaneously improve as underlying quality and recurring revenue base with organic software recurring revenue growing high single-digits in the quarter. Importantly, the cash. As we've been highlighting throughout the year, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow growing 19% for the most recent TTM period and 77% in the quarter. Turning to our second main takeaway, the deployment of $2 billion over last quarter was led by our acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon, both of which are bolt-ons for Strata and Deltek, respectively. These are each strategically interesting bolt-ons and are highly compelling from a value creation perspective as we're able to buy these businesses for about 14 times next year's EBITDA. More on these in a bit. In addition, in the quarter, we made a $125 million minority investment in Certinia, a professional services automation software business. We're excited to partner with Haveli and General Atlantic Ventures to deploy the value creation thesis associated with this unique opportunity. Third, we're increasing our full year total revenue growth to be 14% plus, increasing our organic revenue growth to be 7% plus and increasing our full year debt guidance to be in the range of $16.62 to $16.66 or up $0.21 at the midpoint versus our previous guidance of $16.36 to $16.50. And fourth, we continue to be very well positioned for further capital deployment by having over $4 billion of M&A firepower. We remain very active in the market as we evaluate and diligence in many attractive opportunities. So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through our third quarter results and our very strong financial position. Jason? Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to page nine. And before we walk through our segment details, we'd like to start with an overview of our acquisition of Syntellis and the combination with our Strata business. To remind everyone, Strata has been part of Roper for eight years as a leader in delivering SaaS-based financial planning, decision support and performance analytics solutions to US hospitals and health systems. Syntellis is a leading provider of SaaS-based enterprise performance management and data solutions to hospitals, higher education and financial institutions. As many of you know, US-based hospitals and health systems continue to face intense pressure from macro market trends, challenges resulting from care setting shifts, reimbursement rates, lagging rising costs and labor staffing issues. The combined Strata and Syntellis business will uniquely be able to help health systems address these difficult financial and operational challenges. Together, the enterprise has relationships with about 70% of the country's health systems. Stand-alone, Syntellis meets all our acquisition criteria, a leader in a niche market, delivers mission-critical application-specific solutions, is an HSD organic growth business and operates an extremely asset-light business model. Taken together with Strata, it only gets more attractive in terms of the combined customer base, the combined product offering, the combined financial profile and the combined future product development opportunities. For 2024, we expect Syntellis to deliver about $185 million of revenue and about $90 million of EBITDA inclusive of cost synergies. Of note, this EBITDA is $5 million higher than at the time of our deal announcement. Considering the $1.25 billion net purchase price, the valuation is about 14 times next year's EBITDA and will only improve from there. Operationally, the teams have moved quite expeditiously and are ahead of schedule relative to the near-term value creation plan, having implemented about 85% of the cost synergy opportunities within the first 45 days. In addition, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Finally, the new combined leadership team headed by Strata's CEO, John Martino, are turning their strategic attention to new combined product development ideas. Net-net, this is a highly compelling value creation opportunity for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, let's now turn to page 10 and walk through our Application Software segment. Third quarter revenues for Application Software segment were $803 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins increased to 44.6% in the quarter. We'll start with Deltek. Deltek was solid in the quarter with sustained momentum in their SMB channel and the private sector solutions. They continue to see sluggish activity in their GovCon Enterprise segment given the backdrop of federal government spending uncertainty. Retention rates across the entirety of Deltek remain high. Importantly, over the last couple of months, Deltek released a Gen AI-enabled data collection capability for the GovWin IQ business, an LLM based processing features for their Vantagepoint product. It's good to see further adoption of Gen AI within the portfolio. Also in the quarter, as we outlined on last quarter's call, Deltek closed the acquisition of Replicon, albeit about a month later than anticipated. To remind you, Replicon is a market-leading timekeeping and workforce management SaaS solution focused on professional services firms and is highly complementary to Deltek's strategy. We continue to expect Replicon to contribute north of $70 million of revenue and $24 million of EBITDA next year. Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms, continues to excel and deliver a very strong quarter. In the quarter, Aderant saw record third quarter bookings and continued success in the adoption and cross-sell of their SaaS solutions. Also and importantly, during the quarter, Aderant continue to mature and gain market traction with their Generative AI-enabler MADDI. Aderant's most recent Gen AI product release enables passive fee earner time entry assistance through Aderant's iTimekeep product line. Great to see this rapid product innovation at Aderant. Vertafore, our software business that tech enables property and casualty insurance agencies continues to be a great business for us with solid performance across our core P&C business and their recent MGA solutions bolt-on. Strata, independent from the Syntellis acquisition was strong in the quarter and continued to gain market adoption of their leading decision support and financial planning solutions. Finally, Frontline had strong customer renewal season and delivered significant cash flow, as Jason mentioned, to the enterprise in the quarter. Looking to the final quarter of the year, we expect to see organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit area for the segment. Turning to page 11. Third quarter revenues for our Network Software segment were $364 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 56.3%. Let's start with our US and Canadian freight matching businesses DAT and Loadlink, both of which grew in the quarter despite the continued challenges across the broader freight and logistics markets. Over the last quarter or two, these businesses have done a fantastic job of baselining their cost structures while continuing to invest in new product development. This led to strong segment margins in the quarter. Relative to product development, and as we highlighted a touch last quarter, DAT launched Gen AI-enabled solutions, among other initiatives targeted to combat freight industry fraud, which is a problem that plagues the entire industry. Within the first month of release, DAT has made a significant dent in fraudulent activity and DAT's customers have noticed and recognized this great accomplishment. This is a shiny example of why and how Roper businesses continue to innovate through and across macroeconomic cycles, which enables us to consistently deliver on market and customer opportunities ultimately leading to market share gains. Turning to our iPipeline. Our network software business that tech enabled the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities. iPipeline continues to execute at a high level and gain market share. In the quarter, they had very nice ARR gains driven by strong retention and customer expansion activity. This growth is directly attributable to iPipeline's strategy that is laser-focused on their core life insurance and annuity customer base. We talked about this concept during our Investor Day earlier in the year. A closely held value of Roper in our businesses is a notion that we compete and win based on customer intimacy. Customer intimacy requires focus and strategic choice. iPipeline over the last two to three years has excelled at this, the concept of focus on the core and choice, which enables further market share gains. Great job, team. Foundry, our media and entertainment postproduction software business continued their business model transition to a subscription model and is ahead of plan in that regard. Though industry demand was temporarily paused given both the Hollywood writers and actor strikes. Notwithstanding, Foundry continues to innovate their product offering and will aggressively compete for customer wallet share in the coming months as the actor Strike results. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid and the business has benefited by having improved census and skilled nursing assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels and patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. For the final quarter of the year, we expect to see low single-digit growth for this segment based on continued challenging freight market conditions and the actor strike impact on foundry. Now let's turn to page 12 and walk through our TEP segment. Revenues in the quarter were $396 million, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were strong at 36.5% in the quarter. We'll start with Neptune, our water meter and technology business. Neptune delivered another fantastic quarter of operational and financial performance. As has been the case for several quarters, Neptune continues to see strong demand and momentum for the residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters and increasing adoption for their meter data management software. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete, given this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles. Verathon was awesome in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth and tremendous operational execution. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across the reoccurring single-use products both Bronchoscope or Bflex and video innovation or GlideScope as well as BladderScan capital purchases. A group of smaller businesses here Inovonics, IPA and rf IDEAS were fantastic as they were last quarter substantially working through a series of nagging supply chain challenges. Relative to the final quarter of the year, we expect to see low double-digit organic growth for this segment. Now please turn to page 14, and let's go through our increased 2023 guidance. Based on our strong third quarter performance, we're raising our full year 2023 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and adjusted debts. For 2023, we now expect total revenue growth to be 14% plus, an increase from about 13% last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full year organic revenue outlook to be in a 7% plus ZIP code an increase from about 7% last quarter and 5% to 6% in our original guide for the year. As a result of our improved revenue outlook, we're increasing our DEPS guidance for the year to be in the range of $16.62 and $16.66 up from our prior guidance of $16.36 to $16.50. Assumed in this guidance is the tax rate trending to the high end of our 21% to 22% range. For the fourth quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $4.28 and $4.32. Now please turn over to page 15 and then we'll look forward to answering your questions. We want to leave you with the same four points with which we started. First, we delivered yet another solid quarter. In the third quarter, revenues increased 16% to $1.56 billion. This growth was underpinned with 6% organic revenue growth and high single-digit organic software recurring revenue growth. In addition, EBITDA margins were notably strong at 41.7% and cash flow was outstanding, growing 77% in the quarter and 19% on a TTM basis. Second, we successfully deployed $2 billion of capital in the quarter, led by the bolt-ons of Syntellis and Replicon. These two deals will deliver about $115 million of EBITDA next year and are priced about 14 times next year's EBITDA, quite compelling. Third, based on the strong quarter performance, the recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers were increasing our full year total and organic revenue growth outlook and increasing our full year DEPS outlook to be between $16.62 and $16.66. And finally, notwithstanding this quarter's $2 billion of deployment, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we've been discussing over the past several quarters, we have a very large pipeline of opportunities, though, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure the continued optimal deployment of our available capital, just as we did with the Syntellis and Replicon acquisitions. We firmly believe that patients as is always the case with capital deployment will be rewarded. Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to share an exciting addition to the Roper executive team. During the quarter, Janet Glazer joined our team and is leading our acquisition cultivation and corporate development outreach efforts. Janet will partner with our M&A resources, our corporate leadership team and several of our business units to increase our forward-leaning posture with private equity sponsors and their businesses. Most recently, Janet was a global sector leader and portfolio manager at Fidelity. We're super excited that Janet has joined our leadership team and welcome aboard. As we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel. We'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy, yet we close our businesses on how to structurally improve their growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focus on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow in the mid-teens area over a long arc of time. So with that, thank you for your continued interest in Roper and let's open it up to your questions. Good morning, Julian. Thanks for the question. So I'll try and take it in reverse order. The margins I tried to cover in my prepared remarks how DAT and Loadlink have just done a great job in Q2 and Q3, aligning the cost structure of where the business is today. And so they're actually a little bit ahead of where they wanted to be in that regard. So that's what drove the margins. Relative to Foundry, it's very much in Q4. I mean, there's still much -- very much is an actor strike for Foundry in post-production. They need content flowing through the pipeline. And right now, writers are writing, but actors aren't acting. The general consensus that will sort of resolve itself in Q4, but one never knows. Then the pipelines will build and sort of leading into maybe the second half of Q1 and Q2, Foundry's demand will sort of get back to normal levels. So it's sort of as a Q3, Q4, maybe Q1 impacting. Relative to DAT and Loadlink, I'll remind just DAT has just been remarkable over the last couple of years. It's really been abnormal growth. It's been exceptional. DAT has a super long history of being very steady and growing. They grew in the quarter. They continued to innovate, you know, in October here. We've seen sort of we're bouncing along the bottom, if you will, maybe a slight uptick in the first handful of weeks in October. Who knows if that sort of started the trend or just some of the yellow sort of, you know, capacity coming into a different part of the market and reshaping. But we expect normal behavior for DAT. It's just we've got to wait about get off the bottom here in terms of the industry freight volumes. Anything you want to add to that, Jason? Yeah. So we're partners with Haveli principally in -- the Haveli partners, we know quite well. It was one of the founders of Vista and then the person who led the tech practice at Bain came together joined Haveli. So the long history of both of them as individuals. They actually approached us to see if we can lend some of our expertise to the situation. So we're intrigued by being able to help. We're intrigued by the value creation opportunity here. It's a very compelling value-creation opportunity. And then we'll also learn a thing or two along the way. I mean, this is a smart group of people that have a long history of doing this type of transaction. It's a unique opportunity, Julian, as you mentioned. We're not looking to do a lot more of things like this. This is not the beginning of like a large book of minority investments. We'll continue to be opportunistic, but it's not going to be anything. It's going to be few and far between in terms of our pacing and volume on this. And the scale, I think we're on at the private business, so we'll sort of keep the scale of the business sort of in the private domain. Good morning. Oh, sorry, but you broke up just on the very end there, Allison. So I would say -- so yeah, just to reiterate it, sort of Neptune is, I mean, it is a bit market-based in that, that market continues to be, you know, very healthy. The customers are -- ordering patterns are consistent and robust, lots of backlog carrying into next year. So there's market share gains and product advantage we have and also a cooperative market for sure. You know, with Verathon, the market dynamic is moving towards single-use in the category in bronchoscope from reusables because of infection control. So it's a market that is definitely a growth market that we are very soon to be the number one player in knock on wood, maybe this quarter. And so, that's market related, but just tremendous execution by the team, both go-to-market and product. I mean, tons of product vitality. And then also in the segment, we have a couple -- we mentioned a couple of smaller RF product businesses. That's less market and more just clearing through just a mountain of supply chain problems that plague the businesses for many -- a few quarters. And second quarter and third quarter are great in that regard to those businesses. Yeah, that's really the question. The -- so this -- it's like a -- the market Jason sort of referred to it as like a coiled spring. I mean, there is a tremendous amount of activity like forming activity, investment bankers, pipelines are filling processes are starting. There's increasing pressure from the LPs onto the sponsors to start thinking about getting some liquidity back to them. The sponsor is starting to think about raising new funds, which they need liquidity to do that. So there's a lot of the precursor activity that is required to see transactions come back into the market. The question still remains about the bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers. Here still -- the number of printed deals to date is still small, right? So this is -- and we anticipate -- well, we know there's going to be more opportunities. We don't yet know where they're going to clear. We continue to be super patient. You know, the market is coming to us. We don't have to chase the market. If we can find very compelling value opportunities like Replicon and Syntellis will do them. If we don't, we'll remain patient. Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for saying that. We're looking at her, she's sort of an -- she's not on the back script, we're looking at her, and she's a blushing. So she's got to be great as part of the team for sure. So it's played out as we anticipated over the course of the year. It's really been a mixed bag. Just look at one company in Deltek, strong across SMB, both on the government contracting and private sector, professional services markets, strong at the enterprise level for PS, less strong on the government contracting side at the enterprise level. So it really is a mixed bag. In that case, it's less macro related and more tied to the uncertainty around what's happening to the federal government and budgets and what's going on there. You see strength across iPipeline. You see strength at Aderant. Those are very healthy customer bases. So it really is a mixed bag. Obviously, the weakness at DAT given that we just talked about with just where freight markets are, so it's really a collection of bespoke things than it is sort of a broad brush macro across the portfolio. Sure. Yeah. So we're definitely playing offense here. We think this is a transformational technology, right? It's not a trendy paradigm or hyping a fab. We think this is a foundational technology that will change the way we all live our personal lives and this will be conducted over the course of the next five years to 10 years, right? So that's our view on the technology of Gen AI and large language models, et cetera. So what we're doing is really a combination of top-down bottoms-up, if you will. From a top-down perspective, Deane, we've organized -- we deputized, I should say, a couple of our group executives, Satish Maripuri and Mike Corkery, to lead an education series across a variety of topics around Gen AI for our companies. So we've done a series of Zoom meetings, you know, three or four. We've got five or six still to go. They're spaced out every three weeks or four weeks around, that started with what is Gen AI, and it's evolving more and more into how do you deploy methods of deployment, where and how in the organization you deploy it both in productivity and new product ideas. So the hope with that is that it's -- it spurns this creative thinking across the 18,000 people at Roper. Think about how to impact our customers positively, how to impact our operations positively. So ultimately, it will be a bottoms-up, groundswell of ideas, but we're accelerating the learning, if you will. Ultimately, we might do a couple other things that center around, you know, contracts with some of the larger players or deployment models for cybersecurity, and safety and security purposes. But as with Roper, all the good ideas will be generated bottoms-up from the field and the leadership team and the employee base. Welcome. Yeah. So relative to the professional services ramp build, that was principally at our laboratory -- global laboratory business, Clinisys. They've done just a tremendous job competing and winning in the UK, in the French market, in the Benelux region, they tend to be larger installs, and they did a nice job there. It also is around power plan, were that -- I think their second quarter services bookings was the largest services bookings quarter in the company's history, if my memory serves me correctly. So the deals have sort of formed in the capacity is in the process being utilized. So good operational sort of foresight from those two businesses. And then relative to health care exposure, I mean, it's with Syntellis. I mean, it's a stand-alone high single-digit growth business. Our Strata business was a little bit better than that over our ownership period. And the companies -- the combined company, now they've got the most of the cost synergy work is super excited about the new product development ideas they have to further monetize both the customer base and persona. I mean, we have 70% of the health systems as customers with the persona of the CFO, which is -- it's not just the same customer, but the same persona between the two companies, and we're very excited about what that can do. You're welcome. Hey, Scott. Good morning. So what I would say is -- as a general matter, we're still competing against the sponsor community, though the depth of the field is a little thinner. In the case of Syntellis, it was really a proprietary deal. And we haven't seen many proprietary deals in a long time, right? I mean, in a more frothy market, even if you were the most likely owner of an asset, the seller would run a market check. And in this case, we're able to just sort of cut through all that and reach a deal that made sense to both parties. So maybe in that regard, I mean, the competition is a little thinner, but it's the same set of characters. Yeah. Good to hear from you. Okay. So Frontline, as we mentioned, I mean, it was just a good first year. The renewals and we're right on plan. Consistent with last year, gross retention was in line with historical and net retention. So relative to the upsell, cross-selling was in line with historical rates, sort of 103, 104 is very consistent in the quarter for Frontline for net retention. So steady as she goes. It just goes to the criticality of what Frontline does for the customers in which they serve. Again, they empower the Frontline of education. So it's good. In terms of the new cross-selling or excuse me, net new customers, it's been very good on the sort of the run rate business at Frontline. Actually a little bit better than prior years. And then as it goes with the lot of small numbers, there's a handful of large deals that Frontline normally gets in any given year. The larger deals have been a little slower to show up this year. They're still in the pipeline. They're just starting to push into the right, but we're talking about three to five deals in the course of a year. It -- it's just a lot of small numbers. So we're not reading too much into that. Hard to recall a macro or a lack of execution. It's just a small number of deals. Yeah. So Neptune has got a lot of backlog carrying next year. Obviously, we've got to go through our planning process for all of our companies and understand the puts and takes. But we expect Neptune to have another good year as a general matter, just given the momentum in the backlog, the market positioning, the capacity they have, the competitive advantage they have. Relative to master -- data management and the software, it's been an important part of this business, you know, as we have more technology on the meter to get more data off the meters and do and push more capability to the theaters, you have to be able to start process a gigantic volume of data to be able to put it into a billing system or cash collection system. And so we have a pretty decent size and highly capable software group at Neptune that didn't exist 10 years ago that deals with this and it's a growing part of the business. It's always -- it's a smaller part of the business, but it's a fast-growing part of the business. One worthy to call out in the quarter. So I appreciate the question. I think it's just standard language, Christopher. And so nothing to read into that. Good morning. Well, Joe, I would say, yes and no to that. I would -- I mean, first of all, times of uncertainty relative to our capital deployment, our history and pattern recognition says, those are great times for us, right? If you go back to like the pandemic, we do Vertafore. Like in the late summer of 2020, it was an -- it's a terrific business for us, a great asset for us, our largest deal because of our balance sheet strength and our flexibility, we were in business when nobody else was and the sellers need to sell. Frontlines, very different reasons last year, very similar. Syntellis, I mean, it's opportunity in this uncertainty. So we like that. Now as it relates to going to be deployed to a platform or bolt-on, we've built over 20 years, the ability to understand -- be a great, if you will, humbly a business picker. And part of that is understanding the markets and understand the competitive advantages. But in that, we're looking for stability, right? We're looking for stable competitive forces, observable competitive forces, small markets, clear leadership position, high gross and net retention, that's a formula for stability which -- from which to grow from. And so if we see things like that and these uncertain times, we'll certainly lean into that. At the same time, as we talked about at our Investor Day, for our capital deployment strategy, we are trying to lean in to do more bolt-on activity because they've historically been the best value-creative deals we've done, they help our businesses once they turn organic grow faster. That's a gigantic part of what we brought Janet in to do to help lead that part of our investment strategy. And so, we'll do either, but you understand sort of the dynamic between the -- the interplay between the two. I think all of that is factored into the current environment. I think the large government -- the enterprise class government contractors based on just the uncertainty have -- or just are being very cautious in their activity. They've been cautious over, you know, fits and starts this year. So I think it's baked in. It's certainly reflected in our balance of the outlook for this year, sort of continued uncertainty. And this but the good news is this will eventually clear itself and then the government to get you back to spending, and that will be a catalyst for Deltek. Thank you. Hey, Steve. Good morning to you. Yeah. I mean before Frontline, Q4 was our -- you know, our strongest quarter of the year. You know, we have a lot of large renewals at our enterprise software businesses. We expect it to be strong again this year. I mean, I don't think Frontline is going to really give back. They're just not going to give, right? They'll be kind of flattish on cash. So we feel good about sort of the -- you know, the fourth quarter and how it's going to close out the year. We still expect to be north of 30% free cash flow margins for this year. And so, Q3 was obviously strong, and we expect the same in Q4. Not really. Yeah. Right. I mean, I think it's -- again, just to remind everybody, right, I mean we've got a business model that's like built on durability, right? So it's very highly incurring. What we do is mission-critical. So we're not on the fringe, generally speaking, something that can be turned off and on. We're just -- we're system of record. You know, we operate sort of the freight markets like our customers need our software that leads to high retention. There's pricing, that's routine in the growth algorithm. Most of the cyclicality has been taken out of the business. And so this is -- the macro is it's a very durable set of businesses. So we're talking about a point or two here or there relative to the impact of all of this. There isn't -- we talked quite a bit getting rid of this call, Steve, about is there some broad brush pan room for macroeconomic impact. And what we say is what we said from the beginning of the year is we just expected from our January call that software would be a little slower because generally you're not going to buy new large software with uncertainty in the market. So the impact on our growth algorithm is gross retention should is -- we expect that it is a little bit higher. Cross-selling and up-selling should be a little bit lower because you're not going to grow as much with your customers and then we're not so. Our net retention is going to net out to be in the same area code as it always has been. And then you're not going to sell as many large new things and that's essentially what's played out across the enterprise, but there's pockets of differences. You've got a ton of strength at Aderant. You have a little bit of weakness in GovCon at Deltek. You've got strength you know at -- you know and help me with -- iPipeline, sorry, tons of strength in iPipeline, improving strength at ConstructConnect, but then you have the DAT headwind. So it really is a mixed bag of things. You're welcome. So we're in the early stages of doing that, right? So we don't want what we do not and we will not do is do a center-led process from Sarasota and say to any one of our companies, here's something you should buy. We're not going to do that. We will not do that. What we are going to do is we're asking the vast, vast majority of our businesses as they go through their strategic planning cycle to have both an organic and an inorganic strategy. And so, as we go through that vetting exercise, we'll build -- we'll understand the strategic areas of expansion and then we'll have the discussion should it be organic or inorganic. From there, we'll then forward lean to figure out the inorganic opportunities and then go from there. So that's the process. As a general matter, I think, the larger businesses are the most obvious ones. We'll start Deltek, you know, Frontline, Vertafore, but it's not limited to the largest one. I mean, Strata was sort of an average or a mean-size business for us, if you will, and there was a very compelling opportunity. I think we'll ultimately have, if you will, again, the vast majority, maybe as many as 20 of our 27 companies will have some inorganic growth strategy. Whether or not we execute against that, is a whole another thing, but at least we'll have strategies formed across the vast majority of the portfolio. Yeah. Joe, you know, our fourth quarter is a very strong renewal season for us at Deltek, Vertafore, and Aderant. So -- but I'd say, you know, it is balanced across the year, but more in the fourth quarter. And obviously with Frontline in the third quarter, that's changed the dynamic there. But we expect strong renewals. You know, we had our operating calls this quarter and the renewal process has already kicked off for the fourth quarter for these businesses, and you know, we're hearing positive feedback. You're welcome. Thank you. Good morning. Yeah. So just to remind everybody, Construct Connect is the leader in commercial construction informatics. So in this data set is used in the planning stages of construction. So once they shovel goes in the ground, that's a different part of the industry and one in which we do not compete. So it's actually -- when -- so think of it if you're a contractor or a building product manufacturer and there's so much work to do that you have a backlog and you're not responding to RFPs. That's the environment we've been in for the last handful of years. It actually has a dampening demand driver for our business. When business is harder to find, there's fewer projects than the contractors are having to work harder and find opportunities. That plays into the strength of ConstructConnect. So, to the first point why we're seeing some improving strength there is because the market's coming to us, it tends to have countercyclical demand drivers. But we have to -- when we talk about ConstructConnect, we got to talk about the operational improvements that have happened in the business with Matt Strazza and his team at ConstructConnect. They're doing a tremendous job taking complexity out of this business, having a go-to-market motion that's more efficient, having a product motion that's more efficient, having a marketing message that's more efficient. And so when the market's coming to us, we are doing a better job capturing that demand. So, it's a combination of both market and operations. Yeah, I mean, I think it's a little early to talk about margins for next year, but I mean, broadly, you know, 45% operating leverage is sort of what our long-term model is, and we've been you know, close to that this year. I think you're probably right, though on network, it'll be maybe a little bit above that next year, but it's still too early to tell. Good morning. I wouldn't read too much into that. We have a board member and a board observer, and part of us delivering our knowledge, if you will, to that enterprise and also learning from the enterprise comes partially through the board interaction. And so I would not read anything into that other than Tim was the one who helped shepherd the process. He had the relationships. Obviously, the MA team leads the Diligence. And so he's just a name board member. I wouldn't read anything into that. This is one step into a second-step transaction. Yeah, I mean, I think I've said for about a year, you know, we kind of looked at things as kind of a margin, so as a percent of revenue. And being north of 30% of revenue on free cash flow is kind of the right way to think about it. You know, with EBITDA, obviously, with interest rates changing, it's -- you know, it's good to look at it in a certain point of time. And over time, that can change. So percent of revenue is sort of how we think about it. North of 30% is our target."

            "content": "Thanks, Neil, and good morning to those that have joined our call, and thank you for your interest in Roper. Turning to slide six, I'll take you through our third quarter enterprise results in a bit more detail. Revenue of $1.56 billion was 16% over prior year, with 6% organic growth and a 9% contribution from acquisitions, led by Frontline. As Neil mentioned, organic software recurring revenue growth was in the high single-digit area. This was led by strength in customer expansion and net new logos across our enterprise software businesses. Additionally, our product businesses continued to deliver with 10% organic growth in the quarter, highlighted by Neptune and Verathon. Revenue converted nicely through EBITDA, with EBITDA of $652 million or 18% over prior year. Margin expanded in the quarter to 41.7%, with EBITDA operating leverage of 46%. This all translated to depths of $4.32 versus our guidance of $4.16 to $4.20. Of note, our recent acquisitions had minimal impact on earnings this quarter. We expect DEPS accretion from these deals in 2024 as we pay down the revolver and benefit from full synergy realization. Free cash flow was very strong in the quarter and came in line with our expectations. We generated $625 million of free cash flow, which is up $272 million over prior year. As a reminder, our Frontline business delivers most of its free cash flow in the third quarter. So that, plus a terrific organic contribution drove the significant growth. Looking at cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, as shown on the slide, provides a more relevant comparison. With the frontline renewals tucked into the third quarter, our TTM free cash flow was $1.82 billion, which is up 19% over the prior TTM period. With the expectation for a strong Q4, we're on track to deliver north of 30% free cash flow margins in 2023. Taking a broader view, our TTM free cash flow has compounded 16% over a three-year period, which is in line with EBITDA growth. In summary, our focus on compounding cash flow is evident in our results and will continue to guide us into the future. Next slide on page seven here. Taking a look at our financial position, we ended the quarter with net debt of $6.6 billion, including about $900 million drawn on our revolver. With trailing EBITDA of over $2.4 billion, this leaves us with net leverage of about 2.7 times. Looking forward, we have capacity to deploy $4 billion or more over the foreseeable period even after deploying $2 billion in the third quarter. As always, cash flow growth optimization guides our strategic choices. So while our balance sheet may be primed, we will be disciplined and patient when it comes to capital deployment. To that end, private markets are slowly falling with activity picking up over the last quarter. With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to go through the segment results and outlook. Neil? No, I think that's right. I mean, the abnormality, if you do a straight line from 2019, you'd see the business has been up substantially, right? So we have sort of this exceptional growth. A lot of carriers come in the market, they're exiting out. And you know, again, it's just been a good steady growth for us over the last 20 years absent, you know, sort of this exceptional period. And just back on Foundry, I would say that what we've observed is the gross retention of the business has been extremely strong. We have moved to a subscription model this year, and so that gives customers pause on if they get off maintenance, they're going to have to come back on a subscription. So we feel good to once the actor strike is done, that's -- that business is going to pick back up next year, hopefully. Good morning. I think sort of market-based. Good morning, Deane. Hey, Joe, it's Jason. I would say that -- there always will be a spread. It was probably a little bit more pronounced this quarter just because we had some deals in AS push out, and we have -- you know, we talked about Foundry going from, you know, perpetual to subscription. So yeah, there always will be a spread. It's -- like I said, it's probably a little bit more pronounced than the third quarter though. Yeah, I'd say a little bit. I mean, it's -- you know, for the second half, it's like single-digit revenue impact relative to our last guide. Mid-singles. Good morning. Good morning."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded and all participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President, and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we used a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to page two. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to page three. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indicor. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now, if you please turn to page four, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: [Technical Difficulty] and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing our second quarter results with you this morning, which like Q1 were quite good. As we turn to page four, let's look at today's agenda. I'll start with our second quarter enterprise highlights then ask Jason to share our financial results. After that, we'll turn to our segment specific discussion and wrap up outlining our increased 2023 enterprise guidance. So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to page five, the four main takeaways for today's call are: first, we continue to perform extremely well and had a very strong second quarter, another demonstration of the quality of our portfolio of businesses. Second, we're increasing our full-year guidance both in terms of total and organic revenue growth and adjusted debts. Third, Generative AI. We're very excited by the promise of this technology and outline reasons why today. And fourth, we remain very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to the first takeaway, a strong start to the year and a solid second quarter, we saw total revenue grow 17% and organic revenue grow 9%. Consistent with our longstanding strategy we continue to not only scale our enterprise, but also simultaneously improve its underlying quality and recurring revenue base. Importantly, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow growing 17% in the quarter. Our results this quarter are another proof point that our higher quality, less cyclical portfolio was purpose built to consistently perform at a very high level. Given the strong second quarter, we're increasing our full-year total revenue growth to be around 13%, increasing our organic revenue growth to be around 7% and increasing our full-year debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 to $16.50 or up $0.23 at the midpoint versus our previous guidance of $16.10 to $16.30. Third, relative to Gen AI, we feel we're structurally advantaged and excited by this technology as our vertical and application specific businesses, we use our specialized market positions and knowledge to provide context to these enabling technologies both to create customer value and internal productivity gains more on this during today's call. And finally, we continue to be well positioned relative to capital deployment. We remain active in the market as we evaluate and actively diligence many high quality opportunities. Jason, I'll turn the call over to you so you can walk through our second quarter results and our very strong financial position. Jason?\nJason Conley: Thanks, Neil, and I hope everyone is doing well this morning. Turning to slide six, the seconf quarter was another good post in 2023. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, which was up 17% over prior year. Organic growth was 9%, which was led by 8% software recurring revenue growth across the enterprise and outsized growth 19% in our tech enable product segment. EBITDA increased 20% to $617 million with EBITDA operating leverage of 46%. Notably, margin expanded across all three segments in the quarter. DEPS of $4.12 was $0.12 above the high-end of our guidance range and 20% above prior year. DEPS growth was in line with EBITDA growth given the offsetting impact of a higher tax rate and lower net interest expense. Moving to free cash flow. As a reminder, the second quarter is always our lowest conversion quarter in the year as we make two federal tax payments. We delivered $295 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was up 17% over prior year. As I previously mentioned, Frontline\u2019s cash flow is seasonally weighted to Q3 and Q4, especially in Q3 and this is in line with our K-12 customers' annual renewals. So we expect a meaningful increase to cash flow in the second half. Taking broader view of cash flow on this slide, recall that we acquired Vertafore in 2020 and had a one-time cash tax benefit of $120 million, of which about $60 million benefited the second quarter of 2021. We've therefore had very strong multi-year cash flow performance when normalizing for this 2021 tax item. For the year, we are confident that free cash flow will be greater than 30% of revenue. Turning to our balance sheet on slide seven. Our net leverage sits at 2.2 times at the end of the quarter with about $6.7 billion of debt and just under $1.5 billion of cash against our TTM EBITDA of $2.35 million. Also our $3.5 billion revolver remains fully undrawn. To summarize, we have significant acquisition capacity and remain quite active in many bespoke processes. To that end, in Q3, we expect to close on Replicon, which is a bolt-on acquisition for our Deltek business with a purchase price of $450 million or about $370 million net of a long-term cash tax benefit. Neil will discuss the details around this exciting addition to the Deltek platform in the segment discussion. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk about our segment performance and outlook. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to page nine and walk through our Q2 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $770 million, up 6% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins increased to 43.7% in the quarter. In this segment, we continue to see consistently strong performance across the entire group of companies. We'll start with Deltek. Deltek was once again solid across both our government contracting and private sector businesses. Importantly, Deltek continues to see momentum build with our SaaS offerings and retention rates remain at historically high levels. Also in the quarter and as Jason mentioned earlier, we announced the acquisition of Replicon for Deltek, Roper\u2019s largest bolt-on today. Replicon is a market leading timekeeping and workforce management SaaS solution focused on professional services firms and it's highly complementary to Deltek strategy. We expect Replicon to contribute north of $70 million of revenue and $24 million of EBITDA next year and we expect the deal to close during the third quarter. Finally, as it relates to Deltek, we wanted to brag on them for a moment. During the quarter, the Washington Post award Deltek, the number four top workplace at the D.C. Metro Area for large companies. As you know, we have a closely held belief that talent and culture can create long-term competitive advantage and this is certainly the case for Deltek. During Roper's ownership with Deltek, the company has increased its organic growth rate, retention levels, recurring revenue and margin structure and a big contributor to that success is the structural talent advantage that Deltek continues to build. Congrats to Mike and congrats to your entire team. Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms continues to be excellent. In the quarter, Aderant saw record bookings and continued success in the adoption and cross-sell of their SaaS solutions. Also and importantly during the quarter, Aderant launched their Generative AI enabler, MADDI. Today, MADDI is enabling two solutions outside counsel guidelines management and time entry, with plans to extend this to AR cash receipt matching and docketing over the coming months. Over time MADDI will be integrated widely across Aderant\u2019s product platforms. Generative AI for a legal space has tremendous potential. One such example in the market today is Onyx. Onyx powered by MADDI solves a massive challenge that all law firms face, namely how to navigate outside counsel guidelines or the billing requirements that clients impose on their law firms. It's fairly common for a large law firm to have to navigate 100s of 1,000s of bespoke client billing requirements. Today, Onyx uses Generative AI to extract contractual terms and convert them into business tools used in the time entry and billing processes, a true game changer. More broadly across Roper, we're excited about the potential of Generative AI and large language models. We believe given our deeply verticalized and application specific business model that our businesses are structurally advantaged given that all AI, computational and generative need context specifically dated workflows and wish to train or target the technology. Internally, we're working closely with our businesses on the productivity and product enabled opportunities associated with Gen AI. Certainly much more to come on this. Now back to the segment performance in Vertafore, our software business at tech-enabled property and casualty insurance agencies. Vertafore continues to be a great asset for us with solid performance across our core P&C business and their recent MGA Solutions bolt-on. Our Healthcare/IT businesses also performed very well in the quarter with growth in each of our Healthcare/IT franchises, Clinisys, Data Innovations and Strata. Frontline also continues to deliver for us. Frontline's mission is to empower the frontline of education. As many of you know, the hiring of teachers and administrative staff is particularly challenging and frontline software solutions better equip K-12 school district to navigate these challenges. Because of this, frontline solutions are mission critical and of high importance to their school district customers. As such, frontline's net retention is consistently strong. Looking to the second-half of the year, we expect to see organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digits area for the segment. Overall, very strong results and outlook for this segment. Turning to page 10. Revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $358 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 54.2%. As with our Application Software segment, growth and performance was solid across the segment. Relative to business specific comments, we'll start with our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT & Loadlink, both of which grew in the quarter despite continued challenges across the broader freight and logistics markets. I'll remind you that our businesses are critical to the operation and execution of the North American spot freight market. In addition and importantly the spot market is a long-term secular beneficiary in terms of the volume of future great ships. Throughout and across the freight and economic cycle DAT & Loadlink continue to innovate and launch new products and offerings to help drive enhanced customer value and share of wallet. As we speak, DAT is launching a Generative AI enabled solution among other initiatives targeted to combat freight industry fraud. This is in addition to their existing set of computational AI and data science driven solutions like DAT iQ, which they deploy at scale over the last three or four years. By pipeline, our network software business that tech enables the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities had very nice ARR gains in the quarter driven by strong retention and customer expansion activity. Foundry continued its string of strong performance and had terrific growth for their flagship product Nuke, which enabled continued double-digit recurring revenue growth. As we mentioned last quarter foundry commenced their subscription pricing transition for Nuke and the first-half of the year had north of 60% of their new units sold under their new model ahead of their transition plan. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses led by SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid and the business has benefited by an improving census and skilled nursing assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels in patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. Turning to the second-half of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on sustained ARR momentum. As we turn to page 11, revenues in the quarter for our tech-enabled product segment were $403 million, up 19% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment were strong at 36.4% for the quarter. Across this segment, business performance and execution was exceptional. Importantly, the broad-based supply chain issues continued to ease. Neptune, our water meter, and technology product business continues to be great. In the quarter, they had record revenue performance. Importantly, Neptune continues to see increasing demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete. Given this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers\u2019 budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles. Verathon was awesome in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth and tremendous operational execution. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across their reoccurring single use products, both Bronchoscope or B-Flex and video innovation or GlideScope, as well as bladder scan capital purchases. Northern Digital or NDI was also strong in the quarter setting a record revenue for the business. A group of smaller businesses here, IPA, rf IDEAS and Inovonics were fantastic in the quarter as they substantially work through a series of nagging supply chain challenges. Relative to the second-half of the year, we expect to see high-single-digit organic revenue growth. Recall, we have a tough Q3 revenue and margin comp to lap from the prior year. Now please turn to page 13, and let's review our increased 2023 guidance. Based on our strong second quarter performance, we're raising our full-year 2023 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue, and adjusted DEPS. For 2023, we now expect total revenue growth to be around 13%, an increase from 12% plus last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full-year organic revenue outlook to be in the 7% zip codes, an increase from 6% to 7% last quarter and 5% to 6% in our original guide. As a result of our improved revenue outlook, we're increasing our debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 and $16.50, up for our prior guidance of $16.10 to $16.30. Assumed in this guidance is a tax rate trending to the high-end our 21% to 22% range. Specific to the third quarter, we're establishing our debt guidance to be in the range of $4.16 and $4.20. Now please turn with us to page 14, and then we'll look forward to answering your questions. We want to leave you with the same four points with which we started. First, the year started strong and we delivered solid second quarter results. In the quarter, we saw revenues increased 17% to $1.53 billion. This growth was underpinned with 9% organic revenue growth and 8% organic software recurring revenue growth. In addition, EBITDA margins were quite strong at 40.3%. Second, based on the strong second quarter performance, the recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers, we're increasing our full-year total and organic revenue growth outlook and increasing our full-year DEPS outlook to be between $16.36 and $16.50. Third, we're excited by the potential of Generative AI, both as it relates to internal productivity and using our application specificity to provide context for new product development ideas. We look forward to sharing progress and updates in coming quarters and years. And finally, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we've been discussing over the past several months, we have a very large pipeline of opportunities, though as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure the continued optimal deployment of our available capital. Now as we turn to your questions and if you flip to the final slide our strategic flywheel, we'll want to once again thank those of you who joined us in New York for our first ever Investor Day and for the 100s who have watched the replay over the past few months. During that long form overview of Roper, we were excited to share with you our long-term strategy, the high quality nature of our portfolio of businesses; our operating ability to improve our businesses, our process driven capital deployment approach and our compelling long-term business model that compounds cash flow in the mid-teens area. So thank you for your continued interest in Roper. And with that, let's open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Yes, thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just the first question around in Network Software, you had a very strong margin performance up over 200 points of only mid-single-digit organic growth. So I just wondered if there was anything driving that perhaps on mix or anything kind of one-time? And then also in that division, how are you thinking about second-half growth in DAT & Loadlink versus first-half?\nJason Conley: Hey, good morning, Julian. It's Jason. So yes, I mean, I think we had the strong performance across a lot of the businesses. I think the -- by the one standout is our ConstructConnect business. We acquired a bolt-on that we closed last year and we're seeing -- realizing the benefits from that deal. And then like I said, beyond that, it's just across the segment.\nNeil Hunn: And relative to your second question, second-half for DAT & Loadlink, our freight match businesses. We continue to be cautious there and conservative. We've been held that posture the whole year. DAT performed very well in the quarter, it grew high-single-digits. The broker part of the business and the data analytics part of the business remains super solid, high retention rates. But as we all know, the carrier side of the market, the excess carriers are trading out of the market and that has a weighing effect on DAT. So we've modeled that in all year long and it's playing out generally in line with what we thought here in Sarasota, maybe a touch better, but we'll just stay in line with Sarasota's expectations. And relative to the second-half for DAT, the big wildcard is what happens with Yellow and [EPSI] (ph). I mean, so we'll see what happens there could be a pickup for the spot market, if something were to turn negative on either one or both of those.\nJulian Mitchell: That's interesting. Thank you. And then just as we look at the second-half guidance, you called out in TEP the tough comp for third quarter. Just one other thing I wanted to check on the back half. It looks like the guidance implies fourth quarter DEPS doesn't really go up much sequentially in Q4. Historically, you've had often a mid-single-digit type EPS increase in Q4 sequentially. I just wondered if that was just kind of conservatism in the construct for this year. Or if there's anything specific going on?\nJason Conley: Nothing really specific sequentially. I mean, I think we've talked about a little bit about just the seasonal shutdown at Neptune. We've had that historically, but I wouldn't point to any conservatism and we've got, sort of, networks still at mid-single-digits. So maybe in the prior year, you might have seen some acceleration coming in the fourth quarter, but nothing really unusual there. What is your first question, sorry, Julian?\nJulian Mitchell: Oh, no that was really just around if there was anything on the fourth quarter to kind of call out, but it doesn't -- it sounds like this year should be fairly typical in terms of seasonality.\nJason Conley: Correct.\nNeil Hunn: Correct.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. Thanks.\nJason Conley: Thanks, Julian.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nJason Conley: Good morning.\nDeane Dray: Hey, can we start with just broadly the tone of business. There was a reference in the first quarter and I think also at the Analyst Day that you were seeing some slower customer decision making. But the way I look at this quarter with the upside on the organic side and the outlook, has that improved? And very specifically, would you measure that in new logos and SaaS conversions, but just kind of that tone of business, please?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I would characterize it. Our software businesses are playing out -- about as we expected coming into the year, right, expecting a little bit of a slowdown. So you see delayed decision making that has pushes out net new sales, but it also has the impact of having higher gross retention, because decisions are being deferred. And then also just the amount of expansion activities that we have activity we have with our customers is a little bit less, as our customers are just more cautious as they look forward. So that's playing out about as we expected. It's not acute and any one of our businesses is just sprinkled across the universe of our portfolio. Relative to TEP, I mean, it was just fantastic. We had a lot of demand in the medical businesses remains very strong especially at Verathon and CIVCO, a lot of supply chain clear up in the first-half, especially in the second quarter. And we called out very rarely do we call out the three small businesses that we did on the slide, but they had just terrific supply chain sort of performance and operational performance in the quarter.\nDeane Dray: Yes. That's really good to hear. And just as a follow-up, can we talk about the impact AI is having and how you're evaluating M&A candidates. So is there an eye towards the barriers to entry Roper is focused on these deep domain expertise types of deep vertical. So how do you look at where and how AI might be a threat to these? How do you look at the candidates in terms of where and how AI might advance their business model and just what has changed there?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I think it's certainly a consideration today. We're computationally, AI has been a consideration for a few years. Generative is newer this year. I think the thing that is nice about our portfolio, our M&A strategy is it just happens to play into the strength of where generative AI and computation AI is best suited. So more verticalized, more application-specific, more intimacy with customers. And so our M&A approach is well suited given the development of these technologies. And as always, you've heard us say this for decades, we're looking in our capital deployment. If there's a zero in the Monte Carlo, we can envision a doomsday, then we're out. We're just not going to lean into that. So we'll look at -- we always look at that. And to the extent we can dream up as zero in the Monte Carlo, because of generative computational AI, then we're not going to consider it in any way. So that's not a new thing for us. Anything to add, Jason?\nJason Conley: No, I think that's right. And any sort of content type business, we've always steered away from, and I think this is just accentuates that with the advent of AI and Generative AI.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Vruwink, Robert W. Baird & Company.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. hi, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, good morning.\nJoe Vruwink: Hey, good morning. If I go back to last quarter, I think you referenced the Leadership Summit and the business unit presidents coming together. This quarter, there was an announcement about iPipeline and Vertafore partnering together on product. Is it may be possible to connect these two things together? So by doing more to share best practices across the operating divisions, can Roper actually uncover incremental product opportunities and maybe offering a broader suite when it comes to certain end markets that are jointly served today?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I think there's definitely and demonstrably benefits for getting our leaders together unequivocally. It's going to be more in sharing best practices, sharing leadership philosophy, sharing failures and what they learn from the failure. It's going to be more about how do you lead, how do you manage, how do you inspire teams for terrific performance it's going to be less on connection with the product teams, because most of our businesses are in independent and disconnected markets and swim lanes. So if there's something that makes sense, we'll certainly do it. If it doesn't make sense, we won't. The good news about this particular iPipeline and Vertafore is it happened organically between the businesses without any push from the center. So you know that's authentic and it's going to drive value for our customers.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That's helpful. Just on the topic of generative AI. As you say, your businesses, they provide the context that the applications need, so growth retention if anything, is biased higher in many aspects. How do you think about net retention and just participating in new avenues for growth. So with some of the early products discussed today, does that really strengthen the core? Or is there a separate monetization that can happen?\nNeil Hunn: No, no. I think there's definitely monetization that could happen. It will happen over time. There's no silver bullet in the short run. We play the long game, build for long-term customer value of relationships. But there's just massive amounts of value that can be created by doing things with both computation on generative AI. And our relationship with our customers are such that we're, at least for the last 20-years, we're able to capture our fair share of the value that's created. So I don't know why that would be any different going forward. And then as we all know, there's a tremendous amount of value or productivity to capture inside the four walls of our businesses using Generative AI as well.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Thank you very much.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nJason Conley: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. I saw the announcement with IntelliTrans sort of stepping out and partnering with the product sensor business. Is that something that's just unique to IntelliTrans? Or is it something that you're doing to sort of leverage that sort of asset-light business that you have? Any thoughts there?\nNeil Hunn: No, that's very, very bespoke to IntelliTrans. I mean there's not an enterprise-wide strategy to do anything like that nor would we -- if there was, we wouldn't push it down. It's anathetical to what Roper is about. So it's very bespoke to IntelliTrans. Gold star for asking IntelliTrans question, by the way.\nAllison Poliniak: It helps also covering transports. So -- and then just on tech-enabled products, that business continues to outperform organically. You mentioned difficult comps in Q3. Is there any more color you can give us to the cadence between Q3 and Q4 to, kind of, reach that target? And what sort of drove that outperformance this quarter? Thanks.\nJason Conley: Yes. So this is Jason. I think it's a pretty consistent cadence in terms of the quarters. What I would say is the outperformance in Q3 was really across the board. We had -- Neptune continues to execute really well in their backlog. Their daily sales are up over their plan. Health care is doing really well in terms of procedures. So just executing on a kind of book-and-ship basis there. And then our -- some of our [Technical Difficulty] product businesses had some backlog that finally got cleared. So that really drove the Q3. And then the second-half, like I said, organic growth should be fairly consistent. It's just what we had last year. We had a lot of backlog clear in the third quarter that with very high-margin products. So that's sort of the comp issue that we're lapping in the third quarter.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist.\nTerry Tillman: Yes. Good morning. Can you all hear me, gentlemen?\nNeil Hunn: We can hear you perfect.\nJason Conley: Yes, all good.\nTerry Tillman: Wonderful. Happy Friday, Neil, Jason, and such. Maybe the first question, it's almost technically two questions, but I'm going to call it 1.5 questions, is actually back on Deltek, one of your biggest businesses, if not biggest business on the app software side. I'm just curious on the relative health and demand. Somebody earlier asked about macro, but how the government side is performing versus private sector side? And the second part of that first question is it seems like something with Replicon, and I think you said it's about $70 million. You could have some pretty good revenue synergy opportunities. And how do you think about that $70 million business, kind of, unleashing that product into that large Deltek installed base? And then I have a follow-up.\nNeil Hunn: So we'll call that two questions, 50 degrees. But the Deltek demand, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, our performance was solid across both government contracting and private sector. We are encouraged by the pipeline build in the quarter for Q4 and early \u201824 in government contracting. There definitely was a little bit of a lull or an air pocket in government contracting relative to the debt ceiling. And so it was nice to see activity get back to normalize or maybe slightly better than normalized activities relative to early pipeline build, so that was encouraging to see. You've got to see how that plays out, for sure. Replicon, you know, we really like this bolt-on. As we said, it's the largest bolt-on we've done at $450 million, $370 million net of the tax benefit. It's time entry without attachment to an ERP. So time only is a highly demanded solution in the PS world. It is not sold today in government contracting. And so we have not underwritten into a revenue synergy opportunity. That's not part of the $70 million or the $2 million that we talked about. But it is certainly the expectation over time is to get Deltek takes this product in other core market of government contracting.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. And thanks for being generous, yes, I guess this technically is the third question. Then on the idea of the M&A pipeline and you talked about you're just kind of working through opportunities and bespoke situations, et cetera. But compared to like 90-days ago, would you suggest that there's more -- it's more actionable on the bolt-ons versus the potential platform deals. Just maybe a temperature gauge on the stack ranking of the two types.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So it's been an interesting 90-days. So we continue to be active. Our pipeline still skews more towards bolt-ons for sure. More broadly in the market over the last 90-days, we are encouraged by the fact that there are a couple of sizable deals private that did not happen, because the buyer universe rejected the seller's expectation on value. And so we view that as in the deal ultimately did not consummate. So we view that as actually an encouraging sign around as an early indicator that valuations are going to pull in to being a more normalized with cost of capital. So we're encouraged by that. But still, our pipeline leans into the bolt-on opportunities.\nTerry Tillman: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nJason Conley: Yes, I mean, I would say. Yes, [Multiple Speakers] are down dramatically year-over-year. And so there's just a lot of assets that, at some point, need to go. And it's been 1.5 years now, so we think it's getting closer.\nTerry Tillman: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nChristopher Glynn: I wanted to touch on foundry. Curious if there's any risk of any followed or perturbations from labor strike risk? And also, if you could revisit the comments on the transition plan for that?\nNeil Hunn: Sure. So foundry, for those that aren't familiar with it, it's a business and media entertainment, that's used in post-production for a process called compositing, where you take a live action image and a computer-generated image and push them together in the single scenes. So think Game of Thrones, pretty much every seen in Game of Thrones was used as composite with foundry software as is almost any high-end production or streaming series. So as it turns out, I think this is the first time since 1960. We've had both a writer's trike and an actor's strike concurrently. So the current production of content is ceased. There is still a very active pipeline of things in post. And so it has no impact currently on foundry. The current expectation is the strikes will be resolved this year. And if that's the case, then there'll be very little impact foundry next year as they'll be back in production and sort of catch up. If it extends beyond this year, then yes, foundry will likely be negatively impacted to some extent next year. So that's just a lot of item for us. And your second question, Foundry this year commenced the transition to a subscription pricing model for their core product of Nuke. So this year, there are -- you can buy it either as a license or a subscription. As we mentioned, about 60%, north of 60% of the new units were sold on a subscription basis this year. So it's a nice transition ahead of our plan. ARR is growing double digits. And then beginning next year, it will be 100% subscription opportunity to buy in the license format. So going a little bit better than planned.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks for that.\nNeil Hunn: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nJason Conley: Good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Are you okay?\nSteve Tusa: Am I okay?\nNeil Hunn: Yes, okay. You sound a little froggy there, okay.\nSteve Tusa: No, no, no, no, it's a little bit early. Thanks for the [Multiple Speakers] I appreciate it. So just a couple of things. Can you just talk about what you expect for third quarter free cash? Maybe just talk about the deferred revenue drag you guys have had in the first-half, what's driving that? And then just what are organic bookings year-over-year for the software businesses in the second quarter? Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So we mentioned before, Frontline is a new dynamic, right, for Roper, where all of their renewals happen in the third quarter. So we're already tracking really strong just month-to-date, if you will, for the renewals there. And they actually consumed cash in the first-half, just to give you a perspective on that. I mean also, I think we historically have very strong second-half seasonality. So that, plus just some of the -- I think some of the timing of working capital in the second quarter points to a much better second-half. First-half, we usually -- we pay out incentive. We had -- this year, we had that legal settlement. So that points to sort of that seasonal change for this year. And so we're still on track to deliver north of 30% of free cash flow to revenue. And then you asked about the trends on. So if we kind of look at enterprise software bookings, and it was up sequentially a bit and up year-over-year. Not quite as strong as the first quarter, maybe like low-singles in area, which is about in line with what we had. It's obviously embedded in sort of our slowdown for the second-half for new activity.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nNeil Hunn: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, guys. This is [Dave] (ph) [Multiple Speakers] on for Brent. I appreciate you are taking some questions. Maybe just on the AI theme. I appreciate some of the color that you guys gave. I was curious, is there some sort of AI playbook that you guys are laying out for the portfolio of companies to be thinking through? Just curious how you're approaching that across the portfolio, and I appreciate some of those one-off case studies.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So Playbook, I would say, no, accelerated education across multiple fronts, yes. So what is it? What's are the possible? What are the risks? What are the IP ownership issues? What is how do you get productivity with -- in R&D, how do you get marketing lead productivity, marketing content productivity, customer service productivity. We're doing a series of teach-ins and learnings that is highly subscribed by our businesses. And so that's how we're sort of accelerating the learning across the enterprise.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe wanted to just ask about you guys often talk about the portfolio being mostly macro insulated. I think the macro hasn't been as bad as many have feared. But as you guys kind of think through that, have there been any companies that as things have softened a little bit that maybe have stuck out and maybe were a little surprising where you thought, hey, maybe these were a little bit more macro immune than they've been showing up to be?\nNeil Hunn: Look, Jason, I think, to our surprise, no. I mean, obviously, the one that gets a lot of attention is our DAT business, which grew. It's just truly exceptional the last couple of years. And then this year, it's moderated, still growing. And we talked about that quite a bit last quarter. We -- so really nothing. I mean, Neptune is solid. As we said in the prepared remarks, their customers' budgets tend to be very fixed year-to-year and not tied to housing starts, which some people think is the case, but it generally is not. Jason, anything, so surprises?\nJason Conley: I don't think so.\nNeil Hunn: There's really nothing surprising on the cyclical piece.\nJason Conley: Yes. I mean, Shannon has pointed out, maybe there's a little bit around government contracting, as I mentioned earlier, on the debt ceiling. It's not a macro point per se, but that's not clear at Deltek.\nUnidentified Analyst: I understood. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nNeil Hunn: Yes.\nJason Conley: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nJason Conley: Good morning.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, so maybe just to round out that free cash flow margin point going forward now that the seasonality has maybe changed a little bit. Should we think about them like the second quarter as being kind of like a free cash flow margin around 20% going forward as you kind of think about modeling that business?\nNeil Hunn: I mean it's going to be lower. I'm not sure if I point to a specific margin for every year. But we do make 2 federal tax payments. So that obviously just drags on the second quarter. But so it's always going to be lower than the full year. So that's how I would model it.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. All right. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess, lastly, we talked a little bit about technology-enabled products and the growth this quarter, tougher comps going forward. I'm just curious, is there a way to potentially quantify the supply chain easing impact that occurred this quarter? And then is that going to continue? I guess is that part of the headwind then potentially as you kind of -- as you think about the second-half of the year?\nNeil Hunn: That might be hard. We might have to -- I mean mid-single-digit growth is normal for that segment. And then we got to parse how much might be strength at Verathon and SIFCO that might be a little bit recurring on top of that, but then the balance may be -- the balance would be the supply chain sort of pull and a release.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, I think we can always follow-up offline. Thank you, guys.\nNeil Hunn: You bet.\nJason Conley: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn it back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "[Technical Difficulty] and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our second quarter results with you this morning, which like Q1 were quite good. As we turn to page four, let's look at today's agenda. I'll start with our second quarter enterprise highlights then ask Jason to share our financial results. After that, we'll turn to our segment specific discussion and wrap up outlining our increased 2023 enterprise guidance. So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to page five, the four main takeaways for today's call are: first, we continue to perform extremely well and had a very strong second quarter, another demonstration of the quality of our portfolio of businesses. Second, we're increasing our full-year guidance both in terms of total and organic revenue growth and adjusted debts. Third, Generative AI. We're very excited by the promise of this technology and outline reasons why today. And fourth, we remain very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to the first takeaway, a strong start to the year and a solid second quarter, we saw total revenue grow 17% and organic revenue grow 9%. Consistent with our longstanding strategy we continue to not only scale our enterprise, but also simultaneously improve its underlying quality and recurring revenue base. Importantly, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow growing 17% in the quarter. Our results this quarter are another proof point that our higher quality, less cyclical portfolio was purpose built to consistently perform at a very high level. Given the strong second quarter, we're increasing our full-year total revenue growth to be around 13%, increasing our organic revenue growth to be around 7% and increasing our full-year debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 to $16.50 or up $0.23 at the midpoint versus our previous guidance of $16.10 to $16.30. Third, relative to Gen AI, we feel we're structurally advantaged and excited by this technology as our vertical and application specific businesses, we use our specialized market positions and knowledge to provide context to these enabling technologies both to create customer value and internal productivity gains more on this during today's call. And finally, we continue to be well positioned relative to capital deployment. We remain active in the market as we evaluate and actively diligence many high quality opportunities. Jason, I'll turn the call over to you so you can walk through our second quarter results and our very strong financial position. Jason? Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to page nine and walk through our Q2 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $770 million, up 6% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins increased to 43.7% in the quarter. In this segment, we continue to see consistently strong performance across the entire group of companies. We'll start with Deltek. Deltek was once again solid across both our government contracting and private sector businesses. Importantly, Deltek continues to see momentum build with our SaaS offerings and retention rates remain at historically high levels. Also in the quarter and as Jason mentioned earlier, we announced the acquisition of Replicon for Deltek, Roper's largest bolt-on today. Replicon is a market leading timekeeping and workforce management SaaS solution focused on professional services firms and it's highly complementary to Deltek strategy. We expect Replicon to contribute north of $70 million of revenue and $24 million of EBITDA next year and we expect the deal to close during the third quarter. Finally, as it relates to Deltek, we wanted to brag on them for a moment. During the quarter, the Washington Post award Deltek, the number four top workplace at the D.C. Metro Area for large companies. As you know, we have a closely held belief that talent and culture can create long-term competitive advantage and this is certainly the case for Deltek. During Roper's ownership with Deltek, the company has increased its organic growth rate, retention levels, recurring revenue and margin structure and a big contributor to that success is the structural talent advantage that Deltek continues to build. Congrats to Mike and congrats to your entire team. Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms continues to be excellent. In the quarter, Aderant saw record bookings and continued success in the adoption and cross-sell of their SaaS solutions. Also and importantly during the quarter, Aderant launched their Generative AI enabler, MADDI. Today, MADDI is enabling two solutions outside counsel guidelines management and time entry, with plans to extend this to AR cash receipt matching and docketing over the coming months. Over time MADDI will be integrated widely across Aderant's product platforms. Generative AI for a legal space has tremendous potential. One such example in the market today is Onyx. Onyx powered by MADDI solves a massive challenge that all law firms face, namely how to navigate outside counsel guidelines or the billing requirements that clients impose on their law firms. It's fairly common for a large law firm to have to navigate 100s of 1,000s of bespoke client billing requirements. Today, Onyx uses Generative AI to extract contractual terms and convert them into business tools used in the time entry and billing processes, a true game changer. More broadly across Roper, we're excited about the potential of Generative AI and large language models. We believe given our deeply verticalized and application specific business model that our businesses are structurally advantaged given that all AI, computational and generative need context specifically dated workflows and wish to train or target the technology. Internally, we're working closely with our businesses on the productivity and product enabled opportunities associated with Gen AI. Certainly much more to come on this. Now back to the segment performance in Vertafore, our software business at tech-enabled property and casualty insurance agencies. Vertafore continues to be a great asset for us with solid performance across our core P&C business and their recent MGA Solutions bolt-on. Our Healthcare/IT businesses also performed very well in the quarter with growth in each of our Healthcare/IT franchises, Clinisys, Data Innovations and Strata. Frontline also continues to deliver for us. Frontline's mission is to empower the frontline of education. As many of you know, the hiring of teachers and administrative staff is particularly challenging and frontline software solutions better equip K-12 school district to navigate these challenges. Because of this, frontline solutions are mission critical and of high importance to their school district customers. As such, frontline's net retention is consistently strong. Looking to the second-half of the year, we expect to see organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digits area for the segment. Overall, very strong results and outlook for this segment. Turning to page 10. Revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $358 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 54.2%. As with our Application Software segment, growth and performance was solid across the segment. Relative to business specific comments, we'll start with our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT & Loadlink, both of which grew in the quarter despite continued challenges across the broader freight and logistics markets. I'll remind you that our businesses are critical to the operation and execution of the North American spot freight market. In addition and importantly the spot market is a long-term secular beneficiary in terms of the volume of future great ships. Throughout and across the freight and economic cycle DAT & Loadlink continue to innovate and launch new products and offerings to help drive enhanced customer value and share of wallet. As we speak, DAT is launching a Generative AI enabled solution among other initiatives targeted to combat freight industry fraud. This is in addition to their existing set of computational AI and data science driven solutions like DAT iQ, which they deploy at scale over the last three or four years. By pipeline, our network software business that tech enables the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities had very nice ARR gains in the quarter driven by strong retention and customer expansion activity. Foundry continued its string of strong performance and had terrific growth for their flagship product Nuke, which enabled continued double-digit recurring revenue growth. As we mentioned last quarter foundry commenced their subscription pricing transition for Nuke and the first-half of the year had north of 60% of their new units sold under their new model ahead of their transition plan. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses led by SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid and the business has benefited by an improving census and skilled nursing assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels in patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. Turning to the second-half of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on sustained ARR momentum. As we turn to page 11, revenues in the quarter for our tech-enabled product segment were $403 million, up 19% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment were strong at 36.4% for the quarter. Across this segment, business performance and execution was exceptional. Importantly, the broad-based supply chain issues continued to ease. Neptune, our water meter, and technology product business continues to be great. In the quarter, they had record revenue performance. Importantly, Neptune continues to see increasing demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete. Given this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles. Verathon was awesome in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth and tremendous operational execution. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across their reoccurring single use products, both Bronchoscope or B-Flex and video innovation or GlideScope, as well as bladder scan capital purchases. Northern Digital or NDI was also strong in the quarter setting a record revenue for the business. A group of smaller businesses here, IPA, rf IDEAS and Inovonics were fantastic in the quarter as they substantially work through a series of nagging supply chain challenges. Relative to the second-half of the year, we expect to see high-single-digit organic revenue growth. Recall, we have a tough Q3 revenue and margin comp to lap from the prior year. Now please turn to page 13, and let's review our increased 2023 guidance. Based on our strong second quarter performance, we're raising our full-year 2023 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue, and adjusted DEPS. For 2023, we now expect total revenue growth to be around 13%, an increase from 12% plus last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full-year organic revenue outlook to be in the 7% zip codes, an increase from 6% to 7% last quarter and 5% to 6% in our original guide. As a result of our improved revenue outlook, we're increasing our debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 and $16.50, up for our prior guidance of $16.10 to $16.30. Assumed in this guidance is a tax rate trending to the high-end our 21% to 22% range. Specific to the third quarter, we're establishing our debt guidance to be in the range of $4.16 and $4.20. Now please turn with us to page 14, and then we'll look forward to answering your questions. We want to leave you with the same four points with which we started. First, the year started strong and we delivered solid second quarter results. In the quarter, we saw revenues increased 17% to $1.53 billion. This growth was underpinned with 9% organic revenue growth and 8% organic software recurring revenue growth. In addition, EBITDA margins were quite strong at 40.3%. Second, based on the strong second quarter performance, the recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers, we're increasing our full-year total and organic revenue growth outlook and increasing our full-year DEPS outlook to be between $16.36 and $16.50. Third, we're excited by the potential of Generative AI, both as it relates to internal productivity and using our application specificity to provide context for new product development ideas. We look forward to sharing progress and updates in coming quarters and years. And finally, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we've been discussing over the past several months, we have a very large pipeline of opportunities, though as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure the continued optimal deployment of our available capital. Now as we turn to your questions and if you flip to the final slide our strategic flywheel, we'll want to once again thank those of you who joined us in New York for our first ever Investor Day and for the 100s who have watched the replay over the past few months. During that long form overview of Roper, we were excited to share with you our long-term strategy, the high quality nature of our portfolio of businesses; our operating ability to improve our businesses, our process driven capital deployment approach and our compelling long-term business model that compounds cash flow in the mid-teens area. So thank you for your continued interest in Roper. And with that, let's open it up to your questions. And relative to your second question, second-half for DAT & Loadlink, our freight match businesses. We continue to be cautious there and conservative. We've been held that posture the whole year. DAT performed very well in the quarter, it grew high-single-digits. The broker part of the business and the data analytics part of the business remains super solid, high retention rates. But as we all know, the carrier side of the market, the excess carriers are trading out of the market and that has a weighing effect on DAT. So we've modeled that in all year long and it's playing out generally in line with what we thought here in Sarasota, maybe a touch better, but we'll just stay in line with Sarasota's expectations. And relative to the second-half for DAT, the big wildcard is what happens with Yellow and [EPSI] (ph). I mean, so we'll see what happens there could be a pickup for the spot market, if something were to turn negative on either one or both of those. Correct. Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Yes. I would characterize it. Our software businesses are playing out -- about as we expected coming into the year, right, expecting a little bit of a slowdown. So you see delayed decision making that has pushes out net new sales, but it also has the impact of having higher gross retention, because decisions are being deferred. And then also just the amount of expansion activities that we have activity we have with our customers is a little bit less, as our customers are just more cautious as they look forward. So that's playing out about as we expected. It's not acute and any one of our businesses is just sprinkled across the universe of our portfolio. Relative to TEP, I mean, it was just fantastic. We had a lot of demand in the medical businesses remains very strong especially at Verathon and CIVCO, a lot of supply chain clear up in the first-half, especially in the second quarter. And we called out very rarely do we call out the three small businesses that we did on the slide, but they had just terrific supply chain sort of performance and operational performance in the quarter. Yes. I think it's certainly a consideration today. We're computationally, AI has been a consideration for a few years. Generative is newer this year. I think the thing that is nice about our portfolio, our M&A strategy is it just happens to play into the strength of where generative AI and computation AI is best suited. So more verticalized, more application-specific, more intimacy with customers. And so our M&A approach is well suited given the development of these technologies. And as always, you've heard us say this for decades, we're looking in our capital deployment. If there's a zero in the Monte Carlo, we can envision a doomsday, then we're out. We're just not going to lean into that. So we'll look at -- we always look at that. And to the extent we can dream up as zero in the Monte Carlo, because of generative computational AI, then we're not going to consider it in any way. So that's not a new thing for us. Anything to add, Jason? Hey, good morning. Yes. I think there's definitely and demonstrably benefits for getting our leaders together unequivocally. It's going to be more in sharing best practices, sharing leadership philosophy, sharing failures and what they learn from the failure. It's going to be more about how do you lead, how do you manage, how do you inspire teams for terrific performance it's going to be less on connection with the product teams, because most of our businesses are in independent and disconnected markets and swim lanes. So if there's something that makes sense, we'll certainly do it. If it doesn't make sense, we won't. The good news about this particular iPipeline and Vertafore is it happened organically between the businesses without any push from the center. So you know that's authentic and it's going to drive value for our customers. No, no. I think there's definitely monetization that could happen. It will happen over time. There's no silver bullet in the short run. We play the long game, build for long-term customer value of relationships. But there's just massive amounts of value that can be created by doing things with both computation on generative AI. And our relationship with our customers are such that we're, at least for the last 20-years, we're able to capture our fair share of the value that's created. So I don't know why that would be any different going forward. And then as we all know, there's a tremendous amount of value or productivity to capture inside the four walls of our businesses using Generative AI as well. Thank you. No, that's very, very bespoke to IntelliTrans. I mean there's not an enterprise-wide strategy to do anything like that nor would we -- if there was, we wouldn't push it down. It's anathetical to what Roper is about. So it's very bespoke to IntelliTrans. Gold star for asking IntelliTrans question, by the way. Thank you. We can hear you perfect. So we'll call that two questions, 50 degrees. But the Deltek demand, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, our performance was solid across both government contracting and private sector. We are encouraged by the pipeline build in the quarter for Q4 and early \u201824 in government contracting. There definitely was a little bit of a lull or an air pocket in government contracting relative to the debt ceiling. And so it was nice to see activity get back to normalize or maybe slightly better than normalized activities relative to early pipeline build, so that was encouraging to see. You've got to see how that plays out, for sure. Replicon, you know, we really like this bolt-on. As we said, it's the largest bolt-on we've done at $450 million, $370 million net of the tax benefit. It's time entry without attachment to an ERP. So time only is a highly demanded solution in the PS world. It is not sold today in government contracting. And so we have not underwritten into a revenue synergy opportunity. That's not part of the $70 million or the $2 million that we talked about. But it is certainly the expectation over time is to get Deltek takes this product in other core market of government contracting. Yes. So it's been an interesting 90-days. So we continue to be active. Our pipeline still skews more towards bolt-ons for sure. More broadly in the market over the last 90-days, we are encouraged by the fact that there are a couple of sizable deals private that did not happen, because the buyer universe rejected the seller's expectation on value. And so we view that as in the deal ultimately did not consummate. So we view that as actually an encouraging sign around as an early indicator that valuations are going to pull in to being a more normalized with cost of capital. So we're encouraged by that. But still, our pipeline leans into the bolt-on opportunities. Good morning. Sure. So foundry, for those that aren't familiar with it, it's a business and media entertainment, that's used in post-production for a process called compositing, where you take a live action image and a computer-generated image and push them together in the single scenes. So think Game of Thrones, pretty much every seen in Game of Thrones was used as composite with foundry software as is almost any high-end production or streaming series. So as it turns out, I think this is the first time since 1960. We've had both a writer's trike and an actor's strike concurrently. So the current production of content is ceased. There is still a very active pipeline of things in post. And so it has no impact currently on foundry. The current expectation is the strikes will be resolved this year. And if that's the case, then there'll be very little impact foundry next year as they'll be back in production and sort of catch up. If it extends beyond this year, then yes, foundry will likely be negatively impacted to some extent next year. So that's just a lot of item for us. And your second question, Foundry this year commenced the transition to a subscription pricing model for their core product of Nuke. So this year, there are -- you can buy it either as a license or a subscription. As we mentioned, about 60%, north of 60% of the new units were sold on a subscription basis this year. So it's a nice transition ahead of our plan. ARR is growing double digits. And then beginning next year, it will be 100% subscription opportunity to buy in the license format. So going a little bit better than planned. You bet. Good morning. Are you okay? Yes, okay. You sound a little froggy there, okay. Yes. So we mentioned before, Frontline is a new dynamic, right, for Roper, where all of their renewals happen in the third quarter. So we're already tracking really strong just month-to-date, if you will, for the renewals there. And they actually consumed cash in the first-half, just to give you a perspective on that. I mean also, I think we historically have very strong second-half seasonality. So that, plus just some of the -- I think some of the timing of working capital in the second quarter points to a much better second-half. First-half, we usually -- we pay out incentive. We had -- this year, we had that legal settlement. So that points to sort of that seasonal change for this year. And so we're still on track to deliver north of 30% of free cash flow to revenue. And then you asked about the trends on. So if we kind of look at enterprise software bookings, and it was up sequentially a bit and up year-over-year. Not quite as strong as the first quarter, maybe like low-singles in area, which is about in line with what we had. It's obviously embedded in sort of our slowdown for the second-half for new activity. Yes. Yes. So Playbook, I would say, no, accelerated education across multiple fronts, yes. So what is it? What's are the possible? What are the risks? What are the IP ownership issues? What is how do you get productivity with -- in R&D, how do you get marketing lead productivity, marketing content productivity, customer service productivity. We're doing a series of teach-ins and learnings that is highly subscribed by our businesses. And so that's how we're sort of accelerating the learning across the enterprise. Look, Jason, I think, to our surprise, no. I mean, obviously, the one that gets a lot of attention is our DAT business, which grew. It's just truly exceptional the last couple of years. And then this year, it's moderated, still growing. And we talked about that quite a bit last quarter. We -- so really nothing. I mean, Neptune is solid. As we said in the prepared remarks, their customers' budgets tend to be very fixed year-to-year and not tied to housing starts, which some people think is the case, but it generally is not. Jason, anything, so surprises? There's really nothing surprising on the cyclical piece. Yes. Good morning. I mean it's going to be lower. I'm not sure if I point to a specific margin for every year. But we do make 2 federal tax payments. So that obviously just drags on the second quarter. But so it's always going to be lower than the full year. So that's how I would model it. That might be hard. We might have to -- I mean mid-single-digit growth is normal for that segment. And then we got to parse how much might be strength at Verathon and SIFCO that might be a little bit recurring on top of that, but then the balance may be -- the balance would be the supply chain sort of pull and a release. You bet."

            "name": "Jason Conley",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil, and I hope everyone is doing well this morning. Turning to slide six, the seconf quarter was another good post in 2023. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, which was up 17% over prior year. Organic growth was 9%, which was led by 8% software recurring revenue growth across the enterprise and outsized growth 19% in our tech enable product segment. EBITDA increased 20% to $617 million with EBITDA operating leverage of 46%. Notably, margin expanded across all three segments in the quarter. DEPS of $4.12 was $0.12 above the high-end of our guidance range and 20% above prior year. DEPS growth was in line with EBITDA growth given the offsetting impact of a higher tax rate and lower net interest expense. Moving to free cash flow. As a reminder, the second quarter is always our lowest conversion quarter in the year as we make two federal tax payments. We delivered $295 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was up 17% over prior year. As I previously mentioned, Frontline's cash flow is seasonally weighted to Q3 and Q4, especially in Q3 and this is in line with our K-12 customers' annual renewals. So we expect a meaningful increase to cash flow in the second half. Taking broader view of cash flow on this slide, recall that we acquired Vertafore in 2020 and had a one-time cash tax benefit of $120 million, of which about $60 million benefited the second quarter of 2021. We've therefore had very strong multi-year cash flow performance when normalizing for this 2021 tax item. For the year, we are confident that free cash flow will be greater than 30% of revenue. Turning to our balance sheet on slide seven. Our net leverage sits at 2.2 times at the end of the quarter with about $6.7 billion of debt and just under $1.5 billion of cash against our TTM EBITDA of $2.35 million. Also our $3.5 billion revolver remains fully undrawn. To summarize, we have significant acquisition capacity and remain quite active in many bespoke processes. To that end, in Q3, we expect to close on Replicon, which is a bolt-on acquisition for our Deltek business with a purchase price of $450 million or about $370 million net of a long-term cash tax benefit. Neil will discuss the details around this exciting addition to the Deltek platform in the segment discussion. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk about our segment performance and outlook. Neil? Hey, good morning, Julian. It's Jason. So yes, I mean, I think we had the strong performance across a lot of the businesses. I think the -- by the one standout is our ConstructConnect business. We acquired a bolt-on that we closed last year and we're seeing -- realizing the benefits from that deal. And then like I said, beyond that, it's just across the segment. Nothing really specific sequentially. I mean, I think we've talked about a little bit about just the seasonal shutdown at Neptune. We've had that historically, but I wouldn't point to any conservatism and we've got, sort of, networks still at mid-single-digits. So maybe in the prior year, you might have seen some acceleration coming in the fourth quarter, but nothing really unusual there. What is your first question, sorry, Julian? Correct. Thanks, Julian. Good morning. No, I think that's right. And any sort of content type business, we've always steered away from, and I think this is just accentuates that with the advent of AI and Generative AI. Thanks, Joe. Yes. So this is Jason. I think it's a pretty consistent cadence in terms of the quarters. What I would say is the outperformance in Q3 was really across the board. We had -- Neptune continues to execute really well in their backlog. Their daily sales are up over their plan. Health care is doing really well in terms of procedures. So just executing on a kind of book-and-ship basis there. And then our -- some of our [Technical Difficulty] product businesses had some backlog that finally got cleared. So that really drove the Q3. And then the second-half, like I said, organic growth should be fairly consistent. It's just what we had last year. We had a lot of backlog clear in the third quarter that with very high-margin products. So that's sort of the comp issue that we're lapping in the third quarter. Yes, all good. Yes, I mean, I would say. Yes, [Multiple Speakers] are down dramatically year-over-year. And so there's just a lot of assets that, at some point, need to go. And it's been 1.5 years now, so we think it's getting closer. Good morning. I don't think so. Yes. I mean, Shannon has pointed out, maybe there's a little bit around government contracting, as I mentioned earlier, on the debt ceiling. It's not a macro point per se, but that's not clear at Deltek. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks, Joe."

[Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we used a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indicor. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now, if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Zach and we hope everyone is doing well this morning. We're looking forward to sharing our Q1 results with you which were quite good. As we turn to Page 4, let's look at today's agenda. We'll start with our enterprise highlights and financial results, then turn to our segment-specific discussion and wrap up discussing our raised 2023 enterprise guidance. So with that, let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the 3 main takeaways for today's call are, first, the year is off to a strong operational and financial start as our higher-quality, enhanced portfolio is obviously performing really well; second, we're increasing our full year guidance both in terms of organic revenue growth and adjusted DEPS; and third, we continue to be very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to our first takeaway, a strong start to the year, we saw total revenue grow of 15% and organic revenue grow 8%. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we continue to not only scale our enterprise but also simultaneously improve its underlying quality and recurring revenue base. Importantly, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow margins in excess of 30%. Our results this quarter are another proof point that our higher-quality, less cyclical portfolio was purpose-built to consistently perform at a very high level. Finally and also during the quarter, we held our first ever Roper Leadership Summit, where we had our 27 business unit presidents together and shared best practices and learnings across a variety of topics, including strategy development, strategy enablement and team and talent. While honoring our high trust autonomous model, the operating and corporate teams left feeling a true sense of community. It was a terrific week. Given the strong start to the year, we're increasing our full year organic growth outlook 100 basis points from 5% to 6% to 6% to 7% and increasing our full year DEPS guidance to be to $16.10 to $16.30 or $15.10 at the midpoint. Our previous diluted EPS guide was $15.90 to $16.20. And finally, we continue to be well positioned relative to capital deployment. We remain quite active in the market as we evaluate an actively diligent many high-quality opportunities. Jason, I'll turn the call over to you so you can walk through our first quarter results and our strong financial position. Jason?\nJason Conley: Thanks, Neil and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Turning to Slide 6. We're very pleased with how Q1 shaped up. Revenue came in at $1.47 billion or 15% over prior year. This was through a combination of strong organic growth of 8% and an 8% contribution from acquisitions, led by Frontline and this was slightly offset by a 1% FX headwind. Growth was broad-based across the segments and a little better than expected. Broadly speaking, customer demand was favorable in the quarter and order pipelines remain strong. EBITDA was $582 million or 15% of our prior year with margins roughly flat and in line with expectations. DEPS of $3.90 was up 19% over prior year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range of $3.80 to $3.84. Free cash flow of $445 million was 4% higher than prior year. In our Q4 earnings call, we highlighted a $45 million settlement of a patent dispute for certain Verathon sales dating back to 2004. We paid that this quarter, so adjusted for the settlement, free cash would be 33% of revenue and up 14% over prior year. We saw very good cash performance, especially in our software businesses. Our Q1 renewals and related collections came in strong as expected. As I mentioned last quarter, Frontline will collect most of the renewals in the third quarter. So it's a bit of a drag on conversion in the first half. So overall, just a really great start to 2023. Now turning to Slide 7, we'll spin through our balance sheet. Coming off solid Q1 cash flow performance, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. Gross debt was around $6.7 billion and our cash balance has grown to just under $1.2 billion which yields net debt just shy of $5.5 billion. This puts our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 2.4 which was down from 2.7 at year-end. This, coupled with our undrawn revolver of $3.5 billion gives us capacity to deploy $4 billion or more in the near term. To that end, we've been quite active in 2023, evaluating a number of platform and bolt-on opportunities. As always, we will remain disciplined and patient in our capital deployment process. With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk about our segment performance and outlook. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to Page 9 and walk through our Q1 highlights for Application Software segment. Revenues here were $761 million, up 6% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 43.2%. Performance in this segment was strong across the board. To highlight a few of our business' performance, we'll start with Deltek. Deltek was solid. As we mentioned last quarter, Deltek did see some slower customer decision-making but that was largely rectified this quarter. Deltek had double-digit bookings in the quarter with strength across both enterprise class and SMB-sized customers as well as government contracting and private sector solutions. As usual, both gross and net retention at Deltek remained strong and consistent with recent history. Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms, continues to compete and win and take share from our competitors. In the quarter, Aderant experienced record bookings and continued success in the adoption of their SaaS solutions. Great job by Chris, Rafi and the entire Aderant team. Vertafore, our software business at tech-enabled property and casualty insurance agencies, posted another solid quarter and continues to perform quite well for us. Of particular note, Vertafore's recent acquisition of MGA Systems, a software solution targeted to manage general agents, or MGAs, is proving to be highly strategic and bookings activity is tracking ahead of plan. Frontline continues to perform quite well for us in the first couple of quarters of ownership. Frontline's mission is to empower the front line of education. As many of you know, hiring of teachers and administrative staff is particularly challenging and Frontline software solutions better equip K-12 school districts to navigate these challenges. Because of this, frontline solutions are mission-critical and of high importance to their school district customers. For the segment, EBITDA margins were down 90 basis points year-over-year, in line with our expectations. Our Acute Care software businesses, especially CliniSys, Data Innovations and Strata are ramping up their implementation capacity based on recent bookings momentum. We expect to see similar margins in Q2. Looking to the balance of the year, we expect to see organic growth in the mid-single-digit area for this segment based on our leading market positions and growth in recurring revenue. Turning to Page 10. Revenues in the quarter for Network Software segment were $355 million, up 6% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 53.1%. As with our Application Software segment, growth and performance was broad-based across this segment. Relative to business-specific comments, we'll start with our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink which both grew nicely in the quarter. While freight market conditions are softer than this time last year, our businesses in this space are critical to the operation and execution of the spot freight market. In addition and importantly, the spot market is a long-term secular beneficiary in terms of the volume of future freight shipments. Throughout and across the freight and economic cycle, DAT and Loadlink continue to innovate and launch new products and offerings to help drive enhanced customer value and share of wallet with the current product strategy focused on tech enabling the connectivity between brokers and carriers. iPipeline, our network software business that tech enables the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities, is coming off a terrific 2022 and continued its high level of execution this quarter with very strong bookings, retention and customer expansions. Foundry continued its string of strong performance in the quarter and had terrific seat growth for their flagship product Newk [ph] which enabled continued double-digit recurring revenue growth. As we mentioned last quarter, Foundry commenced their subscription pricing transition for Newk [ph] and in Q1 had north of 50% of the new seats sold under their new model ahead of their plan. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid and the business has benefited by an improving census in skilled nursing, assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels in patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. Turning to the balance of the year. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on broad and sustained growth across this group. As we turn to Page 11. Revenues in the quarter for our Tech-enabled Products segment were $354 million, up 14% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 34.7% in the quarter. Across the segment, business performance and execution was solid. Importantly, the broad-based supply chain issues continue to wane. Though we're not entirely out of the woods, we can now see a path to a more normalized supply chain environment. Neptune, our water meter and technology product business, continues to be just great. In the quarter, they had record revenue performance and set records for backlog levels. Importantly, Neptune continues to see increasing demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic static meters. We remain bullish on Neptune and the market in which they compete as this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles. Great job at Neptune and congrats. Verathon was strong in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across the reoccurring single-use products, both bronchoscope or B-flex [ph] and video innovation or GlideScope as well as bladder scan capital purchases. Importantly, Verathon has 4 product launches scheduled for the next few months which will help continue their market share gains and momentum. Northern Digital or NDI was also strong in the quarter and continued to see terrific demand for their optical and EM solutions. NDI's enabling measurement technology is used by scores and medical product OEMs and solutions such as robotic-assisted surgery and across multiple cardiac-specific modalities. NDI's high level of market focus and operational discipline will enable them to continue to be the market share leader for these measurement technologies long into the future. Our outlook for the balance of the year for this segment has improved to be in the low double-digit area and is based on continued strong orders and improving manufacturing productivity at Neptune as well as an improved growth outlook across our medical product businesses. Now please turn to Page 13 and let's review our increased 2023 guidance. For 2023, we expect total revenue growth to be north of 12%. In addition, we're updating our organic revenue growth outlook to be in the 6% to 7% range, an increase from our original guidance of 5% to 6%. As a result, we're increasing our DEPS guidance to be in the range of $16.10 and $16.30 in up from our guidance of $15.90 to $16.20, assuming that this guidance is a tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. Specific to the second quarter, we're establishing our DEPS guidance is to be in the $3.96 to $4 range. Now please turn with us to Page 14 and then Jason and I will look forward to answering your questions. As we turn to Page 14, we want to leave you with the same 3 points with which we started. First, 2023 is off to a great start. We saw revenues increase 15% to $1.47 billion in the quarter. This growth was underpinned with 8% organic revenue growth and 8% recurring revenue growth. In addition, margins were quite strong. This quarter's financial and operational performance is yet another proof point of our capabilities and frankly, the expectations of our improved higher-quality portfolio of businesses. Most importantly, our revenue growth translated to impressive cash flow growth with our underlying free cash flow growing 14%. As you know, we view cash flow growth as the best measure of performance. Second, based on the strong start to the year, the higher recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers, we are increasing our full year organic revenue growth outlook to be between 6% and 7% and increasing our full year DEPS to be between $16.10 an $16.30. Finally, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we discussed during our Investor Day last month, we have a very large universe and pipeline of opportunities, though, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. Now as we turn to your questions and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we want to thank those of you who joined us in New York or online last month for our first ever Investor Day. During that long-form overview of Roper, we were excited to share with you our long-term strategy, the high-quality nature of our portfolio of businesses, our operating ability to improve our businesses, our process-driven capital deployment approach and are compelling long-term business model that compounds cash flow in the mid-teens area. So, thank you for your continued interest in Roper. And with that, let's open it up to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: It was great to see everyone in New York last month. Just maybe we can start off and it's a bit of a follow-up from last quarter with Deltek on some of the slowing in decision-making. This is kind of what everyone is watching, might there be any kind of fallout from bank turmoil or read through in the construction markets and so forth. But the idea of slower customer decision making, maybe just give us an update on how that played out, time to sign contracts, any new logos. Just any color there would be helpful.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. Sure, Deane. Happy to talk about it. it's something that we spent a tremendous amount of time talking to our leadership teams, our group executives about, trying to understand the signal. To set the obvious context, we spent the last several years trying to really work out the cyclicality of the portfolio and we're also in these very small niche markets where the customers tend to be not that cyclical. So the signal for us is faint. It's not nonexistent but it's faint. Last quarter, we certainly talked about Deltek and them having some slower customer demand, as we said in the prepared comments, that largely, it's not fully rectified itself this most recent quarter. Two or three quarters ago, we talked about the same thing going on a PowerPlan, that rectified itself the subsequent quarter as well. Some of the other macro things that we listen to, the amount of property casualty insurance written as a sign of sort of business formation or business growth continued to grow, life insurance applications that got steady. DAT, the number of carriers we expected and certainly have seen for a couple of quarters, carrier declines at touch. But that meaningfully moderated in Q1. So we continue to listen for it but -- and we certainly have planned for the second half of the year, concern outlook relative to a slowdown. But the signal's faint at the moment. Jason, anything you want to add to that?\nJason Conley: Yes I would just say our software bookings were up high single digits year-over-year in the quarter. So that just put some math behind what he was saying.\nDeane Dray: Great. That's really helpful and appreciate kind of that walk through the portfolio there on sensitivity. And then just second question, it was nice to see the boost in organic revenue guide for the back of the year in tech-enabled products up low double digits. And just with the expectation, look, Neptune continues to do really well and we see that in the industry. That tends to be a bit steady. So how is it that you're seeing this acceleration and must be also on the medical side, too?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. There's 3 parts to this -- macro parts to this segment. There's Neptune, medical products and then a couple of small RF product businesses, all 3, they have and -- we, at corporate, sort of increased the outlook for the balance of the year. Neptune has just continued incredible order growth and then terrific performance out of the factory at Neptune which gives us confidence that they can chew into a little bit more of the backlog than we maybe originally thought coming into the year. At the medical product businesses, as we all know, last year, medical procedure volumes were down in the 7% to 8% range. We plan for that to continue this year. It's actually been a little bit better than that and that flowed through at Verathon, CIVCO directly and less directly through NDI. And then the Inovonics and RF Ideas, the RF product businesses, have been riddled with supply chain challenges and coming into the year. We assume those would continue and they meaningfully improved in Q1. So it's a little bit uplift across the board that gives us the confidence to take the guide up in that segment.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: I know it's not -- there isn't any particular business that's game changing for you in any particular quarter. But when you think about freight matching and I know the truckers have had some tough time this quarter. Some of the guidance has been a little cautious, tough comps, et cetera. How linked is your freight matching business to kind of the miles driven and the B2C kind of truck market? Is there a direct link there? I would assume there is but I'm just -- it doesn't seem like you had really any major problems in DAT this quarter.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. DAT grew in the quarter. Year-over-year, it grew sequentially. So -- but there is a link. It's an indirect link. We're not paid per mile driven, we're not paid on any utilization metric. It's a fixed subscription on both the broker side and the carrier side. The reason DAT historically tends to be less cyclical than the market in which it operates, a couple of things. One is you have this tension between the cyclical nature and the secular growth driver, where the spot market is just winning more market share of the total freight volumes. So you have more volume generally coming into the spot market over the long arc of time. And the simple version for why that is, is because the spot market is becoming more liquid or easier to transact in as it tech enables itself, of which DAT is a participant and enabler of that. The second thing is understanding the dynamic between what the role the spot market plays in a booming versus a waning market, where in the -- and it's about the pricing dynamic between contract pricing and spot pricing. Spot pricing changes daily, contract pricing changes on a rolling year basis. And so when the market is very hot, you obviously have more demand for carriers and there is supply, rates up in the spot market. It invites capacity addition. And that's what's driven DAT's growth for the last couple of 3 years as you have more carriers coming into the market. When the freight market slows, you actually have spot pricing below that of contract and you actually, at that moment, start seeing some of the contract freight come into the spot market so the shippers can save money. So it provides you a floor for the demand of carriers. And so historically, DAT grows very nicely in upmarket and grow slower in the downmarket for those couple of reasons.\nScott Davis: That's interesting. Hate to [indiscernible] here but I'm just going to do it anyways. What's the -- how does this business change over time? Like does AI become a big enabler and a predictor and help kind of drive that liquidity that you talked about, Neil? How does technology, I guess, change the game and help you guys gain share over time, I think is a better question.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I mean -- there's a lot of tech currents and cross currents in this space. At the core of it, today, I still think on average, there's between 8 and 10 phone calls that go between a broker and a carrier to actually broker a load. Obviously, what we're all trying to do is take that to 0. DAT is a big part of their product road map is to tech enable that. So there's AI in the match, there's AI in the routing, there's AI in future trucks going from Cincinnati, Chicago, it's going to be there on Tuesday at 3. How does it have a pickup in Chicago back to where it wants to go 4 hours later or whatever the time frame is. There's a lot of AI that can go into that. But the principle, the true unlock for the industry is to take the -- make the match more efficient and that's where most of the technology investment is going today.\nScott Davis: Okay, that's helpful.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist.\nTerry Tillman: Congrats on the quarter. So the first question, I guess, is on the Frontline because that was the last major platform acquisition. I think you all talked about $370 million of revenue, expected contribution and $170 million EBITDA. And I think also you said it was a stub period, it was in the 80s and 4Q. What I'm curious about is how is it tracking to those targets. And I did notice they just announced a new HCM suite, there's a new CRO there. So it seems like there's some dynamic things going on. Just maybe double-clicking on Frontline and then I had a follow-up for Jason.\nNeil Hunn: You do the -- you take the first one.\nJason Conley: I take the first one. Yes. So they're tracking on their forecast. As you know, they're a business that has large renewals in the third and fourth quarter. And so we'll expect the business to pick up sequentially in the second half but there are definitely on track for their revenue and EBITDA numbers of $370 million, $175 million.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. And as it relates to the new products and a couple of new leaders, we're certainly excited to have Bill a new CFO, Scott, our new COO; and Curtis, the new Chief Client Operations Officer joined. It's often case times the case. There's a few leadership changes that happen in the first year or so of ownership. And so that was expected, we're excited to have this team. It's an incredible group that's joined us. The thing that we -- that I'm particularly excited about and proud of in the first couple of quarters of ownership of Frontline is the strategic choice they've made. As a pattern we see from a lot of companies that come out of private equity is very limited choice that's made, so they try to do too many things and not do them well. And so very quickly, Frontline doubled down on client experience and R&D productivity and actually made a choice to take a little bit of resource out of go-to-market which makes complete sense when you have 85% or 90% coverage of the customers. And the entire strategy or the principal here strategy is to focus on cross-selling, up-selling. You need to deliver a tremendous experience, hence, to focus on client experience and need to be able to innovate and sell them more products, hence the deployment to R&D. So we love the choice that's been made there and excited for what that yields in the future.\nTerry Tillman: That's great color. I guess just a follow-up for Jason is you were able to call out the adjustment from the settlement. So it was up 14% in terms of the free cash flow at low 30s on a free cash flow margin. Should we think about that for the remainder of the year in terms of kind of that mid-teens growth and maintaining a low 30s free cash flow margin?\nJason Conley: Yes, that's right. We're on track to deliver north of 30% free cash flow. As I mentioned, the second half is going to be better than the first half with the renewals at Frontline. But yes, we're still on track there.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: A couple of the businesses that you guys didn't mention but I think to Deane's question around what's going on out there. ConstructConnect, what are you seeing there? And then perhaps Clinisys, another one of your kind of big ones.\nNeil Hunn: Sure. So ConstructConnect, as we talked about in the past, tends to be a countercyclical business. For those that are less familiar, ConstructConnect for simplicity has a near perfect database of every commercial construction project that's in the planning phase. And so if you're a general contractor, a trade contractor, a building product manufacturer, you're generally quite interested in understanding for planning purposes, for bidding a project purposes what's in the stage of development planning. When the construction market is quite hot, general contractors and subs have more work that they can do. There's less utility and value in paying a subscription fee for future projects that are in the queue. When the amount of work starts to slow down, there is increased utility in that. So when I look back and back test ConstructConnect over a couple of cycles, it has a clear countercyclical demand behavior attached to it. So the market, we think, will be coming to it. As a general matter, ConstructConnect has maybe modestly underperformed our hopes. It's been more of a low single-digit growth business. Our expectation is that it should be mid. And we're quite confident with the current strategy that will climb to there and get to there. We have a great leader that came out from Deltek a couple of years ago, Matt Straza, the operational discipline, the strategy, the go-to-market sort of prowess is just at the next level. And so we're quite confident that we're going to be able to reach our expectations of mid there. CliniSys has been nothing short of great. Simpson, who's been -- who has integrated the U.S. Sunquest business with the European business, has just done that almost without error. It's been terrific. The business grew. The combined business grew in the quarter. We haven't been able to say that for quite some time given the drag of the U.S. business. We continue to be just tremendously strong in the U.K. As you know, we're 1 of 3 or 4 strategic IT vendors to the NHS as we run something like 80% or 85% of the laboratory network in the U.K. The pan-European strength continues. For instance, we run the largest health system in France, in APP, the Paris system. And in the U.S., some of the strength comes from the fact that we now have a product offering that is for laboratories outside of that of health care. So think environmental, toxicology, water, et cetera which is showing some early signs of promise. And so a lot of congratulations to Simpson and Andy, the CFO and we're excited to see what happens at Clinisys.\nSteve Tusa: Great. And then just one last one on free cash flow. It's a very pretty strong quarter, upside surprise, at least versus what we were expecting. A little bit bigger of a drag from deferred but maybe a bit lower cash taxes or something. Just talk about the moving parts there and how you expect that to trend sequentially over the next couple of quarters on free cash.\nJason Conley: Sure. Yes, I can take that, Steve. So yes, the deferred revenue is down or, I guess, the consumption of cash in the first quarter because of Frontline, right? So they -- you'll see that spike back up in the third quarter with those renewals. It was, overall, deferred revenue outside of that was in line with expectations. It was fairly flat to the fourth quarter. And then on taxes, we typically make 2 tax payments: federal tax payments in the second quarter and then one in the third and one in the fourth. So we will expect Q2 to be down sequentially but up year-over-year. And then just overall, for the full year, as I mentioned earlier, just north of 30% free cash flow margin, so on track there.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, great. And then sorry, just one last quick one. The high single-digit bookings number, was that an organic number for software? .\nNeil Hunn: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Just a question on tech-enabled products first. So you're seeing a lot of sort of hardware manufacturers in our group with a big kind of flush of revenue right now as component shortages ease and then there's obviously a lot less visibility on the forward look once that flows through. So just wanted to tap -- very strong revenue performance in Q1. You're very confident in the sort of the next 3 quarters' outlook. Maybe just drill down a little bit more into sort of orders and backlog trends there, just kind of the confidence that the strength right now is sustainable through year-end and not just to kind of flush as supply chain eases.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So it's something that we -- a couple of things we've been really quizzing and with our companies is 2 things, this very thing and then also the stability of the backlog has there been any order fall out of the backlog, right? So there's been none, by the way -- virtually none on backlog order fallout. The orders are quite strong. Book-to-bill was greater than 1 in the quarter. So it gives us, I think, a good indication that it's not just a flush backlog. In terms of the balance of the year though, I mean, we're waiting for the time when -- a lot of what's happened across the whole complex, not just us, is order duration is extended, right, as customers that want to be in the queue to make sure they have supply. At some point and at that point, I don't know -- I don't think any of us know what is going to happen, we're going to get back into a more normal order sort of duration timing. So there'll be a period of time when orders, because of timing, compress. It's -- we don't know when that's going to happen but we're fully expecting it. And candidly, aren't going to be that worried about it because it's sort of a natural reaction to where we are. We also -- so that's a commentary for Neptune in the whole segment. For medical products, quite the opposite. There isn't really -- we don't work out of a huge backlog out of that -- those businesses. And so that dynamic that you're addressing or question doesn't exist. And then for -- we really solved the supply chain challenges at the RF product businesses. They were bespoke and unique to the 2 businesses there. And so now we will be able to start clearing some backlog but that's more of a second half thing than what it was in the quarter.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. And then just circling back on one of the more potentially cyclical pieces within software and it's already been touched on once or twice. But to try and put a finer point on the sort of DAT and Loadlinked businesses at Network Software. Within that sort of mid-single-digit growth outlook for the segment for the balance of the year, how -- what are you dialing in for sort of DAT or Loadlink? Not -- you don't have to give me the percentage number. Just curious sort of versus the segment growth of mid-single digit, for example.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So it's the same -- I'll give you a color to it. I think we'll stop short of giving you like specifics at a company level. But as we mentioned last quarter, there is a difference of opinion between the DAT leadership and Sarasota about what the outlook of this business is for the year. DAT is much more bullish on what the year -- the balance of the year is going to look like than what we are here in Sarasota. We continue to have a very conservative posture relative to what DAT looks like, especially uniquely on the carrier count for the balance of the year. We want to see -- while we had a nice proof point in Q1 that the carrier decline started to basically flatten, we have not assumed they continue from that level and improve. We continue -- we assume they actually get a little bit worse.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: So just kind of talk about this on the medical product side but we had another company talking about like big inventory levels of component parts in medical, like -- kind of like unexpectedly so. So like their customers just have some of their -- more of their products than anticipated. I'm guessing that's not really relevant to you guys but I just wanted to ask the question.\nNeil Hunn: It's not particularly relevant. There's one business, Northern Digital, correct me on this I think it's just -- principally one that sells through, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the medical product OEMs were a critical component, a necessary component to scores of these medical product OEMs. They cannot ship their product without our product, obviously. So there was -- we're worried there might have been a fair amount of inventory in the channel as buffer. The commentary from the Northern Digital team this quarter is they feel most if not all of that is through the system. It's hard to know exactly for sure but that's where -- that's really the only place where it happens. Otherwise, it's us directly to a customer -- and in consumer customer.\nJoe Giordano: Yes, that's what I figured. Okay. And then just a question on like the landscape for M&A. Like I'm just curious, from -- for your competitors on the PE side who are looking at stuff, is like the -- I know rates are kind of all over. Is the volatility of rates and like the uncertainty around rates directionally like a problem for them? And like the ability to lock in debt or the desire to lock in rates, like is that having an impact on the market at all?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I mean, it's been slow. The number of deals printed in the last couple of quarters has been very low for this reason that you mentioned for the reason that there's just a bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers. -- that continues to exist. And then also just uncertainty on what the exit values are going to be. If you're doing a IRR analysis, the most sensitive variable and the whole thing is your exit value, your exit multiple. And so all in uncertainty, there just hasn't been a lot of deals or recaps. Private equity -- in private equity, there's been a handful of strategic deals that have happened. I'll tell you though, in this our pattern recognition history would say, in times of volatility, it creates opportunity. We saw that coming out of COVID. And very quickly, I mean, it was what, August-ish and 2020 when we did Vertafore, it was an opportunity for us. And so it's our commitment to investment-grade debt, our leverage levels that we could be nimble and flexible and quite opportunistic because this -- moments like this is where opportunities exist for a variety of reasons. So we're cautiously optimistic over the course of this year that those will present themselves.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Just along the lines of that M&A, I know you mentioned you have certainly have a pipeline platform versus bolt-ons. I guess just even what you're seeing today and sort of the comments that you just made, is there any confidence sort of you'd probably lean towards more bolt-ons in the next few months? Or are there some opportunities that you're seeing on the platform side that could execute?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I think it's -- we characterize the current near-term level of activity in the M&A pipeline as having a bit more on the add-on or bolt-on side than what we might have seen historically. I wouldn't read too much into that. It sometimes -- it's just the way it falls sometimes. There's certainly a handful of platforms that we are currently evaluating. There always is a handful that we're in pretty late stages or detailed work evaluating. But on balance, there's a bit more on the bolt-on side. Those tend to be our very best deals because they are additive to strategically to one of our existing companies. There's normally some synergies that come with those -- and as we talked about in the Investor Day, strategically, we'd like to see more of our capital deployed against the bolt-on strategy. But we're not going to force it but it would be nice to be able to see it.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. That's helpful. And then Application Software, the capacity ramp in acute care. I know you mentioned, obviously, it's impacting Q2. How should we think about that, the balance of the year? When does that slowly get running, that ramp? .\nJason Conley: Yes, that's right. I mean, we thought EBITDA margins were in line with expectations in the first quarter and we did have those implementations. Also, CBORD had some large integrated security pull-ins, they finally got some parts for some of those projects. But for the second quarter, we're expecting it to be about the same and then it will pick back up in the second half. So you can expect EBITDA margins to be about flat year-over-year.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.\nJoe Vruwink: Hope you're well. One observation I just kind of what we're hearing in the broader environment. It does seem like the system of record companies for the industries you serve, they're holding up pretty well. And then I think there's some particular industry examples like K-12 education would be one where the spend is actually consolidating a bit around these companies, so share of wallet is going up right now. Do you think you're generally seeing this so far? And any examples that come to mind where you kind of look at your growth relative to underlying IT spend and this wallet share dynamic is maybe playing out?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I mean, I would say -- I mean, I have to -- we can take this off-line and sort of go company by company in some level of detail to the extent it would be interesting. But at the highest level, we would say yes, right? So we're -- we say in the Investor Day, we say in all of our communication that we're mission-critical software system of record sort of software. On the application side, if you think about like Deltek or Vertafore I mean, Frontline -- Aderant is a great example where we've gone from number 2 to number 1. We've doubled the size of the company over ownership period. The net retention has gone from like low 1-0, whatever, 102,103 so low 110s, 110, 112, I think which just gives you a sense that all these software companies work for a long time to create a customer base that then they can spend the rest of their life cross-selling into. And so most of our -- all of our companies, 50% to 75% or more of their new bookings come from cross-selling, upselling. And the best example of that is the one you called out which is Frontline which I think it's like 80% plus, where it's -- they've done all the work over their history of basically capturing the customers and now it's about how do you get more share of wallet. And in Frontline's case, in particular, it's a more fragmented state-by-state based on the regulatory environment, competitive environment. And you're right, today, 50% of K-12 health systems -- or excuse me, education systems want to buy from a consolidated vendor, where 5 years ago, that number was 25% or 30%. So the market is coming towards -- in the education space towards companies like Frontline.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, that's great. And then, I guess, a quick one on Frontline. In terms of the sequencing of free cash flow, so 50% cash flow margin business, do they typically kind of burn cash 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q? And so 3Q, we can think of more than 50% of that business's full year generation is probably hitting in that time frame.\nJason Conley: Yes, I think that's the right way to think about it, Joe. A little bit more of a burn in Q2 -- or Q1, a little less in Q2 and then a big cash inflow in Q3 and a little bit of cash in Q4.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.\nAlex Blanton: Most of my questions on your operations have been answered but I wanted to ask about the -- how you benefit from the sale of compressor controls. Like Clayton Doble and Rice [ph], they sold it to Honeywell, they just announced this week for $670 million. Are they selling your piece? And do you get any cash from that?\nNeil Hunn: Alex, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this. So we are certainly involved with it. We're 49% owners of Indicor. We have quarterly Board meetings. From the very first conversation we had with [indiscernible] about what the value creation plan is for Indicor, part of it was to do some portfolio work with this being the principal piece to make Indicor less oily and more industrial. And so this was a strategic -- this was an asset that was highly strategic to a number of folks in the industry. It was a very competitive process and we're delighted to be able to sell the business for 19 x this year's EBITDA. I think Honeywell is a great home for this business. That mattered a lot to us. The benefit of Indicor is we now get to take this capital as a company and a 49% owner of the company and then redeploy it to industrial and industrial tech type businesses build the M&A flywheel and hopefully create the next great industrial compounder that will become a public company in 3 to 5 years. And that's when we'll monetize through the whole value creation plan.\nAlex Blanton: Okay. Do you get any cash from this deal?\nJason Conley: The only cash we get, Alex, is we'll have a distribution to us for the tax liability of the sale. But most of the cash is going to stay in the business. So we'll get that cash whenever it closes, sometime in the second half.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call .\nOperator: That conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

As we turn to Page 5, the 3 main takeaways for today's call are, first, the year is off to a strong operational and financial start as our higher-quality, enhanced portfolio is obviously performing really well; second, we're increasing our full year guidance both in terms of organic revenue growth and adjusted DEPS; and third, we continue to be very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to our first takeaway, a strong start to the year, we saw total revenue grow of 15% and organic revenue grow 8%. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we continue to not only scale our enterprise but also simultaneously improve its underlying quality and recurring revenue base. Importantly, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow margins in excess of 30%. Our results this quarter are another proof point that our higher-quality, less cyclical portfolio was purpose-built to consistently perform at a very high level. Finally and also during the quarter, we held our first ever Roper Leadership Summit, where we had our 27 business unit presidents together and shared best practices and learnings across a variety of topics, including strategy development, strategy enablement and team and talent. While honoring our high trust autonomous model, the operating and corporate teams left feeling a true sense of community. It was a terrific week. Given the strong start to the year, we're increasing our full year organic growth outlook 100 basis points from 5% to 6% to 6% to 7% and increasing our full year DEPS guidance to be to $16.10 to $16.30 or $15.10 at the midpoint. Our previous diluted EPS guide was $15.90 to $16.20. And finally, we continue to be well positioned relative to capital deployment. We remain quite active in the market as we evaluate an actively diligent many high-quality opportunities. Jason, I'll turn the call over to you so you can walk through our first quarter results and our strong financial position. Jason? Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to Page 9 and walk through our Q1 highlights for Application Software segment. Revenues here were $761 million, up 6% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 43.2%. Performance in this segment was strong across the board. To highlight a few of our business' performance, we'll start with Deltek. Deltek was solid. As we mentioned last quarter, Deltek did see some slower customer decision-making but that was largely rectified this quarter. Deltek had double-digit bookings in the quarter with strength across both enterprise class and SMB-sized customers as well as government contracting and private sector solutions. As usual, both gross and net retention at Deltek remained strong and consistent with recent history. Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms, continues to compete and win and take share from our competitors. In the quarter, Aderant experienced record bookings and continued success in the adoption of their SaaS solutions. Great job by Chris, Rafi and the entire Aderant team. Vertafore, our software business at tech-enabled property and casualty insurance agencies, posted another solid quarter and continues to perform quite well for us. Of particular note, Vertafore's recent acquisition of MGA Systems, a software solution targeted to manage general agents, or MGAs, is proving to be highly strategic and bookings activity is tracking ahead of plan. Frontline continues to perform quite well for us in the first couple of quarters of ownership. Frontline's mission is to empower the front line of education. As many of you know, hiring of teachers and administrative staff is particularly challenging and Frontline software solutions better equip K-12 school districts to navigate these challenges. Because of this, frontline solutions are mission-critical and of high importance to their school district customers. For the segment, EBITDA margins were down 90 basis points year-over-year, in line with our expectations. Our Acute Care software businesses, especially CliniSys, Data Innovations and Strata are ramping up their implementation capacity based on recent bookings momentum. We expect to see similar margins in Q2. Looking to the balance of the year, we expect to see organic growth in the mid-single-digit area for this segment based on our leading market positions and growth in recurring revenue. Turning to Page 10. Revenues in the quarter for Network Software segment were $355 million, up 6% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 53.1%. As with our Application Software segment, growth and performance was broad-based across this segment. Relative to business-specific comments, we'll start with our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink which both grew nicely in the quarter. While freight market conditions are softer than this time last year, our businesses in this space are critical to the operation and execution of the spot freight market. In addition and importantly, the spot market is a long-term secular beneficiary in terms of the volume of future freight shipments. Throughout and across the freight and economic cycle, DAT and Loadlink continue to innovate and launch new products and offerings to help drive enhanced customer value and share of wallet with the current product strategy focused on tech enabling the connectivity between brokers and carriers. iPipeline, our network software business that tech enables the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities, is coming off a terrific 2022 and continued its high level of execution this quarter with very strong bookings, retention and customer expansions. Foundry continued its string of strong performance in the quarter and had terrific seat growth for their flagship product Newk [ph] which enabled continued double-digit recurring revenue growth. As we mentioned last quarter, Foundry commenced their subscription pricing transition for Newk [ph] and in Q1 had north of 50% of the new seats sold under their new model ahead of their plan. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid and the business has benefited by an improving census in skilled nursing, assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels in patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. Turning to the balance of the year. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on broad and sustained growth across this group. As we turn to Page 11. Revenues in the quarter for our Tech-enabled Products segment were $354 million, up 14% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 34.7% in the quarter. Across the segment, business performance and execution was solid. Importantly, the broad-based supply chain issues continue to wane. Though we're not entirely out of the woods, we can now see a path to a more normalized supply chain environment. Neptune, our water meter and technology product business, continues to be just great. In the quarter, they had record revenue performance and set records for backlog levels. Importantly, Neptune continues to see increasing demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic static meters. We remain bullish on Neptune and the market in which they compete as this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles. Great job at Neptune and congrats. Verathon was strong in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across the reoccurring single-use products, both bronchoscope or B-flex [ph] and video innovation or GlideScope as well as bladder scan capital purchases. Importantly, Verathon has 4 product launches scheduled for the next few months which will help continue their market share gains and momentum. Northern Digital or NDI was also strong in the quarter and continued to see terrific demand for their optical and EM solutions. NDI's enabling measurement technology is used by scores and medical product OEMs and solutions such as robotic-assisted surgery and across multiple cardiac-specific modalities. NDI's high level of market focus and operational discipline will enable them to continue to be the market share leader for these measurement technologies long into the future. Our outlook for the balance of the year for this segment has improved to be in the low double-digit area and is based on continued strong orders and improving manufacturing productivity at Neptune as well as an improved growth outlook across our medical product businesses. Now please turn to Page 13 and let's review our increased 2023 guidance. For 2023, we expect total revenue growth to be north of 12%. In addition, we're updating our organic revenue growth outlook to be in the 6% to 7% range, an increase from our original guidance of 5% to 6%. As a result, we're increasing our DEPS guidance to be in the range of $16.10 and $16.30 in up from our guidance of $15.90 to $16.20, assuming that this guidance is a tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. Specific to the second quarter, we're establishing our DEPS guidance is to be in the $3.96 to $4 range. Now please turn with us to Page 14 and then Jason and I will look forward to answering your questions. As we turn to Page 14, we want to leave you with the same 3 points with which we started. First, 2023 is off to a great start. We saw revenues increase 15% to $1.47 billion in the quarter. This growth was underpinned with 8% organic revenue growth and 8% recurring revenue growth. In addition, margins were quite strong. This quarter's financial and operational performance is yet another proof point of our capabilities and frankly, the expectations of our improved higher-quality portfolio of businesses. Most importantly, our revenue growth translated to impressive cash flow growth with our underlying free cash flow growing 14%. As you know, we view cash flow growth as the best measure of performance. Second, based on the strong start to the year, the higher recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers, we are increasing our full year organic revenue growth outlook to be between 6% and 7% and increasing our full year DEPS to be between $16.10 an $16.30. Finally, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we discussed during our Investor Day last month, we have a very large universe and pipeline of opportunities, though, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. Now as we turn to your questions and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we want to thank those of you who joined us in New York or online last month for our first ever Investor Day. During that long-form overview of Roper, we were excited to share with you our long-term strategy, the high-quality nature of our portfolio of businesses, our operating ability to improve our businesses, our process-driven capital deployment approach and are compelling long-term business model that compounds cash flow in the mid-teens area. So, thank you for your continued interest in Roper. And with that, let's open it up to your questions. Yes. Sure, Deane. Happy to talk about it. it's something that we spent a tremendous amount of time talking to our leadership teams, our group executives about, trying to understand the signal. To set the obvious context, we spent the last several years trying to really work out the cyclicality of the portfolio and we're also in these very small niche markets where the customers tend to be not that cyclical. So the signal for us is faint. It's not nonexistent but it's faint. Last quarter, we certainly talked about Deltek and them having some slower customer demand, as we said in the prepared comments, that largely, it's not fully rectified itself this most recent quarter. Two or three quarters ago, we talked about the same thing going on a PowerPlan, that rectified itself the subsequent quarter as well. Some of the other macro things that we listen to, the amount of property casualty insurance written as a sign of sort of business formation or business growth continued to grow, life insurance applications that got steady. DAT, the number of carriers we expected and certainly have seen for a couple of quarters, carrier declines at touch. But that meaningfully moderated in Q1. So we continue to listen for it but -- and we certainly have planned for the second half of the year, concern outlook relative to a slowdown. But the signal's faint at the moment. Jason, anything you want to add to that? Yes. There's 3 parts to this -- macro parts to this segment. There's Neptune, medical products and then a couple of small RF product businesses, all 3, they have and -- we, at corporate, sort of increased the outlook for the balance of the year. Neptune has just continued incredible order growth and then terrific performance out of the factory at Neptune which gives us confidence that they can chew into a little bit more of the backlog than we maybe originally thought coming into the year. At the medical product businesses, as we all know, last year, medical procedure volumes were down in the 7% to 8% range. We plan for that to continue this year. It's actually been a little bit better than that and that flowed through at Verathon, CIVCO directly and less directly through NDI. And then the Inovonics and RF Ideas, the RF product businesses, have been riddled with supply chain challenges and coming into the year. We assume those would continue and they meaningfully improved in Q1. So it's a little bit uplift across the board that gives us the confidence to take the guide up in that segment. Yes. DAT grew in the quarter. Year-over-year, it grew sequentially. So -- but there is a link. It's an indirect link. We're not paid per mile driven, we're not paid on any utilization metric. It's a fixed subscription on both the broker side and the carrier side. The reason DAT historically tends to be less cyclical than the market in which it operates, a couple of things. One is you have this tension between the cyclical nature and the secular growth driver, where the spot market is just winning more market share of the total freight volumes. So you have more volume generally coming into the spot market over the long arc of time. And the simple version for why that is, is because the spot market is becoming more liquid or easier to transact in as it tech enables itself, of which DAT is a participant and enabler of that. The second thing is understanding the dynamic between what the role the spot market plays in a booming versus a waning market, where in the -- and it's about the pricing dynamic between contract pricing and spot pricing. Spot pricing changes daily, contract pricing changes on a rolling year basis. And so when the market is very hot, you obviously have more demand for carriers and there is supply, rates up in the spot market. It invites capacity addition. And that's what's driven DAT's growth for the last couple of 3 years as you have more carriers coming into the market. When the freight market slows, you actually have spot pricing below that of contract and you actually, at that moment, start seeing some of the contract freight come into the spot market so the shippers can save money. So it provides you a floor for the demand of carriers. And so historically, DAT grows very nicely in upmarket and grow slower in the downmarket for those couple of reasons. Yes. I mean -- there's a lot of tech currents and cross currents in this space. At the core of it, today, I still think on average, there's between 8 and 10 phone calls that go between a broker and a carrier to actually broker a load. Obviously, what we're all trying to do is take that to 0. DAT is a big part of their product road map is to tech enable that. So there's AI in the match, there's AI in the routing, there's AI in future trucks going from Cincinnati, Chicago, it's going to be there on Tuesday at 3. How does it have a pickup in Chicago back to where it wants to go 4 hours later or whatever the time frame is. There's a lot of AI that can go into that. But the principle, the true unlock for the industry is to take the -- make the match more efficient and that's where most of the technology investment is going today. You do the -- you take the first one. Yes. And as it relates to the new products and a couple of new leaders, we're certainly excited to have Bill a new CFO, Scott, our new COO; and Curtis, the new Chief Client Operations Officer joined. It's often case times the case. There's a few leadership changes that happen in the first year or so of ownership. And so that was expected, we're excited to have this team. It's an incredible group that's joined us. The thing that we -- that I'm particularly excited about and proud of in the first couple of quarters of ownership of Frontline is the strategic choice they've made. As a pattern we see from a lot of companies that come out of private equity is very limited choice that's made, so they try to do too many things and not do them well. And so very quickly, Frontline doubled down on client experience and R&D productivity and actually made a choice to take a little bit of resource out of go-to-market which makes complete sense when you have 85% or 90% coverage of the customers. And the entire strategy or the principal here strategy is to focus on cross-selling, up-selling. You need to deliver a tremendous experience, hence, to focus on client experience and need to be able to innovate and sell them more products, hence the deployment to R&D. So we love the choice that's been made there and excited for what that yields in the future. Sure. So ConstructConnect, as we talked about in the past, tends to be a countercyclical business. For those that are less familiar, ConstructConnect for simplicity has a near perfect database of every commercial construction project that's in the planning phase. And so if you're a general contractor, a trade contractor, a building product manufacturer, you're generally quite interested in understanding for planning purposes, for bidding a project purposes what's in the stage of development planning. When the construction market is quite hot, general contractors and subs have more work that they can do. There's less utility and value in paying a subscription fee for future projects that are in the queue. When the amount of work starts to slow down, there is increased utility in that. So when I look back and back test ConstructConnect over a couple of cycles, it has a clear countercyclical demand behavior attached to it. So the market, we think, will be coming to it. As a general matter, ConstructConnect has maybe modestly underperformed our hopes. It's been more of a low single-digit growth business. Our expectation is that it should be mid. And we're quite confident with the current strategy that will climb to there and get to there. We have a great leader that came out from Deltek a couple of years ago, Matt Straza, the operational discipline, the strategy, the go-to-market sort of prowess is just at the next level. And so we're quite confident that we're going to be able to reach our expectations of mid there. CliniSys has been nothing short of great. Simpson, who's been -- who has integrated the U.S. Sunquest business with the European business, has just done that almost without error. It's been terrific. The business grew. The combined business grew in the quarter. We haven't been able to say that for quite some time given the drag of the U.S. business. We continue to be just tremendously strong in the U.K. As you know, we're 1 of 3 or 4 strategic IT vendors to the NHS as we run something like 80% or 85% of the laboratory network in the U.K. The pan-European strength continues. For instance, we run the largest health system in France, in APP, the Paris system. And in the U.S., some of the strength comes from the fact that we now have a product offering that is for laboratories outside of that of health care. So think environmental, toxicology, water, et cetera which is showing some early signs of promise. And so a lot of congratulations to Simpson and Andy, the CFO and we're excited to see what happens at Clinisys. Yes. Yes. So it's something that we -- a couple of things we've been really quizzing and with our companies is 2 things, this very thing and then also the stability of the backlog has there been any order fall out of the backlog, right? So there's been none, by the way -- virtually none on backlog order fallout. The orders are quite strong. Book-to-bill was greater than 1 in the quarter. So it gives us, I think, a good indication that it's not just a flush backlog. In terms of the balance of the year though, I mean, we're waiting for the time when -- a lot of what's happened across the whole complex, not just us, is order duration is extended, right, as customers that want to be in the queue to make sure they have supply. At some point and at that point, I don't know -- I don't think any of us know what is going to happen, we're going to get back into a more normal order sort of duration timing. So there'll be a period of time when orders, because of timing, compress. It's -- we don't know when that's going to happen but we're fully expecting it. And candidly, aren't going to be that worried about it because it's sort of a natural reaction to where we are. We also -- so that's a commentary for Neptune in the whole segment. For medical products, quite the opposite. There isn't really -- we don't work out of a huge backlog out of that -- those businesses. And so that dynamic that you're addressing or question doesn't exist. And then for -- we really solved the supply chain challenges at the RF product businesses. They were bespoke and unique to the 2 businesses there. And so now we will be able to start clearing some backlog but that's more of a second half thing than what it was in the quarter. Yes. So it's the same -- I'll give you a color to it. I think we'll stop short of giving you like specifics at a company level. But as we mentioned last quarter, there is a difference of opinion between the DAT leadership and Sarasota about what the outlook of this business is for the year. DAT is much more bullish on what the year -- the balance of the year is going to look like than what we are here in Sarasota. We continue to have a very conservative posture relative to what DAT looks like, especially uniquely on the carrier count for the balance of the year. We want to see -- while we had a nice proof point in Q1 that the carrier decline started to basically flatten, we have not assumed they continue from that level and improve. We continue -- we assume they actually get a little bit worse. It's not particularly relevant. There's one business, Northern Digital, correct me on this I think it's just -- principally one that sells through, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the medical product OEMs were a critical component, a necessary component to scores of these medical product OEMs. They cannot ship their product without our product, obviously. So there was -- we're worried there might have been a fair amount of inventory in the channel as buffer. The commentary from the Northern Digital team this quarter is they feel most if not all of that is through the system. It's hard to know exactly for sure but that's where -- that's really the only place where it happens. Otherwise, it's us directly to a customer -- and in consumer customer. Yes. I mean, it's been slow. The number of deals printed in the last couple of quarters has been very low for this reason that you mentioned for the reason that there's just a bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers. -- that continues to exist. And then also just uncertainty on what the exit values are going to be. If you're doing a IRR analysis, the most sensitive variable and the whole thing is your exit value, your exit multiple. And so all in uncertainty, there just hasn't been a lot of deals or recaps. Private equity -- in private equity, there's been a handful of strategic deals that have happened. I'll tell you though, in this our pattern recognition history would say, in times of volatility, it creates opportunity. We saw that coming out of COVID. And very quickly, I mean, it was what, August-ish and 2020 when we did Vertafore, it was an opportunity for us. And so it's our commitment to investment-grade debt, our leverage levels that we could be nimble and flexible and quite opportunistic because this -- moments like this is where opportunities exist for a variety of reasons. So we're cautiously optimistic over the course of this year that those will present themselves. Yes. I think it's -- we characterize the current near-term level of activity in the M&A pipeline as having a bit more on the add-on or bolt-on side than what we might have seen historically. I wouldn't read too much into that. It sometimes -- it's just the way it falls sometimes. There's certainly a handful of platforms that we are currently evaluating. There always is a handful that we're in pretty late stages or detailed work evaluating. But on balance, there's a bit more on the bolt-on side. Those tend to be our very best deals because they are additive to strategically to one of our existing companies. There's normally some synergies that come with those -- and as we talked about in the Investor Day, strategically, we'd like to see more of our capital deployed against the bolt-on strategy. But we're not going to force it but it would be nice to be able to see it. Yes. I mean, I would say -- I mean, I have to -- we can take this off-line and sort of go company by company in some level of detail to the extent it would be interesting. But at the highest level, we would say yes, right? So we're -- we say in the Investor Day, we say in all of our communication that we're mission-critical software system of record sort of software. On the application side, if you think about like Deltek or Vertafore I mean, Frontline -- Aderant is a great example where we've gone from number 2 to number 1. We've doubled the size of the company over ownership period. The net retention has gone from like low 1-0, whatever, 102,103 so low 110s, 110, 112, I think which just gives you a sense that all these software companies work for a long time to create a customer base that then they can spend the rest of their life cross-selling into. And so most of our -- all of our companies, 50% to 75% or more of their new bookings come from cross-selling, upselling. And the best example of that is the one you called out which is Frontline which I think it's like 80% plus, where it's -- they've done all the work over their history of basically capturing the customers and now it's about how do you get more share of wallet. And in Frontline's case, in particular, it's a more fragmented state-by-state based on the regulatory environment, competitive environment. And you're right, today, 50% of K-12 health systems -- or excuse me, education systems want to buy from a consolidated vendor, where 5 years ago, that number was 25% or 30%. So the market is coming towards -- in the education space towards companies like Frontline. Alex, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this. So we are certainly involved with it. We're 49% owners of Indicor. We have quarterly Board meetings. From the very first conversation we had with [indiscernible] about what the value creation plan is for Indicor, part of it was to do some portfolio work with this being the principal piece to make Indicor less oily and more industrial. And so this was a strategic -- this was an asset that was highly strategic to a number of folks in the industry. It was a very competitive process and we're delighted to be able to sell the business for 19 x this year's EBITDA. I think Honeywell is a great home for this business. That mattered a lot to us. The benefit of Indicor is we now get to take this capital as a company and a 49% owner of the company and then redeploy it to industrial and industrial tech type businesses build the M&A flywheel and hopefully create the next great industrial compounder that will become a public company in 3 to 5 years. And that's when we'll monetize through the whole value creation plan."

            "name": "Jason Conley",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Turning to Slide 6. We're very pleased with how Q1 shaped up. Revenue came in at $1.47 billion or 15% over prior year. This was through a combination of strong organic growth of 8% and an 8% contribution from acquisitions, led by Frontline and this was slightly offset by a 1% FX headwind. Growth was broad-based across the segments and a little better than expected. Broadly speaking, customer demand was favorable in the quarter and order pipelines remain strong. EBITDA was $582 million or 15% of our prior year with margins roughly flat and in line with expectations. DEPS of $3.90 was up 19% over prior year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range of $3.80 to $3.84. Free cash flow of $445 million was 4% higher than prior year. In our Q4 earnings call, we highlighted a $45 million settlement of a patent dispute for certain Verathon sales dating back to 2004. We paid that this quarter, so adjusted for the settlement, free cash would be 33% of revenue and up 14% over prior year. We saw very good cash performance, especially in our software businesses. Our Q1 renewals and related collections came in strong as expected. As I mentioned last quarter, Frontline will collect most of the renewals in the third quarter. So it's a bit of a drag on conversion in the first half. So overall, just a really great start to 2023. Now turning to Slide 7, we'll spin through our balance sheet. Coming off solid Q1 cash flow performance, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. Gross debt was around $6.7 billion and our cash balance has grown to just under $1.2 billion which yields net debt just shy of $5.5 billion. This puts our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 2.4 which was down from 2.7 at year-end. This, coupled with our undrawn revolver of $3.5 billion gives us capacity to deploy $4 billion or more in the near term. To that end, we've been quite active in 2023, evaluating a number of platform and bolt-on opportunities. As always, we will remain disciplined and patient in our capital deployment process. With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk about our segment performance and outlook. Neil? Yes I would just say our software bookings were up high single digits year-over-year in the quarter. So that just put some math behind what he was saying. I take the first one. Yes. So they're tracking on their forecast. As you know, they're a business that has large renewals in the third and fourth quarter. And so we'll expect the business to pick up sequentially in the second half but there are definitely on track for their revenue and EBITDA numbers of $370 million, $175 million. Yes, that's right. We're on track to deliver north of 30% free cash flow. As I mentioned, the second half is going to be better than the first half with the renewals at Frontline. But yes, we're still on track there. Sure. Yes, I can take that, Steve. So yes, the deferred revenue is down or, I guess, the consumption of cash in the first quarter because of Frontline, right? So they -- you'll see that spike back up in the third quarter with those renewals. It was, overall, deferred revenue outside of that was in line with expectations. It was fairly flat to the fourth quarter. And then on taxes, we typically make 2 tax payments: federal tax payments in the second quarter and then one in the third and one in the fourth. So we will expect Q2 to be down sequentially but up year-over-year. And then just overall, for the full year, as I mentioned earlier, just north of 30% free cash flow margin, so on track there. Yes, that's right. I mean, we thought EBITDA margins were in line with expectations in the first quarter and we did have those implementations. Also, CBORD had some large integrated security pull-ins, they finally got some parts for some of those projects. But for the second quarter, we're expecting it to be about the same and then it will pick back up in the second half. So you can expect EBITDA margins to be about flat year-over-year. Yes, I think that's the right way to think about it, Joe. A little bit more of a burn in Q2 -- or Q1, a little less in Q2 and then a big cash inflow in Q3 and a little bit of cash in Q4. The only cash we get, Alex, is we'll have a distribution to us for the tax liability of the sale. But most of the cash is going to stay in the business. So we'll get that cash whenever it closes, sometime in the second half."

We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, the financial impacts associated with minority investments, and lastly, transaction and restructuring-related expenses associated with the completed acquisition of Transact Campus. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now please turn to Page 4. I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thank you, Zach, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our third quarter results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 4, you'll see the topics we'll cover today. I'll start by highlighting our third quarter financial performance. Jason will then go through our financial results in greater detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity and discuss our very strong cash-flow performance. Then, I'll walk everyone through a summary of our most recent acquisition, Transact Campus, then discuss our segment highlights and review our increased guidance for the full year. After our closing remarks, we'll open the call for your questions. So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the four key takeaways for today's call are, first, we again delivered another solid quarter results and expect an acceleration in sequential organic revenue growth heading into Q4. Second, we completed the Transact Campus acquisition, a very attractive business at a very attractive net purchase price. Third, we're raising our full-year guidance to the high end of our range. And fourth, we continue to be very well-positioned relative to executing on our capital deployment strategy. Now digging a bit deeper into these four key takeaways. We grew total revenue by 13%, organic revenue by 4% and EBITDA by 10%. Importantly, we grew free cash flow by 15% in the quarter and by 20% on a TTM basis. Operationally in the quarter, Neptune performed slightly better than our expectations as they resolved last quarter's mechanical meter production challenges. And also importantly, we're encouraged to see strong organic enterprise software bookings momentum continue this quarter, growing in the double-digits area, up from last quarter's high single-digits bookings growth. Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Transact Campus. Our CBORD business is being combined with Transact and integration activities are well underway. This is yet another very compelling value-creation opportunity for our shareholders, which we'll discuss in a bit. Based on strong enterprise margin performance, we're increasing our full-year 2024 DEPS guidance to the high end of our range. In addition, we're increasing our outlook for total revenue growth to be 13% plus given the addition of our most recent acquisition, Transact Campus. Finally, we're maintaining our approximate 6% organic revenue outlook for the year. If we step back a bit, we recognize we just posted back-to-back 4% organic growth quarters, although not unexpected without question unsatisfying. That said, we do see quarterly organic growth momentum improving and expect our Q4 organic growth to sequentially improve given back-to-back quarters of strong enterprise bookings growth, stabilizing freight market conditions, albeit at the bottom, our resolved Neptune operational issue and MDI returning to growth in Q4. So with this mostly behind us, we're confident we are seeing a reacceleration of our growth. And finally, we continue to be very active on the M&A market, an environment that continues to improve and one where we have a very large pipeline of highly attractive opportunities. We continue to be quite bullish about our ability to be active on the M&A front. So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through our quarterly and full year financial results as well as our very strong financial position. Jason?\nJason Conley: Thanks, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at Slide 6. Revenue was $1.76 billion and up 13% over prior year. Acquisitions contributed 9%, led by Procare and Transact Campus, and organic growth was 4%. Just unpacking organic growth a bit. In application software, revenue grew over 5% with recurring and reoccurring growth in the high single-digit area. Non-recurring revenue was down low-single digits, led by declines in new license sales. New business activity for enterprise software continues to lean towards SaaS, which ultimately creates higher customer lifetime value while yielding a slight drag on near-term non-recurring revenue. In network software, recurring revenue growth of 1% includes temporary headwinds at DAT, Link and Foundry. The balance of the segment saw growth in the mid-single-digit area. As Neil will discuss later, we see stabilization in freight markets and expect some improvement in Q4. TEP organic growth of 4% was underpinned by strength at Verathon and prior year comp challenges at NDI, Inovonics & rf IDEAS. As we discussed last quarter, NDI had a very significant customer program in 2023 that created year-to-date comparison challenges. However, we expect a return to growth in Q4. Separately and importantly, Neptune rapidly resolved its mechanical meter production challenges in the quarter. EBITDA of $717 million was 10% over prior year and EBITDA margin came in at 40.7%. On DEPS, we posted $4.62, which was above our guidance range of $4.50 to $4.54. Of note, the Transact acquisition contributed $0.03 in the stub period as the third quarter is seasonally the highest driven by fees from annual tuition payments and annual renewals of term licenses. Excluding Transact, our guidance beat came from strong core margin performance in our application software segment. Turning to free cash flow, we had our highest-ever quarter with free cash flow of $719 million, up 15% over prior year. Transact was cash accretive in the stub period of ownership and off to a fast start with Q3 being once again seasonally strong for this business. We also had a simply great execution across our software and tech product businesses. Of note, net working capital as a percent of revenue, excluding acquisitions was negative 19%, a new Q3 record. A special thanks to our world-class finance teams across the Roper family who are laser focused on cash returns and cash flow growth. Tremendous job. The bottom right chart provides a trailing 12-month view of free cash flow over a four-year period. The CAGR from the corresponding 2021 period is 12%. If we adjust for the Section 174 that went into effect in 2022, we've compounded cash flow in the mid-teens area. The strong Q3 results places our year-to-date cash flow at 31% as a percentage of revenue and with renewal season at many of our software businesses in Q4, we expect free-cash flow margin to be north of 30% for the year. Turning to Slide 7, I'll now discuss our balance sheet. So net debt of $8.1 billion on trailing EBITDA of $2.75 billion yields leverage of 3 times at the end of the quarter and a bit lower if we pro-forma for the recent acquisitions. In the quarter, we entered the bond market and issued $2 billion across five, seven and 10-year tenors for a blended rate of 4.8%. This was used to fund the Transact deal and partially pay down the revolver, which has a quarter-end balance of $925 million. As we move forward, our strong cash flow and use from investment-grade leverage provides us with $4 billion or more of capacity to deploy towards high-quality acquisitions. To that end, I'll turn it over to Neil to talk about the Transact deal and its compelling combination with our CBORD business. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to our most recent acquisition overview. Transact Campus is another fantastic addition to the Roper portfolio. Let's start with the investment highlights. We paid $1.5 billion net of a $100 million tax benefit for the business. We expect Transact to deliver about $325 million of revenue and $105 million of EBITDA next year, which means we paid about 14 times the EBITDA we expect this business to contribute next year. Transact is adjusted DEPS breakeven this year, be accretive to our adjusted DEPS next year and is immediately cash flow accretive. And we will report Transact as combined with CBORD and our application software segment. On a standalone basis, Transact meets all our long-standing acquisition criteria, leader in the niche market, delivers mission-critical verticalized software solutions, competes based on customer intimacy, operates an asset-light business model and is led by a skilled, passionate leadership team. Let's talk about what the company does. Transact is a leading provider of mission-critical and purpose-built software and integrated payments to higher-education institutions in two focus areas, first, in campus identity management, and second, related to tuition management. The market itself is quite attractive and in the midst of the long-term secular tailwind of universities working to improve the on-campus experience required to attract and retain the next generation of students. We estimate the combined market size to be in the $1.5 billion range and growing 6% to 8% per annum. As previously mentioned, we're integrating our CBORD business with Transact. CBORD will combine its university campus ID business with that of Transact, creating a leading provider of these solution. We expect a long-term organic growth rate of the combined business to be in the high single-digits area. The go-forward leadership team has been announced, the 2025 $20 million cost synergy plan is well underway and the initial set of customer feedback has been quite positive. As you can see, Transact is a highly compelling value-creation opportunity for Roper and our shareholders. As we turn to Page 10, let's review our application software segment results. Revenue here grew by 23% in total and organic revenue grew by 5.5%. EBITDA margins were 43.6% and core margins improved 20 basis points in the quarter. Before getting into the business-specific details, I would like to share a few macro trends we're seeing across this segment. First, we continue to see improving organic enterprise bookings performance, growing in the double-digits area in the quarter following HSD growth in Q2. Importantly, the enterprise-class customer sluggishness we saw during 2023 and the first quarter of this year appears to be waning. Finally, we continue to see strong growth in recurring and reoccurring revenue in this segment, growing in the high single-digit area in the quarter. Turning to our business unit-specific commentary, we'll start with Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of large law firms. Aderant continues to perform incredibly well in the market and had another great quarter. Over the past few quarters, we have highlighted Aderant's improved product development velocity and in particular, with GenAI powered features. Now, this innovation activity is adding to their already-strong bookings momentum, including very nice new customer additions and continued progress in adding new and expanded products within their existing customer base. Deltek, our software business serving government contracting, architecture, engineering and construction markets was strong in the quarter as well. In particular, Deltek's enterprise-class government contracting customer activity improved in the quarter, which is encouraging to see. Also, and as a reminder, Deltek continued their ongoing cloud-based software momentum and expanded their GenAI embedded functionality. PowerPlan, our financial planning and tax software business serving heavy fixed assets industries continues to impress with their operating and financial results. PowerPlan has done a tremendous job over the last three or four years on improving the customer experience, accelerating their software innovation velocity and improving upsell, cross-sell activity. Great job by Joe and his team in Atlanta. Frontline continues to perform nicely and had strong renewal activity and delivered excellent seasonally high cash flow. Of note, we're excited to announce Matt Strazza as Frontline's new CEO. As some of you may recall, Matt joined Roper as Deltek's go-to-market leader, then was promoted to be the CEO of ConstructConnect. Matt did a wonderful job at ConstructConnect and we're excited about having this growth-oriented leader at the helm at Frontline. Also of note, we promoted Buck Brody, ConstructConnect's CFO to assume the CEO role. Buck has been in the Roper ecosystem mostly as the CFO over the past 13 years. This is one of the first, though certainly not the last time, we'll promote leaders across and within Roper. We continue to remain quite bullish about the future for Frontline. Our Healthcare IT businesses led by Strata and Data Innovations were also strong in the quarter and delivered excellent growth. Finally, Procare continues to execute well. Importantly, as part of our evolving governance processes tied to faster growth or maturing leader nature of our portfolio, Roper is working to improve its go-to-market capabilities from lead-generation to deal execution as well as go-to-market leadership. We really like what we're seeing here, although it's early days. As it relates to the guidance for the final quarter of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Please turn with us to page 11. Organic revenue at our network software segment grew 1% in the quarter and was impacted by the fact we continued to experience pressure with our freight matching businesses and work through the impact on Foundry from the recent actors and writers strikes. Excluding our freight matching businesses and Foundry, this segment grew in the mid-singles area, which demonstrates the underlying quality of this group of businesses. EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 56.2%. Let's dig into the details and start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which declined slightly as expected due to the continuing challenging freight market conditions that adversely impact both businesses. That said, we continue to see further signs of market stabilization for both carriers and brokers. During this softer period, DAT continues to invest to accelerate new product development philosophies. Now, let's turn to Foundry, our post-production media and entertainment software business. Foundry continued to roll out innovative product updates and ML-powered functionality this quarter, meaningfully enhancing the creative process for high-quality, post-production visual effects. Given the continued impacts related to the recent industry strikes, Foundry declined in the quarter as expected. We now expect the hangover from the strikes to carry into next year as Foundry's customers continue to navigate through tight economic conditions until the creative pipelines matriculate to the post-production phase, which we expect to be sometime during 2025. As mentioned, the balance of this segment grew mid-singles organically in the quarter with solid execution across this portfolio. In particular, ConstructConnect continued its solid march of improved financial results and bookings momentum. In addition, ConstructConnect continues to lead the market with our GenAI-powered takeoff and estimating solutions. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses performed well, led by our software solutions at MHA, SoftWriters and SHP and further benefited from improved senior care occupancy. Turning to the final quarter of the year, we expect organic revenue to improve a bit but remain in the low single-digits area as we continue to experience stable but muted freight market conditions. Now, please turn to Page 12 and let's review our TEP segment's results. Revenue here grew 4% in total and on organic basis and EBITDA margins came in at 35.4%. We'll start with Neptune. Neptune rapidly resolved our mechanical meter production issue within the quarter, performing slightly better than we anticipated. Importantly, during the short-term bespoke manufacturing challenge, Neptune was able to deliver on all their customer commitments. In addition, Neptune continues to see solid demand for both mechanical and static meters, positioning Neptune very well for the foreseeable future. Next, we'll turn to Verathon. Verathon continues to perform exceptionally well with solid growth across our GlideScope and BFlex product offerings. Of particular note, we're pleased to report that Verathon is the market-share leader in the US for single-use bronchoscopes. Five years ago, we entered this market with a strong belief that we had a higher right to win given our incumbent GlideScope position and now we have claimed the market-share leadership position and Verathon is not done. Great job by team Verathon. Northern Digital or NDI declined as we expected in the quarter based on customer program timing that led to a very difficult comp. That said, OEM order activity remained strong in the quarter. Finally, Inovonics and rf IDEAS each declined against difficult prior year comps. As a reminder, these businesses started recovering from supply chain challenges last year. For the fourth quarter, we expect to improve to high single-digit growth given Neptune is back on track operationally and NDI's customer program timing begins to normalize. With that, please turn with us to Page 14. Now let's review our full-year 2024 guidance and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. Based on strong application segment margin performance and the addition of Transact Campus, we're increasing our total year growth outlook to be north of 13% and we expect full-year organic growth to remain consistent in the 6% area. In addition, we're raising our full-year guidance to be in the range of $18.21 and $18.25, the high-end of our previous range and an increase of $0.06 at the midpoint. Please note, we expect Transact to be DEPS-neutral for the full year. Our guidance continues to assume a full-year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted DEPS to be between $4.70 and $4.74. Please note, our newest acquisition Transact will be about $0.03 dilutive in the quarter. Also, as a reminder, the impact of our $20 million synergy plan meaningfully skews to 2025. Now, please turn with us to Page 15 and then we'll open it up for your questions. We'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. First, we delivered a solid quarter of financial results and expect an acceleration in sequential organic revenue growth heading into Q4. Second, we completed the acquisition of Transact Campus and commenced the integration with CBORD. Third, we're increasing our outlook for the full year. And finally, we are very well-positioned relative to our capital deployment strategy. For the quarter, we delivered 13% total revenue and 4% organic revenue growth, while increasing our EBITDA 10%. Of note, we grew our enterprise software bookings in a double-digit area and continued to see high single-digit ARR growth. Importantly, free-cash flow was impressive, growing 15% in the quarter and 20% on a TTM basis. Next, we completed the compelling acquisition of Transact Campus. The combination with CBORD creates a leading software and integrated payments business that helps universities solve the pressing issue of making the student campus experience more compelling. The cost synergy execution risk here is quite low, most of which has already been actioned, leading to a very attractive shareholder return. Next, we're increasing our full-year outlook for total revenue to be north of 13% and maintaining our approximate 6% organic revenue growth outlook. In addition, we're increasing our full-year DEPS outlook to the high end of our prior guidance. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with over $4 billion of capacity for capital deployment. The M&A markets continue to be very active. We have a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities that we're excited to pursue with our unbiased and disciplined approach. We remain quite bullish about our ability to execute this part of our strategy. Now, as we turn to your questions and if you can flip to the final slide, our strategic compounding flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple, we compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading, application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate in decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long term and sustained organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized, process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses in a deliberate and disciplined manner on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area. With that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor for your questions. Please go ahead, operator.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is now open.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, maybe we can start with the strategy around Transact Campus and I note that CBORD is being combined with the business right away. And historically, Roper really never clustered the application software businesses preferring more standalone siloed businesses. You never talked about scale. I don't think, I've seen a cost synergy estimate coming out of a transaction in a long time. Does this -- is this more of an opportunistic acquisition? You've done it before, you've combined medical purchasing, you've done some insurance business, back-office clustering. So we've seen this before, but this is right-off the -- out of the blocks, it's being combined and the synergies look obvious, but just maybe is there a subtle difference here, more willingness to look at these attractive growth areas? Maybe start there. Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, appreciate the opportunity to talk about that, Deane. The short answer is yes. So even going back to our Investor Day 18 months or so ago, we outlined, I think, there a modest evolution of our capital deployment strategy to focus on a bit more of what we call bolt-on activity and then also the kind of businesses that are a bit faster-growing, call it, mature leaders. And so since then, if you look at our acquisition we've done since then, we've done Strata, Syntellis. So Syntellis, and combine it with Strata. That was the -- archetype is very similar to Transact. We bought Procare, which was our first maturing leader, slightly faster growing business and then Transact. If you go back to 2019, I think we've done 26-ish acquisitions and there'd be a handful of platforms out of that. So we have leaned into a fair number of bolt-ons. I would say on the bolt-ons, the driving -- the principal driving reason for that is to buy businesses where we have a high right to win, and adjacencies that are close to ours that we think increase the likelihood for accelerated organic growth once the bolt-ton turns organic. So yeah, it's very much part of our strategy. And we've tooled up the capital deployment team that Shannon has. We've got folks that are focused on partnering with our businesses, doing a lot of the development work in the marketplace. So yes, it's a strategic intent and we've started the execution pathway.\nDeane Dray: That's great to hear. And maybe for Jason, and I appreciate you guys putting the spotlight on the free cash flow compounding flywheel because it seems like that's what you got this quarter with free cash flow up 15% and DEPS up 7%. So just talk about that spread and was there any sort of seasonal contribution to free cash flow in this quarter? Frontline typically has that's a higher contribution in the third quarter. Just any dynamics there? Thanks.\nJason Conley: Yeah. So I mean, Q3 is now our strongest cash flow quarter. I mean, since we acquired Frontline a couple of years ago and now with the addition of Transact, it's definitely our strongest quarter. Transact has helped a little bit, maybe a couple of points of growth in the quarter. It's our, as I mentioned, seasonally strong for them. But aside from that, we just had tremendous execution through the renewal seasons, which is Q3 and Q4 for us. So Q4 is expected to be strong as well. And I would just say DSO improved almost across the board for a number of our businesses. And so just good old-fashioned execution, I think, is what drove that -- that drove that outsized growth relative to DEPS.\nDeane Dray: Great to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, good morning. Neil, you mentioned some of these macro headwinds. It seems like they're turning a bit. I'm curious if you can just dig into what you're seeing in some of the tone in some of the buyers. And then just maybe for Jason, just if you can just speak to Neptune and how confident that you think we're through some of the challenges that we saw? And what are the reasons why you're confident in that recovery?\nNeil Hunn: Sure. So I'll just -- I'll take the first one, Jason will certainly take the second one. So first, I\u2019d -- just to remind everybody, we've worked hard over the last handful of years to really beat a lot of the cyclicality and macro out of what we, if you think about end markets we serve, there's education, there's legal, government contracting, there's healthcare, insurance and what we sell and what we deliver is mission-critical software. So we're generally not turned on and off based on the macro. And then most of our pricing is subscription-oriented versus transactional. So there's sort of three levels of muting in that regard. But still, we're not immune to the macro, but we muted it. I would highlight a couple that we've been talking about really since the beginning of last year first. We're talking, this time we're even -- call it six or six quarters ago, it was about interest rates and an economic slowdown. It was, I think, the most anticipated economic slowdown in modern history and that psychology of that just slowed down to some extent the enterprise class buying activity across software. We're cautiously optimistic based on the last couple of quarters of enterprise software bookings activity last quarter in the high single-digit area growth, this quarter in the double-digit area growth. Pipelines look very robust heading into the end of the year. So we need to execute that on our pipe -- those pipeline. So we're encouraged by that. The second macro factor certainly that takes the headline for us is the transportation macro with our DAT and Loadlink businesses. They're subscription oriented on both sides of the network, both the carrier and the broker. But the number of carriers in the market loosely follows the amount of tonnage that flows over the roads. And so as the tonnage has come down, so is the number of carriers that are participants in the network, which could put pressure on that. We've just seen there's probably been 20 weeks to 25 weeks of negative brokered loads compared to prior year that actually in the last handful of weeks is more normalized to last year. So we very much are seeing a stabilizing in the freight market. So those would be the macros that have impacted our business. Jason?\nJason Conley: Yeah. And just add to talk about Neptune a little bit. So if you recall, we stood up the ultrasonic or static line last quarter, the second-line. And so we had some constraints in our mechanical meter production. And so, happy to report the root causes were identified, corrective actions implemented. We had some yield issues on plastic molding that got printed. Some of the machines were creating some constraints as well. That's been remedied. Really like the trends we saw through September and those trends pretty much inform the production output for the fourth quarter and beyond. So we feel good about demand is really strong there. So it's really just getting through this mechanical meter production issue and we feel good based on what we saw in Q3 and the confidence the teams have in Q4.\nNeil Hunn: The only thing I'd add to Jason on Neptune, as I said in the prepared remarks, Neptune was able to deliver 100% on the customer commitment. So this was -- there's no issue there. Kaizen continue to improve and get even further improvements and Don and the team did a great job just going to gemba on the shop floor and getting to root cause.\nBrent Thill: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe I just wanted to follow up on the sort of the macro context as it pertains to network software specifically. As we're thinking out sort of beyond this quarter trying to gauge how you're thinking about the recovery slope at network software, you cautioned that Foundry in aggregate next year may not see much growth because of the ongoing sort of strikes hangover. I just wondered on sort of DAT and Loadlink that portion what the expectation is? Do you think it's plausible, we could just keep moving sideways sort of sequentially for some time? And maybe just frame as you see it now, how much are Foundry and the freight match businesses down in 2024?\nNeil Hunn: So I'll take the first part. So, on DAT and Loadlink, it was intentional that we changed our word choice this call to be stabilizing. So it is very much a stabilized market. We anticipate for until we see anything other than stabilized, that we're going to be in this position from just a tonnage or load volumes that are going over the roads and into the network. That said, DAT does have a pathway and a plan, a high confidence plan to return to some modest levels of growth next year with no assumed improvement in carrier network participation through packaging price. And so we'll have, like I said, some modest growth at DAT next year that we have a pretty high degree of confidence heading into our AOP sessions that comes that will occur next month. And then on Foundry, it's just the -- waiting for the post-production employment to return to its historical levels. I think we're about 15% below pre-pandemic or pre-strike, I should say, employment levels and post-production and we just need -- the content is being produced, it's just got to matriculate through the pipelines and that will be sometime in 2025. So it's definitely taken a few quarters longer than we anticipated earlier in the year. Jason?\nJason Conley: Yeah. Sorry, freight match is down sort of low singles for this year. I think we definitely think for NS in general that the Q3 is the low point for us. And then that will start to trend up as Neil said through the fourth quarter and then into next year and the pacing is just dependent on sort of the market momentum there. On Foundry, it's been down double-digits this year and that's been pretty consistent throughout the year. So we expected a little bit more of a recovery in the second half of this year. But as Neil said, it's taken a little bit longer. So yeah, as we think about the trends for next year, I think, the first quarter, just to remind you, we had -- we called out an MHA sort of sort of one-time item this year. So beyond that though, we expect steady growth into next year for the segment.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. And then just my follow-up, switching back maybe to the EBITDA margins at TEP. So those have been sort of down year-on-year for a few quarters. You've mentioned the production issues, there were clearly supply-chain efficiencies sort of moving around. As we look-ahead at TEP, kind of what's the confidence maybe that margins can return to year-on-year expansion in the coming quarters.\nJason Conley: Yeah. No, you're right. I mean, the second and third quarter we had -- if you recall last year, we had some big supply-chain liberation for our med product businesses and our product businesses. This year we're down a little bit. NDI is down, had a little bit of negative mix and we're obviously investing for growth there just because it's always been a consistent double-digit grower for us. So we're continuing to invest in NDI. But I think for the year, just thinking broadly, we're going to be flat EBITDA margin. And so it should inflect back up in the fourth quarter.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nTerry Tillman: Yeah, thanks. Hi, Neil, Jason and Zack. And my primary question is actually on the enterprise software bookings. I think you said double-digits, up from high single-digits. I don't know what you could share in terms of what kind of budget flush you're looking for 4Q. I assume there is some of that. So if you could make either a comment on that or just more importantly, if the bookings are picking up, do you think there's potentially an inflection in the first half next year or second half just depending on how some of that activates to revenue? And then I had a follow-up.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, I'll provide some color there, Terry. I mean, I think you're right. The fourth quarter for us is not necessarily a budget flush, it's probably just more customer behavior. It's typically our biggest quarter. So we're obviously keen to see how that plays out. You're right, the last couple of quarters have been strong. I think just a little bit of color. Neil mentioned that Deltek, GovCon Enterprise got a little bit better. So if you think about what happened from Q2 to Q3, that was a little bit of the delta. Also, Verathon was really strong, specifically in the carrier space. Also had good broker expansions, but carriers has been an area that has been a focus for them. So good to see some new logo wins there. And then Aderant has been really strong as we've mentioned, but it's really good to see the balance of both expansion of existing customers and then some new logo wins with their Sierra Cloud products. So it's good to see that they're continuing to win in the market with new logos. And then when we think about the -- the fourth-quarter is going to be important, like, as I mentioned in terms of how that plays into next year and sort of how that will matriculate into revenue. But we're encouraged what we saw the last couple of quarters.\nJason Conley: Yeah, we are -- obviously, we continue to have enterprise bookings momentum that will matriculate into revenue. And next year, the timing of which depends on implementation timeframes and customer go-lives. But yeah, I mean, it's definitely a trend that we're watching carefully.\nTerry Tillman: That's good to hear. And just my secondary question. Neil, you commented earlier when you get into kind of business level commentary and kind of talent management moves you make. I think you talked about Procare and Frontline. I guess kind of -- what drove kind of some changes there? And I think you said go-to-market is the idea that, hey, they're doing well, but they could be doing even better or just maybe you could double-click a little bit into Procare and Frontline and what to expect with some of those leadership changes? Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Sure. So they're are two different things. I'll start with Procare. So, Procare, we identified in our diligence process that there is an opportunity to improve, modernize whatever word choice you want to pick, the go-to-market functions. And so within a couple of months of ownership, by the way, we shared those diligence finding and value-creation lever with the leadership team of Procare, they agreed with that. We made a leadership change. I like what's happening there, obviously the leadership change in go-to-market for Procare which by the way is an internal promote, it was somebody from within the company. And then, you can start attacking the underlying opportunities, which was there's a lead-generation opportunity. There's a way they actually staff the calls between inbound, outbound, between business development and closures. There's a compensation angle, there's call scripts around attach rates and upselling. So all that is happening and we're -- it's very early days, but starting to gain some encouragement, so that's starting to yield some fruit. So it was again a diligence finding where we thought there was a value creation lever attached to it and the team sort of attacked it pretty quickly. It's simply different. So our existing leader retired or indicated he wanted to retire. So we had an opportunity with Matt Strazza that we have a long history with. As I mentioned, hired, and came into the organization as the go to market leader at Deltek. Did a wonderful job there. Then his first CEO opportunity was the ConstructConnect. Just did a terrific job in terms of the way the business is run. It's very much run in a Roper style and he's a very growth-oriented leader. And so given that Frontline is one of our more attractive growth assets, we wanted a growth leader there. And it\u2019s very early days. I mean, he's two months into the job or something like that at Frontline. And then [indiscernible] effect of that is the CFO at ConstructConnect, Buck Brody became the CEO of ConstructConnect and then the Head of FP&A became the CFO at ConstructConnect. So from an enterprise risk perspective, we're able to sort of promote and rotate leaders inside Roper. And essentially the outside hire is an FP&A leader at a business versus the CEO of one of our larger businesses. So it's a win-win for the organization and individuals.\nTerry Tillman: That's great. That's very helpful. Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: My pleasure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: I wanted -- just a little bit of a high-level question, but there was a lot of price in the last couple of years, not just you guys, pretty much everybody out there. But have you found any harder to get price incrementally? Are we back to kind of more normal? When we walk into 2025, for example, we would be back to kind of the more normal price increased cadence, particularly in software, obviously. But just a high-level picture, what do you see there?\nNeil Hunn: I would say just, I would -- I seem to recall you asking a price question a few years ago as well. So for us on software, we've always had a pricing mechanism in the ARR snowball. Right. As a general matter, we trip -- we have 95-or-so-percent gross retention. So we're going to trip 5-or-so-percent. We're going to offset the vast majority of that at each business unit level with price. It's just in the algorithm, it's in the price expectation with the customers, it\u2019s in what we do from a new product feature point of view with the R&D and efforts we support that obviously [cross-sell itself] (ph) from there to get you net retention in the 105-ish range across the blended enterprise. And we have net new on top of that. That I would say is a muscle that is very well understood and built. We can obviously get better. An example, we've gotten better with that over the last few years with PowerPlan, they didn't have that muscle built. Now it is built. But I would say we didn't get outsized pricing in software and so in the past and so it's just reverting to normal. On the tech businesses, I would say that's a little different. Most of the businesses would take price when they launch a new product. Now there's just a more normalized inflationary every year for 18 months or so opportunity to pass the regular wave of inflation across.\nJason Conley: Yeah, typically medical product, too, it's all about new products versus price just because you're sort of bound by some of the customer contracts with hospitals and the like. But yeah, I think Neil's point on software is it's been part of the rhythm for a long time. A lot of what we've done in strategic plan reviews is understand key purchasing criteria and really unpacking that at a more detailed level for each of our businesses and that's helped them. It's provided some confidence or just some insight into what the customer thinks about the value proposition and that's been helpful as well.\nScott Davis: Okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense and it's consistent with what you said a couple of years ago. But hey guys, there's just a lot of debate as it relates to software around AI, Generative AI. But, I just wonder kind of your view now that you've had a chance to dig more into this and spend more time on it. It's certainly in your slide decks and you're launching products. But does the Generative AI essentially raise the barrier to entry because you have the relationship with the customer already and you can shorten your time to market on product innovation or is it the opposite, and people can come in with a lower priced product easier because just the development cycles are somewhat shorter? How do you guys think about that?\nNeil Hunn: I think it's very much the former, the first. I mean it is -- if you think about what we're doing, first of all, it's the highest level. I mean it's a real thing. We're definitely, I think the whole market is in sort of the trough of disillusionment if you will. I mean the hype is -- the reality is starting to catch up with the hype. I would say the number of new use cases that are being created, I think just not only for Roper, but what we read externally is slowing but we're very much advancing the existing use cases whether it's internal productivity or customer-facing product stuff. I would remind you and everybody that from why we think this is an accelerator and sort of raises the barrier to entry is, to do Generative AI, I think you have to have two things. Well, right. And [Technical Difficulty] software businesses are naturally positioned better than others in regards to these two questions. The first is you need to have [elements I should say those] (ph) questions. You need to have the data that is very, very specific to what the question is you're answering. But then you also need to know what question to ask. And again the more nuanced the question, the better the generative tools are. And I'll give you a very simple example. We have a legal assortment of business that is the ERP backbone for large law firms, right? It's professional services project-based billing. The question is not how do you create a professional-based bill, it's how do you create a -- how does law firm A create a compliant bill for Roper Technologies? Right. And so the very specific bespoke questions, the nuanced questions is where the general tools really, really shine. So unless you, the incumbency really matters in that regard. So it's not about the -- we can develop software as faster, faster than any startup can build software from a generative point of view, but we have the incumbency and the data. I'll probably say verticalized software businesses generally and the incumbency in the data and the specific questions of which to sort of ask if you will.\nScott Davis: That's good color and context. Thanks. Good luck, guys. Appreciate it.\nNeil Hunn: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Good morning.\nSteve Tusa: Just on the -- following up on Julian's question, on the NSS business for next year. So, which businesses are accelerating and how much of a headwind is that MHA benefit in the first quarter? And then will you be able to kind of get into that mid-single-digit range for that business next year?\nNeil Hunn: So, I think, Steve, I think we want to stop short of even implying any guidance in the next year. What I would say just broadly across the enterprise is we like the momentum we're seeing in enterprise software bookings and the fact that it is normalized, a pretty normalized 2024 year from which to grow. You see the reacceleration heading into Q4. We expect those Q4 trends to carry into '25, but I think we want to just sort of stop there short of issuing guidance next quarter.\nJason Conley: That's right. I think on MHA, we can call that as a couple -- MHA in Q1 is a couple of points of drag in Q1.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Okay. And then just lastly on cash. Obviously, a really strong result here. Seasonally, it steps up. How does it now behave seasonally in Q4? Last year, you were down, but not by much like basically kind of flat-to-down. Is that kind of the new seasonality? Or was there something unusual in Q4? Maybe just help us with this seasonality because it's definitely different than it's been in the past given the Frontline.\nJason Conley: Yeah. Q4 used to be our strongest and now like I said, Q3 is our strongest. I think it will be -- we won't see quite the same increase in the fourth quarter as we did the third. Obviously, we got -- Transact came in. So that was helpful, but that's obviously, the strongest collections quarter as well. So that will -- it will be up, but not as much as Q3 in the fourth quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Sorry, one more. Just on Vertafore, I didn't see it in the slides, any updates there?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, Vertafore had -- I think Jason mentioned in his prepared remarks, they had a couple of very, very nice wins in the quarter. You can't really talk about them quite yet. But we will be able to -- also they've had a very impactful product release and they have a product called BenefitPoint, which is the leading product for sort of managing the medical health insurance book. And the -- they have an automation feature that saves like 45 minutes per customer per -- per benefit plan. So this is tens of thousands of hours of productivity that were sort of given to our customers. It's a huge release. They worked on this for quite a bit. So, like what's happening with new product development point of view, couple of nice exciting wins and steady-as-she-goes.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Congrats on the cash. Thanks.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nJoe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning.\nNeil Hunn: Hey, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, so on Neptune, it's good to hear the production issues have been fixed. Just curious, like we've been hearing some, like kind of mixed, I guess, about order patterns in that business. Like, I know almost everyone in that sector had like huge orders for a multi-year period and backlogs are really high. Are you getting any sense of like change in like the incoming flow from like a new bookings standpoint for Neptune?\nNeil Hunn: I would say, it's very much what we expect and what you just described. So during the pandemic, I mean pre-pandemic, this was a four to eight-week lead time business, very much a book-and-ship type business. During COVID, we got -- our lead times gapped out to maybe 12 or 14 weeks, but we had 12 to 18 months of backlog ordered -- the order activity and now the order duration is compressing, but the number, the order volume, if you will, the repeat orders are not. So we're not -- it's just a -- instead of booking a year out, they're booking whatever six -- the customer booking six or nine months out. So that order of duration is coming in as expected. But nothing again for repetitive purposes, nothing from a number of meters that are being shipped to an account-by-account basis, that is all healthy.\nJoe Giordano: Yeah, that makes sense. Just curious if any of your businesses, like, if you -- when you talk to the leaders, are any of them like super-excited or super nervous one way or another about the election outcome? Like, I know, I'm thinking maybe is Deltek get excited about a potential, like, an inflationary kind of spending spree from the government like this and I guess across the portfolio, is anything that you call out one way or the other?\nNeil Hunn: As a general matter, I'd say we're apolitical and no. I mean we're not really impacted positive and negative by either the administration. Relative to Deltek, want to remind you and others is that the government always spends. The administration determines the nature of the spend. So if you go way back, in the Bush era it was defense and Obama was education and healthcare. And so the spend flow changes but the government contractors just position their capabilities where the flow of the federal spending is going. And so that's relatively -- it's just what their business is. I would say for '25, the '25 appropriations are actually pretty well understood at this stage and aren't going to change based on the election. That's why I think we're starting to see some of the enterprise government contracting activities starting to thaw a little bit, at least for the one year target, if you will, is relatively well understood.\nJoe Giordano: Great. Thanks guys.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, good morning, guys. So my first question just a little bit longer-term. Neil, as you have these ambitions to grow the portfolio at a faster clip over the longer-term period, like, do you think you have the right portfolio in place or is there maybe some addition by subtraction to help you kind of achieve the ambitions of maybe more of like a high single-digit type organic growth number going forward?\nNeil Hunn: I think we -- the portfolio we like, we think that there is, we have high confidence there's opportunity for every business inside of Roper to do better. No company has reached its full potential relative to its organic growth. What we like about our approach to improve organic growth is it tends to be quite sticky and sustainable. The downside is it takes time, right? There's no -- it doesn't happen in a year and we cited it at our Investor Day and I'll cite it here again. I mean a great example for us in TEP is our Verathon business. Eight or nine years ago, it was a low single-digit growth business. Now it's a low teens, maybe higher growth business, we think sustainably for quite some time and it takes, just, unfortunately, it takes time to get the strategy right to enable the strategy to build the talent offense to seed in deeply a culture of continuous improvement. We're four or five years in across the portfolio for that and so we're definitely gaining some traction but we like our odds in terms of being able to improve the organic growth. Then in addition, as I mentioned, I think one of the -- definitely one of the -- the first question today is as we deploy our capital, we're definitely tilting towards slightly higher growth businesses like the Transact combined with CBORD high singles, Procare mid-teens. So there's going to be a little bit of mix-up over time in terms of the portfolio mix.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And maybe just following up on that last point, with your leverage now around 3 times net leverage, and I recognize that the pipeline is still strong, do you expect to see any pause in M&A activity as you de-lever and then start to get a little bit more opportunistic or could you see yourself doing transactions in the next -- in the near-term, call it, the next three to six months?\nNeil Hunn: Yeah. I mean the -- as Jason alluded, we've got $4 billion plus of M&A capacity as we sit today. Over the course of the next 12 months or so, we're very active in the M&A markets. It's a very attractive market. There's lots of sellers, one of the largest sponsors in the world, European sponsors on CNBC earlier this week and asked about what's the mantra, it's sell, sell, sell. So there's a lot of LP pressure, DPI matters a lot. And so there's essentially three or four years\u2019 worth of deals that are compressing here in the next year or two. And so it's a very attractive market. We plan to be active in that.\nJoe Ritchie: Great to hear. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Glynn: Yeah, thanks. Was going to ask also about the deal dynamics out there. You answered the supply side. On the demand side, is that still very favorable to where you're seeing diluted buyer activity per deal?\nNeil Hunn: In terms of the competitive intensity on a per deal basis, if that's the question, it's hard to ultimately know. I mean, I would call out that we did the Transact deal on a proprietary basis. I would say that our M&A teams are engaged in -- engaging in more proprietary or quasi-proprietary opportunities and I can recall quite some time. And -- but -- and I think it's -- so we know those are facts. I think where I would speculate a little bit with so many opportunities that are going to be coming out of the pipeline, I think all buyers are going to be a little more discerning early in processes, which might lead to a little bit lower competitive intensity, but hard to know that to be an absolute case.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And then in terms of Deltek and the general GovCon exposure, a lot of the stimulus in mega projects, a lot of compliance hurdles are gating that process. Are you seeing any increased letting or momentum in that? And what's the implication for those platforms in '25?\nNeil Hunn: I would say the -- I would just refer back to what we were talking about before with GovCon. It has been for six quarters slowish based on the uncertainty. About four to six quarters slow based on the uncertainty of the government spending, the operation of the government. We saw some green shoots here in the last quarter or two relative, especially in the enterprise class. Some of the larger customers are starting to be acquisitive again of Deltek. The exact underpinnings of the drivers, some of that might be infrastructure, but some of it might be other things. That's not in our specific purview.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. Thank you.\nNeil Hunn: Yeah, Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zach Moxcey for any closing remarks.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: This concludes -- the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thank you, Zach, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our third quarter results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 4, you'll see the topics we'll cover today. I'll start by highlighting our third quarter financial performance. Jason will then go through our financial results in greater detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity and discuss our very strong cash-flow performance. Then, I'll walk everyone through a summary of our most recent acquisition, Transact Campus, then discuss our segment highlights and review our increased guidance for the full year. After our closing remarks, we'll open the call for your questions. So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the four key takeaways for today's call are, first, we again delivered another solid quarter results and expect an acceleration in sequential organic revenue growth heading into Q4. Second, we completed the Transact Campus acquisition, a very attractive business at a very attractive net purchase price. Third, we're raising our full-year guidance to the high end of our range. And fourth, we continue to be very well-positioned relative to executing on our capital deployment strategy. Now digging a bit deeper into these four key takeaways. We grew total revenue by 13%, organic revenue by 4% and EBITDA by 10%. Importantly, we grew free cash flow by 15% in the quarter and by 20% on a TTM basis. Operationally in the quarter, Neptune performed slightly better than our expectations as they resolved last quarter's mechanical meter production challenges. And also importantly, we're encouraged to see strong organic enterprise software bookings momentum continue this quarter, growing in the double-digits area, up from last quarter's high single-digits bookings growth. Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Transact Campus. Our CBORD business is being combined with Transact and integration activities are well underway. This is yet another very compelling value-creation opportunity for our shareholders, which we'll discuss in a bit. Based on strong enterprise margin performance, we're increasing our full-year 2024 DEPS guidance to the high end of our range. In addition, we're increasing our outlook for total revenue growth to be 13% plus given the addition of our most recent acquisition, Transact Campus. Finally, we're maintaining our approximate 6% organic revenue outlook for the year. If we step back a bit, we recognize we just posted back-to-back 4% organic growth quarters, although not unexpected without question unsatisfying. That said, we do see quarterly organic growth momentum improving and expect our Q4 organic growth to sequentially improve given back-to-back quarters of strong enterprise bookings growth, stabilizing freight market conditions, albeit at the bottom, our resolved Neptune operational issue and MDI returning to growth in Q4. So with this mostly behind us, we're confident we are seeing a reacceleration of our growth. And finally, we continue to be very active on the M&A market, an environment that continues to improve and one where we have a very large pipeline of highly attractive opportunities. We continue to be quite bullish about our ability to be active on the M&A front. So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through our quarterly and full year financial results as well as our very strong financial position. Jason? Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to our most recent acquisition overview. Transact Campus is another fantastic addition to the Roper portfolio. Let's start with the investment highlights. We paid $1.5 billion net of a $100 million tax benefit for the business. We expect Transact to deliver about $325 million of revenue and $105 million of EBITDA next year, which means we paid about 14 times the EBITDA we expect this business to contribute next year. Transact is adjusted DEPS breakeven this year, be accretive to our adjusted DEPS next year and is immediately cash flow accretive. And we will report Transact as combined with CBORD and our application software segment. On a standalone basis, Transact meets all our long-standing acquisition criteria, leader in the niche market, delivers mission-critical verticalized software solutions, competes based on customer intimacy, operates an asset-light business model and is led by a skilled, passionate leadership team. Let's talk about what the company does. Transact is a leading provider of mission-critical and purpose-built software and integrated payments to higher-education institutions in two focus areas, first, in campus identity management, and second, related to tuition management. The market itself is quite attractive and in the midst of the long-term secular tailwind of universities working to improve the on-campus experience required to attract and retain the next generation of students. We estimate the combined market size to be in the $1.5 billion range and growing 6% to 8% per annum. As previously mentioned, we're integrating our CBORD business with Transact. CBORD will combine its university campus ID business with that of Transact, creating a leading provider of these solution. We expect a long-term organic growth rate of the combined business to be in the high single-digits area. The go-forward leadership team has been announced, the 2025 $20 million cost synergy plan is well underway and the initial set of customer feedback has been quite positive. As you can see, Transact is a highly compelling value-creation opportunity for Roper and our shareholders. As we turn to Page 10, let's review our application software segment results. Revenue here grew by 23% in total and organic revenue grew by 5.5%. EBITDA margins were 43.6% and core margins improved 20 basis points in the quarter. Before getting into the business-specific details, I would like to share a few macro trends we're seeing across this segment. First, we continue to see improving organic enterprise bookings performance, growing in the double-digits area in the quarter following HSD growth in Q2. Importantly, the enterprise-class customer sluggishness we saw during 2023 and the first quarter of this year appears to be waning. Finally, we continue to see strong growth in recurring and reoccurring revenue in this segment, growing in the high single-digit area in the quarter. Turning to our business unit-specific commentary, we'll start with Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of large law firms. Aderant continues to perform incredibly well in the market and had another great quarter. Over the past few quarters, we have highlighted Aderant's improved product development velocity and in particular, with GenAI powered features. Now, this innovation activity is adding to their already-strong bookings momentum, including very nice new customer additions and continued progress in adding new and expanded products within their existing customer base. Deltek, our software business serving government contracting, architecture, engineering and construction markets was strong in the quarter as well. In particular, Deltek's enterprise-class government contracting customer activity improved in the quarter, which is encouraging to see. Also, and as a reminder, Deltek continued their ongoing cloud-based software momentum and expanded their GenAI embedded functionality. PowerPlan, our financial planning and tax software business serving heavy fixed assets industries continues to impress with their operating and financial results. PowerPlan has done a tremendous job over the last three or four years on improving the customer experience, accelerating their software innovation velocity and improving upsell, cross-sell activity. Great job by Joe and his team in Atlanta. Frontline continues to perform nicely and had strong renewal activity and delivered excellent seasonally high cash flow. Of note, we're excited to announce Matt Strazza as Frontline's new CEO. As some of you may recall, Matt joined Roper as Deltek's go-to-market leader, then was promoted to be the CEO of ConstructConnect. Matt did a wonderful job at ConstructConnect and we're excited about having this growth-oriented leader at the helm at Frontline. Also of note, we promoted Buck Brody, ConstructConnect's CFO to assume the CEO role. Buck has been in the Roper ecosystem mostly as the CFO over the past 13 years. This is one of the first, though certainly not the last time, we'll promote leaders across and within Roper. We continue to remain quite bullish about the future for Frontline. Our Healthcare IT businesses led by Strata and Data Innovations were also strong in the quarter and delivered excellent growth. Finally, Procare continues to execute well. Importantly, as part of our evolving governance processes tied to faster growth or maturing leader nature of our portfolio, Roper is working to improve its go-to-market capabilities from lead-generation to deal execution as well as go-to-market leadership. We really like what we're seeing here, although it's early days. As it relates to the guidance for the final quarter of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Please turn with us to page 11. Organic revenue at our network software segment grew 1% in the quarter and was impacted by the fact we continued to experience pressure with our freight matching businesses and work through the impact on Foundry from the recent actors and writers strikes. Excluding our freight matching businesses and Foundry, this segment grew in the mid-singles area, which demonstrates the underlying quality of this group of businesses. EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 56.2%. Let's dig into the details and start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which declined slightly as expected due to the continuing challenging freight market conditions that adversely impact both businesses. That said, we continue to see further signs of market stabilization for both carriers and brokers. During this softer period, DAT continues to invest to accelerate new product development philosophies. Now, let's turn to Foundry, our post-production media and entertainment software business. Foundry continued to roll out innovative product updates and ML-powered functionality this quarter, meaningfully enhancing the creative process for high-quality, post-production visual effects. Given the continued impacts related to the recent industry strikes, Foundry declined in the quarter as expected. We now expect the hangover from the strikes to carry into next year as Foundry's customers continue to navigate through tight economic conditions until the creative pipelines matriculate to the post-production phase, which we expect to be sometime during 2025. As mentioned, the balance of this segment grew mid-singles organically in the quarter with solid execution across this portfolio. In particular, ConstructConnect continued its solid march of improved financial results and bookings momentum. In addition, ConstructConnect continues to lead the market with our GenAI-powered takeoff and estimating solutions. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses performed well, led by our software solutions at MHA, SoftWriters and SHP and further benefited from improved senior care occupancy. Turning to the final quarter of the year, we expect organic revenue to improve a bit but remain in the low single-digits area as we continue to experience stable but muted freight market conditions. Now, please turn to Page 12 and let's review our TEP segment's results. Revenue here grew 4% in total and on organic basis and EBITDA margins came in at 35.4%. We'll start with Neptune. Neptune rapidly resolved our mechanical meter production issue within the quarter, performing slightly better than we anticipated. Importantly, during the short-term bespoke manufacturing challenge, Neptune was able to deliver on all their customer commitments. In addition, Neptune continues to see solid demand for both mechanical and static meters, positioning Neptune very well for the foreseeable future. Next, we'll turn to Verathon. Verathon continues to perform exceptionally well with solid growth across our GlideScope and BFlex product offerings. Of particular note, we're pleased to report that Verathon is the market-share leader in the US for single-use bronchoscopes. Five years ago, we entered this market with a strong belief that we had a higher right to win given our incumbent GlideScope position and now we have claimed the market-share leadership position and Verathon is not done. Great job by team Verathon. Northern Digital or NDI declined as we expected in the quarter based on customer program timing that led to a very difficult comp. That said, OEM order activity remained strong in the quarter. Finally, Inovonics and rf IDEAS each declined against difficult prior year comps. As a reminder, these businesses started recovering from supply chain challenges last year. For the fourth quarter, we expect to improve to high single-digit growth given Neptune is back on track operationally and NDI's customer program timing begins to normalize. With that, please turn with us to Page 14. Now let's review our full-year 2024 guidance and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. Based on strong application segment margin performance and the addition of Transact Campus, we're increasing our total year growth outlook to be north of 13% and we expect full-year organic growth to remain consistent in the 6% area. In addition, we're raising our full-year guidance to be in the range of $18.21 and $18.25, the high-end of our previous range and an increase of $0.06 at the midpoint. Please note, we expect Transact to be DEPS-neutral for the full year. Our guidance continues to assume a full-year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted DEPS to be between $4.70 and $4.74. Please note, our newest acquisition Transact will be about $0.03 dilutive in the quarter. Also, as a reminder, the impact of our $20 million synergy plan meaningfully skews to 2025. Now, please turn with us to Page 15 and then we'll open it up for your questions. We'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. First, we delivered a solid quarter of financial results and expect an acceleration in sequential organic revenue growth heading into Q4. Second, we completed the acquisition of Transact Campus and commenced the integration with CBORD. Third, we're increasing our outlook for the full year. And finally, we are very well-positioned relative to our capital deployment strategy. For the quarter, we delivered 13% total revenue and 4% organic revenue growth, while increasing our EBITDA 10%. Of note, we grew our enterprise software bookings in a double-digit area and continued to see high single-digit ARR growth. Importantly, free-cash flow was impressive, growing 15% in the quarter and 20% on a TTM basis. Next, we completed the compelling acquisition of Transact Campus. The combination with CBORD creates a leading software and integrated payments business that helps universities solve the pressing issue of making the student campus experience more compelling. The cost synergy execution risk here is quite low, most of which has already been actioned, leading to a very attractive shareholder return. Next, we're increasing our full-year outlook for total revenue to be north of 13% and maintaining our approximate 6% organic revenue growth outlook. In addition, we're increasing our full-year DEPS outlook to the high end of our prior guidance. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with over $4 billion of capacity for capital deployment. The M&A markets continue to be very active. We have a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities that we're excited to pursue with our unbiased and disciplined approach. We remain quite bullish about our ability to execute this part of our strategy. Now, as we turn to your questions and if you can flip to the final slide, our strategic compounding flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple, we compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading, application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate in decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long term and sustained organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized, process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses in a deliberate and disciplined manner on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area. With that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor for your questions. Please go ahead, operator. Good morning, Deane. Yeah, appreciate the opportunity to talk about that, Deane. The short answer is yes. So even going back to our Investor Day 18 months or so ago, we outlined, I think, there a modest evolution of our capital deployment strategy to focus on a bit more of what we call bolt-on activity and then also the kind of businesses that are a bit faster-growing, call it, mature leaders. And so since then, if you look at our acquisition we've done since then, we've done Strata, Syntellis. So Syntellis, and combine it with Strata. That was the -- archetype is very similar to Transact. We bought Procare, which was our first maturing leader, slightly faster growing business and then Transact. If you go back to 2019, I think we've done 26-ish acquisitions and there'd be a handful of platforms out of that. So we have leaned into a fair number of bolt-ons. I would say on the bolt-ons, the driving -- the principal driving reason for that is to buy businesses where we have a high right to win, and adjacencies that are close to ours that we think increase the likelihood for accelerated organic growth once the bolt-ton turns organic. So yeah, it's very much part of our strategy. And we've tooled up the capital deployment team that Shannon has. We've got folks that are focused on partnering with our businesses, doing a lot of the development work in the marketplace. So yes, it's a strategic intent and we've started the execution pathway. Sure. So I'll just -- I'll take the first one, Jason will certainly take the second one. So first, I'd -- just to remind everybody, we've worked hard over the last handful of years to really beat a lot of the cyclicality and macro out of what we, if you think about end markets we serve, there's education, there's legal, government contracting, there's healthcare, insurance and what we sell and what we deliver is mission-critical software. So we're generally not turned on and off based on the macro. And then most of our pricing is subscription-oriented versus transactional. So there's sort of three levels of muting in that regard. But still, we're not immune to the macro, but we muted it. I would highlight a couple that we've been talking about really since the beginning of last year first. We're talking, this time we're even -- call it six or six quarters ago, it was about interest rates and an economic slowdown. It was, I think, the most anticipated economic slowdown in modern history and that psychology of that just slowed down to some extent the enterprise class buying activity across software. We're cautiously optimistic based on the last couple of quarters of enterprise software bookings activity last quarter in the high single-digit area growth, this quarter in the double-digit area growth. Pipelines look very robust heading into the end of the year. So we need to execute that on our pipe -- those pipeline. So we're encouraged by that. The second macro factor certainly that takes the headline for us is the transportation macro with our DAT and Loadlink businesses. They're subscription oriented on both sides of the network, both the carrier and the broker. But the number of carriers in the market loosely follows the amount of tonnage that flows over the roads. And so as the tonnage has come down, so is the number of carriers that are participants in the network, which could put pressure on that. We've just seen there's probably been 20 weeks to 25 weeks of negative brokered loads compared to prior year that actually in the last handful of weeks is more normalized to last year. So we very much are seeing a stabilizing in the freight market. So those would be the macros that have impacted our business. Jason? The only thing I'd add to Jason on Neptune, as I said in the prepared remarks, Neptune was able to deliver 100% on the customer commitment. So this was -- there's no issue there. Kaizen continue to improve and get even further improvements and Don and the team did a great job just going to gemba on the shop floor and getting to root cause. Good morning, Julian. So I'll take the first part. So, on DAT and Loadlink, it was intentional that we changed our word choice this call to be stabilizing. So it is very much a stabilized market. We anticipate for until we see anything other than stabilized, that we're going to be in this position from just a tonnage or load volumes that are going over the roads and into the network. That said, DAT does have a pathway and a plan, a high confidence plan to return to some modest levels of growth next year with no assumed improvement in carrier network participation through packaging price. And so we'll have, like I said, some modest growth at DAT next year that we have a pretty high degree of confidence heading into our AOP sessions that comes that will occur next month. And then on Foundry, it's just the -- waiting for the post-production employment to return to its historical levels. I think we're about 15% below pre-pandemic or pre-strike, I should say, employment levels and post-production and we just need -- the content is being produced, it's just got to matriculate through the pipelines and that will be sometime in 2025. So it's definitely taken a few quarters longer than we anticipated earlier in the year. Jason? Yeah, I'll provide some color there, Terry. I mean, I think you're right. The fourth quarter for us is not necessarily a budget flush, it's probably just more customer behavior. It's typically our biggest quarter. So we're obviously keen to see how that plays out. You're right, the last couple of quarters have been strong. I think just a little bit of color. Neil mentioned that Deltek, GovCon Enterprise got a little bit better. So if you think about what happened from Q2 to Q3, that was a little bit of the delta. Also, Verathon was really strong, specifically in the carrier space. Also had good broker expansions, but carriers has been an area that has been a focus for them. So good to see some new logo wins there. And then Aderant has been really strong as we've mentioned, but it's really good to see the balance of both expansion of existing customers and then some new logo wins with their Sierra Cloud products. So it's good to see that they're continuing to win in the market with new logos. And then when we think about the -- the fourth-quarter is going to be important, like, as I mentioned in terms of how that plays into next year and sort of how that will matriculate into revenue. But we're encouraged what we saw the last couple of quarters. Sure. So they're are two different things. I'll start with Procare. So, Procare, we identified in our diligence process that there is an opportunity to improve, modernize whatever word choice you want to pick, the go-to-market functions. And so within a couple of months of ownership, by the way, we shared those diligence finding and value-creation lever with the leadership team of Procare, they agreed with that. We made a leadership change. I like what's happening there, obviously the leadership change in go-to-market for Procare which by the way is an internal promote, it was somebody from within the company. And then, you can start attacking the underlying opportunities, which was there's a lead-generation opportunity. There's a way they actually staff the calls between inbound, outbound, between business development and closures. There's a compensation angle, there's call scripts around attach rates and upselling. So all that is happening and we're -- it's very early days, but starting to gain some encouragement, so that's starting to yield some fruit. So it was again a diligence finding where we thought there was a value creation lever attached to it and the team sort of attacked it pretty quickly. It's simply different. So our existing leader retired or indicated he wanted to retire. So we had an opportunity with Matt Strazza that we have a long history with. As I mentioned, hired, and came into the organization as the go to market leader at Deltek. Did a wonderful job there. Then his first CEO opportunity was the ConstructConnect. Just did a terrific job in terms of the way the business is run. It's very much run in a Roper style and he's a very growth-oriented leader. And so given that Frontline is one of our more attractive growth assets, we wanted a growth leader there. And it's very early days. I mean, he's two months into the job or something like that at Frontline. And then [indiscernible] effect of that is the CFO at ConstructConnect, Buck Brody became the CEO of ConstructConnect and then the Head of FP&A became the CFO at ConstructConnect. So from an enterprise risk perspective, we're able to sort of promote and rotate leaders inside Roper. And essentially the outside hire is an FP&A leader at a business versus the CEO of one of our larger businesses. So it's a win-win for the organization and individuals. My pleasure. Good morning, Scott. I would say just, I would -- I seem to recall you asking a price question a few years ago as well. So for us on software, we've always had a pricing mechanism in the ARR snowball. Right. As a general matter, we trip -- we have 95-or-so-percent gross retention. So we're going to trip 5-or-so-percent. We're going to offset the vast majority of that at each business unit level with price. It's just in the algorithm, it's in the price expectation with the customers, it's in what we do from a new product feature point of view with the R&D and efforts we support that obviously [cross-sell itself] (ph) from there to get you net retention in the 105-ish range across the blended enterprise. And we have net new on top of that. That I would say is a muscle that is very well understood and built. We can obviously get better. An example, we've gotten better with that over the last few years with PowerPlan, they didn't have that muscle built. Now it is built. But I would say we didn't get outsized pricing in software and so in the past and so it's just reverting to normal. On the tech businesses, I would say that's a little different. Most of the businesses would take price when they launch a new product. Now there's just a more normalized inflationary every year for 18 months or so opportunity to pass the regular wave of inflation across. I think it's very much the former, the first. I mean it is -- if you think about what we're doing, first of all, it's the highest level. I mean it's a real thing. We're definitely, I think the whole market is in sort of the trough of disillusionment if you will. I mean the hype is -- the reality is starting to catch up with the hype. I would say the number of new use cases that are being created, I think just not only for Roper, but what we read externally is slowing but we're very much advancing the existing use cases whether it's internal productivity or customer-facing product stuff. I would remind you and everybody that from why we think this is an accelerator and sort of raises the barrier to entry is, to do Generative AI, I think you have to have two things. Well, right. And [Technical Difficulty] software businesses are naturally positioned better than others in regards to these two questions. The first is you need to have [elements I should say those] (ph) questions. You need to have the data that is very, very specific to what the question is you're answering. But then you also need to know what question to ask. And again the more nuanced the question, the better the generative tools are. And I'll give you a very simple example. We have a legal assortment of business that is the ERP backbone for large law firms, right? It's professional services project-based billing. The question is not how do you create a professional-based bill, it's how do you create a -- how does law firm A create a compliant bill for Roper Technologies? Right. And so the very specific bespoke questions, the nuanced questions is where the general tools really, really shine. So unless you, the incumbency really matters in that regard. So it's not about the -- we can develop software as faster, faster than any startup can build software from a generative point of view, but we have the incumbency and the data. I'll probably say verticalized software businesses generally and the incumbency in the data and the specific questions of which to sort of ask if you will. Thanks. Good morning. So, I think, Steve, I think we want to stop short of even implying any guidance in the next year. What I would say just broadly across the enterprise is we like the momentum we're seeing in enterprise software bookings and the fact that it is normalized, a pretty normalized 2024 year from which to grow. You see the reacceleration heading into Q4. We expect those Q4 trends to carry into '25, but I think we want to just sort of stop there short of issuing guidance next quarter. Yeah, Vertafore had -- I think Jason mentioned in his prepared remarks, they had a couple of very, very nice wins in the quarter. You can't really talk about them quite yet. But we will be able to -- also they've had a very impactful product release and they have a product called BenefitPoint, which is the leading product for sort of managing the medical health insurance book. And the -- they have an automation feature that saves like 45 minutes per customer per -- per benefit plan. So this is tens of thousands of hours of productivity that were sort of given to our customers. It's a huge release. They worked on this for quite a bit. So, like what's happening with new product development point of view, couple of nice exciting wins and steady-as-she-goes. Thank you. Hey, Joe. I would say, it's very much what we expect and what you just described. So during the pandemic, I mean pre-pandemic, this was a four to eight-week lead time business, very much a book-and-ship type business. During COVID, we got -- our lead times gapped out to maybe 12 or 14 weeks, but we had 12 to 18 months of backlog ordered -- the order activity and now the order duration is compressing, but the number, the order volume, if you will, the repeat orders are not. So we're not -- it's just a -- instead of booking a year out, they're booking whatever six -- the customer booking six or nine months out. So that order of duration is coming in as expected. But nothing again for repetitive purposes, nothing from a number of meters that are being shipped to an account-by-account basis, that is all healthy. As a general matter, I'd say we're apolitical and no. I mean we're not really impacted positive and negative by either the administration. Relative to Deltek, want to remind you and others is that the government always spends. The administration determines the nature of the spend. So if you go way back, in the Bush era it was defense and Obama was education and healthcare. And so the spend flow changes but the government contractors just position their capabilities where the flow of the federal spending is going. And so that's relatively -- it's just what their business is. I would say for '25, the '25 appropriations are actually pretty well understood at this stage and aren't going to change based on the election. That's why I think we're starting to see some of the enterprise government contracting activities starting to thaw a little bit, at least for the one year target, if you will, is relatively well understood. Yeah, thanks. I think we -- the portfolio we like, we think that there is, we have high confidence there's opportunity for every business inside of Roper to do better. No company has reached its full potential relative to its organic growth. What we like about our approach to improve organic growth is it tends to be quite sticky and sustainable. The downside is it takes time, right? There's no -- it doesn't happen in a year and we cited it at our Investor Day and I'll cite it here again. I mean a great example for us in TEP is our Verathon business. Eight or nine years ago, it was a low single-digit growth business. Now it's a low teens, maybe higher growth business, we think sustainably for quite some time and it takes, just, unfortunately, it takes time to get the strategy right to enable the strategy to build the talent offense to seed in deeply a culture of continuous improvement. We're four or five years in across the portfolio for that and so we're definitely gaining some traction but we like our odds in terms of being able to improve the organic growth. Then in addition, as I mentioned, I think one of the -- definitely one of the -- the first question today is as we deploy our capital, we're definitely tilting towards slightly higher growth businesses like the Transact combined with CBORD high singles, Procare mid-teens. So there's going to be a little bit of mix-up over time in terms of the portfolio mix. Yeah. I mean the -- as Jason alluded, we've got $4 billion plus of M&A capacity as we sit today. Over the course of the next 12 months or so, we're very active in the M&A markets. It's a very attractive market. There's lots of sellers, one of the largest sponsors in the world, European sponsors on CNBC earlier this week and asked about what's the mantra, it's sell, sell, sell. So there's a lot of LP pressure, DPI matters a lot. And so there's essentially three or four years' worth of deals that are compressing here in the next year or two. And so it's a very attractive market. We plan to be active in that. Thank you. In terms of the competitive intensity on a per deal basis, if that's the question, it's hard to ultimately know. I mean, I would call out that we did the Transact deal on a proprietary basis. I would say that our M&A teams are engaged in -- engaging in more proprietary or quasi-proprietary opportunities and I can recall quite some time. And -- but -- and I think it's -- so we know those are facts. I think where I would speculate a little bit with so many opportunities that are going to be coming out of the pipeline, I think all buyers are going to be a little more discerning early in processes, which might lead to a little bit lower competitive intensity, but hard to know that to be an absolute case. I would say the -- I would just refer back to what we were talking about before with GovCon. It has been for six quarters slowish based on the uncertainty. About four to six quarters slow based on the uncertainty of the government spending, the operation of the government. We saw some green shoots here in the last quarter or two relative, especially in the enterprise class. Some of the larger customers are starting to be acquisitive again of Deltek. The exact underpinnings of the drivers, some of that might be infrastructure, but some of it might be other things. That's not in our specific purview. Yeah, Thank you."

            "name": "Jason Conley",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at Slide 6. Revenue was $1.76 billion and up 13% over prior year. Acquisitions contributed 9%, led by Procare and Transact Campus, and organic growth was 4%. Just unpacking organic growth a bit. In application software, revenue grew over 5% with recurring and reoccurring growth in the high single-digit area. Non-recurring revenue was down low-single digits, led by declines in new license sales. New business activity for enterprise software continues to lean towards SaaS, which ultimately creates higher customer lifetime value while yielding a slight drag on near-term non-recurring revenue. In network software, recurring revenue growth of 1% includes temporary headwinds at DAT, Link and Foundry. The balance of the segment saw growth in the mid-single-digit area. As Neil will discuss later, we see stabilization in freight markets and expect some improvement in Q4. TEP organic growth of 4% was underpinned by strength at Verathon and prior year comp challenges at NDI, Inovonics & rf IDEAS. As we discussed last quarter, NDI had a very significant customer program in 2023 that created year-to-date comparison challenges. However, we expect a return to growth in Q4. Separately and importantly, Neptune rapidly resolved its mechanical meter production challenges in the quarter. EBITDA of $717 million was 10% over prior year and EBITDA margin came in at 40.7%. On DEPS, we posted $4.62, which was above our guidance range of $4.50 to $4.54. Of note, the Transact acquisition contributed $0.03 in the stub period as the third quarter is seasonally the highest driven by fees from annual tuition payments and annual renewals of term licenses. Excluding Transact, our guidance beat came from strong core margin performance in our application software segment. Turning to free cash flow, we had our highest-ever quarter with free cash flow of $719 million, up 15% over prior year. Transact was cash accretive in the stub period of ownership and off to a fast start with Q3 being once again seasonally strong for this business. We also had a simply great execution across our software and tech product businesses. Of note, net working capital as a percent of revenue, excluding acquisitions was negative 19%, a new Q3 record. A special thanks to our world-class finance teams across the Roper family who are laser focused on cash returns and cash flow growth. Tremendous job. The bottom right chart provides a trailing 12-month view of free cash flow over a four-year period. The CAGR from the corresponding 2021 period is 12%. If we adjust for the Section 174 that went into effect in 2022, we've compounded cash flow in the mid-teens area. The strong Q3 results places our year-to-date cash flow at 31% as a percentage of revenue and with renewal season at many of our software businesses in Q4, we expect free-cash flow margin to be north of 30% for the year. Turning to Slide 7, I'll now discuss our balance sheet. So net debt of $8.1 billion on trailing EBITDA of $2.75 billion yields leverage of 3 times at the end of the quarter and a bit lower if we pro-forma for the recent acquisitions. In the quarter, we entered the bond market and issued $2 billion across five, seven and 10-year tenors for a blended rate of 4.8%. This was used to fund the Transact deal and partially pay down the revolver, which has a quarter-end balance of $925 million. As we move forward, our strong cash flow and use from investment-grade leverage provides us with $4 billion or more of capacity to deploy towards high-quality acquisitions. To that end, I'll turn it over to Neil to talk about the Transact deal and its compelling combination with our CBORD business. Neil? Yeah. So I mean, Q3 is now our strongest cash flow quarter. I mean, since we acquired Frontline a couple of years ago and now with the addition of Transact, it's definitely our strongest quarter. Transact has helped a little bit, maybe a couple of points of growth in the quarter. It's our, as I mentioned, seasonally strong for them. But aside from that, we just had tremendous execution through the renewal seasons, which is Q3 and Q4 for us. So Q4 is expected to be strong as well. And I would just say DSO improved almost across the board for a number of our businesses. And so just good old-fashioned execution, I think, is what drove that -- that drove that outsized growth relative to DEPS. Yeah. And just add to talk about Neptune a little bit. So if you recall, we stood up the ultrasonic or static line last quarter, the second-line. And so we had some constraints in our mechanical meter production. And so, happy to report the root causes were identified, corrective actions implemented. We had some yield issues on plastic molding that got printed. Some of the machines were creating some constraints as well. That's been remedied. Really like the trends we saw through September and those trends pretty much inform the production output for the fourth quarter and beyond. So we feel good about demand is really strong there. So it's really just getting through this mechanical meter production issue and we feel good based on what we saw in Q3 and the confidence the teams have in Q4. Yeah. Sorry, freight match is down sort of low singles for this year. I think we definitely think for NS in general that the Q3 is the low point for us. And then that will start to trend up as Neil said through the fourth quarter and then into next year and the pacing is just dependent on sort of the market momentum there. On Foundry, it's been down double-digits this year and that's been pretty consistent throughout the year. So we expected a little bit more of a recovery in the second half of this year. But as Neil said, it's taken a little bit longer. So yeah, as we think about the trends for next year, I think, the first quarter, just to remind you, we had -- we called out an MHA sort of sort of one-time item this year. So beyond that though, we expect steady growth into next year for the segment. Yeah. No, you're right. I mean, the second and third quarter we had -- if you recall last year, we had some big supply-chain liberation for our med product businesses and our product businesses. This year we're down a little bit. NDI is down, had a little bit of negative mix and we're obviously investing for growth there just because it's always been a consistent double-digit grower for us. So we're continuing to invest in NDI. But I think for the year, just thinking broadly, we're going to be flat EBITDA margin. And so it should inflect back up in the fourth quarter. Yeah, we are -- obviously, we continue to have enterprise bookings momentum that will matriculate into revenue. And next year, the timing of which depends on implementation timeframes and customer go-lives. But yeah, I mean, it's definitely a trend that we're watching carefully. Yeah, typically medical product, too, it's all about new products versus price just because you're sort of bound by some of the customer contracts with hospitals and the like. But yeah, I think Neil's point on software is it's been part of the rhythm for a long time. A lot of what we've done in strategic plan reviews is understand key purchasing criteria and really unpacking that at a more detailed level for each of our businesses and that's helped them. It's provided some confidence or just some insight into what the customer thinks about the value proposition and that's been helpful as well. That's right. I think on MHA, we can call that as a couple -- MHA in Q1 is a couple of points of drag in Q1. Yeah. Q4 used to be our strongest and now like I said, Q3 is our strongest. I think it will be -- we won't see quite the same increase in the fourth quarter as we did the third. Obviously, we got -- Transact came in. So that was helpful, but that's obviously, the strongest collections quarter as well. So that will -- it will be up, but not as much as Q3 in the fourth quarter."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nZack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We discussed the second quarter 2024 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon Callahan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and financial impacts associated with minority investments. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\nNeil Hunn: Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our second quarter results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 4, you can see the topics we'll cover today. I'll start by highlighting our second quarter performance, Jason will then go through our financial results in greater detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity and discuss our strong cash flow performance. Then I'll walk through our segment highlights and discuss our guidance for the full year. After our closing remarks, we'll open up the call for your questions. So, let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, three key takeaways for today's call are: first, we delivered another solid quarter results; second, we're increasing the bottom end of our full year outlook; and third, we continue to be very well positioned relative to executing on our capital deployment strategy. To double-click a bit. We grew total revenue by 12%, organic revenue by 4% and EBITDA by 13% with EBITDA margins expanding by 20 basis points to 40.5%. Importantly, we saw good bookings momentum with organic enterprise software bookings increasing in the high single digits area during the quarter. Finally, we grew free cash flow of 24% in the quarter and 35% on a TTM basis. Also, TTM free cash flow margins came in at 32%. We are also increasing our full year 2024 guidance on the low end and maintaining our outlook for total revenue and organic revenue reflecting our continued confidence in our outlook, notwithstanding some production efficiency challenges at Neptune, which we'll discuss in a bit. And we continue to be very active in the M&A market, an environment that continues to improve and one where we have a large pipeline of highly attractive opportunities. Net-net, we continue to be quite bullish about our ability to be active on the M&A front this year. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Jason to walk through our P&L and key balance sheet metrics. Jason?\nJason Conley: Thanks, Neil, and good morning to those joining the call. As always, thank you for your interest in Roper. If we look at Slide 6, I will provide an update on Q2, both against prior year and against a longer historical time frame. Revenue was $1.72 billion, which is 12% higher than prior year. Underpinning this was organic growth of 4% and an acquisition contribution of 8%, driven mostly by Procare and Syntellis. Organic recurring software revenue grew 6% and as we cycle through the tougher comps at freight match and foundry, which we've outlined in prior calls. We see signs of stabilization in both the freight and media and entertainment markets, which Neil will discuss further. Given our leadership positions and continued innovation investments at DAT, Loadlink and Foundry, we are confident that these businesses will capture growth upon market recovery. Also of note, organic growth in our tech segment was 5% with some production delays at Neptune. EBITDA was $695 million, which is 13% over prior year and yielded EBITDA margin of 40.5%, representing 20 basis points of expansion. Debt of $4.48 was above our guidance range of $4.42 to $4.46. Free cash flow was quite good at $367 million, up 24% over prior year and bringing year-to-date growth to 19%. Broadly over three years, our Q2 revenue has compounded 13% through a combination of organic growth and our consistent repeatable and disciplined M&A process. Q2 EBITDA CAGR over the same period has outpaced revenue at 14%. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow compounded at 10%. Adjusting for cash tax payments related to Section 174, which went into effect in 2022, the normalized CAGR is 12% over this three-year period. Just looking at our current trailing 12-month performance against the prior TTM period, free cash flow of $2.1 billion grew 35% with free cash flow margins of 32%. We expect this to normalize in the second half and for 2024, we continue to expect free cash flow margins of 30% or more. With that, we can turn to Slide 7 to go through our financial position. With our strong Q2 cash flow, we paid down the revolver by $300 million, which brings our drawn balance down to $1.45 billion on a $3.5 billion capacity facility. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now sits at 2.7x, which when coupled with future cash generation provides us with capacity to deploy $4 billion or more towards market-leading BMS businesses. On the capital deployment front, we have been quite busy over the second quarter and expect that to continue into the second half. Now, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk through our segment detail and updated guidance.\nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 9, let's review our Application Software segment results. Revenue here grew by 21% in total and organic revenue grew by 5%. EBITDA margins were 43.6%. We experienced strong performance across this portfolio of businesses with organic recurring and reoccurring revenue growing in the high single-digit area. So, let's start with Deltek. Our software business serving the government contracting, architecture, engineering and construction contractor markets. Deltek was solid in the quarter. We saw continued momentum across our private sector solutions and improved bookings activity and revenue within their GovCon business. Importantly, and as we started to highlight last quarter, Deltek's new GenAI-powered digital assistant Dela is in the process of integrated across Deltek's core suite of software applications. We're keen to see the customer workflow efficiency benefits take route as Dela is deployed throughout the Deltek tech stack, exciting for sure. Turning to Aderant. Our software business focused on the needs of large law firms continues to perform incredibly well in the market and had another great quarter with continued SaaS momentum and GenAI-focused innovation. The Aderant team is consistently delivering new GenAI-powered capabilities across our platform, enabling meaningful efficiencies in creating significant value for their customers in areas like billing, receivables management and time entry. Also, Vertafore & Frontline performed well in the quarter with strong net dollar retention and bookings growth. Also during the quarter, we completed our periodic strategic reviews with each of these businesses and left the reviews encouraged by the long-term opportunities in front of each. PowerPlan, our financial planning and tax software business serving heavy fixed industries was impressive yet again in the quarter and grew its ARR with strong net dollar retention and adoption of its new SaaS solution. Excited to see the progress the PowerPlan team is making. Our health care IT businesses led by Strata and data innovations were also strong in the quarter. As it relates to Strata, the combination with Syntellis continues to go very well with the vast majority of the cost synergies now in the rearview mirror. Great job by the team implementing this portion of the value creation plan. Since the completion of the transaction with Syntellis, the sales pipeline has continued to fill with substantial growth opportunities with several of these opportunities converting to bookings during the quarter. Further to this end, with the cost synergy faced behind the team, their full attention is now focused on long-term growth-related initiatives about which we are quite bullish and look forward to discussing in the quarters to come. As for data innovations, we saw accelerated growth in the quarter with customer decision-making returning to normal, encouraging for sure. Finally, Procare, the most recent addition to the Roper family companies is off to a strong start. For the second half of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth trending to the upper end of this range for this segment. Please turn is to Page 10. Organic revenue in our Network Software segment grew 2% in the quarter and was impacted by the fact we continue to experience pressure with our freight matching businesses and work through the impact on Foundry in the recent actors and rider strikes. Excluding our freight matching businesses and Foundry, the segment grew in the mid-singles area, which demonstrates the underlying quality of this group of market-leading businesses. EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 54.8%. Let's dig into the details and start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which declined slightly as expected due to the continuing challenging freight market conditions that adversely impact both businesses. That said, the market appears stable, both on the carrier and broker side, bouncing along the bottom, if you will. Notwithstanding this and is typical for Roper, we invest for long-term sustainable and improving levels of organic growth. In DAT's case, we're absolutely doing this, leading the industry with GenAI-enabled fraud detection and prevention tools. Also, and importantly, in the quarter, we welcomed a new DAT CEO to the team, Jeff Clementz. Jeff has a long and successful career in network and software businesses, and we look forward to working with him to deliver the next chapter of DAT's growth. Now let's turn to Foundry, our postproduction media and entertainment software business. Foundry continued to roll out innovative product updates and ML-powered functionality this quarter, enhancing the creative process for high-quality visual effects. Given the continued impact related to the recent industry strikes Foundry declined in the quarter as expected. That said, the current content production pipeline is filling and Foundry's customers are beginning to reramp their capacity, which gives us confidence Foundry return to more normalized growth next year. As mentioned, the balance of this segment grew mid-singles organically in the quarter with solid execution across this portfolio of businesses. By pipeline, our life insurance and annuities network software business, has strong renewals, customer expansions and market activity, especially in the annuities market. ConstructConnect continued its solid march of improved financial results and bookings momentum. In addition, ConstructConnect continues to lead the market with their GenAI power and take off and estimating solutions. Great job by Matt, Buck and the entire ConstructConnect team. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses performed well with MHA benefiting from increased operational focus and rigor and improvement in senior care occupancy rates. SoftWriters, our LTC pharmacy software business continued their cadence of solid execution, well done. For the second half of the year, we expect the difficult freight market conditions to persist which resulted in our continued low single-digit organic revenue growth outlook for this segment. Now please turn to Page 11, and let's review our TEP segment's results. Revenue here grew 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins remain strong at 36.2%. We'll start with Verathon. Verathon had very strong growth across all through its product families and once again executed at an exceptional level in the quarter. The long-term success of Verathon is directly attributable to its leadership team building the business and all the underlying processes to enable sustainable long-term and improved organic growth. This long-term disciplined focus is truly a competitive advantage for Verathon. Neptune continues to be solid and delivered another record quarter financial results. Demand remains strong and consistent with our expectations. Also, the Neptune team did a great job commissioning substantial ultrasonic meter capacity during the first half of this year, both of which are great relative to Neptune's long-term success. However, Neptune struggled in the quarter to achieve the manufacturing efficiency needed to deliver on the mechanical meter demand. We anticipate this to progressively be resolved through the balance of this year. Northern Digital, or NDI, declined as expected in the quarter. As a reminder, NDI is our market-leading precision measurement business. NDI partners with the world's leading medical device manufacturers to deliver innovative health care applications that require super precise navigation such as robotic surgery and cardiac procedures to name a couple. Their long-term historical growth rate has been in the double-digit area. However, NDI is declining this quarter and this year based on customer program timing. Notwithstanding the first half performance, NDI continues to see strong OEM order activity, and we fully expect NDI to return to their normalized organic growth rate next year. Finally, IPA Inovonics & rf IDEAS declined against a difficult prior year comp. As a reminder, these businesses started recovering from supply chain challenges this quarter a year ago. For the balance of the year, we expect the TEP segment to grow in the mid-single to high singles range, which is slightly below our prior expectation of high singles growth due to the mechanical meter production efficiency timing at Neptune. We do expect to return to high singles growth in the fourth quarter as Neptune's efficiency improvements take hold. Please turn with us to Page 13. Now let's review our full year 2024 guidance and discuss the third quarter outlook. Based on our first half performance, enterprise momentum and our confidence in our outlook, we're maintaining our 12% total revenue growth and 6% organic revenue growth outlook for the full year. In addition, we're raising at the bottom end of our full year guidance of touch to be in the range of $18.10 and $18.25. Our guidance continues to assumes full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted debt to be between $4.50 and $4.54. Now please turn us to Page 14, and then we'll open it up for your questions. We'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. First, we delivered a solid quarter of financial results, Second, we're increasing the low end of our outlook for the full year. And third, we are very well positioned relative to our capital deployment strategy. For the quarter, we delivered 12% total revenue and 4% organic revenue growth while increasing our EBITDA 13%. Importantly, free cash flow was strong, growing 24% in the quarter and 35% on a trailing 12-month basis. Free cash flow margins were 32% on a TTM basis as well. Next, we're maintaining our full year outlook for 12% total revenue and 6% organic revenue growth and increasing the bottom end of our full year guidance. We're confident in our outlook given the mission criticality of our solutions, the ongoing expansion of our recurring revenue base and seeing HSD growth in our enterprise software bookings. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with over $4 billion capacity for capital deployment. The M&A markets are very active. We have a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities that we're excited to pursue with our unbiased and disciplined approach. We remain quite bullish about our ability to execute this partner strategy over the balance of this year and into the future. Now as we turn to your questions and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once a company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment, so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long-term and sustained organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses in a deliberate and disciplined manner on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area. So, with that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor for your questions. Operator, please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now go to our Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. And we will now take the first question, and this comes from the line of the Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Maybe we can start with the production efficiency issues at Neptune. And if I understand this correctly, so mechanical meters, it's an established platform. So, I would not expect it to be like a start-up issue on this, but maybe just share with us what the problem is, what the remedy is and so forth?\nNeil Hunn: Sure, delighted to do that. I appreciate the question. So just to highlight what we talked about on the call. So first, the demand at Neptune is consistent with our expectations. So, there's no demand issue here on either the static or the mechanical side. Second, the team did just a remarkable job, standing out of the static ultrasonic capacity in the first half. That business is growing north of 20% a quarter year-on-year. So, there's capacity had to happen there. And we get to the mechanical, and I think the root cause here is just a simple, the fact that the team's attention was standing up the static and the ultrasound capacity, and we lost a little bit of production efficiency on the mechanical side. The countermeasures are in place. We just have to get back to prior levels of efficiency. We don't have to have a breakthrough level of efficiency here. And so, like I said, the countermeasures are in process. it's got the full attention of the team, and this should be resolved this year.\nDeane Dray: All right. That's good to hear. And then a second question, how about any issues with the CrowdStrike fiasco earlier this week? Any impact, any new vulnerabilities across your businesses? And anything you could share there would be helpful.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. Generally, a non-event for us. And based on the information we have at this stage, at this time, we don't anticipate the event will have any general impact on us.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink. Your line is now open.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. There was a fair amount of discussion over the past quarter from others in enterprise software, just around maybe deal delays customers contemplate AI and investments related to it certainly doesn't seem like that's happening at broker application software. So, I was hoping you could comment just on what the portfolio companies at Roper are hearing from customers on AI and are there either postponements or I might ask inversely, is Roper actually being brought in new ways by customers to assist with their AI strategies?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. I'll take a first pass of this and then Jason has anything to add. So first, it's been this -- certainly, we're aware of the situation from the other companies. And so, we're listening intently for this when we do our call downs of their businesses. And not once in any of our call downs or none of the first quarter, second quarter written summaries of business unit performance is this then the other as an issue in terms of our customers' IT spending diverting away from what we did is the first point. We've started to think about why that is. I think part of the reason is we're a teeny tied portion of the IT spend of our customers, and we're mission critical in what we do. So, I think it's a combination of the two. And our customers are very much looking to us to GenAI enable our product offerings. And we're very much doing that. We've talked about it in the prepared remarks for the last several quarters. I think there's three or four references in it in today's call. And so, we're super bullish about the opportunity. We noted enterprise software bookings up high single digits in the quarter, so some momentum there.\nJason Conley: Yes, that's right. Joe, we talked about this a month or two ago. It's pretty consistent there. And I think, like Neil said, our enterprise bookings were strong across a number of businesses. Even Deltek was still down a little bit, so it was pretty widespread. So, no. Like Neil said nothing on our calls indicated that this is an issue whatsoever, at least at this point.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That's great to hear. Yes. And I wanted to follow up on the high single-digit growth in enterprise bookings because that does seem like a positive change in trend. So Deltek contributed, it sounds like any other big needle movers to call out just in terms of the bookings developments?\nJason Conley: And actually, Joe, Deltek was still down a little bit. So that's what Deltek. But Neil highlighted some strength at Strata. So, we saw, like I said, pipeline has been building and saw some good bookings at the latter part of Q2. Aderant has continued to be strong. Vertafore, Frontline, also really good quarters as well.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Yes. I just wondered if you could give us some color around the Q3 EPS guide. Normally, you have a stronger sequential uplift maybe 27 plus in the last couple of years -- into the $0.10 or $0.15 into the third quarter. Is there much sort of happening there this year that's kind of weighing on that? Any kind of one-timers maybe on that point on Neptune that's weighing on the sequential growth?\nJason Conley: Yes. Thanks, Julian. I think a little bit is Neptune. So just getting that -- those operational efficiencies will push some of that revenue that we normally have in the third quarter into the fourth. And then if you just look prior year, I think we think AS margins are going to be down year-over-year in Q3. If you recall last year, it was kind of the high watermark, Q3 was, of 2023. So, we actually expect it to be stronger AS margins in Q4. So, we'll have a strong Q4 there. So, it's just a little bit of a shift on margin, I think in the AS segment, which is obviously more than half of our revenue.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then just my follow-up question would really be around the network software piece and going back to the freight market. It sounds like it's trending kind of as you thought. Maybe update us where we sit in terms of the timing of that cycle trough and what sort of slope of recovery you think we should expect there in the next kind of 12, 18 months, please?\nNeil Hunn: I'll give you our best crack at what's going on there. So, as we all know, in recent past periods, DAT just really experienced abnormal growth that was consistent with the freight cycle. And then -- and then -- and sort of the freight recession is what's been impacting the business over the last several quarters. This quarter was flattish in terms of the volumes that we're seeing. And then maybe there's a little bit of green shoots happening. The spot market volumes are stable to slightly improving. Carrier attrition and the network has slowed a little bit more than originally expected or anticipated. And finally, maybe most importantly, freight rejection rates in the market are improving. And so, we're sort of balancing, as I mentioned, we're bouncing along the bottom. That's our call for the balance of the year, and we're not going to bake in an improvement in our outlook until we actually see it, but maybe there's some green shoots happening here.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from True Securities. Please go ahead.\nTerry Tillman: The first question, it's kind of a multiparter. It's related to the Deltek business. And then I did have a follow-up. It's going to be on Aderant. But in terms of Deltek on that large GovCon side, I assume that's for some of that volatility and some of the bookings weakness is still going on. Is there some seasonality dynamics and just kind of strengthening of the pipeline and visibility into the second half where you think that can turn positive in terms of bookings? And the second part of this first question is on FedRAMP. If I wasn't mistaken, FedRAMP could potentially unlock some large deals? And then I had a follow-up.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So, we'll try to take both of those. So Deltek is not really a seasonal business. Just so we're clear. Deltek got two parts of the business, about 60% GovCon, about 40% is the professional services end markets, architects, engineers, construction contractors. The professional services side, it's been solid, robust, consistent. The slowness has been on the GovCon side, particularly the enterprise, the very largest customers as just the last 12 months or maybe a little bit longer, if government spending uncertainty is what's driven sort of the slowdown or sluggishness in the market. In the second quarter, Deltek on the GovCon side, there was a little bit of enterprise activity, bookings activity, which was super encouraging to see it's been two quarters since we've seen that. And so -- and there also isn't really an election impact that's tied to this part of the business. At least historically, there's not been. So, it's just having some stability in the government spending outlook. It also doesn't really matter what the government spending is on. It just is the government operation of spending has been uncertain. I mean you're right on FedRAMP, the Company is, I think, FedRAMP have moderate complied today, and it's a definitive unlock for the SaaS migration on the GovCon side of the business, which is just in the very, very beginning, like the bottom of the first inning.\nTerry Tillman: And I guess just a follow-up question. I've been struck by just from our own primary research, just the Aderant customer base and optimism about moving to cloud. Where are we in that upgrade cycle and moving to cloud. And is it unlocking kind of expansion sales opportunities?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. Aderant, it's just so good at the moment for multiple factors, the one you list around the SaaS migration is just one. I mean the Company has just done a -- we got a lot of market momentum. They're leading the market on the use of generative AI tools and software applications. Their net market share winners that continue to gain net market share and just to give everybody listening context, the last five to seven years has been a market share gain, right? So, we've gone from to north of 50% market share over that period of time for large law firms, and most of that share gain was on-premise. And with the advent of COVID, the large law firms decided they wanted to start the migration to the cloud. So, we've got a multiyear journey of the lift and shift from our on-premise customers to the cloud. The product is enabled and we're just beginning that migration now. Maybe this is in the second or third inning and barrier.\nJason Conley: There's a few dozen conversions that's happened over the last three or four years. So, we're still really early. It's obviously picked up in the last, call it, six quarters. But yes, still plenty of running there.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Is it fair to say, it's getting a little harder to get price year-over-year? I'm kind of thinking specifically network software, but I guess, application software as well. But I know you had some pretty big price increases the last couple of years. Has it gotten a little harder to get price in those markets?\nNeil Hunn: Scott, we would actually say we've not gotten outsized price in our software businesses over the last couple of years. Price is part of the growth algorithm that we talked about. As a general matter, right, is going to offset the attrit on the ARR base, and then we're going to cross-sell and upsell and add new to sort of get to the total growth of the business. There's been just maybe a little bit look a teeny tiny amount of price that's above normal on both the network and application software side. So, it wasn't a big benefit historically. We don't have to lap that going forward to the extent pricing were to normalize because in our case, we've been normal through the period.\nScott Davis: Okay. All right. That's good color. And then last quarter, my takeaway was your enthusiasm on kind of M&A markets unlocking was pretty high. Is that -- is it fair to say you're still in the same level of enthusiasm about being able to get high-quality deals done this year?\nNeil Hunn: Very much so. The market is -- the commentary we talked about a quarter ago was the exact same commentary today. There's just an amazing amount of pent-up demand for opportunities. I think I said last time, it's going to be 3 to 3.5 years deals compressed in a couple of years. We still believe that's the case. Interesting thing happened in the first half is that the first half deals in the market were super binary based on asset quality. A plus assets traded anything in the PP or below did not which is leading sponsors to really face the reality about value and valuations. And so, the combination of that, the pent-up demand, interest rates being higher should yield more reasonable valuations. We'll see, but we're super encouraged by both that dynamic around valuation and then just the volume of opportunities that we see. Final thing I'd say is that Janet and her team are much more proactive and proprietary in our pursuits, and that's being well received by the sponsors we're engaging with.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Giordano -- I mean Joe Giordano from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Can you remind me of at Neptune, the mix between ultrasonic and mechanical? And like where that is today, where you see that going? And like is there any material margin difference between the two products today.\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So, on the mix, we've been advised by Neptune for competitive reasons to sort of stay away from the specifics of the mix. Today, the market is declaratively going to static. There's a lot of benefit to static, and we believe we have a most product advantage with our static meter around being able to be accurately both high and low flow rates. Relative to the margin profile today, they're similar-ish in terms of margin profile.\nJoe Giordano: Okay. And then -- if I just think about maybe more ConstructConnect, but maybe a little bit on Deltek too, but it seems like construction starts and like activity is still at a good level, but like the starts are getting worse and like we're kind of -- it seems like even on the institutional side, things getting a little bit weaker, but from good levels. Like what are the implications there? And are you seeing any of that of those businesses?\nNeil Hunn: Yes. So, on the Deltek side, the construction vertical, Deltek remains strong. The pipeline activity is strong. Their bookings activity is strong. Now mind you, our customer base is very much on the S&M side. They're not the enterprise. They're not the largest customers, the Deltek services. So maybe -- I mean there's a gigantic un-bended market. So even in the headwinds of maybe a little bit of slowdown when these smaller contracts are looking for efficiency, they would look to using our software to do that, which might help with some of the pressure. At ConstructConnect, this business has just been -- it's just good old-fashioned execution that has led to better outcomes there. They're going to really get choice on their strategy and making choices to focus on the trade contractors and building product manufacturers. They've done a great job enabling that strategy around the product and R&D and go-to-market sort of changes, the lead generation changes, the way they hear their demos I think we've been four quarters of double-digit bookings at ConstructConnect. And so, it's just been good old-fashioned execution there that's led to quite improved outcome here.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: On the Neptune side, what's the kind of backlog status there? And what's your book-to-bill on that front? Just some color on the orders because accelerating into 4Q when your growth was 15% seems to imply quite a catch-up even beyond maybe just fulfilling some of these other orders? And then secondarily, you mentioned high single-digit growth in software, I believe it was bookings. Is that organic or reported? And if that's total software, shouldn't that translate to revenues more near term in the second half. It doesn't look like you're accelerating there in the second half.\nJason Conley: So, on Neptune bookings, I mean we talked about the backlog coming into the year was still extremely strong, right? And so, we had three or four quarters, almost four quarters of backlog going into the year. And so, that's what we've been working through this year. And then orders have been -- continue to be strong, continue to be enough to -- I guess, to answer your question around the fourth quarter for sure in our guide and then setting up for next year. And then on enterprise bookings, the way we define that is it's all of the software business outside of DAT, Loadlink and ConstructConnect because those are more SMB-type businesses and those are annual contract value revenue. So, it's the time of booking and then you've got a -- depending on the Company, the delay between when the booking happens and when it converts to revenue, that can vary, depending on the nature of the award. And so, it doesn't always translate into revenue in the current year, but it certainly does help support where we think AS is going to be in the second half and then into '25.\nNeil Hunn: That's right. And just the only thing I'd add to Jason\u2019s thought, on the software bookings is the majority, if not the vast majority of bookings are subscription or SaaS related. So, you've got the number of months left in the year, it's just hard to impact bookings in the second half or even second quarter six months left to go. So, it really is about the launch of point in AR for '25.\nJason Conley: And yes, just to clarify, it is organic.\nNeil Hunn: That's right.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Alexander Blanton, Individual Investor. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Blanton: It's really Clear Harbor Asset Management, not an individual investor. I want to go back to the Neptune production issue. I really wasn't clear on the answer that you gave before. So perhaps you can make some clarifying comments. What's the nature of the production holdup or problem? And I think you said that you expected it to be resolved by the end of the third quarter so that you would do some catch-up in the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate on that?\nNeil Hunn: I'll do my best. So, as you know, Neptune makes the sense that the highest level makes two forms of meters, a static meter and mechanical meter. The static meter, we've had to add production capacity, which was successfully commissioned in the first half. So that's great news to the existing factory that we have in Alabama. The mechanical meter side, we have the capacity that's needed, but there was essentially a daily efficiency production rate that was below where it needed to be to meet the demand and deliver on the customer commitments. That's what's in the process of being countermeasure. Again, I mentioned before, this is just returning to levels of previous efficiency, not a breakthrough level of efficiency that would not get ever achieved. And so, the teams are fully contrasting this at the moment, and we expect it's beginning to resolve itself in the third quarter, and we hope and expect to resolve itself for the balance of the year.\nAlexander Blanton: My question really was what caused it to deviate from prior levels?\nNeil Hunn: We think it's -- we think the root cause of that is you've got a factory management team that was super focused on adding the static capacity in the first half and just got distracted or lost focus on the daily efficiency or production efficiency on the mechanical side.\nAlexander Blanton: Well, right. But what is the nature of the production efficiency problem. That's what I'm getting at.\nNeil Hunn: Alex. We're delighted to take this off-line if you want to talk about more detail.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the call over back to Zack Moxcey. Please go ahead, sir.\nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.\nOperator: Thank you.

As we turn to Page 4, you can see the topics we'll cover today. I'll start by highlighting our second quarter performance, Jason will then go through our financial results in greater detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity and discuss our strong cash flow performance. Then I'll walk through our segment highlights and discuss our guidance for the full year. After our closing remarks, we'll open up the call for your questions. So, let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, three key takeaways for today's call are: first, we delivered another solid quarter results; second, we're increasing the bottom end of our full year outlook; and third, we continue to be very well positioned relative to executing on our capital deployment strategy. To double-click a bit. We grew total revenue by 12%, organic revenue by 4% and EBITDA by 13% with EBITDA margins expanding by 20 basis points to 40.5%. Importantly, we saw good bookings momentum with organic enterprise software bookings increasing in the high single digits area during the quarter. Finally, we grew free cash flow of 24% in the quarter and 35% on a TTM basis. Also, TTM free cash flow margins came in at 32%. We are also increasing our full year 2024 guidance on the low end and maintaining our outlook for total revenue and organic revenue reflecting our continued confidence in our outlook, notwithstanding some production efficiency challenges at Neptune, which we'll discuss in a bit. And we continue to be very active in the M&A market, an environment that continues to improve and one where we have a large pipeline of highly attractive opportunities. Net-net, we continue to be quite bullish about our ability to be active on the M&A front this year. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Jason to walk through our P&L and key balance sheet metrics. Jason? Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 9, let's review our Application Software segment results. Revenue here grew by 21% in total and organic revenue grew by 5%. EBITDA margins were 43.6%. We experienced strong performance across this portfolio of businesses with organic recurring and reoccurring revenue growing in the high single-digit area. So, let's start with Deltek. Our software business serving the government contracting, architecture, engineering and construction contractor markets. Deltek was solid in the quarter. We saw continued momentum across our private sector solutions and improved bookings activity and revenue within their GovCon business. Importantly, and as we started to highlight last quarter, Deltek's new GenAI-powered digital assistant Dela is in the process of integrated across Deltek's core suite of software applications. We're keen to see the customer workflow efficiency benefits take route as Dela is deployed throughout the Deltek tech stack, exciting for sure. Turning to Aderant. Our software business focused on the needs of large law firms continues to perform incredibly well in the market and had another great quarter with continued SaaS momentum and GenAI-focused innovation. The Aderant team is consistently delivering new GenAI-powered capabilities across our platform, enabling meaningful efficiencies in creating significant value for their customers in areas like billing, receivables management and time entry. Also, Vertafore & Frontline performed well in the quarter with strong net dollar retention and bookings growth. Also during the quarter, we completed our periodic strategic reviews with each of these businesses and left the reviews encouraged by the long-term opportunities in front of each. PowerPlan, our financial planning and tax software business serving heavy fixed industries was impressive yet again in the quarter and grew its ARR with strong net dollar retention and adoption of its new SaaS solution. Excited to see the progress the PowerPlan team is making. Our health care IT businesses led by Strata and data innovations were also strong in the quarter. As it relates to Strata, the combination with Syntellis continues to go very well with the vast majority of the cost synergies now in the rearview mirror. Great job by the team implementing this portion of the value creation plan. Since the completion of the transaction with Syntellis, the sales pipeline has continued to fill with substantial growth opportunities with several of these opportunities converting to bookings during the quarter. Further to this end, with the cost synergy faced behind the team, their full attention is now focused on long-term growth-related initiatives about which we are quite bullish and look forward to discussing in the quarters to come. As for data innovations, we saw accelerated growth in the quarter with customer decision-making returning to normal, encouraging for sure. Finally, Procare, the most recent addition to the Roper family companies is off to a strong start. For the second half of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth trending to the upper end of this range for this segment. Please turn is to Page 10. Organic revenue in our Network Software segment grew 2% in the quarter and was impacted by the fact we continue to experience pressure with our freight matching businesses and work through the impact on Foundry in the recent actors and rider strikes. Excluding our freight matching businesses and Foundry, the segment grew in the mid-singles area, which demonstrates the underlying quality of this group of market-leading businesses. EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 54.8%. Let's dig into the details and start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which declined slightly as expected due to the continuing challenging freight market conditions that adversely impact both businesses. That said, the market appears stable, both on the carrier and broker side, bouncing along the bottom, if you will. Notwithstanding this and is typical for Roper, we invest for long-term sustainable and improving levels of organic growth. In DAT's case, we're absolutely doing this, leading the industry with GenAI-enabled fraud detection and prevention tools. Also, and importantly, in the quarter, we welcomed a new DAT CEO to the team, Jeff Clementz. Jeff has a long and successful career in network and software businesses, and we look forward to working with him to deliver the next chapter of DAT's growth. Now let's turn to Foundry, our postproduction media and entertainment software business. Foundry continued to roll out innovative product updates and ML-powered functionality this quarter, enhancing the creative process for high-quality visual effects. Given the continued impact related to the recent industry strikes Foundry declined in the quarter as expected. That said, the current content production pipeline is filling and Foundry's customers are beginning to reramp their capacity, which gives us confidence Foundry return to more normalized growth next year. As mentioned, the balance of this segment grew mid-singles organically in the quarter with solid execution across this portfolio of businesses. By pipeline, our life insurance and annuities network software business, has strong renewals, customer expansions and market activity, especially in the annuities market. ConstructConnect continued its solid march of improved financial results and bookings momentum. In addition, ConstructConnect continues to lead the market with their GenAI power and take off and estimating solutions. Great job by Matt, Buck and the entire ConstructConnect team. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses performed well with MHA benefiting from increased operational focus and rigor and improvement in senior care occupancy rates. SoftWriters, our LTC pharmacy software business continued their cadence of solid execution, well done. For the second half of the year, we expect the difficult freight market conditions to persist which resulted in our continued low single-digit organic revenue growth outlook for this segment. Now please turn to Page 11, and let's review our TEP segment's results. Revenue here grew 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins remain strong at 36.2%. We'll start with Verathon. Verathon had very strong growth across all through its product families and once again executed at an exceptional level in the quarter. The long-term success of Verathon is directly attributable to its leadership team building the business and all the underlying processes to enable sustainable long-term and improved organic growth. This long-term disciplined focus is truly a competitive advantage for Verathon. Neptune continues to be solid and delivered another record quarter financial results. Demand remains strong and consistent with our expectations. Also, the Neptune team did a great job commissioning substantial ultrasonic meter capacity during the first half of this year, both of which are great relative to Neptune's long-term success. However, Neptune struggled in the quarter to achieve the manufacturing efficiency needed to deliver on the mechanical meter demand. We anticipate this to progressively be resolved through the balance of this year. Northern Digital, or NDI, declined as expected in the quarter. As a reminder, NDI is our market-leading precision measurement business. NDI partners with the world's leading medical device manufacturers to deliver innovative health care applications that require super precise navigation such as robotic surgery and cardiac procedures to name a couple. Their long-term historical growth rate has been in the double-digit area. However, NDI is declining this quarter and this year based on customer program timing. Notwithstanding the first half performance, NDI continues to see strong OEM order activity, and we fully expect NDI to return to their normalized organic growth rate next year. Finally, IPA Inovonics & rf IDEAS declined against a difficult prior year comp. As a reminder, these businesses started recovering from supply chain challenges this quarter a year ago. For the balance of the year, we expect the TEP segment to grow in the mid-single to high singles range, which is slightly below our prior expectation of high singles growth due to the mechanical meter production efficiency timing at Neptune. We do expect to return to high singles growth in the fourth quarter as Neptune's efficiency improvements take hold. Please turn with us to Page 13. Now let's review our full year 2024 guidance and discuss the third quarter outlook. Based on our first half performance, enterprise momentum and our confidence in our outlook, we're maintaining our 12% total revenue growth and 6% organic revenue growth outlook for the full year. In addition, we're raising at the bottom end of our full year guidance of touch to be in the range of $18.10 and $18.25. Our guidance continues to assumes full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted debt to be between $4.50 and $4.54. Now please turn us to Page 14, and then we'll open it up for your questions. We'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. First, we delivered a solid quarter of financial results, Second, we're increasing the low end of our outlook for the full year. And third, we are very well positioned relative to our capital deployment strategy. For the quarter, we delivered 12% total revenue and 4% organic revenue growth while increasing our EBITDA 13%. Importantly, free cash flow was strong, growing 24% in the quarter and 35% on a trailing 12-month basis. Free cash flow margins were 32% on a TTM basis as well. Next, we're maintaining our full year outlook for 12% total revenue and 6% organic revenue growth and increasing the bottom end of our full year guidance. We're confident in our outlook given the mission criticality of our solutions, the ongoing expansion of our recurring revenue base and seeing HSD growth in our enterprise software bookings. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with over $4 billion capacity for capital deployment. The M&A markets are very active. We have a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities that we're excited to pursue with our unbiased and disciplined approach. We remain quite bullish about our ability to execute this partner strategy over the balance of this year and into the future. Now as we turn to your questions and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once a company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment, so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long-term and sustained organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses in a deliberate and disciplined manner on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area. So, with that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor for your questions. Operator, please go ahead. Sure, delighted to do that. I appreciate the question. So just to highlight what we talked about on the call. So first, the demand at Neptune is consistent with our expectations. So, there's no demand issue here on either the static or the mechanical side. Second, the team did just a remarkable job, standing out of the static ultrasonic capacity in the first half. That business is growing north of 20% a quarter year-on-year. So, there's capacity had to happen there. And we get to the mechanical, and I think the root cause here is just a simple, the fact that the team's attention was standing up the static and the ultrasound capacity, and we lost a little bit of production efficiency on the mechanical side. The countermeasures are in place. We just have to get back to prior levels of efficiency. We don't have to have a breakthrough level of efficiency here. And so, like I said, the countermeasures are in process. it's got the full attention of the team, and this should be resolved this year. Yes. Generally, a non-event for us. And based on the information we have at this stage, at this time, we don't anticipate the event will have any general impact on us. Yes. I'll take a first pass of this and then Jason has anything to add. So first, it's been this -- certainly, we're aware of the situation from the other companies. And so, we're listening intently for this when we do our call downs of their businesses. And not once in any of our call downs or none of the first quarter, second quarter written summaries of business unit performance is this then the other as an issue in terms of our customers' IT spending diverting away from what we did is the first point. We've started to think about why that is. I think part of the reason is we're a teeny tied portion of the IT spend of our customers, and we're mission critical in what we do. So, I think it's a combination of the two. And our customers are very much looking to us to GenAI enable our product offerings. And we're very much doing that. We've talked about it in the prepared remarks for the last several quarters. I think there's three or four references in it in today's call. And so, we're super bullish about the opportunity. We noted enterprise software bookings up high single digits in the quarter, so some momentum there. I'll give you our best crack at what's going on there. So, as we all know, in recent past periods, DAT just really experienced abnormal growth that was consistent with the freight cycle. And then -- and then -- and sort of the freight recession is what's been impacting the business over the last several quarters. This quarter was flattish in terms of the volumes that we're seeing. And then maybe there's a little bit of green shoots happening. The spot market volumes are stable to slightly improving. Carrier attrition and the network has slowed a little bit more than originally expected or anticipated. And finally, maybe most importantly, freight rejection rates in the market are improving. And so, we're sort of balancing, as I mentioned, we're bouncing along the bottom. That's our call for the balance of the year, and we're not going to bake in an improvement in our outlook until we actually see it, but maybe there's some green shoots happening here. Yes. So, we'll try to take both of those. So Deltek is not really a seasonal business. Just so we're clear. Deltek got two parts of the business, about 60% GovCon, about 40% is the professional services end markets, architects, engineers, construction contractors. The professional services side, it's been solid, robust, consistent. The slowness has been on the GovCon side, particularly the enterprise, the very largest customers as just the last 12 months or maybe a little bit longer, if government spending uncertainty is what's driven sort of the slowdown or sluggishness in the market. In the second quarter, Deltek on the GovCon side, there was a little bit of enterprise activity, bookings activity, which was super encouraging to see it's been two quarters since we've seen that. And so -- and there also isn't really an election impact that's tied to this part of the business. At least historically, there's not been. So, it's just having some stability in the government spending outlook. It also doesn't really matter what the government spending is on. It just is the government operation of spending has been uncertain. I mean you're right on FedRAMP, the Company is, I think, FedRAMP have moderate complied today, and it's a definitive unlock for the SaaS migration on the GovCon side of the business, which is just in the very, very beginning, like the bottom of the first inning. Yes. Aderant, it's just so good at the moment for multiple factors, the one you list around the SaaS migration is just one. I mean the Company has just done a -- we got a lot of market momentum. They're leading the market on the use of generative AI tools and software applications. Their net market share winners that continue to gain net market share and just to give everybody listening context, the last five to seven years has been a market share gain, right? So, we've gone from to north of 50% market share over that period of time for large law firms, and most of that share gain was on-premise. And with the advent of COVID, the large law firms decided they wanted to start the migration to the cloud. So, we've got a multiyear journey of the lift and shift from our on-premise customers to the cloud. The product is enabled and we're just beginning that migration now. Maybe this is in the second or third inning and barrier. Scott, we would actually say we've not gotten outsized price in our software businesses over the last couple of years. Price is part of the growth algorithm that we talked about. As a general matter, right, is going to offset the attrit on the ARR base, and then we're going to cross-sell and upsell and add new to sort of get to the total growth of the business. There's been just maybe a little bit look a teeny tiny amount of price that's above normal on both the network and application software side. So, it wasn't a big benefit historically. We don't have to lap that going forward to the extent pricing were to normalize because in our case, we've been normal through the period. Very much so. The market is -- the commentary we talked about a quarter ago was the exact same commentary today. There's just an amazing amount of pent-up demand for opportunities. I think I said last time, it's going to be 3 to 3.5 years deals compressed in a couple of years. We still believe that's the case. Interesting thing happened in the first half is that the first half deals in the market were super binary based on asset quality. A plus assets traded anything in the PP or below did not which is leading sponsors to really face the reality about value and valuations. And so, the combination of that, the pent-up demand, interest rates being higher should yield more reasonable valuations. We'll see, but we're super encouraged by both that dynamic around valuation and then just the volume of opportunities that we see. Final thing I'd say is that Janet and her team are much more proactive and proprietary in our pursuits, and that's being well received by the sponsors we're engaging with. Yes. So, on the mix, we've been advised by Neptune for competitive reasons to sort of stay away from the specifics of the mix. Today, the market is declaratively going to static. There's a lot of benefit to static, and we believe we have a most product advantage with our static meter around being able to be accurately both high and low flow rates. Relative to the margin profile today, they're similar-ish in terms of margin profile. Yes. So, on the Deltek side, the construction vertical, Deltek remains strong. The pipeline activity is strong. Their bookings activity is strong. Now mind you, our customer base is very much on the S&M side. They're not the enterprise. They're not the largest customers, the Deltek services. So maybe -- I mean there's a gigantic un-bended market. So even in the headwinds of maybe a little bit of slowdown when these smaller contracts are looking for efficiency, they would look to using our software to do that, which might help with some of the pressure. At ConstructConnect, this business has just been -- it's just good old-fashioned execution that has led to better outcomes there. They're going to really get choice on their strategy and making choices to focus on the trade contractors and building product manufacturers. They've done a great job enabling that strategy around the product and R&D and go-to-market sort of changes, the lead generation changes, the way they hear their demos I think we've been four quarters of double-digit bookings at ConstructConnect. And so, it's just been good old-fashioned execution there that's led to quite improved outcome here. That's right. And just the only thing I'd add to Jason's thought, on the software bookings is the majority, if not the vast majority of bookings are subscription or SaaS related. So, you've got the number of months left in the year, it's just hard to impact bookings in the second half or even second quarter six months left to go. So, it really is about the launch of point in AR for '25. That's right. I'll do my best. So, as you know, Neptune makes the sense that the highest level makes two forms of meters, a static meter and mechanical meter. The static meter, we've had to add production capacity, which was successfully commissioned in the first half. So that's great news to the existing factory that we have in Alabama. The mechanical meter side, we have the capacity that's needed, but there was essentially a daily efficiency production rate that was below where it needed to be to meet the demand and deliver on the customer commitments. That's what's in the process of being countermeasure. Again, I mentioned before, this is just returning to levels of previous efficiency, not a breakthrough level of efficiency that would not get ever achieved. And so, the teams are fully contrasting this at the moment, and we expect it's beginning to resolve itself in the third quarter, and we hope and expect to resolve itself for the balance of the year. We think it's -- we think the root cause of that is you've got a factory management team that was super focused on adding the static capacity in the first half and just got distracted or lost focus on the daily efficiency or production efficiency on the mechanical side. Alex. We're delighted to take this off-line if you want to talk about more detail."

            "name": "Jason Conley",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil, and good morning to those joining the call. As always, thank you for your interest in Roper. If we look at Slide 6, I will provide an update on Q2, both against prior year and against a longer historical time frame. Revenue was $1.72 billion, which is 12% higher than prior year. Underpinning this was organic growth of 4% and an acquisition contribution of 8%, driven mostly by Procare and Syntellis. Organic recurring software revenue grew 6% and as we cycle through the tougher comps at freight match and foundry, which we've outlined in prior calls. We see signs of stabilization in both the freight and media and entertainment markets, which Neil will discuss further. Given our leadership positions and continued innovation investments at DAT, Loadlink and Foundry, we are confident that these businesses will capture growth upon market recovery. Also of note, organic growth in our tech segment was 5% with some production delays at Neptune. EBITDA was $695 million, which is 13% over prior year and yielded EBITDA margin of 40.5%, representing 20 basis points of expansion. Debt of $4.48 was above our guidance range of $4.42 to $4.46. Free cash flow was quite good at $367 million, up 24% over prior year and bringing year-to-date growth to 19%. Broadly over three years, our Q2 revenue has compounded 13% through a combination of organic growth and our consistent repeatable and disciplined M&A process. Q2 EBITDA CAGR over the same period has outpaced revenue at 14%. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow compounded at 10%. Adjusting for cash tax payments related to Section 174, which went into effect in 2022, the normalized CAGR is 12% over this three-year period. Just looking at our current trailing 12-month performance against the prior TTM period, free cash flow of $2.1 billion grew 35% with free cash flow margins of 32%. We expect this to normalize in the second half and for 2024, we continue to expect free cash flow margins of 30% or more. With that, we can turn to Slide 7 to go through our financial position. With our strong Q2 cash flow, we paid down the revolver by $300 million, which brings our drawn balance down to $1.45 billion on a $3.5 billion capacity facility. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now sits at 2.7x, which when coupled with future cash generation provides us with capacity to deploy $4 billion or more towards market-leading BMS businesses. On the capital deployment front, we have been quite busy over the second quarter and expect that to continue into the second half. Now, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk through our segment detail and updated guidance. Yes, that's right. Joe, we talked about this a month or two ago. It's pretty consistent there. And I think, like Neil said, our enterprise bookings were strong across a number of businesses. Even Deltek was still down a little bit, so it was pretty widespread. So, no. Like Neil said nothing on our calls indicated that this is an issue whatsoever, at least at this point. And actually, Joe, Deltek was still down a little bit. So that's what Deltek. But Neil highlighted some strength at Strata. So, we saw, like I said, pipeline has been building and saw some good bookings at the latter part of Q2. Aderant has continued to be strong. Vertafore, Frontline, also really good quarters as well. Yes. Thanks, Julian. I think a little bit is Neptune. So just getting that -- those operational efficiencies will push some of that revenue that we normally have in the third quarter into the fourth. And then if you just look prior year, I think we think AS margins are going to be down year-over-year in Q3. If you recall last year, it was kind of the high watermark, Q3 was, of 2023. So, we actually expect it to be stronger AS margins in Q4. So, we'll have a strong Q4 there. So, it's just a little bit of a shift on margin, I think in the AS segment, which is obviously more than half of our revenue. There's a few dozen conversions that's happened over the last three or four years. So, we're still really early. It's obviously picked up in the last, call it, six quarters. But yes, still plenty of running there. So, on Neptune bookings, I mean we talked about the backlog coming into the year was still extremely strong, right? And so, we had three or four quarters, almost four quarters of backlog going into the year. And so, that's what we've been working through this year. And then orders have been -- continue to be strong, continue to be enough to -- I guess, to answer your question around the fourth quarter for sure in our guide and then setting up for next year. And then on enterprise bookings, the way we define that is it's all of the software business outside of DAT, Loadlink and ConstructConnect because those are more SMB-type businesses and those are annual contract value revenue. So, it's the time of booking and then you've got a -- depending on the Company, the delay between when the booking happens and when it converts to revenue, that can vary, depending on the nature of the award. And so, it doesn't always translate into revenue in the current year, but it certainly does help support where we think AS is going to be in the second half and then into '25. And yes, just to clarify, it is organic."

[Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nZack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining as we discuss the first quarter 2024 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.  \n Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.\n Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. \n And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; financial impacts associated with minority investments; and lastly, transaction-related expenses associated with the completed acquisitions. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. \n And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil? \nNeil Hunn: Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our first quarter results and our increased outlook for the year.\n As we turn to Page 4, you can see the topics we'll cover today. I'll start by highlighting our strong performance in Q1. Jason will then go through our financial results in more detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity; and finally, our notable cash flow performance. Then I'll walk through our segment highlights and discuss our increased guidance for the full year and initiate our Q2 guidance. After our closing remarks, we'll open the floor for your questions. \n So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, 3 key takeaways for today's call. First, we delivered another strong quarter results. Second, we're increasing our full year outlook. And third, we continue to be very well positioned relative to capital deployment. We double-click a bit. We grew total revenue by 14%, organic revenue by 8% and EBITDA by 16%, with EBITDA margin expanding by 60 basis points to 40.2%. \n We grew DEPS by 13% to $4.41 beating our guidance range. We grew free cash flow 15% year-over-year with free cash flow margins of 31%. We also completed the acquisition of Procare Solutions, a leading provider of software and integrated payments for the early childhood education market for $1.75 billion. Procare is a great addition to Roper. We remain very excited about the business and are especially pleased with the initial results and progress we've made during the onboarding process. \n We're also increasing our full year 2024 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and DEPS reflecting our strong momentum and continued confidence in our outlook. And we continue to be very active in the M&A market, an environment that continues to improve and one where we have a very large pipeline of high-quality and attractive opportunities.\n Net-net, we're quite bullish about our ability to be active on the M&A front this year. As you can see, we had a great start to 2024, and we're well positioned to deliver yet another strong year of performance and growth. Now let me turn the call over to Jason. Jason? \nJason Conley: Thanks, Neil. Let's dive right in on Slide 6. Q1 was an excellent first installment to 2024. Revenue was 14% over prior year to $1.68 billion. Organic growth of 8% was led by double-digit growth at our TEP segment and solid mid-single-digit growth across our application software and network software segments.  \n Of note, organic recurring revenue grew 7% and despite known headwinds at our Freight Match and Foundry businesses. Acquisitions contributed 6 points of growth led by Syntellis, which is a large bolt-on for our Strata platform that closed in Q3 of last year, and Procare, which closed at the end of February.  \n Regarding Procare, integration is going really well, and we're excited to work with [ Joe and Kinzel ] and her team to drive continued growth and innovation in the attractive early childhood education market. EBITDA was $676 million, which was 16% over prior year. EBITDA incremental margin of 44% translated into EBITDA margin of 40.2% and represented 60 basis points of expansion. This was fueled by gross margin expansion of 100 basis points to 70.3%.\n Our market-leading businesses compete on customer intimacy and deliver demonstrable value to their customers which we consistently realize in our high gross margin profile. Debt of $4.41 was above our guidance of $4.30 to $4.34. Importantly, free cash flow was strong at $513 million, up 15% over prior year and our trailing 12-month free cash flow surpassed $2 billion for the first time in Roper's history.  \n Looking over a 4-year horizon, revenue and EBITDA CAGRs are 13% on a quarterly basis. For free cash flow, we take a broader lens and a review on a trailing 12-month basis, which generated an 11% CAGR over this period. Adjusting for cash tax payments related to Section 174 which went into effect and impacted the period -- the current period's free cash flow by $80 million.  \n The normalized CAGR is 13% over this period. For 2024, we still expect free cash flow margins of 30% or more. With that, we can turn to Slide 7 to talk about our balance sheet. Following our Procare acquisition, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio came in at 2.9x at quarter end. Our revolver, which provides us with $3.5 billion of immediate liquidity was utilized to fund the Procare acquisition, bringing the drawn balance to $1.75 billion.  \n With strong, consistent cash generation and a well-positioned balance sheet, we have the capacity to deploy $4 billion or more towards high-quality acquisitions. And I'll reiterate our commitment to remain a solid investment-grade issuer as access to investment-grade capital markets is fundamental to Roper's strategy. In terms of what we're seeing in deal markets, our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is growing and quite attractive. As always, we will remain patient and disciplined in allocating capital to opportunities with highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.\n With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk through our segment detail and updated guidance. \nNeil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 9, let's review our Application Software segment results. Revenues here grew by 18% in total and organic revenue grew by 6%. EBITDA margins were 43.3%. We experienced strong performance across this portfolio of businesses.\n We'll start with Deltek. Our enterprise software business survey the government contracting, architecture, engineering and construction contractor markets. Deltek continued to grow at SaaS solutions, especially within their private sector markets. Importantly, in the quarter, Deltek launched a new GenAI-powered digital assistant Dela which will be integrated across Deltek's core software applications. We also welcome Bob Hughes as the new CEO of Deltek. Bob brings a wealth of software and leadership experience to the role having most recently served as the Chief Customer and Strategy Officer at UKG. Bob, we're thrilled to be working with you.  \n We also welcome Mike Corkery into his new role as a full-time group executive within Roper. For those who do not know, Mike was Deltek's CEO for nearly 12 years, more than standing our entire ownership period. Mike, thank you for building a tremendous market-leading company. Not only is Deltek grown multifold during their leadership tenure, the underlying quality has massively improved and the culture has never been better. Thank you for everything you've accomplished and we're very much looking forward to working with you in your new leadership capacity at Roper. \n Aderant continues to perform incredibly well in the market and had another great quarter with continued SaaS momentum and GenAI-focused innovation. Vertafore also performed well with solid growth in their ARR base.  \n Turning to PowerPlan. Our financial planning and tax software business serving the heavy fixed asset industries, PowerPlan was impressive in the quarter and grew its ARR with strong customer retention and adoption of its new SaaS solution. Great job here. Our healthcare IT businesses led by Strata and Data Innovations were also strong in the quarter. We're especially pleased to see the solid go-to-market execution at both businesses.\n Finally, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we completed the acquisition of Procare Solutions, which is off to a good start and complements this segment with a higher organic growth profile. For the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment.  \n Please turn with us to Page 10. Revenues in our Network Software segment grew 5% in total and 4% on an organic basis despite the fact we continue to experience pressure with our Freight Matching businesses and the impact on Foundry related to the recent actor strike and writer strike. EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 55.9% and grew about 10% and year-over-year. As we dig into the details of it, we'll start with our Freight Matching businesses, DAT & Loadlink which declined slightly as expected due to the challenging freight market conditions that affected each of these businesses. \n As is typical for Roper, we invest for long-term sustainable and improving levels of organic growth. In DAT's case, we're leading the industry with GenAI-enabled fraud detection and prevention tools. As many know, fraud across the transport ecosystem remains a cause of great concern and economic loss.\n Turning to Foundry, which continues to innovate at an impressive clip both in terms of major product enhancements and customer productivity-based AI/ML innovations. That said, Foundry declined a bit in the quarter as expected, given the recent industry strikes. Notwithstanding the headwinds of DAT, Loadlink and Foundry, we grew 4% organically in this segment based on the strength across the balance of this portfolio.\n Specifically, iPipeline, our life insurance and annuities network software business had strong renewals, customer expansions and market activity, especially in the annuities market. ConstructConnect continued its solid mark but improved financial results and enhanced its network value with GenAI-powered solutions. And MHA had a strong quarter, benefiting from increased operational focus and rigor revenue timing related to one of MHA's data partnerships and improvement in senior care occupancy rates.\n For the balance of the year, although we did a touch better than expected in the first quarter, we continue to expect to see low single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment based on the continued difficult freight market conditions and our view that foundries recovery will be extended through this year. \n Now please turn to Page 11, and let's review our TEP segment's results. Revenues here grew 17% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins remained strong at 34.3%. Neptune continued to see notable customer demand, in particular for their ultrasonic meters and meter data management software. In short, Neptune delivered another quarter of growth. Verathon had very strong growth across all 3 of its product families and executed at an exceptional level in the quarter. \n Of note, Verathon had a record number of large account wins further demonstrating their market momentum. Great job by team Verathon. We also had strong execution and growth led by healthcare end markets from CIVCO, Inovonics, IPA and rf IDEAS.  \n As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, let us remind you that we expected to have a stronger first quarter, which we delivered. That said, for the balance of the year, we expect to see organic revenue for this segment to be in the high single-digits area. \n Now please turn to Page 13. Now let's review our increased full year 2024 guidance and discuss our Q2 outlook. Based on our strong Q1 results, enterprise momentum and our confidence in our outlook, we are raising our guidance for 2024. For the full year, we now expect total revenue to grow in the 12% area, up from our initial guide of 11% to 12%. Organic revenues to grow about 6%, up from 5% to 6% originally and adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $18.05 and $18.25, up from $17.85 to $18.15 previously.  \n Our guidance continues to assume a full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. For Q2, we expect adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $4.42 and $4.46. Now please turn it to Page 14, and we'll open it up for your questions. As per custom, we'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started.  \n First, we delivered another strong quarter results. Second, we're increasing our outlook for the full year. And third, we are very well positioned relative to capital deployment. For the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, adjusted DEPS and free cash flow with margin expansion and very strong cash flow conversion. Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Procare Solutions, which is a great addition to our enterprise and our application software segment.\n And we're increasing our full year 2024 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and DEPS reflecting our confidence in our outlook and continued momentum. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with $4 billion plus of capacity for capital deployment. The M&A markets are very active. We have a very robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities that we're excited to pursue with our unbiased and disciplined approach. \n We're quite bullish about our ability to execute this part of our strategy over the course of 2024. Now as we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment, so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve the organic growth rates and underlying business quality.\n Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area.  \n With that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. \nJulian Mitchell: Maybe just a first question on the network software division. So the freight markets, I think there was a fairly sort of down the outlook from some of the U.S. trucking companies in the past couple of weeks. It sounds like that business for you on Freight Matching is playing out as expected. \n Are we expecting sort of down-low single digits for the balance of the year in the freight match business? Is that what you're kind of dialing in? And any comments on where we are on the sort of carrier consolidation? \nNeil Hunn: Why don't you take Jason the first one, I'll say the second one. \nJason Conley: So Julian, it's -- like you said, it's about playing out as we expected, down low singles for the year. Not much change from our perspective last quarter. So yes, that's kind of the current guiding assumption. \nNeil Hunn: And as far as on the carrier side, it's actually been pretty stable for the last several months. It hasn't improved. It has been stable. And when you take that stability and you put it against the prior year comp, that's what drives to the outlook for the year. \nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then just dialing in on the second quarter EPS guide. I think normally, you'd have maybe sort of a 3%, 4% type sequential increase in earnings in the second quarter, looks like it's basically flat at the guide midpoint for this Q2, is there anything going on sort of sequentially with any of the segment sales or margins that's abnormal or something below the line that's weighing on that? \nJason Conley: No, not really. I mean we feel good about our guidance being raised for the full year. And if you look -- we look back a quarter ago, our Q2 guidance is consistent with what we thought 90 days ago. So I think if you go back to like '21 and '22, we were actually flat Q1 to Q2 on like a segment EBITDA basis. And that's usually the normal motion for us. Last year, we did move up sequentially, but that was driven by some [indiscernible], there were some strong deliveries led by Verathon and then this year, Verathon is coming out strong out of the gate. So we don't have that dynamic this year. \n And then usually, AS steps down a little bit in earnings due to some Vertafore timing, but we didn't have that dynamic last year. So I think we feel good about sort of the progression from Q1 to Q2 on an operating basis. And in terms of the second half, we'll start to see the accretion of Procare with this -- it's got sequential growth throughout the year and then we'll have, of course, reduced interest expense as we pay down the revolver. So I feel pretty good about the progression going throughout 2024. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. \nDeane Dray: Since it's the newest addition to the team on Procare, just some data points. So what was the contribution in the quarter? And reminds us about any kind of seasonality on the cash flow because it is tied to education. So we know that it tends to be seasonal. And any sort of like first 100-day plans for the business? \nNeil Hunn: Yes. So if I can hit that, Deane. So it was about what we expected. We had a couple more days in, but it was a little over $20 million of revenue came in sort of about as we expected in terms of EBITDA margin in the mid-30s or so. And then I think what we -- from a cash flow perspective, it's more of a monthly sort of payment stream. So we don't get -- it's not like a frontline where they've got big renewals and the schools are paying them. \n This is childhood education centers that are just sort of paying on a monthly basis, of course, there's a payment stream there, too, that we get that comes on a monthly basis. So it's more consistent throughout the year. And I think we're just off to a really good start in terms of the integration work.\n Of course, teams are quickly up and running from a financial standpoint. We're working through all the normal integration points around insurance and cyber and things like that. And then beyond that, we've been engaged in weekly conversations on progress against some defined value creation levers that we had around growth, and those are going really well. And super collaborative teams digging in and we're really on track for the milestones we agreed upon right after close. So just feeling really good about the momentum there. \nDeane Dray: And the normal cadence for the monthly is revenue cadence is approximately what? \nNeil Hunn: It's consistent, right? So it's just -- if you think about software is obviously consistent month-to-month. And then the payments, they might get a little bit more at the beginning of the year, but it's modest. It's pretty consistent throughout the year. Of course, they're growing, right? So it's going to -- it will ramp up sequentially throughout the year. But just overall, in terms of a business model, it's pretty consistent throughout the year, not a lot of seasonality. \nZack Moxcey: If you're comparing this to front line, where most of the cash flow comes in Q3, this is not that. This is much more linear throughout the course of the year. \nDeane Dray: That's great. And then just a follow-up on the fastest growth platform right now is surprisingly on the tech-enabled products, Neptune is just how -- what's expectations for this growth rate? How much of this -- because we see similar numbers at like Badger meter. So it looks in line, but how much of this is market growth versus any sort of share gains that you might be realizing? \nNeil Hunn: Yes. So for a long -- Deane, as you know, Neptune over a long arc of time is a slow and steady share gainer for sure. I think it proves out in all the market data we see and continues to research it. Relative short-term performance, we think it's a combination of a couple of things. \n First is there has been -- they're working through an unprecedented amount of backlog. So that has certainly happened. But then when COVID happened and the Northeast, in particular, where a lot of the meter sets or inside people's homes versus outside, there was basically a stall of that activity yet the customers -- our customers still have obligations to stay on their maintenance schedules. \n So if there was 1 year, 1.5 years of slower maintenance schedule sort of execution, that's being deployed now. We think that's happening over a 3-, 4-year period. So if you will, maybe 5 or 5.5 years demand squeezed into 4. So that's the market dynamic that's driving some of the growth that we're very much in the midst of. We expect that to continue well in the next year. \n Final thing I'd say is there's just nice momentum on the new technologies that Neptune has in the field, both in terms of solid state  ultrasonic meters, both on the resi side and large commercial side as well as just the cellular and the meter data management software that we have that really helps our customers have better network connectivity. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. \nJoseph Vruwink: When you consider the businesses that serve clients in the public sector, how are they planning for the balance of the year, just particularly around the election and then the end of stimulus in certain cases? And I ask about stimulus not because a business like frontline has benefited from that. But does just the shifting of revenue sources for a school district perhaps cause a pause in their decision-making? \nNeil Hunn: Yes. So we got -- it depends on which part of the market you're talking about. Education, our frontline business was not and has not been a meaningful beneficiary of [ ESR ] funding. And so as that is coming to an end, we've not been a direct beneficiary of that. There might be some secondhand or thirdhand benefit by that, just having school districts having a lot of money over the last years and feeling good about life. \n But we've not -- none of what -- we don't believe anything that we sell has been directly funded by [ ESR ] funding. So the pipeline coverage -- first of all, frontline had a very solid first quarter booking. Pipeline on the second quarter is very good. And so we're cautiously optimistic there. \n The other part of the market that we've talked about is on U.S. Federal Government contractors, the enterprise class, the largest customers, the largest government contractors just with the uncertainty of government spending that has been a more tepid macro environment and slower on the bookings front on the largest of the customers. The SMB portion of that market actually has been quite strong for Deltek. So if you want to talk about other parts of portfolio happy to do it. But Jason, anything you want to add to that? \nJoseph Vruwink: Yes, yes. No, those are the 2 that I had in mind. And then if I can ask, I guess this is a pretty targeted segment level question. But the reoccurring revenue sources for application software really look like they jumped this period, maybe about 2 points more in growth contribution than typically you see there. Just what drives that particular part of the business? \nNeil Hunn: Yes. Joe, that's the Procare business coming online, right? So we talked about 75% or so of their revenue is payments. And so that's showing up in the recurring line. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. \nScott Davis: I think this was more positive in tone on the M&A side commentary wise, and I think we usually get from you guys. You're never really that bearish. But talk to us about -- a couple of things, a little bit more color there. Is it the number of deals? Is it the valuations have gotten more interesting? Is it the competition on the buy side has gotten a little bit better? I mean just drill down a little bit into that, it would be helpful. And kind of a natural secondary is you say $4 billion of fire price, is that enough? And would you consider tapping equity markets if the deal flow was going to be even more robust? \nNeil Hunn: A lot in there, Jason and I'll do our best to cover all points, if we don't cover one pull us, I'll bring it back to it. So we're very optimistic at the moment. I think it's for really all the reasons you talk about. So there are a very large number of deals in the market and coming to the market. \n We have very good instrumentation relationships with both the sponsors and all the investment banker intermediaries, the bankers, pipelines are full. And so there is just a lot of stuff coming. So why is that? There was essentially not a lot of stuff for [ 18 ] or so months prior. So in the private equity world, it's all about DPI and getting money back to the LPs. \n The LP pressure is mounted to the point where they want the capital return. And so we're just going to compress 2.5 years worth of deals in 1 year, 1.5 years. And so there's going to be a lot of activity. Relative to the competition point, because of this -- this is our belief, my belief for a window of time here that the asset class of private equity that we compete with is going to be a net seller of assets versus a net buyer here for a period of time. \n So Procare is an indication for what's to come, then the competition is less. It's not without competition, but it is less than we've seen for in prior periods, which leads to valuation. I mean if you look at the Procare valuation, I mean that was a very high growth, very high quality business at a very reasonable price. I think it's really a combination of the volume of deals that maybe our view on competition. We'll also I mean any of this -- the number of deals is almost for sure going to happen. \n This concept of competition could change at any moment. But that's our -- that's what's fueling sort of our optimism. To your point about this $4 billion enough, we're just always about the cash flow compounding of the enterprise being investment grade, using the leverage and being unbiased and disciplined in our approach. And so we're going to stay true to that and look at every deal on a deal-by-deal basis. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. \nUnknown Analyst: This is David on for Brent. I wanted to ask around there was increased commentary, I think, versus prior quarter around some of the companies and what they're doing around AI. Just if you could just give us an update on the broader AI strategy? And if you guys are charging for any of these AI products, any color there would be helpful on how AI could possibly help with the organic growth of some of your assets in the long term, that would be helpful. \nNeil Hunn: Yes. We'll certainly give you an update on that. So we continue to grind away at this. So we have done a lot of work engaging with all 28 of our businesses, both on the internal productivity-based applications around R&D, customer for live customer support go-to-market, admin, HR, finance, regulatory, et cetera, have a call at lunch with a large group of our leaders today on just that topic. \n We're starting to see some early wins on productivity, like most of us are in code assistance, marketing content generation, things like that. So cautiously optimistic about productivity enhancements. As it relates more directly to your question around products and the market and monetization. This is going to be a slow and steady race about how do you use these tools to create incremental value for our customers. \n Again, you know we compete on intimacy. That intimacy leads us to know very specific problems and very specific questions that need to be addressed. We have a new technology set to be able to do that. Companies that have products in the market today using GenAI, Aderant, Deltek, DAT, ConstructConnect and Foundry by our account, there may be a few others. Two quarters ago, I think that the count was 0. And so we like the momentum in that regard. \n In terms of monetization, it's still early days. Our belief -- like for the moment at least, we're monetizing the GenAI investments by having -- by adding that toolset and capability to our existing products in unique ways and then that is creating more value in the products, which is driving in almost all cases, bookings acceleration with those products, and in some cases, higher price points because of the value that's achieved through the tools. \n So that's where I leave it. Happy to follow up, say, if you want to add, Jason. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. \nTerrell Tillman: Maybe just the first question because it is the most recent addition to the portfolio, and I think you all calculated the opportunity here maybe to continue buying high-quality assets, but maybe even some better growth profiles, good valuations. I'm curious, just an update on where you see kind of on a go-forward basis, the Procare Solutions revenue compounding growth rate where you see that? And then as you've had a little bit of time here, where do you see one of the most untapped growth engines for that? And then I had a quick follow-up for Jason. \nNeil Hunn: Yes. So on Procare when we announced the deal, we talked about how we believe, this is going to be a mid-teens organic growth business. The market is growing 10% or a little north of that. Procare is about 1.5x relative market share. And so with that leadership position and market growth, broker has the right to win that big share and grow above market. \n In terms of your question, Terry, is bolt-on activity inside of Procare, there's a couple of areas that Janet and her team with the leadership team at Procare are exploring, we. Tuck in a couple of bolt-on type products that sell into the network. But I think at Procare, the bolt-ons are going to be modest on a go-forward basis. \nTerrell Tillman: Got it. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I think it was 5% to 6% organic growth and now you've firmly set 6%, so that's good to see. Jason, if you had to think about like what is the biggest driver or maybe it's just a bunch of little things. What is the biggest swing factor in just tightening that and effectively raising the organic? \nJason Conley: Yes. I mean, obviously, we had a really strong Q1. So part of that is just carrying that through and a lot of that was at TEP and then we had some various small beats across software. So I think it's mainly what we saw in Q1 and then just the confidence that we're going to be able to sort of maintain our prior guidance for the out quarters. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. \nJoseph Giordano: Just curious on the jobs in the country, like you look at the jobs data and they're pretty good, but it's generally been like an erosion of white collar type jobs replaced by like part-time blue-collar jobs. And I'm just curious like on a longer term, what are the implications on some of your software businesses that are more headcount driven? Is that trend? I know you won't see it like immediately, but is that -- are you starting to see the implications of that like an outlook basis? \nNeil Hunn: So I would say no, but perhaps the reason is very -- there's some, but very little of our revenue is seat-based pricing. There's some, like I said, -- and where that exists, we're transitioning to a different metric. So as you get more disruption with GenAI or the knowledge workers sort of get more productive, we certainly want to benefit by that, not be penalized by that. But it's not been something that's been brought up by any of our companies in any of our operating or strategy reduce. \nJoseph Giordano: Interesting. Okay. And then just to follow up on the AI discussion in terms of like deployments and the products you're launching here. Has that been like table stakes now? Or is your competition doing the same? Or do you feel like deploying these tools has been a differentiation for your businesses? \nNeil Hunn: So far, it's been very differential. I think the expectation is the competitors will have their response for sure. I'm just double-click on that a bit, though, which is we tend -- we are across all 20 of our businesses, we operate in these very small markets, and we are the largest player in the small market. \n So we have that advantage around scale in these small markets to be able to do more product development, do more research and development, do more -- invest more and go to market to get these tools there. And so that is a long-term advantage that we have and why we select the businesses we do to be part of the portfolio. The other thing is when you compete on intimacy with Generative AI, all these verticals that we have, we obviously have the knowledge and the content and the data. And that's only half the question. The other half the problem. The other half of the problem, though, is we are so -- we compete on intimacy so we actually know what questions to answer. So we have the content, the data and the question and now the Generative AI, it's just another tool in the toolkit about how to solve those problems. So we like our long-term competitive positions. \nJoseph Giordano: Just on that, if I could just sneak in a follow-up on that. Like is this an area -- I know generally, once you acquire a business that kind of runs on its own, but is this an area where like the corporate can flex a little bit because these solutions tend to be expensive to deploy. \n So is this an area where like Roper corporate could be like all we are making a decision to kind of allocate capital to the businesses that need this specifically outside of the natural free cash flow dynamics of that specific firm? \nNeil Hunn: So these tools are not free, but they are substantially less expensive than these large language models that have to be developed, right? And so there is the research and development part of the application of the LLM and what we're doing, and then there's the operational costs. Jason did a teach-in a couple of months ago about the ROI case studies and all of this stuff. \n So far, we've not seen an ROI case study that's been challenged in any meaningful way on this front. I'm sure that will happen as you start to work down the curve of opportunities. But we're not -- at the moment, we're not going to try to do a one-size-fits-all Roper Generative AI solution because it would just not work because of the 28 different applications. Jason, anything you want to add. \nJason Conley: Yes. No, that's right. I mean we do have benefits and scale with some of the agreements with our large cloud service providers. So that's been beneficial for companies to do some experimentation at a very low cost. And then we're just allocating a lot of mind share towards that, so we can collectively get better. But in terms of like allocating capital that just hasn't been front-centered out. The company has a really compelling value proposition. We're always going to entertain that, but that's not what we're seeing today. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. \nJoseph Ritchie: So in your prepared comments, Neil, you referenced how some of your new SaaS-based offerings were helping certain businesses. I'm just curious as you kind of think a look at the portfolio as a whole, like how far along are you in terms of rolling out additional new platforms? And how much room is there to go from here? And if there are any examples that you want to highlight, that would be great across the portfolio. \nNeil Hunn: So I just want to make sure we understand it or answering the question you're asking is that essentially how far along are we on our SaaS journey? And what's that look like? \nJoseph Ritchie: Yes, that's exactly right. And if there are examples across the portfolio where you think you're -- you have like additional opportunity, I'd love to just hear about some of those examples. \nNeil Hunn: So Jason why don't you take on the first part, I'll take the second part. \nJason Conley: Yes. At the macro level, we're a little over $900 million of maintenance today, maintenance revenue and if you go back maybe in the last 5 years, we've converted the base of maintenance probably like in the mid- to high single-digit area. So we still have a lot of room left, and we convert that maintenance revenue at 2 to 2.5x when we go to SaaS. And so that's kind of where we're at today. \n And there's a -- Neil can talk about the specific businesses. There's a handful of businesses that are transitioning. I'd say Aderant is one that's probably had the biggest migration over the last 3 or 4 years, which happened right at co -- that was an industry that was reluctant to move to the cloud and then all of a sudden, once a few firms when they all win. So they're right in the in the thick of things in terms of that cloud migration. But Neil, do you want to talk about some other. \nNeil Hunn: As Jason said, I mean, it is this $900 million of on-premise maintenance is concentrated in a handful of businesses. The examples we give would start with Deltek. It's both on the cost point, which is our government contracting core product and Vantage Point, which is their private sector, their engineering, architecture product.\n You might have seen, for instance, on cost point, this quarter, Deltek achieved FedRAMP Moderate ready status. So there is a requirement the government puts on for security. It's a meaningful checkpoint for cost point in the cloud, almost all net new for the private sector part of Deltek's book is sole and Vantage Point, which is in the cloud and SaaS enabled. Jason talked about Aderant, 80-plus percent of all of Aderant bookings today are in the cloud, talked about PowerPlan. PowerPlan has one, a handful of core applications. I would say their #2 application is cloud-enabled and being deployed today. So we're definitively rolling through that book in that product set and building into this long-term SaaS business. \nJoseph Ritchie: Got it. That's super helpful. I'll just leave it there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wolfe Research. \nBradley Hewitt: So you talked about the strength that pipeline in the quarter. I saw you announced a new CFO for that business with a focus on kind of driving the long-term growth strategy. Just wondering if you could update us on kind of the normalized growth profile of that business and what you see as kind of the biggest opportunities to perhaps accelerate growth in that business going forward. \nNeil Hunn: Yes, I'll take the first part. I'll let Jason talk about the growth outlook. So -- it's not -- I mean, we have a new president there, Pat McDonald. He is just hired as new CFO, as you referenced, really like the leadership mindset, the competitive orientation, the learning orientation, the building capability to be able to take long term, in that short term that the new leader brings to iPipeline. \n His predecessor [indiscernible], he's been a long-term Roper leader, did a great job for a couple of years setting that business up. Retention is super strong, love sort of the market -- this company is really poised for market share gains. It's good market focus. The competitive environment, one, is tilting our direction for sure. The business has network effects. So I really like the momentum and what we're poised to do in that business. And then, Jason, I will let you take the growth question. \nJason Conley: Yes. I mean I think it's playing out as we thought it would when we acquired it back in 2018, 2019 area, it's in the high single-digit plus range and maybe it tilt a little higher down the road. But that's sort of where it's tracking. And just Adam Boone was added to the team a month ago, and we're excited about him joining along with Pat. So we're excited about the process for our pipeline. \nBradley Hewitt: Okay. Great. And then it looks like growth in network in Q1 was maybe a few points better than expected. Your guidance for the rest of the year kind of implies revenue flattish sequentially on an absolute basis. \n I would assume most of the businesses in that segment would see kind of modest sequential growth throughout the year. So just kind of trying to understand if there are any potential offsets that maybe if that's DAT. Just any thoughts on kind of sequentials relative to Q1 levels in network. \nJason Conley: Yes, sure. So we talked a little bit about MHA had a really strong quarter, and we think they're still -- they're going to continue to grow this year. But Q1 was especially strong as they had a contract renegotiations. So we got a little bit of a bump in organic growth in the first quarter. And then DAT & Loadlink, they'll continue to be down this year. And so maybe a touch lower than Q1. So that's what's driving the sort of low single digits throughout the rest of the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. \nPatrick Baumann: Lot of ground been covered. Just a couple of cleanups here. Sticking with the Network Software segment, it's seen really good margin expansion for a couple of quarters now. Could you remind us what's driving that? And if this 56%, 57% is sustainable and could potentially move up further in coming quarters? \nNeil Hunn: Yes. So we touched on this last year, just DAT getting ahead of where they saw the market was going and taking some of the fixed costs out of the business. And so we're just realizing that through the first 3 quarters of this year. We think the margins in that -- I don't think it's going to get -- it's going to expand further. We're sort of in the 55%, 56% range. We expect that to continue throughout the year. \nPatrick Baumann: Okay. Got it. And then lastly, just the second quarter. Any color you could give us on organic growth expectations? I know you gave it for 2Q to 4Q. Any difference between second quarter and that 2Q to 4Q guide? And then also on free cash flow, typically lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. So wondering if you could give any kind of color on that relative to the first quarter. \nNeil Hunn: Yes. I mean I think the organic growth expectations are the same in the second quarter as they are for the year. So no real big swings there. And then cash flow on the second quarter, it's always the quarter that we make to federal tax payments. So it's always the lowest of the year. So that's really the only dynamic I would point out there. If you look over prior years, that's always our low point, but still expect to grow, of course. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Alexander Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. \nAlexander Blanton: I noticed that you're forecasting or guiding to organic growth of 6% for the year, correct? But you had 8% in the first quarter. So are you factoring in some economic weakness in the U.S. in that forecast? \nJason Conley: No. I mean, I think it all plays out, Alex, in our products segment and our TEP segment over the first quarter, we just had a better compare and just the ramp that we had in Neptune last year, it's sort of the comps sort of normalize out in the balance of the year. So it's really just that. It's no more complicated than that. And so that's why Q1 was -- and that's -- when we came into the year, that's what we had indicated that Q1 was going to be the kind of the high mark in terms of organic unless things change in our assumptions. \nNeil Hunn: And I would just add, Alex, to what Jason said, we assume that there is the freight conditions and whatnot that, that is muted, but we've assumed that all the way through, it's not a new assumption, but there is definitely back half macroeconomic weak impacts in that part of our business. That did not change, but it's embedded from our original guidance. \nAlexander Blanton: And which part of the business? I missed that. \nNeil Hunn: The transportation part, the DAT & Loadlink inside of network, the Freight Matching business. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks. \nZack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Neil Hunn",
            "content": "Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our first quarter results and our increased outlook for the year.\n As we turn to Page 4, you can see the topics we'll cover today. I'll start by highlighting our strong performance in Q1. Jason will then go through our financial results in more detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity; and finally, our notable cash flow performance. Then I'll walk through our segment highlights and discuss our increased guidance for the full year and initiate our Q2 guidance. After our closing remarks, we'll open the floor for your questions. \n So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, 3 key takeaways for today's call. First, we delivered another strong quarter results. Second, we're increasing our full year outlook. And third, we continue to be very well positioned relative to capital deployment. We double-click a bit. We grew total revenue by 14%, organic revenue by 8% and EBITDA by 16%, with EBITDA margin expanding by 60 basis points to 40.2%. \n We grew DEPS by 13% to $4.41 beating our guidance range. We grew free cash flow 15% year-over-year with free cash flow margins of 31%. We also completed the acquisition of Procare Solutions, a leading provider of software and integrated payments for the early childhood education market for $1.75 billion. Procare is a great addition to Roper. We remain very excited about the business and are especially pleased with the initial results and progress we've made during the onboarding process. \n We're also increasing our full year 2024 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and DEPS reflecting our strong momentum and continued confidence in our outlook. And we continue to be very active in the M&A market, an environment that continues to improve and one where we have a very large pipeline of high-quality and attractive opportunities.\n Net-net, we're quite bullish about our ability to be active on the M&A front this year. As you can see, we had a great start to 2024, and we're well positioned to deliver yet another strong year of performance and growth. Now let me turn the call over to Jason. Jason? Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 9, let's review our Application Software segment results. Revenues here grew by 18% in total and organic revenue grew by 6%. EBITDA margins were 43.3%. We experienced strong performance across this portfolio of businesses.\n We'll start with Deltek. Our enterprise software business survey the government contracting, architecture, engineering and construction contractor markets. Deltek continued to grow at SaaS solutions, especially within their private sector markets. Importantly, in the quarter, Deltek launched a new GenAI-powered digital assistant Dela which will be integrated across Deltek's core software applications. We also welcome Bob Hughes as the new CEO of Deltek. Bob brings a wealth of software and leadership experience to the role having most recently served as the Chief Customer and Strategy Officer at UKG. Bob, we're thrilled to be working with you.  \n We also welcome Mike Corkery into his new role as a full-time group executive within Roper. For those who do not know, Mike was Deltek's CEO for nearly 12 years, more than standing our entire ownership period. Mike, thank you for building a tremendous market-leading company. Not only is Deltek grown multifold during their leadership tenure, the underlying quality has massively improved and the culture has never been better. Thank you for everything you've accomplished and we're very much looking forward to working with you in your new leadership capacity at Roper. \n Aderant continues to perform incredibly well in the market and had another great quarter with continued SaaS momentum and GenAI-focused innovation. Vertafore also performed well with solid growth in their ARR base.  \n Turning to PowerPlan. Our financial planning and tax software business serving the heavy fixed asset industries, PowerPlan was impressive in the quarter and grew its ARR with strong customer retention and adoption of its new SaaS solution. Great job here. Our healthcare IT businesses led by Strata and Data Innovations were also strong in the quarter. We're especially pleased to see the solid go-to-market execution at both businesses.\n Finally, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we completed the acquisition of Procare Solutions, which is off to a good start and complements this segment with a higher organic growth profile. For the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment.  \n Please turn with us to Page 10. Revenues in our Network Software segment grew 5% in total and 4% on an organic basis despite the fact we continue to experience pressure with our Freight Matching businesses and the impact on Foundry related to the recent actor strike and writer strike. EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 55.9% and grew about 10% and year-over-year. As we dig into the details of it, we'll start with our Freight Matching businesses, DAT & Loadlink which declined slightly as expected due to the challenging freight market conditions that affected each of these businesses. \n As is typical for Roper, we invest for long-term sustainable and improving levels of organic growth. In DAT's case, we're leading the industry with GenAI-enabled fraud detection and prevention tools. As many know, fraud across the transport ecosystem remains a cause of great concern and economic loss.\n Turning to Foundry, which continues to innovate at an impressive clip both in terms of major product enhancements and customer productivity-based AI/ML innovations. That said, Foundry declined a bit in the quarter as expected, given the recent industry strikes. Notwithstanding the headwinds of DAT, Loadlink and Foundry, we grew 4% organically in this segment based on the strength across the balance of this portfolio.\n Specifically, iPipeline, our life insurance and annuities network software business had strong renewals, customer expansions and market activity, especially in the annuities market. ConstructConnect continued its solid mark but improved financial results and enhanced its network value with GenAI-powered solutions. And MHA had a strong quarter, benefiting from increased operational focus and rigor revenue timing related to one of MHA's data partnerships and improvement in senior care occupancy rates.\n For the balance of the year, although we did a touch better than expected in the first quarter, we continue to expect to see low single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment based on the continued difficult freight market conditions and our view that foundries recovery will be extended through this year. \n Now please turn to Page 11, and let's review our TEP segment's results. Revenues here grew 17% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins remained strong at 34.3%. Neptune continued to see notable customer demand, in particular for their ultrasonic meters and meter data management software. In short, Neptune delivered another quarter of growth. Verathon had very strong growth across all 3 of its product families and executed at an exceptional level in the quarter. \n Of note, Verathon had a record number of large account wins further demonstrating their market momentum. Great job by team Verathon. We also had strong execution and growth led by healthcare end markets from CIVCO, Inovonics, IPA and rf IDEAS.  \n As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, let us remind you that we expected to have a stronger first quarter, which we delivered. That said, for the balance of the year, we expect to see organic revenue for this segment to be in the high single-digits area. \n Now please turn to Page 13. Now let's review our increased full year 2024 guidance and discuss our Q2 outlook. Based on our strong Q1 results, enterprise momentum and our confidence in our outlook, we are raising our guidance for 2024. For the full year, we now expect total revenue to grow in the 12% area, up from our initial guide of 11% to 12%. Organic revenues to grow about 6%, up from 5% to 6% originally and adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $18.05 and $18.25, up from $17.85 to $18.15 previously.  \n Our guidance continues to assume a full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. For Q2, we expect adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $4.42 and $4.46. Now please turn it to Page 14, and we'll open it up for your questions. As per custom, we'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started.  \n First, we delivered another strong quarter results. Second, we're increasing our outlook for the full year. And third, we are very well positioned relative to capital deployment. For the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, adjusted DEPS and free cash flow with margin expansion and very strong cash flow conversion. Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Procare Solutions, which is a great addition to our enterprise and our application software segment.\n And we're increasing our full year 2024 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and DEPS reflecting our confidence in our outlook and continued momentum. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with $4 billion plus of capacity for capital deployment. The M&A markets are very active. We have a very robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities that we're excited to pursue with our unbiased and disciplined approach. \n We're quite bullish about our ability to execute this part of our strategy over the course of 2024. Now as we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment, so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve the organic growth rates and underlying business quality.\n Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area.  \n With that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor to your questions. Why don't you take Jason the first one, I'll say the second one. And as far as on the carrier side, it's actually been pretty stable for the last several months. It hasn't improved. It has been stable. And when you take that stability and you put it against the prior year comp, that's what drives to the outlook for the year. Yes. So if I can hit that, Deane. So it was about what we expected. We had a couple more days in, but it was a little over $20 million of revenue came in sort of about as we expected in terms of EBITDA margin in the mid-30s or so. And then I think what we -- from a cash flow perspective, it's more of a monthly sort of payment stream. So we don't get -- it's not like a frontline where they've got big renewals and the schools are paying them. \n This is childhood education centers that are just sort of paying on a monthly basis, of course, there's a payment stream there, too, that we get that comes on a monthly basis. So it's more consistent throughout the year. And I think we're just off to a really good start in terms of the integration work.\n Of course, teams are quickly up and running from a financial standpoint. We're working through all the normal integration points around insurance and cyber and things like that. And then beyond that, we've been engaged in weekly conversations on progress against some defined value creation levers that we had around growth, and those are going really well. And super collaborative teams digging in and we're really on track for the milestones we agreed upon right after close. So just feeling really good about the momentum there. It's consistent, right? So it's just -- if you think about software is obviously consistent month-to-month. And then the payments, they might get a little bit more at the beginning of the year, but it's modest. It's pretty consistent throughout the year. Of course, they're growing, right? So it's going to -- it will ramp up sequentially throughout the year. But just overall, in terms of a business model, it's pretty consistent throughout the year, not a lot of seasonality. Yes. So for a long -- Deane, as you know, Neptune over a long arc of time is a slow and steady share gainer for sure. I think it proves out in all the market data we see and continues to research it. Relative short-term performance, we think it's a combination of a couple of things. \n First is there has been -- they're working through an unprecedented amount of backlog. So that has certainly happened. But then when COVID happened and the Northeast, in particular, where a lot of the meter sets or inside people's homes versus outside, there was basically a stall of that activity yet the customers -- our customers still have obligations to stay on their maintenance schedules. \n So if there was 1 year, 1.5 years of slower maintenance schedule sort of execution, that's being deployed now. We think that's happening over a 3-, 4-year period. So if you will, maybe 5 or 5.5 years demand squeezed into 4. So that's the market dynamic that's driving some of the growth that we're very much in the midst of. We expect that to continue well in the next year. \n Final thing I'd say is there's just nice momentum on the new technologies that Neptune has in the field, both in terms of solid state  ultrasonic meters, both on the resi side and large commercial side as well as just the cellular and the meter data management software that we have that really helps our customers have better network connectivity. Yes. So we got -- it depends on which part of the market you're talking about. Education, our frontline business was not and has not been a meaningful beneficiary of [ ESR ] funding. And so as that is coming to an end, we've not been a direct beneficiary of that. There might be some secondhand or thirdhand benefit by that, just having school districts having a lot of money over the last years and feeling good about life. \n But we've not -- none of what -- we don't believe anything that we sell has been directly funded by [ ESR ] funding. So the pipeline coverage -- first of all, frontline had a very solid first quarter booking. Pipeline on the second quarter is very good. And so we're cautiously optimistic there. \n The other part of the market that we've talked about is on U.S. Federal Government contractors, the enterprise class, the largest customers, the largest government contractors just with the uncertainty of government spending that has been a more tepid macro environment and slower on the bookings front on the largest of the customers. The SMB portion of that market actually has been quite strong for Deltek. So if you want to talk about other parts of portfolio happy to do it. But Jason, anything you want to add to that? Yes. Joe, that's the Procare business coming online, right? So we talked about 75% or so of their revenue is payments. And so that's showing up in the recurring line. A lot in there, Jason and I'll do our best to cover all points, if we don't cover one pull us, I'll bring it back to it. So we're very optimistic at the moment. I think it's for really all the reasons you talk about. So there are a very large number of deals in the market and coming to the market. \n We have very good instrumentation relationships with both the sponsors and all the investment banker intermediaries, the bankers, pipelines are full. And so there is just a lot of stuff coming. So why is that? There was essentially not a lot of stuff for [ 18 ] or so months prior. So in the private equity world, it's all about DPI and getting money back to the LPs. \n The LP pressure is mounted to the point where they want the capital return. And so we're just going to compress 2.5 years worth of deals in 1 year, 1.5 years. And so there's going to be a lot of activity. Relative to the competition point, because of this -- this is our belief, my belief for a window of time here that the asset class of private equity that we compete with is going to be a net seller of assets versus a net buyer here for a period of time. \n So Procare is an indication for what's to come, then the competition is less. It's not without competition, but it is less than we've seen for in prior periods, which leads to valuation. I mean if you look at the Procare valuation, I mean that was a very high growth, very high quality business at a very reasonable price. I think it's really a combination of the volume of deals that maybe our view on competition. We'll also I mean any of this -- the number of deals is almost for sure going to happen. \n This concept of competition could change at any moment. But that's our -- that's what's fueling sort of our optimism. To your point about this $4 billion enough, we're just always about the cash flow compounding of the enterprise being investment grade, using the leverage and being unbiased and disciplined in our approach. And so we're going to stay true to that and look at every deal on a deal-by-deal basis. Yes. We'll certainly give you an update on that. So we continue to grind away at this. So we have done a lot of work engaging with all 28 of our businesses, both on the internal productivity-based applications around R&D, customer for live customer support go-to-market, admin, HR, finance, regulatory, et cetera, have a call at lunch with a large group of our leaders today on just that topic. \n We're starting to see some early wins on productivity, like most of us are in code assistance, marketing content generation, things like that. So cautiously optimistic about productivity enhancements. As it relates more directly to your question around products and the market and monetization. This is going to be a slow and steady race about how do you use these tools to create incremental value for our customers. \n Again, you know we compete on intimacy. That intimacy leads us to know very specific problems and very specific questions that need to be addressed. We have a new technology set to be able to do that. Companies that have products in the market today using GenAI, Aderant, Deltek, DAT, ConstructConnect and Foundry by our account, there may be a few others. Two quarters ago, I think that the count was 0. And so we like the momentum in that regard. \n In terms of monetization, it's still early days. Our belief -- like for the moment at least, we're monetizing the GenAI investments by having -- by adding that toolset and capability to our existing products in unique ways and then that is creating more value in the products, which is driving in almost all cases, bookings acceleration with those products, and in some cases, higher price points because of the value that's achieved through the tools. \n So that's where I leave it. Happy to follow up, say, if you want to add, Jason. Yes. So on Procare when we announced the deal, we talked about how we believe, this is going to be a mid-teens organic growth business. The market is growing 10% or a little north of that. Procare is about 1.5x relative market share. And so with that leadership position and market growth, broker has the right to win that big share and grow above market. \n In terms of your question, Terry, is bolt-on activity inside of Procare, there's a couple of areas that Janet and her team with the leadership team at Procare are exploring, we. Tuck in a couple of bolt-on type products that sell into the network. But I think at Procare, the bolt-ons are going to be modest on a go-forward basis. So I would say no, but perhaps the reason is very -- there's some, but very little of our revenue is seat-based pricing. There's some, like I said, -- and where that exists, we're transitioning to a different metric. So as you get more disruption with GenAI or the knowledge workers sort of get more productive, we certainly want to benefit by that, not be penalized by that. But it's not been something that's been brought up by any of our companies in any of our operating or strategy reduce. So far, it's been very differential. I think the expectation is the competitors will have their response for sure. I'm just double-click on that a bit, though, which is we tend -- we are across all 20 of our businesses, we operate in these very small markets, and we are the largest player in the small market. \n So we have that advantage around scale in these small markets to be able to do more product development, do more research and development, do more -- invest more and go to market to get these tools there. And so that is a long-term advantage that we have and why we select the businesses we do to be part of the portfolio. The other thing is when you compete on intimacy with Generative AI, all these verticals that we have, we obviously have the knowledge and the content and the data. And that's only half the question. The other half the problem. The other half of the problem, though, is we are so -- we compete on intimacy so we actually know what questions to answer. So we have the content, the data and the question and now the Generative AI, it's just another tool in the toolkit about how to solve those problems. So we like our long-term competitive positions. So these tools are not free, but they are substantially less expensive than these large language models that have to be developed, right? And so there is the research and development part of the application of the LLM and what we're doing, and then there's the operational costs. Jason did a teach-in a couple of months ago about the ROI case studies and all of this stuff. \n So far, we've not seen an ROI case study that's been challenged in any meaningful way on this front. I'm sure that will happen as you start to work down the curve of opportunities. But we're not -- at the moment, we're not going to try to do a one-size-fits-all Roper Generative AI solution because it would just not work because of the 28 different applications. Jason, anything you want to add. So I just want to make sure we understand it or answering the question you're asking is that essentially how far along are we on our SaaS journey? And what's that look like? So Jason why don't you take on the first part, I'll take the second part. As Jason said, I mean, it is this $900 million of on-premise maintenance is concentrated in a handful of businesses. The examples we give would start with Deltek. It's both on the cost point, which is our government contracting core product and Vantage Point, which is their private sector, their engineering, architecture product.\n You might have seen, for instance, on cost point, this quarter, Deltek achieved FedRAMP Moderate ready status. So there is a requirement the government puts on for security. It's a meaningful checkpoint for cost point in the cloud, almost all net new for the private sector part of Deltek's book is sole and Vantage Point, which is in the cloud and SaaS enabled. Jason talked about Aderant, 80-plus percent of all of Aderant bookings today are in the cloud, talked about PowerPlan. PowerPlan has one, a handful of core applications. I would say their #2 application is cloud-enabled and being deployed today. So we're definitively rolling through that book in that product set and building into this long-term SaaS business. Yes, I'll take the first part. I'll let Jason talk about the growth outlook. So -- it's not -- I mean, we have a new president there, Pat McDonald. He is just hired as new CFO, as you referenced, really like the leadership mindset, the competitive orientation, the learning orientation, the building capability to be able to take long term, in that short term that the new leader brings to iPipeline. \n His predecessor [indiscernible], he's been a long-term Roper leader, did a great job for a couple of years setting that business up. Retention is super strong, love sort of the market -- this company is really poised for market share gains. It's good market focus. The competitive environment, one, is tilting our direction for sure. The business has network effects. So I really like the momentum and what we're poised to do in that business. And then, Jason, I will let you take the growth question. Yes. So we touched on this last year, just DAT getting ahead of where they saw the market was going and taking some of the fixed costs out of the business. And so we're just realizing that through the first 3 quarters of this year. We think the margins in that -- I don't think it's going to get -- it's going to expand further. We're sort of in the 55%, 56% range. We expect that to continue throughout the year. Yes. I mean I think the organic growth expectations are the same in the second quarter as they are for the year. So no real big swings there. And then cash flow on the second quarter, it's always the quarter that we make to federal tax payments. So it's always the lowest of the year. So that's really the only dynamic I would point out there. If you look over prior years, that's always our low point, but still expect to grow, of course. And I would just add, Alex, to what Jason said, we assume that there is the freight conditions and whatnot that, that is muted, but we've assumed that all the way through, it's not a new assumption, but there is definitely back half macroeconomic weak impacts in that part of our business. That did not change, but it's embedded from our original guidance. The transportation part, the DAT & Loadlink inside of network, the Freight Matching business."

            "name": "Jason Conley",
            "content": "Thanks, Neil. Let's dive right in on Slide 6. Q1 was an excellent first installment to 2024. Revenue was 14% over prior year to $1.68 billion. Organic growth of 8% was led by double-digit growth at our TEP segment and solid mid-single-digit growth across our application software and network software segments.  \n Of note, organic recurring revenue grew 7% and despite known headwinds at our Freight Match and Foundry businesses. Acquisitions contributed 6 points of growth led by Syntellis, which is a large bolt-on for our Strata platform that closed in Q3 of last year, and Procare, which closed at the end of February.  \n Regarding Procare, integration is going really well, and we're excited to work with [ Joe and Kinzel ] and her team to drive continued growth and innovation in the attractive early childhood education market. EBITDA was $676 million, which was 16% over prior year. EBITDA incremental margin of 44% translated into EBITDA margin of 40.2% and represented 60 basis points of expansion. This was fueled by gross margin expansion of 100 basis points to 70.3%.\n Our market-leading businesses compete on customer intimacy and deliver demonstrable value to their customers which we consistently realize in our high gross margin profile. Debt of $4.41 was above our guidance of $4.30 to $4.34. Importantly, free cash flow was strong at $513 million, up 15% over prior year and our trailing 12-month free cash flow surpassed $2 billion for the first time in Roper's history.  \n Looking over a 4-year horizon, revenue and EBITDA CAGRs are 13% on a quarterly basis. For free cash flow, we take a broader lens and a review on a trailing 12-month basis, which generated an 11% CAGR over this period. Adjusting for cash tax payments related to Section 174 which went into effect and impacted the period -- the current period's free cash flow by $80 million.  \n The normalized CAGR is 13% over this period. For 2024, we still expect free cash flow margins of 30% or more. With that, we can turn to Slide 7 to talk about our balance sheet. Following our Procare acquisition, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio came in at 2.9x at quarter end. Our revolver, which provides us with $3.5 billion of immediate liquidity was utilized to fund the Procare acquisition, bringing the drawn balance to $1.75 billion.  \n With strong, consistent cash generation and a well-positioned balance sheet, we have the capacity to deploy $4 billion or more towards high-quality acquisitions. And I'll reiterate our commitment to remain a solid investment-grade issuer as access to investment-grade capital markets is fundamental to Roper's strategy. In terms of what we're seeing in deal markets, our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is growing and quite attractive. As always, we will remain patient and disciplined in allocating capital to opportunities with highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.\n With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk through our segment detail and updated guidance. So Julian, it's -- like you said, it's about playing out as we expected, down low singles for the year. Not much change from our perspective last quarter. So yes, that's kind of the current guiding assumption. No, not really. I mean we feel good about our guidance being raised for the full year. And if you look -- we look back a quarter ago, our Q2 guidance is consistent with what we thought 90 days ago. So I think if you go back to like '21 and '22, we were actually flat Q1 to Q2 on like a segment EBITDA basis. And that's usually the normal motion for us. Last year, we did move up sequentially, but that was driven by some [indiscernible], there were some strong deliveries led by Verathon and then this year, Verathon is coming out strong out of the gate. So we don't have that dynamic this year. \n And then usually, AS steps down a little bit in earnings due to some Vertafore timing, but we didn't have that dynamic last year. So I think we feel good about sort of the progression from Q1 to Q2 on an operating basis. And in terms of the second half, we'll start to see the accretion of Procare with this -- it's got sequential growth throughout the year and then we'll have, of course, reduced interest expense as we pay down the revolver. So I feel pretty good about the progression going throughout 2024. Yes. I mean, obviously, we had a really strong Q1. So part of that is just carrying that through and a lot of that was at TEP and then we had some various small beats across software. So I think it's mainly what we saw in Q1 and then just the confidence that we're going to be able to sort of maintain our prior guidance for the out quarters. Yes. No, that's right. I mean we do have benefits and scale with some of the agreements with our large cloud service providers. So that's been beneficial for companies to do some experimentation at a very low cost. And then we're just allocating a lot of mind share towards that, so we can collectively get better. But in terms of like allocating capital that just hasn't been front-centered out. The company has a really compelling value proposition. We're always going to entertain that, but that's not what we're seeing today. Yes. At the macro level, we're a little over $900 million of maintenance today, maintenance revenue and if you go back maybe in the last 5 years, we've converted the base of maintenance probably like in the mid- to high single-digit area. So we still have a lot of room left, and we convert that maintenance revenue at 2 to 2.5x when we go to SaaS. And so that's kind of where we're at today. \n And there's a -- Neil can talk about the specific businesses. There's a handful of businesses that are transitioning. I'd say Aderant is one that's probably had the biggest migration over the last 3 or 4 years, which happened right at co -- that was an industry that was reluctant to move to the cloud and then all of a sudden, once a few firms when they all win. So they're right in the in the thick of things in terms of that cloud migration. But Neil, do you want to talk about some other. Yes. I mean I think it's playing out as we thought it would when we acquired it back in 2018, 2019 area, it's in the high single-digit plus range and maybe it tilt a little higher down the road. But that's sort of where it's tracking. And just Adam Boone was added to the team a month ago, and we're excited about him joining along with Pat. So we're excited about the process for our pipeline. Yes, sure. So we talked a little bit about MHA had a really strong quarter, and we think they're still -- they're going to continue to grow this year. But Q1 was especially strong as they had a contract renegotiations. So we got a little bit of a bump in organic growth in the first quarter. And then DAT & Loadlink, they'll continue to be down this year. And so maybe a touch lower than Q1. So that's what's driving the sort of low single digits throughout the rest of the year. No. I mean, I think it all plays out, Alex, in our products segment and our TEP segment over the first quarter, we just had a better compare and just the ramp that we had in Neptune last year, it's sort of the comps sort of normalize out in the balance of the year. So it's really just that. It's no more complicated than that. And so that's why Q1 was -- and that's -- when we came into the year, that's what we had indicated that Q1 was going to be the kind of the high mark in terms of organic unless things change in our assumptions."
