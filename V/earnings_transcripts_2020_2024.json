And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Hey, Mike, thank you and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our fiscal 2020 started off very strong and this COVID-19 spread across the globe, certainly, our business was impacted. As a result, we were quite thoughtful during the year, adjusting our expenses, yet we continue to invest in key initiatives to support and fuel growth. Let me share a few highlights from fiscal 2020 that will illustrate our continued momentum. Over $185 billion payment transactions and almost $9 trillion of payment volume were made on Visa credentials. Acceptance points grew 16% to nearly 70 million merchant locations and that only counts our partners like PayPal, Square and Stripe as one each. Contactless penetration grew to 43% of all face-to-face transactions around the world, 65% excluding the United States. U.S. tap-to-pay cards reached $255 million and globally, they were 23 countries that increased their penetration by 25 points or more over fiscal 2019. We expanded wallet partnerships which now represent over $2 billion in potential credentials and nearly 70 million additional potential acceptance location. Globally, the number of active credentials in e-commerce excluding travel rose 14% since January, reinforcing the continued shift by consumers online shopping. We renewed about 25% of our payments volume in fiscal 2020 with key clients and secured several new wins, over 50% of Visa volume has now been renewed over the last two years. We expanded tokenization globally crossing the 1.4 billion tokens milestone and enabling over 8,300 issuers across 192 markets. Visa Direct grew to nearly 3.5 billion transactions utilizing 16 card-based networks, 65 domestic ACHs scheme, 7 RTPs scheme, and 5 payment gateways. More than 5,000 client users accessed over 450,000 reports for our Visa Analytics platform, a powerful application suite that delivers data driven insights and industry benchmarks. And finally, several large acquirers leveraged CyberSource's robust omnicommerce payments offerings to support their merchant customers with innovative capabilities. With that backdrop, today I'd like to first discuss our results, then I'll highlight some key client wins in the quarter and client momentum from recent deals contributing to our current performance across our three growth levers: consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Lastly, I'll provide a very brief initial thoughts on 2021. To start, our fourth quarter results, while the underlying business was in various stages of recovery, we saw the acceleration of cash digitization through debit, e-commerce and tap-to-pay and the penetration of new flows through Visa Direct. We also advanced our value-added services led by CyberSource, security and identity products, and our consulting. Payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volumes were all showed positive momentum exiting the quarter. From Q3 to Q4, payments volume improved 14 points, process transactions improved 16 points, and cross-border volume improved 5 points. Net revenues in fiscal fourth quarter were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 17% in constant dollars. The decrease in net revenue was approximately 11%, however, with service revenues recognized on a current quarter payments volume basis. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, a decrease of 23%. Given our strong ability to generate cash flow, we returned $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the fourth quarter. Now looking ahead, our strategic focus in 2021 remains the same. Accelerating our growth through consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all while fortifying the key foundation of our business model, our brand, security, technology and talent. In consumer payments, we've had success with traditional financial institutions, wallets and fintechs, as well as merchants. First, let me hone in on Europe, which is definitely been a key focus for us since the acquisition just over four years ago. Our first Visa client in Europe from 1974 Corner Banca in Switzerland renewed their credit relationship and extended into debit for the first time ever. In Denmark, Jyske Bank will migrate over 200,000 debit cards from a local card scheme to Visa in order to access Visa's risk, data and other value-added services. Last quarter, I spoke about our win of the UBS debit business and this quarter we also renewed the credit business as well. In the wallet space, Samsung Pay will put virtual Visa debit cards in all Samsung devices in Germany. For those issuers in Europe who want to offer a wallet solution to their customers without developing it themselves, we recently signed an agreement with the digital wallet company called Vipps. And wrapping up Europe with fintech progress, let me highlight global fintech Revolut, who chose us late last year to be their lead issuing partner. In 12 months, Revolut has issued nearly 7 million Visa credentials in over 34 markets with plan to expand more in the coming year. Let me now move to success with traditional FIs in other parts of the world. ING, one of the largest banks in Europe, recently expanded their long-term global partnership with Visa for their consumer and commercial cards in 12 countries across Europe, EMEA and Asia Pacific. In Asia Pacific, we renewed with one of the top five banks in China, Bank of Communications and we've strengthened our strategic partnership with Malaysia-based AmBank who will now become an exclusive Visa credit card issuer. In the United States, we recently won the inaugural debit card for markets by Goldman Sachs' digital checking account. With millions of customers, market has continues to create new products, create a full service digital bank and we're excited about the opportunity to help make checking with debit card functionality and attractive part of their growing product set. Also in the United States, we announced in the first quarter that we have secured the Venmo credit card and are pleased that it has started to rollout unlocking new ways for Venmo and its community of more than 60 million users to shop, share and split purchases, and our own custom automatic cash back everywhere Visa is accepted. Shopee, the leading e-commerce platform with a large user base in Southeast Asia and Taiwan is launching a Visa co-branded card across five Southeast Asian markets. And our traditional wins in the fourth quarter capped a successful year of renewals that went into effect with key partners, including Bank of America, Capital One, Barclays, Santander, [indiscernible] and Al Rajhi. Now let me turn to expanding access with digital wallets and FinTechs which are critical to growing credentials and acceptance globally. In the last 90 days, we signed multiple deals with digital wallets including Yandex in Russia, Wing in Cambodia, PAYCO in Korea, Naranja X in Argentina and Easypaisa in Pakistan. These wallets represent tens of millions of potential credentials. Our existing wallet relationships that continue to grow this year Rappi, Latin America's Super App with over 30 million users is now expanding into financial services with the new division Rappi Bank and it has chosen Visa as their exclusive network and payments provider. Rappi will leverage their deep knowledge in their existing nine markets to create new payment solutions that drive digital inclusion and cash digitization that not just for their users but also their [couriers] [ph], restaurant partners and small businesses. In Asia Pacific, in the last year, LINE Pay added one million credentials and now is approximately 3.5 million total Visa credentials across Taiwan and Japan. Our partnership with Paytm in India span both acquiring and issuing and this year the relationship resulted in approximately 80,000 incremental acceptance points and 1.4 million incremental credentials. We also see cash digitization opportunities with merchants providing payment services to their customers. Two to highlight from this quarter and they're both from Latin America. We're extending our partnership with Oxxo, the leading convenience chain with nearly 20,000 stores in Latin America as they establish a new FinTech arm. This business will exclusively issue Visa credentials in the Oxxo wallet and through their stores to further their reach of the under and unbanked. Visa also partnered with Natura and Company, the fourth largest beauty group in the world to enable financial and digital inclusion. Through a financial services platform, they're nearly 4 million direct selling consultant representatives in the region, who will be able to access a digital account of Visa credential and NAM NAM pass among other services. This progress in consumer payments is also prevalent in new flows as the pandemic is accelerating the migration to digital payments. Governments, merchants and consumers all seek fast, safe and secure ways to move money. Let's look at a few new flows, cross-border P2P is a Visa Direct use case with significant potential and we made meaningful progress this quarter. Ozone in Turkey plan to launch a global mobile remittance service in early 2021 for the underbanked and gig economy workers representing over a quarter of Turkey's 83 million population. In Russia, the VTB Bank, the second-largest bank in Russia with 15 million customers is utilizing Visa Direct for card-to-card transfers across 64 countries. Additionally, in Russia, KoronaPay, a leading remittance center - system, I'm sorry, will leverage Visa Direct for cross-border money movement. And TD Bank in Canada is offering their retail customers, our mobile platform for P2P with cross-border capability. Earned wage access and payroll or other use cases that are growing an important throughout the pandemic. This quarter, Wagestream the market leading earned wage access provider in Europe signed on to Visa Direct. Also in the two months, since with earned wage access U.S. provider Immediate launched Visa Direct as the payment option, the near real-time method is already accounting for 50% of Immediate's disbursements. And P&C in the U.S. is providing their commercial clients B2C disbursement solutions such as traditional payroll processing, another new flows with B2B which represents $120 trillion volume opportunity. On the card based, B2B front in the wake of COVID, we are seeing increased interest for digital payments including virtual cards. We are addressing this demand, by one, engaging with a broad range of issuers and partners, two, expanding into new verticals, and three, investing to streamline operations and enable acceptance. First, in terms of supporting issuance, Visa payables automation which enabled issuers to efficiently offer virtual cards to their corporate clients and sent back that said data back to the buyer to aid and reconciliation to an increase of issuers and partners in the platform by almost 50% in FY'20. Second, relative to expanding into new verticals, we are expanding partners and use cases for virtual cards beyond OTA. In Q4, we launched e-pay - we launched with e-pay in China to support a virtual card program involve OTA and education. We also announced the new set of solutions partnering with Stripe to enabled buyers to use virtual cards for payments and the initial user as a Citibank healthcare client. And third, investing to streamline operations and enable acceptance together with partners like Boost of FinTech focus and B2B payment acceptance. We are expanding commercial card adoption by streamlining the manual acceptance processes for suppliers enabling automated data reconciliation and offering flexible economics. And now let me turn to our third growth lever value-added services. Value-added services grew 15% in revenue in the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year, a testament to the resilience of this business as well as the demand from our clients for support. Often our value-added services are sold with a brand deal, but many times they're sold after or even on a standalone basis. Permanent TSB in Europe renew their credit and debit business earlier this year and subsequently signed an agreement with Visa to launch Visa transaction controls, which will provide a powerful convenient way for cardholders to track and manage all payments activity on enrolled accounts and tokens. In seller solutions, both merchants and acquirers of actively thought CyberSource's offering throughout the pandemic. CyberSource sales direct to merchant and also through robust and fast growing indirect channel with acquirers, who can leverage our platform to provide the latest digital capabilities in order to attract and maintain merchants. With that in mind, we are very pleased that Barclaycard, one of the largest acquirers in Europe will utilize CyberSource to support their merchant digital payment journeys, e-commerce and omni-channel requirements. We've also established relationships with acquirers in other regions. This quarter in SEMEA, we signed CyberSource deals with HBL the largest e-commerce acquirer in Pakistan, Equity Bank Group in sub-Saharan Africa and Bank of Abyssinia in Ethiopia. Before I close, a few words on the acquisition we announced yesterday. YellowPepper is a software company with a platform that we see as the universal adapted that allows clients to connect and scale new innovative capabilities without having to expend significant technology resources. Through a single API based connection issuers, processors and governments can access YellowPepper's rich set of APIs to initiate secure, real-time money movement transactions across a variety of payment rail using a simple alley like an email address or a phone number. For Visa, the acquisition extends to our network of network strategy by significantly reducing the time to market and cost for issuers and processers regardless of who owns or operates the payment rails. It supports our financial institutions in their quest to modernize the infrastructure and access network agnostic solutions and facilitate an easier - and it facilitates an easier integration to Visa Direct and Visa B2B Connect, which will help to grow new flows and transactions. It enables the further adoptions of value-added services both hours of Visa's as well as YellowPepper's. We're excited about the deal and we expect to close it in the next few weeks. In terms of Plaid, I want to say two things. First, we continue to engage with the Department of Justice on the review of the acquisition. Second, the Department of Justice's lawsuit yesterday against Visa and Bain & Company is related to a dispute over documents they requested as part of the review of the deal. Beyond that, we're not going to comment further. To close, this pandemic has touched all of us. Through it all, I think my resilience of our clients who worked hard to be there for their customers despite the many obstacles. I also have to pay tribute to the more than 20,000 extraordinary people who work at Visa. My colleagues have demonstrated dedication, creativity and professionalism in the face of extraordinary challenges. In 2021, we remain committed to making the changes necessary to ensure our organization better reflects the world in which we live and work. Visa is proud to lead, lend our support in the fight for racial and social justice within our four wall and beyond. In terms of 2021, Vasant will provide a good deal of detailed commentary. So let me just make a few brief points. In 2021, we'll continue to manage the business for the medium and long-term, we're recognizing the nearer term realities. This means: one, we will focus on the opportunities that are being accelerated by COVID-19. Two, we will continue to invest to grow our business and three, we will be thoughtful about controlling discretionary expenses. To be clear, while our business faces clear uncertainty we have too many attractive growth initiatives to pull back on the future. Our long-term strategy which recovered in depth just eight months ago at our Investor Day remains more relevant than ever. And I believe Visa has a tremendous opportunity to continue to trends, weaken transforming, secure, reliable and efficient money movement for everyone everywhere. With that, let me turn microphone over to Vasant Prabhu.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was the first quarter of recovery from the global shutdowns. I'll start with some high level observations on the trajectory of the recovery so far. First, the debit business has been the major beneficiary of the accelerated shift to e-commerce and the shift away from cash even for in-person transactions. In the U.S., debit is growing at twice the rate it was pre-COVID and international debit growth has stepped up from 11% to 13% pre-COVID to 17% in the fourth quarter. Debit stayed resilient through the shutdowns growing 8% in the U.S. in Q3, and declining only 3% in international markets. Debit growth was strong and stable through the fourth quarter. Second, credit was hit hard by the pandemic, declining 20% globally in Q3. However, credit has been recovering fast, exiting September, down only 5% in our major markets steady improvement through the quarter. Third, as economy is reopened, card present growth in major markets bounced back shortly from 44% decline in April to a 4% decline in September, a 40 point in recovery. Even as card present volume rebounded card-not-present growth remained robust. Card-not-present volume excluding travel grew 20% in April, 29% in May, and 33% in September. Consumers worldwide are sticking with habits formed during the shutdowns. Fourth, the cross-border recovery has been sluggish, since borders remains closed or there are significant impediments to crossing borders like quarantine and other such restrictions. From May through August, cross-border volumes were persistently down in the mid 40% range. September saw a 6 points recovery, which has continued into October. This recovery was driven by a few corridors, where travel is now relatively friction-less, like travel from the U.S. to Mexico and the Caribbean. Travel from and to the Persian Gulf States and travel to Turkey. The sharp recovery in these corridors provide some early indicators for how cross-border travel may recover and borders duly opened. And finally, the recovery so far has been uneven. V-shaped for domestic volumes, but L-shaped for cross-border volumes. The cross-border business remains a significant and continued drag on revenue growth. As a result, net revenue declined 17% in the fourth quarter approximately 11% when you adjust for the service fee lag. This is 10 points better than a similarly adjusted third quarter driven primarily by the domestic rebound. Moving now to a review of our key business drivers. In Q4, U.S. payments volume was up over 7% with consistent growth through the quarter. October volumes through the 21st, are up 9%. Debit was up 24% in Q4 and up 22% in October. Credit declined 7% improving through the quarter. In October, through the 21st, credit is declining 3%. Card-not-present volume excluding travel continue to grow over 30% in the quarter even as card present spending improved almost 2019 levels in September. A quick review of the recovery trend across spend categories in the U.S. As we did last quarter, we have three groups each accounting for about a third of our volume. The first group includes categories such as food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. These categories have consistently grown after above the pre-COVID growth rates in the high teens or even higher every week since mid-April. Through Q4, growth remained strong and stable. The second group includes categories such as automotive, retail services, department and apparel stores, which drop between 10% to 50% in April and have recovered to growth by the end of June. In the fourth quarter, these categories steadily improved and are generally back to pre-COVID growth rates. The third group includes categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic, travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants. These categories declined over 50% in April, improved 20 to 45 points through the third quarter, and adopt at least another 10 points with steady improvement every month. Travel is still declining over 40% in September, with the largest improvement so far in car rentals and travel services. Fuel is also still negative but recovered 20 points since June, driven both by gallons purchase and higher prices. Restaurant spending is almost back to 2019 levels. International payments volume grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 5% excluding China. A few regional highlights, SEMA remains our best performing region, growing 15% in constant dollars in the quarter, a 20 point improvement over Q3. The combination of easing COVID restrictions and client wins drove the strong growth. Europe improved 19 points over last quarter growing 9% in constant dollars, growth was strongest in the UK as well as Central and Eastern Europe. Fourth quarter growth in Europe benefited from UK cardholders utilizing their Visa credentials to move money into higher interest-bearing saving the funds. This is not expected to continue growing forward. Latin America also improved 19 points, growing 6% in constant dollars. Brazil spend growth was positive in the quarter, fueled by a steady recovery in face-to-face spending, very high e-commerce spending and client wins. Asia-Pacific declined 10% in constant dollars in Q4 or declined 4% excluding China, and a 11 point improvement since last quarter. China continues to be impacted by the run-off of dual branded cards that have a little revenue impact. There were more COVID-related restrictions in effect across Asia and other parts of the world. Korea, New Zealand are the exceptions, where spending is already above 2019 levels. Process transactions turned positive in the quarter, up 3% improving each month as a result of the domestic spending recovery. As you know, transaction sizes increased at the height of the pandemic, but customer behavior is starting to normalize. Process transactions growth in October through the 21st is 4% globally. Constant dollar cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe declined 41% in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we did start to see some improvement in September and through October led by card present spending in the few corridors, where there is less friction at the border. Cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe through October 21st declined 37%. Constant dollar cross-border volume including volume within Europe declined 29% in the quarter. It's important to remember that cross border volume, excluding volume within Europe drives our international fees. The trajectory of the recovery, where borders are now open provide some indication of how fast the cross-border business could rebound once most borders reopen. For example, travel from the U.S. to Mexico saw 40 point recovery from the trough in April through July, and the trend continue through the quarter. This corridor actually grew over 20% in constant dollars in September and October. Travel to Turkey, which opened in early August, improved almost 30 points in August itself and remained at that level in September. However, at this point borders remain largely closed. The World Tourism Organization reported in September that out of 217 countries, 161 countries or 74% still had complete or partial closure of their borders to foreign visitors. Of the remaining 56 countries, the majority are mandating COVID tests with quarantine. There are very few countries with no COVID restrictions. As a result, travel related spending remains depressed declining in the mid- to high-60s in Q4 and through October. Growth in cross-border e-commerce spend excluding travel and inter Europe volume has been consistently in the mid to high teens since mid-April, led by retail spending. Moving to fourth quarter financial results. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenues declined 17% on a nominal and constant dollar basis. Adjusted for the service fee lag, net revenues were down approximately 11%, a 10 point improvement from a similarly adjusted third quarter. This improvement was driven largely by the domestic spending recovery. Service revenues were down 13% driven by the 12% decline in nominal payments volume from the prior quarter. Data processing grew 4% with strong value-added services growth offset by the mix shifting the way from higher yielding cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 38% a few points better than cross-border volumes excluding inter-Europe due to some country mix and currency volatility benefits. Other revenues grew 5% led by value-added services but continue to be negatively impacted by declines in the usage of travel related card benefits and marketing services for clients. Overall, value-added services revenue grew 15% for the fourth quarter. Client incentives were 25% of gross revenues. This step up in the percentage was due to the revenue mix shift away from cross-border and the service fee lag, as well as the impacts of very significant renewal activity in this year. Client incentives were a little better than expected due to some deal timing and performance adjustments. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses declined 4% as expected, primarily driven by professional fees, G&A and marketing expenses. These expense reductions were achieved while sustaining investments in our longer term growth initiatives. Non-GAAP, non-operating expense was $126 million for the fiscal fourth quarter. Interest income fell through the quarter due to lower interest rates. Interest expense was higher from the August and April debt issuance. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.3%. GAAP EPS fell 28%, excluding special items non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, a decrease of 23%. On the fourth anniversary of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we had our first mandatory relieves assessment for the preferred B and C stock and released approximately $7.3 billion, giving preferred B and C shareholders the opportunity to sell these shares. This did not affect the fully diluted share count. A quick summary of fiscal year 2020 results. Payments volume increased 2% in constant dollars. Processed transactions grew 2%. Cross-border volumes were down 22%, excluding volume within Europe and 16% including Europe on a constant dollar basis. For the full year, net revenues decreased 4% in constant dollars. Client incentives were 23.4% of gross revenues. Operating expenses were down 3% on a GAAP basis and up 1% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP EPS decreased 8% while non-GAAP EPS of $5.04 was down 7% or 6% in constant dollars. The return $10.8 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 44.2 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $183.30 or $8.1 billion and by paying dividends of $2.7 billion. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2021, I'll start with a few general observations. Fiscal year 2020 with the year of two very distinct harms. The first quarter of fiscal year '20 had no COVID impact, net revenues grew almost 10%. Second quarter net revenues grew 6.6% with the COVID impact on our reported numbers mitigated by the quarter lag in service fees. In sharp contrast, net revenues dropped 17% in the second half. As we look ahead, it is important to remember that the first half of fiscal year '21 will lap relatively normal first half of fiscal year '20. Another important factor to highlight is the nature of the recovery we've had so far. Helped by the accelerated shift to e-commerce and the shift to digital payments, even in face-to-face transactions, the domestic business has experienced a V-shape recovery. Process transactions have largely tracked domestic payments volume growth with some impact from the mix shift to higher tickets, which appears to be normalizing. On the other hand, borders remain largely closed, or cross-border travel has significant friction in the form of quarantines or other requirements, resulting in a very slow recovery in cross-border travel. Also, the cross-border business comes at higher yields. This significant shift in mix is a drag on revenue growth, which will continue into fiscal year 2021 until the cross-border business recovers. Meanwhile, the pandemic is still with us. The environment remains uncertain. It is not possible to reliably forecast volume and revenue four quarters out. The significant uncertainties include the impact of spikes in COVID infections as we are seeing now, the timing reopening of borders, the easing of friction in crossing borders and its impact on cross-border travel recovery. The positive impact that improves therapeutics and a vaccine could have and all this. The timing and size of additional stimulus programs, the economic impact once various stimulus programs end. With that as context, I'll share a few perspective on fiscal year 2021 to try and be as helpful as we can be under the circumstances. On the revenue front, given how fiscal year 2020 played out, fiscal year 2021 we'll also be a year of two very different harms. Net revenue growth is expected to decline in the first half and rebound significantly in the second, with the highest growth in the fourth quarter. The level of the decline in the first half and the size of the recovery in the second will depend on how some of the unknowns I just enumerated play out. For example, this process transactions and cross-border travel - cross-border volume growth say at levels we have seen so far in October, through the first fiscal quarter, net revenue would be down in the high-single to low double-digit range. This includes a 1 to 1.5 point negative impact from the service fee lag. Through fiscal year '21, we expect Visa Direct to continue its robust growth trajectory. We also expect to value-added services to continue to grow in the mid teens. There is little in new pricing in fiscal year '21 but some benefit from pricing we delayed and some carryover pricing from fiscal year '20. On client incentives, we finished the fourth quarter of fiscal year '20 at 25%. There are several factors that will impact client incentives in fiscal year '21. First mix, incentives are tied more to domestic volumes than they are to cross-border volumes. The current mix shift away from cross-border curse gross revenues and causes this ratio to increase. When the mix normalizes, this will push the ratio down again. Second performance, in fiscal year '20 with a sharp decline in volumes, many clients did not meet certain volumes thresholds. And as such, did not earn corresponding incentives. As volume recovers in fiscal year '21, we expect clients will take special and on these incentives, which causes a year-over-year increase unique to the year over recovery. Finally, the impact of renewals, as we have told you fiscal year '20 was another big year for client renewals. We renewed 25% of our volume during the year with another 15% to 20% likely renewed in fiscal year '21. Factoring all this in, we currently estimate that fiscal year '21 incentives as a percent of gross revenue could be in the 25.5% to 26.5% range. As always we've given you our best sense of the range at this point and will update you through the year as we learn more. First quarter incentives are likely to be at the lower end of the range. Moving to operating expenses, in fiscal year '20, we demonstrated our ability to modulate expenses and investments as circumstances change, balancing short term imperatives with long-term priorities. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 8% in the first half and declined 5% in the second. As Al indicated, we remain very bullish about the growth potential of our business and we'll invest accordingly. Visa Direct continues its robust growth, B2B Connect is ram ping, our value-added services growth is sustaining at mid-teens levels and our recent acquisitions required investments to scale. We will step up investment in all these areas and a few others such as the Tokyo Olympics. As a result, we plan to increase our level of investment through the year modulating as we learn more about the trajectory of the recovery. Our current plan is for expenses to be down in the first quarter, in line with second half fiscal year '20 trends. Expenses are expected to grow in the mid-single digits in the second quarter as we begin to lap the expense pullbacks from the last fiscal year. At this point, we plan on double-digit expense growth in the second half, in part due to the Olympics. However, we will adjust our plans as needed and update you as the year progresses. We expect non-operating expense to average $145 million to $150 million each quarter in fiscal year '21 for two primary reasons. First, low and even negative interest rates on our cash balances, and two, our $4 billion in additional debt after we pay off our December bond maturities. Our fiscal year '21 tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range. It is too early to predict what impact the U.S. elections will have on our taxes. As always, we will provide updates if any to our tax rate expectations as the year progresses. Capital spending in fiscal year '21 is likely to be around $700 million. We expect to return most of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Our Board of Directors has authorized an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.32, starting in the first quarter of fiscal year '21. Then the flat transaction closes, we will let you know what is impact on FY '21 will be. In summary, as we've done in fiscal year 2020, we will stay flexible and agile as we work through the pandemic. As you heard from Al, the opportunity ahead is lost. The shift to e-commerce and away from cash is accelerating. Use cases for new payment flows are proliferating and ramping. Our value-added services business continues to grow at a healthy clip. We remain as optimistic about our future, as we were at our Investor Day in February, which now seems like a lifetime ago. Our strategy remains unchanged and in fiscal year '21, we will continue to prioritize and invest in our key growth initiatives. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Vasant. We will run a little long in order to ensure we have enough time for questions. So with that, we're ready to get started, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Thank you for taking my question. YellowPepper, can you give us little more color you [technical difficulty] mentioned money with email or anything like that that you could highlight in terms of the advantages of YellowPepper? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: This is a company that we're quite familiar with, we invest - we were an early investor with them, we've been working with them, what they really are - they'll allow various players throughout, at least in the foreseeable future through Latin America being able to facilitate getting any kinds of - various kinds of services up and going very quickly by connecting to YellowPepper. And then YellowPepper taking over from there. And we think as the payments of money movement world continues to grow and diversify, having a software platform like YellowPepper that makes it easier for these connections to happen and gives us an on-ramp to sell value-added services and accommodate the needs of various clients to have network agnostic solutions that it's going to give us a good path towards accelerating both core payments as well as value-added services and new flows throughout Latin America. And then over time, we will look to extend the capability beyond that region.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line is open.\nBob Napoli: Just on the value-added services, I was hoping to get a little more color on kind of the mix of the revenue that could kind of break it out by - whatever reasonable products you could have done and if which of those products are growing the fastest [indiscernible] Visa Direct?\nAl Kelly: Well, Bob, thank you for the question. So first of all, we think of Visa Direct as a new flow not evaluated.\nBob Napoli: Okay. Sure.\nAl Kelly: So let me try to get a little more color. So about 2/3 of value-added services are platform type of services that are driven by transactions. And obviously, in this environment some of those have done quite well. CyberSource, where people are looking for omni-channel solutions, risk and fraud services, particularly as lot more transactions have gone online and people looking at things like 3-D Secure at 2.0 and our offering from CardinalCommerce and then issuer processing has done well given that what's happening with debit, as Vasant described in his remarks. About other the 1/3 - so that's about 2/3 of value-added services, the other 1/3 is kind of split between service revenue and other revenue. So in service revenue, you have card benefits, which are offered as a package. And then in other revenue you have services that are generally not tied to volumes, things like travel-related card benefits, marketing services, data and consulting and analytics. So you can imagine in that grouping, there are things that are struggling a little bit and other things that are accelerating. So travel-related card benefits are obviously very sluggish as our marketing services, but things like data and consulting and analytics are continuing to grow at a pretty robust levels. So that would be hopefully give you some color. I don't know, Vasant whether you want to add anything to that.\nVasant Prabhu: No. I think we're very pleased with how as Al said the platform-based services are growing those happen to be the ones that have the best margins and it's things like our fraud services, authentication, through CardinalCommerce as well as, as Al said CyberSource, clearly the growth of omni-commerce and certainly everybody - every merchant wanting to enhance the e-commerce business is very helpful to CyberSource, which as you know is a gateway for most e-commerce merchants. And then with debit doing well, the debit processing business. So those platform-services most of it show up in our data processing line from a revenue standpoint, particularly high growth right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: I just want to ask you about the strength in debit, obviously, even without stimulus the growth continues to be impressive well above 20%, especially in the U.S. and then obviously picking up internationally. How much of that is driven by this move towards contact with an e-comm and as we get into next year, does it cause a difficult comp, just because of the growth rate is so much higher than traditional or does this growth continue at these rates and maybe somewhat offset by a pickup in credit by the time we get to the second half of next year? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Bryan. I'd say, there is a number of drivers that what's happening with debit, certainly, I think an acceleration of cash displacement at the point of sale, where people are just concerned about cash being a carrier of germs, I see that, I think that trend continues. Certainly, a significant shift online purchases and mostly in everyday spend categories which kind of favors debit a bit. I think that's going to stay up a fairly healthy level. Thirdly, what we've learned in the past and it's being reinforced now is that in these uncertain economic times, people probably would prefer to spend the money they have been than they borrow the money and hence that's a positive driver for debit. And then Visa Direct, obviously, helps drive our debit performance as well. I expect that a lot of this positive momentum will continue, but I think there's no question that, if and let's hope it does, the world gets back to normal quicker than many would might predict, that a, you will see credit come back as - as more discretionary purchases and travel start to bounce back. And maybe some purchases start to move that are online maybe move back into the face-to-face world. But I think a lot of people have gotten very comfortable sitting out there, dining room table or in their home office, shopping on online on e-commerce. So I think a lot of these drivers of what we're seeing in debit over the last six months have some staying power to them.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I mean, I\u2019ll add a couple of things. And you can see it in some of the charts, we provided on the weekly trends. I think what's happening about debit, which as I said in my comments is the biggest beneficiary of the accelerated growth of e-commerce and the shift away from cash. The two things, we are seeing is that even this credit has recovered from declining 20% in April to exiting September down only about 5% I believe if I remember right, in the major markets. You see the credit line, the debit line has been very steady. It's been growing at the same rate without really being impacted by the recovery of credit and even as card present trends have improved you're seeing the debit line hold steady. So a lot of it has to be driven by the new cases, we are enabling a new payment flows through Visa Direct, as Al said. And also the fact that, there has been a true shift away from cash and most of it has gone to debit. Now clearly some of it is the stimulus payments and if you don't have them next year clearly some of that spending - may have been spending that may not sustained but that remains to be seen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I wanted to sort of follow-up on exactly what you were talking about, Vasant, obviously there is a recovery underway, but to the extent that stimulus isn't renewed and I know that means may or may not happen. And then you have - you're going into the winter months where it may be more difficult to travel or as such. Do you feel like that's a risk to the growth trajectory of the volumes and then just a clarification on the incentive guidance, the volume and support guidance. And does that include the numbers you gave an impact from the lag of the volumes that come back versus what you're paying out? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: I'm not sure fully understood your second question. But I will try to answer it. On the first one, as we said, we live in uncertain times and it's difficult to hazard guesses on what's going to happen when if there are spikes in infections. I would say, we are tracking it very closely, and there really two things to track, its spikes in infections and then what is the response from the government? To the extent that the response from the government is to impose restrictions and shutdown, then it does have effects on spending. If the response of the government is to largely keep things open then we see less of an impact. So it will be very different region by region and country by country, both linked to the infection rate as well as the governmental response. As it relates to travel, travel habits are changing, as you saw, I mean people can't go everywhere. So corridors that are open are getting more of the travel, which is why you saw the Caribbean and Mexico are actually growing in September and October. And normally September and October, after schools open tends to be a slowdown in travel in fact we are seeing travel continue, personnel travel continue into September and October in the corridors that are open. So what you may see in terms of travel is, people really being quite astute about where they can travel and as certain corridors open up, you start to see travel moving into those corridor that may have gone elsewhere. So it all makes it very difficult to make any hard predictions about what's going to happen next. As far as your incentives question, I wasn't sure what the question was, exactly, but we've tried to factor in everything we know right now, mix shift from cross-border, service fee lag, the renewals we already had and what we might expect to give you the best range we can. We will obviously give you an update as the year goes by.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: You called out a lot of new partnerships and agreements this quarter, Al, in your prepared remarks and I'm just wondering in the context of the pandemic, have the way you structured the agreement changed at all or incentive levels, less performance-based or is there any kind of changes that might have an impact on the way incentives just kind of come in down the road in terms of how you're negotiating right now?\nAl Kelly: We will ramp - as a general, I'd say there really hasn't been a lot of change. I think that they've generally been fairly similar. I think that for the most part, I think most - as you know, most of these deals are five, seven, sub-type longer years in duration and I think almost everybody thinks that we're looking at a kind of a once in a century-type of event here. The conversation, Sanjay, Vasant was just having we're not sure how long that really last, but we're certainly not looking for it to last through the duration of what these contracts are? I think that said, we're certainly thinking about the structure of deals and trying to determine where to tweak things here and there, but I wouldn't say that we've made any kind of radical changes to how we're restructuring the deals ramping.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: My question is about Europe, this 9.1% growth in Europe this quarter that is a very strong number stronger than it had been pre-pandemic. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on in Europe, are you starting to see the pay-off of the long-term effort there to invigorate that business after the Visa Europe trend transaction. I mean, are you seeing just really elevated cash displacement. What are some of the underlying dynamics in Europe? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Lisa, I'd got say a few things. First of all, this movement of funds into these higher yielding savings accounts, definitely it was a real factor and that's not going to repeat itself, but not beyond that I think that you are seeing - be seen the beginnings of traction of a number of FinTech deals, I mentioned Revolut in my remarks, but Lydia and France comes to mind in and out, the FinTech in Turkey comes to mind that are really starting to scale up in terms of their relationship with Visa. I also think that we've had a pretty good track record of deepening some of our existing businesses and that we renewed as well, I commented on a few of those but if we go back over the past numbers of earnings calls commented on others. And I have made the point that, I think that I believe over the last five or six quarters that Europe has made a lot of progress in terms of relationship build they just going to take time to show up in the numbers, because they're either doing a start-up or you're doing a shift-in with the client and both of those just simply take time and they take time to ramp to get credentials out and then they take time to those credentials to ramp in terms of volume. The other thing, I would say is that open banking continues to be a strength for us in Europe, and we're having good success selling our value-added services, particularly, I commented in, Dan's or somebody else's question earlier, some of our products from CardinalCommerce as well as our 3D Secure products. So I think the beginnings of some of the success that we think we've been having over the last five or six quarters, plus this kind of one-time deal where people move money via their debit cards into these high yield savings accounts, and we'll see what happens, Lisa. Today, you probably saw our both France and Germany announced going into some form of partial lock-downs, again. So that's obviously not very positive news B2B driving volume across the continent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: I just wanted to follow backup again around the notion of cross-border volume is going to ex inter-Europe is probably going to drag on for a bit. And so what I'm trying to understand, are going to reconcile a little bit here is the specific opportunities that you might be pursuing, maybe more behind the scenes in order to offset some loss revenue and lost profits. So rather than kind of a very large drop list of products and opportunities. I'm thinking of things like increased authorization rates now that you have a lot more e-commerce cross-border that's happening and that's opening up the funnel for merchants. Are you able to offset some of those lost profit dollars as a result of those types of things? And then how prominently is CyberSource playing in that regard. Thanks\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I mean, we are clearly focused on all that, increasing authorization rates in particular corridors big priority, increasing activation of cards that can be used for cross-border critical priority. The growth of non-travel cross-border business big priority, cross-border business for new use cases that Al highlighted through Visa Direct like remittances, cross-border business with B2B Connect, all those are revenue streams that are new and very exciting and growing well, it's a big year in '21 to lay the groundwork for YellowPepper to scale. We have signed up a lot of clients. The volume is ramping, we're spending quite a bit of time and effort to ensure that the YellowPepper platform can scale and a lot of that will be cross-border flows not necessarily for consumer payments for but a whole range of other use cases. So there is a variety of non-specifically travel related cross-border use cases that are happening right now that we are very excited about and then we're doing as you said, the sort of the bread and butter stuff of improving authorization rates reducing fraud and all the things that would make people more willing to approve more cross-border transactions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Al, I was thinking about your answer to Lisa's question and I'm curious if you can shift into another gear and win more business in Europe with open banking and the digital shift there, I guess, how could you expand that to other regions as well. But I'm thinking about Europe, given the open banking dynamics?\nAl Kelly: I, certainly, hope so Tien-Tsin. We are very, very focused on it. I think we've talked about in the past. I mean, we really feel like we've been in the last year, 15 months really on our fund footing in Europe. We've got a really good win rate on FinTech's. We're having lots of really good discussions with banks about open banking in addition to the things I mentioned, we've got our Visa trusted listing, which allows customers to identify merchants that they trust, which will help users meet regulatory requirement and have a much better user experience for the customer. We've got the Visa delegated authentication which issuers' delegate authentication to merchant or digital wallets, which also reduces friction at the point of check out. So a lot of these discussions have gone very well and I think that people, who are clients, and potential clients are viewing us as being very supportive of what they have to do to deal with open banking downstream. So I believe that our momentum is good and you're going to continue to see it in our numbers.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Just a quick follow-up if you don't mind. And then some of the wins, you guys have had like Venmo and you talked about Revolut, pretty innovative including in the reward side of things like Venmo. I'm curious, if you'd also that you could see a little bit more of is this become available thinking about travel cards and some of the more traditional travel rewards might have less utility here during the pandemic, are you seeing that. Is that an area of focus perhaps?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think, issuers around the world are dialing back on their spending and their acquisition on travel related card at this point in looking at all alternatives. And even here in the United States obviously, I think you've seen a lot more activity on things like cash back than you are on travel co-brand. So I think in the near term that's going to be the case. I think though as travel returns, which I happen to be optimistic that it well, beside basically describe how I see it, which is that travel is for all intensive purposes, it shut for consumers. It's not that you are even having a choice of to travel or not to travel in most cases. It's so much of a hassle that right now that you just don't. It is not a good experience. And I think as travel can reopen. I think that people wanting to see the world and see family and friends and knock places off their bucket lists et cetera, it will start to come back and at that time, I think people will go back to promoting the travel elements of their card or the benefits of the card, as well as you'll see more attention paid back on the travel-related co-brand cards.\nVasant Prabhu: A couple of focus on it, let's say, bright spots from some of the early indication there is, as you know, the bulk of the cross-border business we have that's card present and the bulk of our cross-border travel is based on personal travel and that's an important one to note and that clearly seems evidence of pent-up demand because anytime a corridor opens up we shared the example of Turkey, there is a maximum pickup, there are more Americans traveling to Turkey now than they did last year by a significant amount, because they realize that's one place they can go. We've seen that from other parts of the world that are open like travel in and out of Dubai. So we're seeing a lot of travel from Europe into the UAE for example. So what we're seeing is there is pent-up demand the corridors, which are very few right now that are open are getting a lot of it and as corridor start to open you will see different travel pattern when you pre-COVID but I just seem to be a lot of desire to travel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg for from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: I know back at the Analyst Day, which I agree with you, Vasant, it feels a very long time ago. It's been a lot of time on B2B and I wanted to see now that we're six plus months into the pandemic, I mean, is COVID catalyzing accelerated growth in B2B for Visa. And if so, are there some supporting data points you might be able to share on that front?\nAl Kelly: So I'll start, Jason and Vasant can add. I would say that commercial B2B volume in the carded space is running pretty close to where you see consumer credit. So it's definitely has been hit and as the line - its growth has been, as I said fairly close to the credit line that said we've continued to invest heavily and trying to promote virtual cards is more digital spending is going to take place in the B2B arena and we're continuing to build out and invest in building out the B2B Connect network were up and have the capability up and going in 80 countries, we're looking to expand for the next 30 countries over the next year plus. And so we haven't really taken our investment dollars on building for the future, down much at all in this area, but there's no question, the volume has been impacted by lots of people curtailing their spending and lots of employees around the world working from home.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I mean just a little more color on the B2B side and the - as Al said in the card-based part of the business, we're seeing the small business side recover nicely. The large and medium-size side is the one that is still somewhat sluggish. We don't have a big travel related component in our card-based B2B business. On B2B Connect, we continue to build a nodes, lot of interest and we have some big new clients that will be ramping and hopefully, we can tell you more about that in the next few quarters. And then in the very large AR/AP business, there continues to be interest. We are very focused on trying to figure out the use cases that have traction and how we create value, but I wouldn't say that there is any dramatic shift, it remains the category of people are trying to figure out a way to create value there. So we'll again tell you more as things develop.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: We've seen obviously this uplift in the CMP transactions both online and even offline similar with contactless and I think we've been saying and I think you guys have said also there is - your technology can handle more of that market share than other local or PIN networks, given your investments. I guess first of all, can you just make sure - just verify that's true in your opinion. And then second of all, what kind of economic uplift is there from things like the CyberSource and fraud solutions you provide there. And then, Vasant, just a quick follow-up on the incentives comment you made about '21. You mentioned incentives I think 26% or so in fiscal '21, is that assume that cross-border does not - doesn't improve it all in fiscal '21? Are just stays basically October levels to get to that number. Thanks guys.\nVasant Prabhu: I mean what happens. I'll take the second part first. What happens to cross-border is anybody's guess, right. So we gave you a range of 25.5% to 26.5%. We have seen, let's say, a 6 point improvement from Q3 to Q4, from Q4, 41% down to where it's running in October is a 4 point improvement. So we've assumed some modest improvements through the year. So it's not saying that there is no improvement implied in there is some modest improvement. I think that's probably the best way to think about it, but it is a range, it's hard to estimate, we've giving you the best range. We will tell you more as the year goes by. And then your first question, and I'll now let Al take that.\nAl Kelly: So, I wasn't - in case of card-not-present, it's very, very good volume for us. As we - I think at Investor Day, we said that $0.15 in every dollar in the world. Today is, in face-to-face, it's spent on Visa Card in the card-not-present world. It's $0.43 on the dollar, simply because cash comes out of the picture. And obviously, as fraud has migrated more to online, as chip on card has depressed fraud in the face-to- face world that gives us an opportunity to work with issuers on driving down fraud by using various services and products that we can - we could provide and somebody alluded to it earlier, I mean it is still in the card-not-present world, still real opportunity to drive up authorization rates. I think it was, it was a question out relative to cross-border. And clearly, cross-border authorization rates and card-not-present are lower than authorization rates, domestically on card-not-present. But in both cases versus face-to-face, there is real opportunity to increase authorization levels to drive more volume. Darrin, you said something about contactless too, obviously that's in the face-to-face world and we continue to make, and we'll continue to make real progress there. I think COVID will help accelerate the pace in the United States which is the one market that has been much further behind, I think I said in my remarks that contactless transactions represents 43% of face-to-face and across the globe, 65% excluding the United States which gives you the magnitude of how far behind the U.S. is. I do think though that and maybe you meant Click-to-Pay, I do think Click-to-Pay will help as well, accelerate card-not-present as well, particularly for people who are - not card on file, but they are just logging on to buy for the first time and they're doing, they are being a guest. So I think that there is real opportunity for Click-to-Pay to help build a better user experience there. So we certainly remain really bullish and what can happen in the card-not-present world.\nMike Milotich: I would like to thank you for joining us today.

            "name": "Al Kelly",
            "content": "Hey, Mike, thank you and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our fiscal 2020 started off very strong and this COVID-19 spread across the globe, certainly, our business was impacted. As a result, we were quite thoughtful during the year, adjusting our expenses, yet we continue to invest in key initiatives to support and fuel growth. Let me share a few highlights from fiscal 2020 that will illustrate our continued momentum. Over $185 billion payment transactions and almost $9 trillion of payment volume were made on Visa credentials. Acceptance points grew 16% to nearly 70 million merchant locations and that only counts our partners like PayPal, Square and Stripe as one each. Contactless penetration grew to 43% of all face-to-face transactions around the world, 65% excluding the United States. U.S. tap-to-pay cards reached $255 million and globally, they were 23 countries that increased their penetration by 25 points or more over fiscal 2019. We expanded wallet partnerships which now represent over $2 billion in potential credentials and nearly 70 million additional potential acceptance location. Globally, the number of active credentials in e-commerce excluding travel rose 14% since January, reinforcing the continued shift by consumers online shopping. We renewed about 25% of our payments volume in fiscal 2020 with key clients and secured several new wins, over 50% of Visa volume has now been renewed over the last two years. We expanded tokenization globally crossing the 1.4 billion tokens milestone and enabling over 8,300 issuers across 192 markets. Visa Direct grew to nearly 3.5 billion transactions utilizing 16 card-based networks, 65 domestic ACHs scheme, 7 RTPs scheme, and 5 payment gateways. More than 5,000 client users accessed over 450,000 reports for our Visa Analytics platform, a powerful application suite that delivers data driven insights and industry benchmarks. And finally, several large acquirers leveraged CyberSource's robust omnicommerce payments offerings to support their merchant customers with innovative capabilities. With that backdrop, today I'd like to first discuss our results, then I'll highlight some key client wins in the quarter and client momentum from recent deals contributing to our current performance across our three growth levers: consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Lastly, I'll provide a very brief initial thoughts on 2021. To start, our fourth quarter results, while the underlying business was in various stages of recovery, we saw the acceleration of cash digitization through debit, e-commerce and tap-to-pay and the penetration of new flows through Visa Direct. We also advanced our value-added services led by CyberSource, security and identity products, and our consulting. Payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volumes were all showed positive momentum exiting the quarter. From Q3 to Q4, payments volume improved 14 points, process transactions improved 16 points, and cross-border volume improved 5 points. Net revenues in fiscal fourth quarter were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 17% in constant dollars. The decrease in net revenue was approximately 11%, however, with service revenues recognized on a current quarter payments volume basis. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, a decrease of 23%. Given our strong ability to generate cash flow, we returned $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the fourth quarter. Now looking ahead, our strategic focus in 2021 remains the same. Accelerating our growth through consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all while fortifying the key foundation of our business model, our brand, security, technology and talent. In consumer payments, we've had success with traditional financial institutions, wallets and fintechs, as well as merchants. First, let me hone in on Europe, which is definitely been a key focus for us since the acquisition just over four years ago. Our first Visa client in Europe from 1974 Corner Banca in Switzerland renewed their credit relationship and extended into debit for the first time ever. In Denmark, Jyske Bank will migrate over 200,000 debit cards from a local card scheme to Visa in order to access Visa's risk, data and other value-added services. Last quarter, I spoke about our win of the UBS debit business and this quarter we also renewed the credit business as well. In the wallet space, Samsung Pay will put virtual Visa debit cards in all Samsung devices in Germany. For those issuers in Europe who want to offer a wallet solution to their customers without developing it themselves, we recently signed an agreement with the digital wallet company called Vipps. And wrapping up Europe with fintech progress, let me highlight global fintech Revolut, who chose us late last year to be their lead issuing partner. In 12 months, Revolut has issued nearly 7 million Visa credentials in over 34 markets with plan to expand more in the coming year. Let me now move to success with traditional FIs in other parts of the world. ING, one of the largest banks in Europe, recently expanded their long-term global partnership with Visa for their consumer and commercial cards in 12 countries across Europe, EMEA and Asia Pacific. In Asia Pacific, we renewed with one of the top five banks in China, Bank of Communications and we've strengthened our strategic partnership with Malaysia-based AmBank who will now become an exclusive Visa credit card issuer. In the United States, we recently won the inaugural debit card for markets by Goldman Sachs' digital checking account. With millions of customers, market has continues to create new products, create a full service digital bank and we're excited about the opportunity to help make checking with debit card functionality and attractive part of their growing product set. Also in the United States, we announced in the first quarter that we have secured the Venmo credit card and are pleased that it has started to rollout unlocking new ways for Venmo and its community of more than 60 million users to shop, share and split purchases, and our own custom automatic cash back everywhere Visa is accepted. Shopee, the leading e-commerce platform with a large user base in Southeast Asia and Taiwan is launching a Visa co-branded card across five Southeast Asian markets. And our traditional wins in the fourth quarter capped a successful year of renewals that went into effect with key partners, including Bank of America, Capital One, Barclays, Santander, [indiscernible] and Al Rajhi. Now let me turn to expanding access with digital wallets and FinTechs which are critical to growing credentials and acceptance globally. In the last 90 days, we signed multiple deals with digital wallets including Yandex in Russia, Wing in Cambodia, PAYCO in Korea, Naranja X in Argentina and Easypaisa in Pakistan. These wallets represent tens of millions of potential credentials. Our existing wallet relationships that continue to grow this year Rappi, Latin America's Super App with over 30 million users is now expanding into financial services with the new division Rappi Bank and it has chosen Visa as their exclusive network and payments provider. Rappi will leverage their deep knowledge in their existing nine markets to create new payment solutions that drive digital inclusion and cash digitization that not just for their users but also their [couriers] [ph], restaurant partners and small businesses. In Asia Pacific, in the last year, LINE Pay added one million credentials and now is approximately 3.5 million total Visa credentials across Taiwan and Japan. Our partnership with Paytm in India span both acquiring and issuing and this year the relationship resulted in approximately 80,000 incremental acceptance points and 1.4 million incremental credentials. We also see cash digitization opportunities with merchants providing payment services to their customers. Two to highlight from this quarter and they're both from Latin America. We're extending our partnership with Oxxo, the leading convenience chain with nearly 20,000 stores in Latin America as they establish a new FinTech arm. This business will exclusively issue Visa credentials in the Oxxo wallet and through their stores to further their reach of the under and unbanked. Visa also partnered with Natura and Company, the fourth largest beauty group in the world to enable financial and digital inclusion. Through a financial services platform, they're nearly 4 million direct selling consultant representatives in the region, who will be able to access a digital account of Visa credential and NAM NAM pass among other services. This progress in consumer payments is also prevalent in new flows as the pandemic is accelerating the migration to digital payments. Governments, merchants and consumers all seek fast, safe and secure ways to move money. Let's look at a few new flows, cross-border P2P is a Visa Direct use case with significant potential and we made meaningful progress this quarter. Ozone in Turkey plan to launch a global mobile remittance service in early 2021 for the underbanked and gig economy workers representing over a quarter of Turkey's 83 million population. In Russia, the VTB Bank, the second-largest bank in Russia with 15 million customers is utilizing Visa Direct for card-to-card transfers across 64 countries. Additionally, in Russia, KoronaPay, a leading remittance center - system, I'm sorry, will leverage Visa Direct for cross-border money movement. And TD Bank in Canada is offering their retail customers, our mobile platform for P2P with cross-border capability. Earned wage access and payroll or other use cases that are growing an important throughout the pandemic. This quarter, Wagestream the market leading earned wage access provider in Europe signed on to Visa Direct. Also in the two months, since with earned wage access U.S. provider Immediate launched Visa Direct as the payment option, the near real-time method is already accounting for 50% of Immediate's disbursements. And P&C in the U.S. is providing their commercial clients B2C disbursement solutions such as traditional payroll processing, another new flows with B2B which represents $120 trillion volume opportunity. On the card based, B2B front in the wake of COVID, we are seeing increased interest for digital payments including virtual cards. We are addressing this demand, by one, engaging with a broad range of issuers and partners, two, expanding into new verticals, and three, investing to streamline operations and enable acceptance. First, in terms of supporting issuance, Visa payables automation which enabled issuers to efficiently offer virtual cards to their corporate clients and sent back that said data back to the buyer to aid and reconciliation to an increase of issuers and partners in the platform by almost 50% in FY'20. Second, relative to expanding into new verticals, we are expanding partners and use cases for virtual cards beyond OTA. In Q4, we launched e-pay - we launched with e-pay in China to support a virtual card program involve OTA and education. We also announced the new set of solutions partnering with Stripe to enabled buyers to use virtual cards for payments and the initial user as a Citibank healthcare client. And third, investing to streamline operations and enable acceptance together with partners like Boost of FinTech focus and B2B payment acceptance. We are expanding commercial card adoption by streamlining the manual acceptance processes for suppliers enabling automated data reconciliation and offering flexible economics. And now let me turn to our third growth lever value-added services. Value-added services grew 15% in revenue in the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year, a testament to the resilience of this business as well as the demand from our clients for support. Often our value-added services are sold with a brand deal, but many times they're sold after or even on a standalone basis. Permanent TSB in Europe renew their credit and debit business earlier this year and subsequently signed an agreement with Visa to launch Visa transaction controls, which will provide a powerful convenient way for cardholders to track and manage all payments activity on enrolled accounts and tokens. In seller solutions, both merchants and acquirers of actively thought CyberSource's offering throughout the pandemic. CyberSource sales direct to merchant and also through robust and fast growing indirect channel with acquirers, who can leverage our platform to provide the latest digital capabilities in order to attract and maintain merchants. With that in mind, we are very pleased that Barclaycard, one of the largest acquirers in Europe will utilize CyberSource to support their merchant digital payment journeys, e-commerce and omni-channel requirements. We've also established relationships with acquirers in other regions. This quarter in SEMEA, we signed CyberSource deals with HBL the largest e-commerce acquirer in Pakistan, Equity Bank Group in sub-Saharan Africa and Bank of Abyssinia in Ethiopia. Before I close, a few words on the acquisition we announced yesterday. YellowPepper is a software company with a platform that we see as the universal adapted that allows clients to connect and scale new innovative capabilities without having to expend significant technology resources. Through a single API based connection issuers, processors and governments can access YellowPepper's rich set of APIs to initiate secure, real-time money movement transactions across a variety of payment rail using a simple alley like an email address or a phone number. For Visa, the acquisition extends to our network of network strategy by significantly reducing the time to market and cost for issuers and processers regardless of who owns or operates the payment rails. It supports our financial institutions in their quest to modernize the infrastructure and access network agnostic solutions and facilitate an easier - and it facilitates an easier integration to Visa Direct and Visa B2B Connect, which will help to grow new flows and transactions. It enables the further adoptions of value-added services both hours of Visa's as well as YellowPepper's. We're excited about the deal and we expect to close it in the next few weeks. In terms of Plaid, I want to say two things. First, we continue to engage with the Department of Justice on the review of the acquisition. Second, the Department of Justice's lawsuit yesterday against Visa and Bain & Company is related to a dispute over documents they requested as part of the review of the deal. Beyond that, we're not going to comment further. To close, this pandemic has touched all of us. Through it all, I think my resilience of our clients who worked hard to be there for their customers despite the many obstacles. I also have to pay tribute to the more than 20,000 extraordinary people who work at Visa. My colleagues have demonstrated dedication, creativity and professionalism in the face of extraordinary challenges. In 2021, we remain committed to making the changes necessary to ensure our organization better reflects the world in which we live and work. Visa is proud to lead, lend our support in the fight for racial and social justice within our four wall and beyond. In terms of 2021, Vasant will provide a good deal of detailed commentary. So let me just make a few brief points. In 2021, we'll continue to manage the business for the medium and long-term, we're recognizing the nearer term realities. This means: one, we will focus on the opportunities that are being accelerated by COVID-19. Two, we will continue to invest to grow our business and three, we will be thoughtful about controlling discretionary expenses. To be clear, while our business faces clear uncertainty we have too many attractive growth initiatives to pull back on the future. Our long-term strategy which recovered in depth just eight months ago at our Investor Day remains more relevant than ever. And I believe Visa has a tremendous opportunity to continue to trends, weaken transforming, secure, reliable and efficient money movement for everyone everywhere. With that, let me turn microphone over to Vasant Prabhu. This is a company that we're quite familiar with, we invest - we were an early investor with them, we've been working with them, what they really are - they'll allow various players throughout, at least in the foreseeable future through Latin America being able to facilitate getting any kinds of - various kinds of services up and going very quickly by connecting to YellowPepper. And then YellowPepper taking over from there. And we think as the payments of money movement world continues to grow and diversify, having a software platform like YellowPepper that makes it easier for these connections to happen and gives us an on-ramp to sell value-added services and accommodate the needs of various clients to have network agnostic solutions that it's going to give us a good path towards accelerating both core payments as well as value-added services and new flows throughout Latin America. And then over time, we will look to extend the capability beyond that region. Well, Bob, thank you for the question. So first of all, we think of Visa Direct as a new flow not evaluated. So let me try to get a little more color. So about 2/3 of value-added services are platform type of services that are driven by transactions. And obviously, in this environment some of those have done quite well. CyberSource, where people are looking for omni-channel solutions, risk and fraud services, particularly as lot more transactions have gone online and people looking at things like 3-D Secure at 2.0 and our offering from CardinalCommerce and then issuer processing has done well given that what's happening with debit, as Vasant described in his remarks. About other the 1/3 - so that's about 2/3 of value-added services, the other 1/3 is kind of split between service revenue and other revenue. So in service revenue, you have card benefits, which are offered as a package. And then in other revenue you have services that are generally not tied to volumes, things like travel-related card benefits, marketing services, data and consulting and analytics. So you can imagine in that grouping, there are things that are struggling a little bit and other things that are accelerating. So travel-related card benefits are obviously very sluggish as our marketing services, but things like data and consulting and analytics are continuing to grow at a pretty robust levels. So that would be hopefully give you some color. I don't know, Vasant whether you want to add anything to that. Thanks, Bryan. I'd say, there is a number of drivers that what's happening with debit, certainly, I think an acceleration of cash displacement at the point of sale, where people are just concerned about cash being a carrier of germs, I see that, I think that trend continues. Certainly, a significant shift online purchases and mostly in everyday spend categories which kind of favors debit a bit. I think that's going to stay up a fairly healthy level. Thirdly, what we've learned in the past and it's being reinforced now is that in these uncertain economic times, people probably would prefer to spend the money they have been than they borrow the money and hence that's a positive driver for debit. And then Visa Direct, obviously, helps drive our debit performance as well. I expect that a lot of this positive momentum will continue, but I think there's no question that, if and let's hope it does, the world gets back to normal quicker than many would might predict, that a, you will see credit come back as - as more discretionary purchases and travel start to bounce back. And maybe some purchases start to move that are online maybe move back into the face-to-face world. But I think a lot of people have gotten very comfortable sitting out there, dining room table or in their home office, shopping on online on e-commerce. So I think a lot of these drivers of what we're seeing in debit over the last six months have some staying power to them. We will ramp - as a general, I'd say there really hasn't been a lot of change. I think that they've generally been fairly similar. I think that for the most part, I think most - as you know, most of these deals are five, seven, sub-type longer years in duration and I think almost everybody thinks that we're looking at a kind of a once in a century-type of event here. The conversation, Sanjay, Vasant was just having we're not sure how long that really last, but we're certainly not looking for it to last through the duration of what these contracts are? I think that said, we're certainly thinking about the structure of deals and trying to determine where to tweak things here and there, but I wouldn't say that we've made any kind of radical changes to how we're restructuring the deals ramping. Lisa, I'd got say a few things. First of all, this movement of funds into these higher yielding savings accounts, definitely it was a real factor and that's not going to repeat itself, but not beyond that I think that you are seeing - be seen the beginnings of traction of a number of FinTech deals, I mentioned Revolut in my remarks, but Lydia and France comes to mind in and out, the FinTech in Turkey comes to mind that are really starting to scale up in terms of their relationship with Visa. I also think that we've had a pretty good track record of deepening some of our existing businesses and that we renewed as well, I commented on a few of those but if we go back over the past numbers of earnings calls commented on others. And I have made the point that, I think that I believe over the last five or six quarters that Europe has made a lot of progress in terms of relationship build they just going to take time to show up in the numbers, because they're either doing a start-up or you're doing a shift-in with the client and both of those just simply take time and they take time to ramp to get credentials out and then they take time to those credentials to ramp in terms of volume. The other thing, I would say is that open banking continues to be a strength for us in Europe, and we're having good success selling our value-added services, particularly, I commented in, Dan's or somebody else's question earlier, some of our products from CardinalCommerce as well as our 3D Secure products. So I think the beginnings of some of the success that we think we've been having over the last five or six quarters, plus this kind of one-time deal where people move money via their debit cards into these high yield savings accounts, and we'll see what happens, Lisa. Today, you probably saw our both France and Germany announced going into some form of partial lock-downs, again. So that's obviously not very positive news B2B driving volume across the continent. I, certainly, hope so Tien-Tsin. We are very, very focused on it. I think we've talked about in the past. I mean, we really feel like we've been in the last year, 15 months really on our fund footing in Europe. We've got a really good win rate on FinTech's. We're having lots of really good discussions with banks about open banking in addition to the things I mentioned, we've got our Visa trusted listing, which allows customers to identify merchants that they trust, which will help users meet regulatory requirement and have a much better user experience for the customer. We've got the Visa delegated authentication which issuers' delegate authentication to merchant or digital wallets, which also reduces friction at the point of check out. So a lot of these discussions have gone very well and I think that people, who are clients, and potential clients are viewing us as being very supportive of what they have to do to deal with open banking downstream. So I believe that our momentum is good and you're going to continue to see it in our numbers. Well, I think, issuers around the world are dialing back on their spending and their acquisition on travel related card at this point in looking at all alternatives. And even here in the United States obviously, I think you've seen a lot more activity on things like cash back than you are on travel co-brand. So I think in the near term that's going to be the case. I think though as travel returns, which I happen to be optimistic that it well, beside basically describe how I see it, which is that travel is for all intensive purposes, it shut for consumers. It's not that you are even having a choice of to travel or not to travel in most cases. It's so much of a hassle that right now that you just don't. It is not a good experience. And I think as travel can reopen. I think that people wanting to see the world and see family and friends and knock places off their bucket lists et cetera, it will start to come back and at that time, I think people will go back to promoting the travel elements of their card or the benefits of the card, as well as you'll see more attention paid back on the travel-related co-brand cards. So I'll start, Jason and Vasant can add. I would say that commercial B2B volume in the carded space is running pretty close to where you see consumer credit. So it's definitely has been hit and as the line - its growth has been, as I said fairly close to the credit line that said we've continued to invest heavily and trying to promote virtual cards is more digital spending is going to take place in the B2B arena and we're continuing to build out and invest in building out the B2B Connect network were up and have the capability up and going in 80 countries, we're looking to expand for the next 30 countries over the next year plus. And so we haven't really taken our investment dollars on building for the future, down much at all in this area, but there's no question, the volume has been impacted by lots of people curtailing their spending and lots of employees around the world working from home. So, I wasn't - in case of card-not-present, it's very, very good volume for us. As we - I think at Investor Day, we said that $0.15 in every dollar in the world. Today is, in face-to-face, it's spent on Visa Card in the card-not-present world. It's $0.43 on the dollar, simply because cash comes out of the picture. And obviously, as fraud has migrated more to online, as chip on card has depressed fraud in the face-to- face world that gives us an opportunity to work with issuers on driving down fraud by using various services and products that we can - we could provide and somebody alluded to it earlier, I mean it is still in the card-not-present world, still real opportunity to drive up authorization rates. I think it was, it was a question out relative to cross-border. And clearly, cross-border authorization rates and card-not-present are lower than authorization rates, domestically on card-not-present. But in both cases versus face-to-face, there is real opportunity to increase authorization levels to drive more volume. Darrin, you said something about contactless too, obviously that's in the face-to-face world and we continue to make, and we'll continue to make real progress there. I think COVID will help accelerate the pace in the United States which is the one market that has been much further behind, I think I said in my remarks that contactless transactions represents 43% of face-to-face and across the globe, 65% excluding the United States which gives you the magnitude of how far behind the U.S. is. I do think though that and maybe you meant Click-to-Pay, I do think Click-to-Pay will help as well, accelerate card-not-present as well, particularly for people who are - not card on file, but they are just logging on to buy for the first time and they're doing, they are being a guest. So I think that there is real opportunity for Click-to-Pay to help build a better user experience there. So we certainly remain really bullish and what can happen in the card-not-present world."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Vasant Prabhu",
            "content": "Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was the first quarter of recovery from the global shutdowns. I'll start with some high level observations on the trajectory of the recovery so far. First, the debit business has been the major beneficiary of the accelerated shift to e-commerce and the shift away from cash even for in-person transactions. In the U.S., debit is growing at twice the rate it was pre-COVID and international debit growth has stepped up from 11% to 13% pre-COVID to 17% in the fourth quarter. Debit stayed resilient through the shutdowns growing 8% in the U.S. in Q3, and declining only 3% in international markets. Debit growth was strong and stable through the fourth quarter. Second, credit was hit hard by the pandemic, declining 20% globally in Q3. However, credit has been recovering fast, exiting September, down only 5% in our major markets steady improvement through the quarter. Third, as economy is reopened, card present growth in major markets bounced back shortly from 44% decline in April to a 4% decline in September, a 40 point in recovery. Even as card present volume rebounded card-not-present growth remained robust. Card-not-present volume excluding travel grew 20% in April, 29% in May, and 33% in September. Consumers worldwide are sticking with habits formed during the shutdowns. Fourth, the cross-border recovery has been sluggish, since borders remains closed or there are significant impediments to crossing borders like quarantine and other such restrictions. From May through August, cross-border volumes were persistently down in the mid 40% range. September saw a 6 points recovery, which has continued into October. This recovery was driven by a few corridors, where travel is now relatively friction-less, like travel from the U.S. to Mexico and the Caribbean. Travel from and to the Persian Gulf States and travel to Turkey. The sharp recovery in these corridors provide some early indicators for how cross-border travel may recover and borders duly opened. And finally, the recovery so far has been uneven. V-shaped for domestic volumes, but L-shaped for cross-border volumes. The cross-border business remains a significant and continued drag on revenue growth. As a result, net revenue declined 17% in the fourth quarter approximately 11% when you adjust for the service fee lag. This is 10 points better than a similarly adjusted third quarter driven primarily by the domestic rebound. Moving now to a review of our key business drivers. In Q4, U.S. payments volume was up over 7% with consistent growth through the quarter. October volumes through the 21st, are up 9%. Debit was up 24% in Q4 and up 22% in October. Credit declined 7% improving through the quarter. In October, through the 21st, credit is declining 3%. Card-not-present volume excluding travel continue to grow over 30% in the quarter even as card present spending improved almost 2019 levels in September. A quick review of the recovery trend across spend categories in the U.S. As we did last quarter, we have three groups each accounting for about a third of our volume. The first group includes categories such as food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. These categories have consistently grown after above the pre-COVID growth rates in the high teens or even higher every week since mid-April. Through Q4, growth remained strong and stable. The second group includes categories such as automotive, retail services, department and apparel stores, which drop between 10% to 50% in April and have recovered to growth by the end of June. In the fourth quarter, these categories steadily improved and are generally back to pre-COVID growth rates. The third group includes categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic, travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants. These categories declined over 50% in April, improved 20 to 45 points through the third quarter, and adopt at least another 10 points with steady improvement every month. Travel is still declining over 40% in September, with the largest improvement so far in car rentals and travel services. Fuel is also still negative but recovered 20 points since June, driven both by gallons purchase and higher prices. Restaurant spending is almost back to 2019 levels. International payments volume grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 5% excluding China. A few regional highlights, SEMA remains our best performing region, growing 15% in constant dollars in the quarter, a 20 point improvement over Q3. The combination of easing COVID restrictions and client wins drove the strong growth. Europe improved 19 points over last quarter growing 9% in constant dollars, growth was strongest in the UK as well as Central and Eastern Europe. Fourth quarter growth in Europe benefited from UK cardholders utilizing their Visa credentials to move money into higher interest-bearing saving the funds. This is not expected to continue growing forward. Latin America also improved 19 points, growing 6% in constant dollars. Brazil spend growth was positive in the quarter, fueled by a steady recovery in face-to-face spending, very high e-commerce spending and client wins. Asia-Pacific declined 10% in constant dollars in Q4 or declined 4% excluding China, and a 11 point improvement since last quarter. China continues to be impacted by the run-off of dual branded cards that have a little revenue impact. There were more COVID-related restrictions in effect across Asia and other parts of the world. Korea, New Zealand are the exceptions, where spending is already above 2019 levels. Process transactions turned positive in the quarter, up 3% improving each month as a result of the domestic spending recovery. As you know, transaction sizes increased at the height of the pandemic, but customer behavior is starting to normalize. Process transactions growth in October through the 21st is 4% globally. Constant dollar cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe declined 41% in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we did start to see some improvement in September and through October led by card present spending in the few corridors, where there is less friction at the border. Cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe through October 21st declined 37%. Constant dollar cross-border volume including volume within Europe declined 29% in the quarter. It's important to remember that cross border volume, excluding volume within Europe drives our international fees. The trajectory of the recovery, where borders are now open provide some indication of how fast the cross-border business could rebound once most borders reopen. For example, travel from the U.S. to Mexico saw 40 point recovery from the trough in April through July, and the trend continue through the quarter. This corridor actually grew over 20% in constant dollars in September and October. Travel to Turkey, which opened in early August, improved almost 30 points in August itself and remained at that level in September. However, at this point borders remain largely closed. The World Tourism Organization reported in September that out of 217 countries, 161 countries or 74% still had complete or partial closure of their borders to foreign visitors. Of the remaining 56 countries, the majority are mandating COVID tests with quarantine. There are very few countries with no COVID restrictions. As a result, travel related spending remains depressed declining in the mid- to high-60s in Q4 and through October. Growth in cross-border e-commerce spend excluding travel and inter Europe volume has been consistently in the mid to high teens since mid-April, led by retail spending. Moving to fourth quarter financial results. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenues declined 17% on a nominal and constant dollar basis. Adjusted for the service fee lag, net revenues were down approximately 11%, a 10 point improvement from a similarly adjusted third quarter. This improvement was driven largely by the domestic spending recovery. Service revenues were down 13% driven by the 12% decline in nominal payments volume from the prior quarter. Data processing grew 4% with strong value-added services growth offset by the mix shifting the way from higher yielding cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 38% a few points better than cross-border volumes excluding inter-Europe due to some country mix and currency volatility benefits. Other revenues grew 5% led by value-added services but continue to be negatively impacted by declines in the usage of travel related card benefits and marketing services for clients. Overall, value-added services revenue grew 15% for the fourth quarter. Client incentives were 25% of gross revenues. This step up in the percentage was due to the revenue mix shift away from cross-border and the service fee lag, as well as the impacts of very significant renewal activity in this year. Client incentives were a little better than expected due to some deal timing and performance adjustments. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses declined 4% as expected, primarily driven by professional fees, G&A and marketing expenses. These expense reductions were achieved while sustaining investments in our longer term growth initiatives. Non-GAAP, non-operating expense was $126 million for the fiscal fourth quarter. Interest income fell through the quarter due to lower interest rates. Interest expense was higher from the August and April debt issuance. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.3%. GAAP EPS fell 28%, excluding special items non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, a decrease of 23%. On the fourth anniversary of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we had our first mandatory relieves assessment for the preferred B and C stock and released approximately $7.3 billion, giving preferred B and C shareholders the opportunity to sell these shares. This did not affect the fully diluted share count. A quick summary of fiscal year 2020 results. Payments volume increased 2% in constant dollars. Processed transactions grew 2%. Cross-border volumes were down 22%, excluding volume within Europe and 16% including Europe on a constant dollar basis. For the full year, net revenues decreased 4% in constant dollars. Client incentives were 23.4% of gross revenues. Operating expenses were down 3% on a GAAP basis and up 1% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP EPS decreased 8% while non-GAAP EPS of $5.04 was down 7% or 6% in constant dollars. The return $10.8 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 44.2 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $183.30 or $8.1 billion and by paying dividends of $2.7 billion. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2021, I'll start with a few general observations. Fiscal year 2020 with the year of two very distinct harms. The first quarter of fiscal year '20 had no COVID impact, net revenues grew almost 10%. Second quarter net revenues grew 6.6% with the COVID impact on our reported numbers mitigated by the quarter lag in service fees. In sharp contrast, net revenues dropped 17% in the second half. As we look ahead, it is important to remember that the first half of fiscal year '21 will lap relatively normal first half of fiscal year '20. Another important factor to highlight is the nature of the recovery we've had so far. Helped by the accelerated shift to e-commerce and the shift to digital payments, even in face-to-face transactions, the domestic business has experienced a V-shape recovery. Process transactions have largely tracked domestic payments volume growth with some impact from the mix shift to higher tickets, which appears to be normalizing. On the other hand, borders remain largely closed, or cross-border travel has significant friction in the form of quarantines or other requirements, resulting in a very slow recovery in cross-border travel. Also, the cross-border business comes at higher yields. This significant shift in mix is a drag on revenue growth, which will continue into fiscal year 2021 until the cross-border business recovers. Meanwhile, the pandemic is still with us. The environment remains uncertain. It is not possible to reliably forecast volume and revenue four quarters out. The significant uncertainties include the impact of spikes in COVID infections as we are seeing now, the timing reopening of borders, the easing of friction in crossing borders and its impact on cross-border travel recovery. The positive impact that improves therapeutics and a vaccine could have and all this. The timing and size of additional stimulus programs, the economic impact once various stimulus programs end. With that as context, I'll share a few perspective on fiscal year 2021 to try and be as helpful as we can be under the circumstances. On the revenue front, given how fiscal year 2020 played out, fiscal year 2021 we'll also be a year of two very different harms. Net revenue growth is expected to decline in the first half and rebound significantly in the second, with the highest growth in the fourth quarter. The level of the decline in the first half and the size of the recovery in the second will depend on how some of the unknowns I just enumerated play out. For example, this process transactions and cross-border travel - cross-border volume growth say at levels we have seen so far in October, through the first fiscal quarter, net revenue would be down in the high-single to low double-digit range. This includes a 1 to 1.5 point negative impact from the service fee lag. Through fiscal year '21, we expect Visa Direct to continue its robust growth trajectory. We also expect to value-added services to continue to grow in the mid teens. There is little in new pricing in fiscal year '21 but some benefit from pricing we delayed and some carryover pricing from fiscal year '20. On client incentives, we finished the fourth quarter of fiscal year '20 at 25%. There are several factors that will impact client incentives in fiscal year '21. First mix, incentives are tied more to domestic volumes than they are to cross-border volumes. The current mix shift away from cross-border curse gross revenues and causes this ratio to increase. When the mix normalizes, this will push the ratio down again. Second performance, in fiscal year '20 with a sharp decline in volumes, many clients did not meet certain volumes thresholds. And as such, did not earn corresponding incentives. As volume recovers in fiscal year '21, we expect clients will take special and on these incentives, which causes a year-over-year increase unique to the year over recovery. Finally, the impact of renewals, as we have told you fiscal year '20 was another big year for client renewals. We renewed 25% of our volume during the year with another 15% to 20% likely renewed in fiscal year '21. Factoring all this in, we currently estimate that fiscal year '21 incentives as a percent of gross revenue could be in the 25.5% to 26.5% range. As always we've given you our best sense of the range at this point and will update you through the year as we learn more. First quarter incentives are likely to be at the lower end of the range. Moving to operating expenses, in fiscal year '20, we demonstrated our ability to modulate expenses and investments as circumstances change, balancing short term imperatives with long-term priorities. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 8% in the first half and declined 5% in the second. As Al indicated, we remain very bullish about the growth potential of our business and we'll invest accordingly. Visa Direct continues its robust growth, B2B Connect is ram ping, our value-added services growth is sustaining at mid-teens levels and our recent acquisitions required investments to scale. We will step up investment in all these areas and a few others such as the Tokyo Olympics. As a result, we plan to increase our level of investment through the year modulating as we learn more about the trajectory of the recovery. Our current plan is for expenses to be down in the first quarter, in line with second half fiscal year '20 trends. Expenses are expected to grow in the mid-single digits in the second quarter as we begin to lap the expense pullbacks from the last fiscal year. At this point, we plan on double-digit expense growth in the second half, in part due to the Olympics. However, we will adjust our plans as needed and update you as the year progresses. We expect non-operating expense to average $145 million to $150 million each quarter in fiscal year '21 for two primary reasons. First, low and even negative interest rates on our cash balances, and two, our $4 billion in additional debt after we pay off our December bond maturities. Our fiscal year '21 tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range. It is too early to predict what impact the U.S. elections will have on our taxes. As always, we will provide updates if any to our tax rate expectations as the year progresses. Capital spending in fiscal year '21 is likely to be around $700 million. We expect to return most of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Our Board of Directors has authorized an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.32, starting in the first quarter of fiscal year '21. Then the flat transaction closes, we will let you know what is impact on FY '21 will be. In summary, as we've done in fiscal year 2020, we will stay flexible and agile as we work through the pandemic. As you heard from Al, the opportunity ahead is lost. The shift to e-commerce and away from cash is accelerating. Use cases for new payment flows are proliferating and ramping. Our value-added services business continues to grow at a healthy clip. We remain as optimistic about our future, as we were at our Investor Day in February, which now seems like a lifetime ago. Our strategy remains unchanged and in fiscal year '21, we will continue to prioritize and invest in our key growth initiatives. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike. No. I think we're very pleased with how as Al said the platform-based services are growing those happen to be the ones that have the best margins and it's things like our fraud services, authentication, through CardinalCommerce as well as, as Al said CyberSource, clearly the growth of omni-commerce and certainly everybody - every merchant wanting to enhance the e-commerce business is very helpful to CyberSource, which as you know is a gateway for most e-commerce merchants. And then with debit doing well, the debit processing business. So those platform-services most of it show up in our data processing line from a revenue standpoint, particularly high growth right now. Yes, I mean, I'll add a couple of things. And you can see it in some of the charts, we provided on the weekly trends. I think what's happening about debit, which as I said in my comments is the biggest beneficiary of the accelerated growth of e-commerce and the shift away from cash. The two things, we are seeing is that even this credit has recovered from declining 20% in April to exiting September down only about 5% I believe if I remember right, in the major markets. You see the credit line, the debit line has been very steady. It's been growing at the same rate without really being impacted by the recovery of credit and even as card present trends have improved you're seeing the debit line hold steady. So a lot of it has to be driven by the new cases, we are enabling a new payment flows through Visa Direct, as Al said. And also the fact that, there has been a true shift away from cash and most of it has gone to debit. Now clearly some of it is the stimulus payments and if you don't have them next year clearly some of that spending - may have been spending that may not sustained but that remains to be seen. I'm not sure fully understood your second question. But I will try to answer it. On the first one, as we said, we live in uncertain times and it's difficult to hazard guesses on what's going to happen when if there are spikes in infections. I would say, we are tracking it very closely, and there really two things to track, its spikes in infections and then what is the response from the government? To the extent that the response from the government is to impose restrictions and shutdown, then it does have effects on spending. If the response of the government is to largely keep things open then we see less of an impact. So it will be very different region by region and country by country, both linked to the infection rate as well as the governmental response. As it relates to travel, travel habits are changing, as you saw, I mean people can't go everywhere. So corridors that are open are getting more of the travel, which is why you saw the Caribbean and Mexico are actually growing in September and October. And normally September and October, after schools open tends to be a slowdown in travel in fact we are seeing travel continue, personnel travel continue into September and October in the corridors that are open. So what you may see in terms of travel is, people really being quite astute about where they can travel and as certain corridors open up, you start to see travel moving into those corridor that may have gone elsewhere. So it all makes it very difficult to make any hard predictions about what's going to happen next. As far as your incentives question, I wasn't sure what the question was, exactly, but we've tried to factor in everything we know right now, mix shift from cross-border, service fee lag, the renewals we already had and what we might expect to give you the best range we can. We will obviously give you an update as the year goes by. Yes, I mean, we are clearly focused on all that, increasing authorization rates in particular corridors big priority, increasing activation of cards that can be used for cross-border critical priority. The growth of non-travel cross-border business big priority, cross-border business for new use cases that Al highlighted through Visa Direct like remittances, cross-border business with B2B Connect, all those are revenue streams that are new and very exciting and growing well, it's a big year in '21 to lay the groundwork for YellowPepper to scale. We have signed up a lot of clients. The volume is ramping, we're spending quite a bit of time and effort to ensure that the YellowPepper platform can scale and a lot of that will be cross-border flows not necessarily for consumer payments for but a whole range of other use cases. So there is a variety of non-specifically travel related cross-border use cases that are happening right now that we are very excited about and then we're doing as you said, the sort of the bread and butter stuff of improving authorization rates reducing fraud and all the things that would make people more willing to approve more cross-border transactions. A couple of focus on it, let's say, bright spots from some of the early indication there is, as you know, the bulk of the cross-border business we have that's card present and the bulk of our cross-border travel is based on personal travel and that's an important one to note and that clearly seems evidence of pent-up demand because anytime a corridor opens up we shared the example of Turkey, there is a maximum pickup, there are more Americans traveling to Turkey now than they did last year by a significant amount, because they realize that's one place they can go. We've seen that from other parts of the world that are open like travel in and out of Dubai. So we're seeing a lot of travel from Europe into the UAE for example. So what we're seeing is there is pent-up demand the corridors, which are very few right now that are open are getting a lot of it and as corridor start to open you will see different travel pattern when you pre-COVID but I just seem to be a lot of desire to travel. Yes, I mean just a little more color on the B2B side and the - as Al said in the card-based part of the business, we're seeing the small business side recover nicely. The large and medium-size side is the one that is still somewhat sluggish. We don't have a big travel related component in our card-based B2B business. On B2B Connect, we continue to build a nodes, lot of interest and we have some big new clients that will be ramping and hopefully, we can tell you more about that in the next few quarters. And then in the very large AR/AP business, there continues to be interest. We are very focused on trying to figure out the use cases that have traction and how we create value, but I wouldn't say that there is any dramatic shift, it remains the category of people are trying to figure out a way to create value there. So we'll again tell you more as things develop. I mean what happens. I'll take the second part first. What happens to cross-border is anybody's guess, right. So we gave you a range of 25.5% to 26.5%. We have seen, let's say, a 6 point improvement from Q3 to Q4, from Q4, 41% down to where it's running in October is a 4 point improvement. So we've assumed some modest improvements through the year. So it's not saying that there is no improvement implied in there is some modest improvement. I think that's probably the best way to think about it, but it is a range, it's hard to estimate, we've giving you the best range. We will tell you more as the year goes by. And then your first question, and I'll now let Al take that."

Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Milotich, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's third -- fiscal third quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted to the IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and the reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Mike, thank you very much. The past few months certainly continue to be challenging and our focus has and will always remain on the well being of our employees, clients and the communities, in which we operate. Even with significant impacts to the economies around the world, many aspects of Visa's business have proven to be resilient and have continued -- and we've continued to invest to propel Visa's growth well into the future in consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Today after discussing our results, I will then provide an overview of the ways COVID-19 is shifting the way consumers, businesses and governments want to pay and be paid and in turn how Visa is helping them. I will close with some notable deal highlights for the quarter that demonstrate how we continue to enable the movement of money globally. So to start our third quarter results. Net revenues in the fiscal third quarter were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 17% or 16% in constant dollars. All of the business drivers were significantly impacted by the pandemic. Payments volume this quarter declined 10% globally or 9% excluding China. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, which drives our international transaction revenue declined 47% on a constant dollar basis, driven primarily by the lack of travel. Including intra-Europe volume was down 37%. We processed 30.7 billion transactions or over 337 million per day through the quarter on our network, a 13% decrease over the prior year. However, in each case, the business drivers improved each month throughout the quarter meaningfully for payments volume and processed transactions and only marginally for cross-border volume. In new flows, Visa Direct grew global transactions in the mid-60s year-over-year. And our value-added services revenue grew in the mid-teens year-over-year. We also effectively managed our expenses, which declined 5% but more importantly this was achieved without affecting investments in our primary growth initiatives. Our non-GAAP EPS declined 23%. While, COVID-19 certainly impacted our fiscal third quarter performance there are many trends that are accelerating the demand for consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, which will help our business as we look ahead. In consumer payments, even with all the success Visa has had electronifying payments, there is still $18 trillion transacted in cash and check globally. In today's environment, people are sensitive to touching surfaces, including cash and check and we are seeing this manifest in interest and usage in tap to pay, which we know helps digitize cash at the low ticket level and has historically increased transactions by an average of 20% over time in mature markets globally. From second quarter to third quarter, we had nearly 50 countries improve tap to pay penetration by more than five percentage points and over 10 countries increased by 10 percentage points or more. We have helped more than 55 countries to increase the tap to pay limits, reducing the share of transactions that require consumer contact by more than 40% in several of those countries. In the United States, we added more than 80 million contactless cards in the first six months of calendar year 2020 as a number of our financial institution partners accelerated their issuance schedules. Tap to pay is likely to accelerate post-COVID, especially as consumers start going back to the office where they tend to conduct smaller transactions for their commute, paying for public transit fares and buying food and drinks. Another positive trend has been the shift to e-commerce. This works in our favor because Visa's share of digital commerce where cash is not an option is approximately three times greater than the physical point of sale. In the United States, Visa credentials active in e-commerce excluding travel were over 12% higher in June than in January. In addition to the total spend per active credential also increased during that time by over 6%, which is notable considering new adopters typically spend less than those used to shopping online. In fact when you isolate the active credentials who tend to be more significantly engaged in e-commerce, the spend per active credential increased by over 25%. And these trends are not unique to the United States. During this period in the U.K., active e-commerce credentials increased 16% while spend per active credential increased 3%. In Brazil, active e-commerce credentials increased 11% while spend per active credential increased 12%. In markets where e-commerce is not as developed there are examples of dramatic changes in adoption. Argentina experienced active e-commerce card growth of over 100%, and Romania 70%. In new flows, we continued our focus on addressing the $185 trillion opportunity. In B2B, the opportunity is across card-based, accounts payable and receivable and cross-border payments. While B2B volume is down during this work from home and very limited travel period, we are continuing to build out our capabilities and relationships to fuel future growth. A couple of quick points from the quarter. We recently established a global partnership with U.K. fintech Conferma Pay which enables companies to provision virtual Visa commercial cards to employees' digital wallets enabling tap to pay and simplifying expense reimbursement. For our large-ticket cross-border B2B solution called Visa B2B Connect, we continue to build the network out. Many banks are in the implementation phase. And when they are all live by the end of the year, Visa will be processing cross-border transactions in half of the 80 markets where Visa's B2B Connect capability is available. Let's look at the remainder of new flows. In the United States, P2P is up almost 80%. And in Latin America, we saw progress with P2P apps in Peru where there was nearly a 400% increase in transactions in Q3 versus Q2. Visa is also excited to announce a global partnership with PayPal including its Venmo, Braintree, Zoom, iZettle and Hyperwallet brands. This is an extension of a long-standing regional partnership with PayPal. This new global agreement will allow PayPal and all of its brands to offer fast Visa Direct-enabled domestic and cross-border payments and expand PayPal's real-time transfer capabilities globally. In the gig economy food and grocery delivery category, we have seen a nearly 50% growth in transactions from pre-COVID levels and have continued to add new program launches such as Instacart for shopper earnings payouts in Canada. G2C government-to-consumer use cases are gaining momentum employing both Visa Direct and prepaid cards. This quarter let me highlight some of the card examples. In the U.S., the Treasury distributed nearly four million economic impact payments via Visa prepaid cards. We also worked with CaixaBank in Spain on three projects issuing 330,000 prepaid Visa cards with government-allocated funds to support vulnerable families across the region. In France, Natixis partnered with Visa to issue 15,000 cards as a thank you to frontline hospital workers financed by the government. In value-added services, we've seen more clients turn to us for help. As e-commerce has expanded and new sellers are looking to offer omnicommerce payment capabilities that are safe and secure our CyberSource and fraud and risk capabilities have seen growth. Let me name two recent examples. A recent win in Saudi Arabia with Al Rajhi Bank, the largest acquiring bank in the country will leverage CyberSource to enable e-commerce payments platform for all Saudi Arabian government services through a centralized interface with the country's Ministry of Finance. Buying online picking up in-store has become very popular among consumers and is a key way for sellers to operate in this environment. However, this use case does bring a higher potential for fraud. One home improvement partner chose Decision Manager a CyberSource fraud offering to quickly review online orders for fraud risk and meet customer expectations for a two-hour pickup. This resulted in a massive increase in Decision Manager transactions in May alone at this merchant. Across all CyberSource risk products in Q3 we saw a nearly 50% year-over-year growth in transactions. Interest also has grown in our authentication products. CardinalCommerce which provides network-agnostic products for sellers and issuers to leverage the 3D Secure standard has seen accelerated growth in transactions this quarter versus last year. 3D Secure is making steady progress in Europe as well where the ecosystem is ramping up in advance of the secure customer authentication mandate beginning in December for most of Europe. We continue to work with the ecosystem participants as the deadline approaches given that some are not ready for the deadline. EMV 3D Secure transactions in Q3 has grown over 100% compared to Q2. Data and consulting continue to be valuable to our clients as they navigate this environment. Clients utilized our consulting services at an accelerated rate with almost 60% more projects completed than the third quarter of last year. Visa plays a critical role in providing data and analysis to help clients manage their business through the pandemic. And the client activity on our Visa Analytics Platform increased 60% just from Q2 alone. Now let me talk to new deals where we made very good progress this quarter. First our momentum in Europe continues. We renewed with one of the largest banks in the Nordics, Nordea to grow debit portfolios across the region. We expanded our partnership with Permanent TSB, a large issuer in Ireland with over 800,000 cards in force making Visa the primary card in most wallets in Ireland. We recently extended our partnership with UBS in Switzerland to debit. And we're winning processing. In Spain, we secured a significant deal to expand our processing capabilities for domestic transactions. Banco Caminos will migrate their issuing and acquiring volumes from their local processor to Visa. Europe was certainly not the exception in developing and renewing partnerships this quarter. In Singapore, we renewed our partnership with the second-largest debit issuer OCBC Bank to remain the preferred debit card issued to OCBC Bank's personal savings and current account customers. In Korea, we recently secured a renewal with South Korea's biggest issuer Shinhan Card. We renewed our credit and debit partnership with Banco de Bogota, our largest issuer client in Colombia. We recently won started issuance with Kaspi Bank, one of the largest retail banks in Kazakhstan. The bank is moving 100% to Visa over the next few years. And our leadership position in co-brand also continued. This quarter Visa renewed and expanded its strategic partnership with Best Buy including extending the My Best Buy co-brand relationship. Ford and Visa will collaborate on Ford's new FordPass Rewards Visa Card available to their 4 million FordPass rewards members and other Ford customers. Another recent co-brand win was with Verizon to launch a Visa credit card that provide savings on Verizon's industry-leading products and services along with benefits for everyday and essential purposes. And we signed a co-brand deal with Tiki, one of the leading e-commerce platforms in Vietnam. A key component to building issuance and acceptance is with fintechs. And this quarter we secured many wallet and neobank wins globally. Let me name a few. Careem, the biggest ride-hailing app in the Middle East and Africa will offer driver payouts with Visa Direct as well as credentials to their over 35 million user base. Hong Kong's digital transit card Octopus will accept Visa wallet top-ups allowing commuters to pay for transport and to pay in 35,000 retail outlets. In Saudi Arabia, we signed a strategic partnership with Hala [ph] a rising challenger bank that has the potential to penetrate an unbanked population of up to 7 million people. Neobank Vivid Money announced its official launch in Germany offering Visa debit cards in an all-in-one mobile application including innovative savings and cash-back solutions. In the U.S., U.S.-based Chime with over 8 million accounts launched access to a new Visa secured credit card, which allows consumers to build credit while spending on everyday purchases like groceries and monthly subscriptions. As I've often said, partnerships are fundamental to Visa's business model and these renewals and new deals will certainly help drive growth into the future. Before I close, I would be remiss if not to comment on the race situation in this country and around the world. For four centuries Black and African-American women and men have experienced many forms of social injustice and discrimination. It is offensive. It is frustrating and it's unacceptable. It must stop. At Visa, we are committed to do our part. Visa recently announced the next steps in our journey to drive inclusion and diversity across our company. We've announced a number of actions including the establishment of a Visa scholars and jobs program. And very importantly, last week, we announced that we are committing to increasing the number of underrepresented U.S. vice presidents and above by 50% in the next three years and increasing the number of underrepresented U.S. colleagues within Visa overall by 50% in the next five years. So to close, while there is some uncertainty in the near term for sure, we remain confident about our long-term strategy and growth prospects and our ability to make a positive difference in the world. On one hand, net revenue, EPS overall payments volume, cross-border volume and process transactions declined this quarter. Yet we saw growth in debit and in e-commerce volumes in Visa Direct transactions, growth in tap to pay and click-to-pay enablement and value-added services revenue. Furthermore, we've demonstrated our discipline. We've been able to reduce expenses by 5% this quarter while still investing in future growth. And we returned capital to our shareholders at historic levels and retained our dividend. All of this speaks to the resiliency of our business model. We have the scale, a trusted brand, digital products financial levers and most importantly, a talented team to emerge from this pandemic even stronger. We remain confident in the efficacy of our global network of network strategy, as we enable the movement of money for everyone everywhere. Now for more detail, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al and good afternoon, everyone. As we did last quarter, we will provide a fair amount of color on the business trends we are seeing as we navigate through this unprecedented time. I'll begin with the key business drivers then review our financial results and close with some perspectives on the next quarter. Starting with U.S. payments volume. For the quarter U.S. payments volume declined 7%, a sharp decline from mid-April was followed by a V-shaped domestic spending recovery. Volumes declined 18% in April, before returning to positive territory in June. July volumes through the 21st are up 7%. This recovery was jump-started by the economic impact payments and enhanced unemployment benefits, helped along by pent-up demand fulfillment and accelerated by the relaxation of shelter in place requirements. Debit outperformed credit by almost 30 points. Debit spending was up 8% while credit spending declined 21% in the quarter. Credit spending recovered 21 points from a decline of 30% in April to a decline of 9% in July through the 21st. Debit spending bounced 30 points from down 5% in April to up 25% in July. The outperformance of debit versus credit is driven by several factors. Some of them are more likely to persist than others. First, the government's economic impact payments were directly deposited into consumers checking accounts benefiting debit. Second, in times of economic uncertainty, consumers have a propensity to shift spending from money they borrow to money they have in the bank. Third, as you know, there has been a significant shift to online purchases in almost every day almost every \u2013 in most everyday spend categories which favors debit. Fourth, affluent customers tend to use credit for discretionary spending in categories such as travel, entertainment and restaurants, which have been especially hard-hit by the pandemic. Fifth, the last tranche of economic impact payments as well as unemployment benefits in over 20 states were distributed via Visa prepaid cards, which lifted debit growth by several points in May and June. Finally, in the U.S. Visa Direct was up over 75% this quarter, due to strong growth in a variety of use cases ranging from P2P, to insurance payouts, to payroll. The significant growth in debit demonstrates the acceleration of the secular shift away from cash to digital forms of payment as a result of the pandemic. The COVID crisis has also significantly accelerated the secular shift to e-commerce. Card not present spend excluding travel has grown over 25% every week since mid-April, which is 2x the pre-COVID growth rate. Card present spending improved steadily through the quarter as reopenings went into effect from declining almost 50% in early April to declining in the high single-digits by late June, but there has been little improvement since. It is too early to tell what all the underlying causes of this recent stabilization are. Recovery trajectories for card present volumes are relatively similar across states. In terms of U.S. spend by category excluding Visa Direct, performance can be summarized in three groups based on COVID impact and the recovery we've seen to-date. Each group represents roughly a third of our U.S. payments volume. The first group includes categories, such as food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. These categories have consistently grown at or above their pre-COVID growth rates in the high teens or even higher every week since mid-April. The second group includes categories that experienced spend declines between 10% to 50% in April and had all recovered to growth by the end of June. These segments include automotive, retail services, department and apparel stores, health care, education, government and business supplies. The third group includes categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic: travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants. These categories declined over 50% in April and are still declining year-over-year, although, each improved by between 20 to 45 points during the quarter. Travel remains the most impacted category still down over 50%. Fuel gallons purchased are growing again, but spend is down more than 15% in July driven by lower prices. Within the restaurant category, card present spend is still declining, while card not present spend continues to grow significantly with quick-service restaurants outperforming. Moving on to trends in the rest of the world. International payments volume declined over 12% in constant dollars in the third quarter. Similar to the U.S., debit significantly outperformed credit with debit down only 3% and credit down 20%. Card present spend improved through the quarter, as countries reopened, while card not present excluding travel spend remained elevated. Performance across categories was broadly similar to the U.S. Our best performing region continues to be CEMEA, which declined 5% in constant dollars. Within CEMEA, Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia had positive growth in the quarter fueled by a rapid recovery after April declines as well as client wins. Europe payments volume declined 10% in constant dollars in the third quarter. Central and Southeastern Europe which include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary recovered rapidly to post positive growth in the quarter. The U.K. returned to growth in June, driven by consistently strong card not present growth. Italy is almost back to prior year levels in June following one of the strictest lockdowns within Europe. Canada declined 15% and Latin America declined 13% in constant dollars. Brazil spend decline early in the quarter was one of the shallowest, but the recovery has also been slow. Brazil is now back near 2019 levels of domestic spending fueled by strong card not present growth. Asia Pacific payments volume declined 16% in constant dollars. Reopening of the Asian economies has been gradual with multiple phases depending on the country. Two of the least impacted countries were Korea and New Zealand, both of which were close to flat in the quarter. Domestic spending in Japan and Australia was back to 2019 levels by late June. India remains one of the most impacted markets globally. Processed transactions declined 13% in the quarter. Although this lags volume growth due to a mix shift, the trajectory of the processed transactions recovery is similar improving from a 24% decline in April to a 4% decline in June. Growth in July through the 21st is flat. Domestically, the mix of spend has shifted from low ticket to higher ticket categories. Cross-border transactions on the other hand are holding up better than volumes due to the mix shift from high ticket travel-related spending to lower ticket non-travel e-commerce. Cross-border -- constant dollar cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe declined 47% in the third quarter. Volumes declined 51% in April and improved marginally in May to decline 45%, but there has been little -- since. For the month of June and in July through the 21st, the rate of decline has stayed at 44%. Constant dollar cross-border volume including volume within Europe declined 37% in the quarter. It's important to remind you that cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe drives our international fees. As you know, the cross-border spend decline is driven by travel. Travel-related spend, which includes both card present and card not present in travel categories represented roughly two-third of our pre-COVID cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe. Travel-related spend declined 78% in the quarter and was still declining over 70% at the end of June. To have a recovery in cross-border travel, you have to have a reopening of borders. At this point, borders remain largely closed. The World Tourism Organization reported at the end of June that out of 217 countries, 189 or 87% had completely or partially closed their borders to foreign visitors. Of the remaining 28 countries, 10 had completely or partially suspended flights. Several other countries like the U.K. require quarantines and the rest had imposed visa restrictions or demand medical certificates. As we speak, cross-border travel, especially by air is even not possible or very difficult. While no one corridor derives a large portion of our volumes -- drives a large portion of our volumes, some of our most important corridors remain closed. Borders have to reopen before we can get a sense of what the cross-border recovery trajectory might be. In the few corridors, where cross-border travel is now possible, we have seen some significant recoveries. For example Americans are traveling again to Mexico and the Caribbean. Since the April low, these corridors have seen cross-border card-present volumes recover by 30 to 40 points. Travel to and from Switzerland to France and Germany is almost back to normal. Russian travel to neighboring countries has picked up. Travel from Europe to the UAE is gaining momentum. It is important to note that the vast majority of cross-border travel spend is on personal cards and not for business travel. Consumer travel demand for visits to friends relatives and for vacations is more likely to remain intact post-COVID perhaps even enhanced. The consumer travel recovery is likely to start with people going to countries within their geographic zone of comfort. This is already evident as we look at short-haul cross-border travel which we define as less than 3,000 miles. Short-haul air travel is recovering faster than longer haul corridors. Similarly drive to hotels are doing better as are leisure hotels versus business hotels. Growth in cross-border e-commerce spend excluding travel has been consistently in the high teens to low 20s since mid-April. The strong growth is fueled by retail spending which is growing about 30% since mid-April and drives the majority of non-travel e-commerce spend. In most countries, we see that once a consumer decides to buy something online rather than go to a local store, there is a higher likelihood the purchase becomes cross-border with little regard to where the item is shipped from. The strength in retail is offset by declines in entertainment, education, and government some of which are tied to travel and represent a meaningful portion of card-not-present non-travel spend. Much of the color I just provided excludes volume within Europe. Within the EU, borders have largely reopened. Intra-Europe cross-border card-present spend is up 40 points from the trough in April through three weeks in July, another indication of the possible trajectory of the cross-border recovery when borders do reopen. A quick review of our third quarter financial results. Net revenues declined 17% in the quarter or 16% in constant dollars. Third quarter service revenues were flat with prior year and reflect last quarter's volumes. Data processing revenues declined 5% supported by strong value-added services growth as well as acquisition-related revenue. International transaction revenues decreased 44% in line with the decline in cross-border volumes excluding volume within Europe. Other revenues declined 8% over the prior year due to value-added services impacted by the pandemic. The value-added services impacted by the pandemic include lower use of travel-related card benefits, lower marketing-related services for clients as many slowed marketing activities, and fees we waived on certain services which surged at the outset of the pandemic. We should note that had we reported service fees without a lag our service fees would have declined 11% and reported net revenues would have dropped an additional 4.5 points to approximately 21.5%. These lower service fees will impact our reported revenues next quarter. Before I move on, let me provide some more detail on where value-added services revenues are captured in the P&L. In the third quarter, total value-added services revenue grew in the mid-teens including acquisitions. Approximately two-thirds of our value-added services revenues are included in data processing as many of them are transaction-based revenue streams. These value-added services grew in the mid-teens driven by the strength in U.S. debit and prepaid issuer processing, CyberSource, as well as authentication and fraud services as Al highlighted. The remaining value-added services revenue is split roughly evenly between service fees and other revenue. Value-added services and service fees also grew in the mid-teens. Value-added services recorded in other revenues grew in the mid-single -igits due to acquisitions, increased use of our data products, and consulting, offset by declines in the usage of card benefits and marketing services I described earlier. Client incentives declined 2% versus last year and were 23.8% of gross revenue. As we've indicated before, the vast majority of incentives are tied to payments volumes. However, incentives declined less than gross revenue pushing up incentives as a percent of gross revenue. Let me explain why. First, incentives are generally tied to total payments volumes and only selectively to cross-border volumes. As declines in cross-border volumes have been deeper than total payments volumes and cross-border volumes have higher yields, incentive declines lag gross revenue declines. Second, heavy renewal activity like we had in fiscal year 2019, causes incentives to grow faster than gross revenue. As a result, the decline in incentives lags gross revenue on the way down. Offsetting these factors to some degree is the service fee lag. As I mentioned earlier, service fee lag mitigated the gross revenue decline reported this quarter. This will impact us negatively next quarter. Third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses declined 5% as we were able to execute additional cost management initiatives, particularly in the areas of marketing and G&A. These expense reductions were achieved while sustaining investments in our longer-term growth initiatives. Acting early and decisively has helped us to reduce expenses fast. Non-GAAP non-operating expense was $118 million for the fiscal third quarter. Interest income was lower due to the sharp drop in interest rates. Interest expense was higher from our $4 billion debt issue. The non-GAAP tax rate was 19%.  Finally, some perspectives on the fourth quarter. Forecasting revenues remains a challenge in this environment. It is difficult to predict when borders will reopen and what the trajectory of the cross-border travel recovery will be post re-openings. Domestic volumes have bounced back nicely in most countries and inevitably the rate of recovery will slow. Other uncertainties include the impact of the recent spike in infections and the economic impact of stimulus payments tapering off or ending altogether around the world.  A few points to note as you model revenue growth for the next quarter. As I indicated earlier had we reported service revenues without a lag, third quarter net revenue would have declined an additional 4.5 points. This will cause fourth quarter reported net revenue growth to be lower than the third quarter absent the change in trend on key business drivers.  Continued recovery in domestic payments volumes and transactions will improve the data processing revenue trend, but not reported service revenues. This will be partially offset by higher incentives related to the increasing volumes. As such the most important variable that would improve the fourth quarter net revenue growth rate is cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe.  One other point to note driven by these turbulent times: if the cross-border recovery remains sluggish through the fourth quarter, the revenue mix shift away from cross-border will persist. Adding in the impact of the service fee lag, incentives as a percent of gross revenues are likely to increase by two to three points over the third quarter levels. This percentage should normalize as cross-border volumes improve and the domestic volume recovery stabilizes.  Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter are expected to decline roughly in line with the reductions we delivered in the third quarter. Non-GAAP non-operating expenses are expected to be around $140 million. Even with a significant COVID-19 impact, we expect to generate a very healthy level of free cash flow this year. We ended the quarter with over $17 billion of cash equivalents and investment securities on hand. With access to the commercial paper market on favorable terms and our $5 billion revolver our liquidity position remains strong.  In the third quarter, we bought back 5.2 million shares for almost $900 million at an average price of $180.47. Year-to-date, we bought back 36 million shares for $6.5 billion at an average price of approximately $180. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. Crises create both risks and opportunities. We have moved fast to mitigate risks by ensuring strong liquidity, reducing expenses while sustaining key growth investments and closely monitoring network performance, security, daily settlement, fraud and other key metrics. The crisis accelerated many favorable secular trends: the digitization of cash, the shift to e-commerce and the penetration of tap to pay.  Visa Direct momentum has remained very strong and value-added services have continued to grow in the mid-teens. Our focus remains on helping all our stakeholders, cardholders, clients, governments, regulators and of course, our own associates as they navigate through these unusual times.  With that I'll turn this back to Mike. \nAl Kelly: Mike, I think you're on mute. Mike, you're on mute. \nVasant Prabhu: Al maybe we should turn to questions. Operator, why don't we move to questions? \nAl Kelly: So Vasant, I also understand that we had a technical issue that some people might not have heard the end of mine and the beginning of yours. \nVasant Prabhu: Okay. \nAl Kelly: I'm looking for a little -- I was hoping Mike would give us a little direction whether we should summarize those points. Maybe... \nVasant Prabhu: Mike is suggesting we keep going. \nAl Kelly: Okay. So maybe what I would suggest is that let me just quickly summarize what I said at the end and maybe you could talk a little bit about U.S. debit before we open it up to questions. \nVasant Prabhu: Okay. \nAl Kelly: So what I said is that certainly the future is going to have uncertainty associated with it, but we continue to believe in our strategy and our growth prospects. Certainly, there were things that declined in the quarter: net revenue, EPS, overall payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. But we did see growth in a number of important areas: growth in debit, growth in e-commerce volumes, growth in Visa Direct transactions, growth in tap to pay, advances in click-to-pay enablement and growth in value-added services revenue.  We also demonstrated our ability to reduce our expenses while continuing to invest in the future and we returned capital to shareholders at historic levels and retained our dividend. So net-net, we believe that our business model is resilient and we have a lot of confidence in the efficacy of our global network of network strategy.  I think it would be helpful, if you'd Vasant could just comment on U.S. debit because I think a lot of people might not have heard it from what I understand. \nVasant Prabhu: Okay, Al. Yes. So I talked about why debit was outperforming credit. As you may have heard debit has bounced back about 30 points and is now growing at about 25% in the first three weeks of July whereas credit recovered by less than that and is still declining 9% through the first three weeks of July, whereas credit recovered by less than that and is still declining 9% through the first three weeks of July. I went through six reasons for that. I'll do those quickly. Economic impact payments going directly into checking accounts helps debit. In times of economic uncertainty, consumers do shift spending away from money they have borrowed, to money they have in the bank. Third reason, the shift to online has caused a lot of everyday spend categories to move to e-commerce, which has favored debit, because normally debit is used for everyday purchases. Affluent customers reason number four, tend to use credit for discretionary purposes like travel, entertainment and restaurants, which have been especially hard-hit in times like these. The economic impact payments this is reason number five, were distributed using Visa prepaid cards in 20 states, including the unemployment benefits which lifted our debit growth in May and June. And then finally, Visa Direct, which helps our debit numbers was up over 75% this quarter as a whole bunch of use cases performed really well. So I think, we'll probably stop there Al and take questions. I think we might have lost Mike, so we can take questions.\nMike Milotich: Jordanne, are you there?\nOperator: Yes, I'm here Mike.\nMike Milotich: Jordanne, if we can go into Q&A that would be great.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nLisa Ellis: All right. Good afternoon, guys. Hopefully you can hear me I guess.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes we can.\nLisa Ellis: So I'm going to hit a topic you did not cover on the call. Al, question for you about big tech. The big tech companies are now facing elevated regulatory pressure obviously very present right now in the U.S. also in Europe related to some of their competitive practices. Can you comment on, how this regulatory scrutiny you see affecting one those firms' initiatives in payments? Like in particular, are there anything \u2013 any practices that they're doing that you at Visa or Visa would view should be scrutinized? And then also, do you view this sort of regulatory scrutiny on big tech as a plus for the payments ecosystem and for Visa or as potentially a negative? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Well, Lisa as you might imagine, we have relationships with all of the companies that you would consider big techs. Some are a bit more extensive than others, but we certainly have relationships with all of them. I certainly can't comment and wouldn't comment on regulatory scrutiny that they are experiencing. But if it involves payments, and we can be helpful to them, or helpful to the government in either advocating or explaining what's going on we will jump into that. There was a case with a payment initiative that we had going with Facebook in Brazil in the last month, where we did just that as an example. I think that, these big techs are \u2013 certainly, have attracted lots and lots of users and have developed relationships with them. And some of those relationships are going to require money movement or payments capability. And we certainly want to be there, and be the partner to work with them on those particular things. And we'll leave it to them to figure out and deal with any of the regulatory issues that they're facing. And we're a phone call away, if we can be helpful. But I think in most cases, it's kind of up to them to resolve them. Jordanne, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Neill from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Neill: Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could provide some anecdotal views on what I think is probably the next leg of the sort of secular catalyst here the sort of silver lining of this pandemic, if there is one which is obviously the e-com growth has been robust. But how are the bank partners and merchant partners sort of thinking about the move back into brick-and-mortar commerce in what will inevitably be a significantly greater demand for contactless payments? And then, if I could just have a quick unrelated follow-up. I was just wondering, if there's any update on the Plaid acquisition and any comments around the lawsuit there? Thank you very much.\nAl Kelly: Well, interestingly enough as you probably could see in some of our charts as card-not-present has \u2013 I'm sorry as card-not-present has started to work its way back it lagged obviously card-not-present it was impacted much more greatly by the pandemic. Card-not-present volumes have held up, so we're not seeing any declines there. And I think that what all issuers and anybody who's rooting for economies around the world to come back would love to see a situation where both card-not-present and card-present both bounce back and that bricks-and-mortar commerce on main streets and communities around the world continue to grow. I think the case for contactless Matt has been made. We have seen consumers and governments and merchants voting through their actions and contactless has had \u2013 or tap to pay had tremendous momentum kind of going into COVID. And if anything COVID had accelerated the momentum of tap to pay even in the United States, which we know has been further behind, but as I cited we've added 80,000 \u2013 or I'm sorry, our issuers have added 80 million credentials that are tap to pay-enabled in the first six months of the year. Something like 80% of the merchant volume is \u2013 that is occurring in the face-to-face world is occurring at terminals that are enabled for tap to pay. So I think it's going to just continue to grow everywhere around the world. And I believe that the COVID situation will help accelerate the growth here in the United States at a perhaps faster pace than it might have happened otherwise. As for Plaid \u2013 \nVasant Prabhu: Al, I might add a couple of things. One crisis fosters innovation as you know. And if anything this has made more and more merchants focus on omni-channel commerce which CyberSource is very much in the middle of. And increasingly merchants are getting better and better at serving customers, seamlessly across bricks-and-mortar as well as e-commerce. It has also made a lot of categories that never used e-commerce become a lot better at e-commerce. And that's \u2013 you've seen that in a lot of everyday spend categories. You've seen that with restaurants. And more broadly across retail people have come up with more innovative ways like curbside delivery has been perfected in many ways. And that we think is going to be here with us, which is really a way where you order online but you may pick up physically. So you have one more delivery option, you can get it delivered after a day or two delay or you can get it right away by going and picking it up. So there's a lot going on. And I think the most important point that Al made was that even as we've seen card-present improve from minus 50 to minus high single-digits, card-not-present has stayed very robust continuing to grow at those mid-20s levels for quite a while now. So lots of changes underway.\nAl Kelly: Matt, let me address your Plaid question. It's still pending regulatory approval. And we certainly are expecting to close by the end of the calendar year and are doing everything we can to comply with any request from the regulators that are looking at it. We are as excited about the Plaid acquisition today, as we were back in January, when we made the announcement. And we really believe we got the asset we wanted. And all of the various benefits that we have articulated in prior calls we believe are still there. Everything from the depth of their integration with fintechs, the fact that they are most attracted to a lot of fintechs that they're positioned in terms of how far along they are we believe they have the best team. And we see it as the best way to integrate into Visa. So we're \u2013 we remain very excited about Plaid and hopeful to close by the end of the year.\nMike Milotich: Next question please, Jordanne\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller: All right. Hey, guys. Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. First on the fourth quarter, fiscal fourth quarter comments. Just to clarify I think you guys are saying that the \u2013 just the lag effect of services versus prior quarter volume would impact that line by four points. But I guess we're just wondering if the \u2013 just given the trends we're seeing on transactions processed flattening out, shouldn't those trends be enough to offset that when it comes to growth in fiscal Q4? And then Al just bigger picture, when we think about the services, all these other value-added services you guys are doing well with I mean, do you see these sticking around post-COVID in terms of the demand you're seeing for analytics and potentially the card-not-present service fees or CyberSource? \nAl Kelly: So why don't I let Vasant answer the first piece and I'll come back and address the second piece? \nVasant Prabhu: Sure. So if you look at the various lines on the revenue line, service fees as you indicated and as we told you in the comments are known already. They're going to report service fees based on our volumes in the third quarter. And the volumes in the third quarter was hopefully the low point. And as we said had we not done a lag, our service fees would have been down 11% and total net revenue would have been down as you said in that 4, 4.5 range. So that is going to happen. That's a known fact. And even if volumes improve on the domestic front and transactions improve, the service fee number isn't going to change next quarter. So that's locked in. So when volumes do improve which we expect will be the case on domestic volumes and transactions, transactions revenues will definitely go up. Value-added services revenues will definitely go up. But the other thing that goes up is the contra-revenue line incentives. Incentives will go up to reflect the higher volumes because we don't book incentives with a lag. Incentives will go up but the benefit of that revenue from the higher incentives we won't get on the services line \u2013 service fee line, we will get it on \u2013 we will definitely get it on the processing line. So there's something of an offset there. I just want you to be aware of that. But the biggest variable is going to be cross-border. If there's a change in trend in cross-border and it improves then that would be the single biggest reason to expect Q4 trends to be better than Q3, recognizing that you've got pressure going in the other direction from the service fee lag. So there's some complexity created by these things because of the turbulent times we're in. We've tried to help you with it. And hopefully, we can help you some more if you like answer more questions later on.\nAl Kelly: And Darrin on your second question, I'm very bullish on what's going to happen with value-added services in a post-COVID world. First of all two-thirds of our value-added service is a platform-type services, CyberSource issuer processing risk and fraud. The need for those is going to continue. And if anything the volumes and transactions that will run through those will go up. Where we've seen some declines are in travel-related card benefits which is going to get better as travel comes back. We've also waived some fees because of the pandemic. And once we're past the pandemic, we won't waive those fees as readily, so that volume will go up. Travel-related benefits will go up, as I said, as travel comes back. So I see value-added services being very well positioned coming out of COVID and feel very good about the contribution they'll make and how they'll continue to diversify our revenue profile over time. \nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I think the other things to add there, three of our largest value-added services we think are going to sustain their growth which has already accelerated. Our issuer processing business, which is directed towards debit. Debit has become the engine for cash conversion right now. Debit growth rates as you saw are 25% in the first three weeks of July. So as long as debit growth rates are at an accelerated level, the issuer processing business will clearly have high growth rates. CyberSource always benefits from the shift to e-commerce. And now with their focus on omnicommerce, CyberSource clearly is benefiting from the shift. And then finally our risk and fraud services, certainly benefit as things move more to e-commerce which is where fraud is an area that we can really help a lot on. So they're reasons to believe that higher growth rates can sustain post-COVID. \nMike Milotich: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.\nJames Friedman: Hi, thank you. Al in your prepared remarks you shared some P2P growth characteristics. You were going kind of quick there. I -- that disclosure was new at least to me. But I was wondering if you could repeat what you said and also at the same time share some use cases about how you're seeing the P2P applications develop?\nAl Kelly: Well what I said in my remarks was that P2P is up almost 80% in third quarter and in Latin America -- that was in the United States I'm sorry up 80% in the third quarter. And in Latin America there we saw progress with two different apps -- P2P apps in Peru where we saw a nearly 400% increase in transactions in Q3 over the prior quarter Q2. We've got this tremendous track record of working with P2P providers. And as we said in the past, we were heavily skewed toward the United States and Russia. But we're -- and where we have relationships with most of the big P2P providers; Square Cash, Venmo, Zelle etcetera, I think that now we're seeing our P2P capability through our Visa Direct platform becomes something that people are looking to us for as P2P applications are developing in other countries around the world. \nVasant Prabhu: Since we had some issues earlier we'll run longer. So we'll probably go for at least 10 minutes past the hour. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nCraig Maurer: I was hoping Vasant, you could comment on if we see cross-border -- the cross-border recovery continue to stagnate into next year and domestic volume continue to pick up intra-Europe cross-border continue to pick up where should we be thinking about incentives as a percentage of gross revenue going? What's the risk to next year in terms of upside from that percentage? And then perhaps, Al maybe a comment or two on the renewal of the Durbin Amendment version 2 or 3 whatever we're at this point and EPI in Europe? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. In times like these I think it's not easy to make long-term projections clearly. In terms of cross-border and its recovery yes it's possible I suppose that it remains sluggish. It all depends on borders reopening. Wherever borders have been opened or the restrictions have not been significant, we've seen some pretty quick recoveries. So to the extent that there are borders reopening, it may not be globally but there could be corridors opening up as we're already hearing Australia, New Zealand you've seen that it's mostly open across the EU. It's starting to open in other geographies within regions. So it's not black and white, I think in terms of the cross-border recovery. You could see some changes in travel patterns because of how countries open up. But if cross-border remains depressed certainly the mix won't help us. And that will cause the percentage of incentives to gross revenue to stay higher than what you might call -- what it would might have been normalized mix of earnings -- of revenues. The other factor that's influencing it is probably most acute in the fourth quarter which is the service fee lag. Normally our service fees from one quarter to another don't have such significant swings because our business tends to be quite stable, so that service fee lag effect will moderate. So I think the best way to describe it is, it will probably normalize from the levels you see in the fourth quarter. It will certainly normalize because of service fee stabilizing. It will probably normalize some because the cross-border business will recover in corridors, but we'll wait and see how fast cross-border normalizes. \nAl Kelly: Let me address your other two questions you asked about Durbin. Visa is fully compliant with all the requirements of the Durbin Amendment. And we don't have any rules or requirements or other restrictions that inhibit a merchant's ability to select their routing decisions make the routing decision of their choice. And merchants are free and often do route to various unaffiliated networks enabled on a debit card. So that would -- I think we're in good shape as it relates to Durbin. EPI, we have a history of dealing with either regions or groups of countries or countries developing their own scheme or intra-market network. It's something that we're very, very used to dealing with. We do know though that developing a network is not an inexpensive thing to do and it's not a onetime investment. You have to continue to push and invest and innovate and be creative to stay ahead as it relates to all the elements of security, fraud prevention, risk, authentication etcetera. And so we will continue to monitor and engage constructively with regulators and banks in Europe on EPI. But on the other hand, we're going to continue to invest heavily behind our various networks to make them as good as they could possibly be. And we will be continuing to focus on making sure that our clients know the benefits that they can obtain by doing business with us and running on our networks. \nMike Milotich: Next question please, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey thanks. I just want to ask on the spread in U.S. debit and credit I know you went through it a couple of times Vasant. But it's wider than what we saw in 2008, 2009. So is there a way to try and quantify how much of the debit outperformance we can attribute to secular versus stimulus benefits? And curious, also, I just want to make sure any impact on yield differences between the two products. I don't think so, but just wanted to make sure.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. There are some modest yield differences depending on parts of the world and so on. I don't think you should view that as a huge factor. In terms of the reasons that might stick as we go ahead, I think we went through five reasons. One, the economic impact payments and unemployment benefits being distributed on Visa prepaid cards, clearly, that's linked to the crisis and probably is not something that will continue. Affluent customers putting off some discretionary items like travel entertainment and restaurants, which has hit credit in particular, that probably normalizes over time, so that you can attribute to COVID. The propensity for people to spend money -- spend the money they have versus money from -- borrowed money that is something you do see in times of uncertainty. And then, some of the economic incentive impact payments going into checking accounts, clearly, has helped debit. But there's a few others that are clearly sticking. The fact that Visa Direct is still going very strong, that has been helping debit for a long time and we'll continue to do that. The fact that debit has become the mechanism for cash conversion to digital in everyday spend categories and in just about -- in most categories, which have seen a big increase in e-commerce has benefited debit, I think some of that sticks. So I think the best way to describe it is that, the acceleration of cash conversion has disproportionately helped debit and that is most likely going to stick.\nAl Kelly: And Tien-Tsin, it's Al. I would only add that I think the -- if I look back, same observation you do about the 2008, 2009 time frame. But e-commerce is just much, much bigger and it just appears that people who are doing card-not-present e-com non-travel are using their debit cards much more than their credit cards.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you parse out some of the drivers of the 36% decline in international transaction revenue yield? I imagine a lot of that's just the big drop in cross-border travel. But if you could help us think through the drivers in terms of how much might be inter-European versus debit? And how should we think about international transaction revenue yield going forward?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. So I think it's very important to continue to point people to the decline of cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe volumes. The decline was roughly -- was 47% in cross-border constant dollar volumes excluding intra-Europe. So the revenue decline is, roughly as you can see, in line with that. The reason being that -- and if you look at total cross-border volume that includes intra-Europe. Intra-Europe looks more like a domestic transaction. In fact in our international revenue line, the contribution from intra-Europe transactions is very small. The international revenue line is driven almost entirely by volume excluding intra-Europe. Now there's a few other things there that can have an impact. Exchange rate shifts can. Changes in currency volatility can. So that explains -- and then, some small changes in mix in terms of which corridors are doing better than others, because of some yield differences across corridors. But that explains the 44% decline in revenues versus the 47% decline in volumes ex intra-Europe. But as you can see watching that volume line ex intra-Europe is the best indicator and that's what you should focus on.\nDavid Togut: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, could you just comment on the 10% growth in processing transaction yield year-over-year and thoughts going forward?\nVasant Prabhu: Right. There's two factors driving it. One is that, cross-border transactions have held up a little better than cross-border volume. So the mix has helped a bit, because cross-border transactions for processing have a higher yield. And the second is we have value-added services and some acquisitions in that line. And as you heard, value-added services are growing in the mid-teens in that line. So those two things have helped data processing yields go up.\nDavid Togut: Much appreciated.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Koning: Yeah. Hey, thanks guys. And I guess following up on that last question, you said that the ex-intra-Europe volume down 47% but 44% revenue decline. Is that gap going to change much? I know FX volatility probably helped a little bit in Q3 to make revenue a little better than the volume decline. But are there any other kind of yield factors in there other than FX volatility to think about?\nVasant Prabhu: The variables that can make a difference there, first of all the 44% to 47% is a relatively small delta. There'll always be some differences between the two. They won't match each other precisely. But you're right, currency volatility is one factor. Another factor would be mix. Certain corridors can have better yields than others. So if the recovery of cross-border favors higher-yielding corridors, you can have something of a difference. But other than that, it should track pretty closely to volumes, ex intra-Europe volumes.\nDave Koning: Okay. Well, thank you.\nMike Milotich: And Jordan, we\u2019ll take one last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Al, can you expand upon your recent conversations with regulators and governments? Now on one hand some merchants are lobbying for lower fees in this crisis and I understand that's not a new phenomenon. But then there are very real benefits of digital payments, especially in this current environment. So just \u2013 can you just talk about how your conversations with regulators and governments are evolving in this crisis? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Look, I think like many people governments are finding themselves in uncharted territory here. And they're all well intentioned trying to figure out the right things to do. Our biggest piece of advice to governments as it relates to core payments is to do no harm at the moment. I mean, right now I think the less amount of moving parts, as we're fighting through this pandemic is the best answer for everybody. This is not a time for any kind of changes. Governments are also increasingly talking to us in terms of looking for information that we have in terms of trends, because they're trying to understand what's happening in their economies. And in many ways, we could get them real-time picture of what's going on faster than they can get it themselves. And the last thing, I would say is that, there's a lot of interest in the form of governments to become more role models in terms of what they want to see in their countries from a digital adoption point of view. And so as they are \u2013 have genned up stimulus programs, unemployment programs, thank-you programs, and all kinds of other things, they're looking to Visa to help advise them on how they could distribute funds digitally as opposed to cutting checks. So, I think my view at the moment is that governments have \u2013 are being very, very thoughtful and reasonable in terms of what they're saying, and they're also being good listeners. And so, we're going to continue to do our job to provide them with whatever information they need and to provide them with whatever advice and counsel we can provide to be helpful to them both in their role as governments, and setters of laws as well as in their role as potential clients for various Visa services. Before we close out, one of the things I gather that did not \u2013 when we had a little blackout with \u2013 in terms of the transmission was I did before I closed make a comment about the race situation in the country and around the world. And I'd like to just cite that again. For four centuries, Black and African-American women and men have experienced incredible forms of social injustice and discrimination. And it's offensive, it's frustrating and it's unacceptable and it has to stop. At Visa we've committed to do our part. We recently announced the next steps in our journey to drive inclusion and diversity across our company. We announced a number of actions, including the establishment of a Visa scholars and jobs program. But very importantly, last week we announced that we're committing to increase the number of underrepresented U.S. vice presidents and above by 50% in the next three years and increase the number of underrepresented U.S. colleagues within Visa overall by 50% in the next five years. We want to do our part to eradicate the social injustice in the world. It's way past time that that has to be the case. With that, thank you to everybody. Mike, did you want to \u2013 \nMike Milotich: Yes. Thank you, Al. So yes, once again, I apologize for the technical challenges. We will make sure that the replay that's on our website as well as the transcript reflect everything. And if you have additional questions of course feel free and reach out to us here on the Investor Relations team and we're happy to help you. So, thanks so much and have a great day.",

            "name": "Al Kelly",
            "content": "Mike, thank you very much. The past few months certainly continue to be challenging and our focus has and will always remain on the well being of our employees, clients and the communities, in which we operate. Even with significant impacts to the economies around the world, many aspects of Visa's business have proven to be resilient and have continued -- and we've continued to invest to propel Visa's growth well into the future in consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Today after discussing our results, I will then provide an overview of the ways COVID-19 is shifting the way consumers, businesses and governments want to pay and be paid and in turn how Visa is helping them. I will close with some notable deal highlights for the quarter that demonstrate how we continue to enable the movement of money globally. So to start our third quarter results. Net revenues in the fiscal third quarter were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 17% or 16% in constant dollars. All of the business drivers were significantly impacted by the pandemic. Payments volume this quarter declined 10% globally or 9% excluding China. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, which drives our international transaction revenue declined 47% on a constant dollar basis, driven primarily by the lack of travel. Including intra-Europe volume was down 37%. We processed 30.7 billion transactions or over 337 million per day through the quarter on our network, a 13% decrease over the prior year. However, in each case, the business drivers improved each month throughout the quarter meaningfully for payments volume and processed transactions and only marginally for cross-border volume. In new flows, Visa Direct grew global transactions in the mid-60s year-over-year. And our value-added services revenue grew in the mid-teens year-over-year. We also effectively managed our expenses, which declined 5% but more importantly this was achieved without affecting investments in our primary growth initiatives. Our non-GAAP EPS declined 23%. While, COVID-19 certainly impacted our fiscal third quarter performance there are many trends that are accelerating the demand for consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, which will help our business as we look ahead. In consumer payments, even with all the success Visa has had electronifying payments, there is still $18 trillion transacted in cash and check globally. In today's environment, people are sensitive to touching surfaces, including cash and check and we are seeing this manifest in interest and usage in tap to pay, which we know helps digitize cash at the low ticket level and has historically increased transactions by an average of 20% over time in mature markets globally. From second quarter to third quarter, we had nearly 50 countries improve tap to pay penetration by more than five percentage points and over 10 countries increased by 10 percentage points or more. We have helped more than 55 countries to increase the tap to pay limits, reducing the share of transactions that require consumer contact by more than 40% in several of those countries. In the United States, we added more than 80 million contactless cards in the first six months of calendar year 2020 as a number of our financial institution partners accelerated their issuance schedules. Tap to pay is likely to accelerate post-COVID, especially as consumers start going back to the office where they tend to conduct smaller transactions for their commute, paying for public transit fares and buying food and drinks. Another positive trend has been the shift to e-commerce. This works in our favor because Visa's share of digital commerce where cash is not an option is approximately three times greater than the physical point of sale. In the United States, Visa credentials active in e-commerce excluding travel were over 12% higher in June than in January. In addition to the total spend per active credential also increased during that time by over 6%, which is notable considering new adopters typically spend less than those used to shopping online. In fact when you isolate the active credentials who tend to be more significantly engaged in e-commerce, the spend per active credential increased by over 25%. And these trends are not unique to the United States. During this period in the U.K., active e-commerce credentials increased 16% while spend per active credential increased 3%. In Brazil, active e-commerce credentials increased 11% while spend per active credential increased 12%. In markets where e-commerce is not as developed there are examples of dramatic changes in adoption. Argentina experienced active e-commerce card growth of over 100%, and Romania 70%. In new flows, we continued our focus on addressing the $185 trillion opportunity. In B2B, the opportunity is across card-based, accounts payable and receivable and cross-border payments. While B2B volume is down during this work from home and very limited travel period, we are continuing to build out our capabilities and relationships to fuel future growth. A couple of quick points from the quarter. We recently established a global partnership with U.K. fintech Conferma Pay which enables companies to provision virtual Visa commercial cards to employees' digital wallets enabling tap to pay and simplifying expense reimbursement. For our large-ticket cross-border B2B solution called Visa B2B Connect, we continue to build the network out. Many banks are in the implementation phase. And when they are all live by the end of the year, Visa will be processing cross-border transactions in half of the 80 markets where Visa's B2B Connect capability is available. Let's look at the remainder of new flows. In the United States, P2P is up almost 80%. And in Latin America, we saw progress with P2P apps in Peru where there was nearly a 400% increase in transactions in Q3 versus Q2. Visa is also excited to announce a global partnership with PayPal including its Venmo, Braintree, Zoom, iZettle and Hyperwallet brands. This is an extension of a long-standing regional partnership with PayPal. This new global agreement will allow PayPal and all of its brands to offer fast Visa Direct-enabled domestic and cross-border payments and expand PayPal's real-time transfer capabilities globally. In the gig economy food and grocery delivery category, we have seen a nearly 50% growth in transactions from pre-COVID levels and have continued to add new program launches such as Instacart for shopper earnings payouts in Canada. G2C government-to-consumer use cases are gaining momentum employing both Visa Direct and prepaid cards. This quarter let me highlight some of the card examples. In the U.S., the Treasury distributed nearly four million economic impact payments via Visa prepaid cards. We also worked with CaixaBank in Spain on three projects issuing 330,000 prepaid Visa cards with government-allocated funds to support vulnerable families across the region. In France, Natixis partnered with Visa to issue 15,000 cards as a thank you to frontline hospital workers financed by the government. In value-added services, we've seen more clients turn to us for help. As e-commerce has expanded and new sellers are looking to offer omnicommerce payment capabilities that are safe and secure our CyberSource and fraud and risk capabilities have seen growth. Let me name two recent examples. A recent win in Saudi Arabia with Al Rajhi Bank, the largest acquiring bank in the country will leverage CyberSource to enable e-commerce payments platform for all Saudi Arabian government services through a centralized interface with the country's Ministry of Finance. Buying online picking up in-store has become very popular among consumers and is a key way for sellers to operate in this environment. However, this use case does bring a higher potential for fraud. One home improvement partner chose Decision Manager a CyberSource fraud offering to quickly review online orders for fraud risk and meet customer expectations for a two-hour pickup. This resulted in a massive increase in Decision Manager transactions in May alone at this merchant. Across all CyberSource risk products in Q3 we saw a nearly 50% year-over-year growth in transactions. Interest also has grown in our authentication products. CardinalCommerce which provides network-agnostic products for sellers and issuers to leverage the 3D Secure standard has seen accelerated growth in transactions this quarter versus last year. 3D Secure is making steady progress in Europe as well where the ecosystem is ramping up in advance of the secure customer authentication mandate beginning in December for most of Europe. We continue to work with the ecosystem participants as the deadline approaches given that some are not ready for the deadline. EMV 3D Secure transactions in Q3 has grown over 100% compared to Q2. Data and consulting continue to be valuable to our clients as they navigate this environment. Clients utilized our consulting services at an accelerated rate with almost 60% more projects completed than the third quarter of last year. Visa plays a critical role in providing data and analysis to help clients manage their business through the pandemic. And the client activity on our Visa Analytics Platform increased 60% just from Q2 alone. Now let me talk to new deals where we made very good progress this quarter. First our momentum in Europe continues. We renewed with one of the largest banks in the Nordics, Nordea to grow debit portfolios across the region. We expanded our partnership with Permanent TSB, a large issuer in Ireland with over 800,000 cards in force making Visa the primary card in most wallets in Ireland. We recently extended our partnership with UBS in Switzerland to debit. And we're winning processing. In Spain, we secured a significant deal to expand our processing capabilities for domestic transactions. Banco Caminos will migrate their issuing and acquiring volumes from their local processor to Visa. Europe was certainly not the exception in developing and renewing partnerships this quarter. In Singapore, we renewed our partnership with the second-largest debit issuer OCBC Bank to remain the preferred debit card issued to OCBC Bank's personal savings and current account customers. In Korea, we recently secured a renewal with South Korea's biggest issuer Shinhan Card. We renewed our credit and debit partnership with Banco de Bogota, our largest issuer client in Colombia. We recently won started issuance with Kaspi Bank, one of the largest retail banks in Kazakhstan. The bank is moving 100% to Visa over the next few years. And our leadership position in co-brand also continued. This quarter Visa renewed and expanded its strategic partnership with Best Buy including extending the My Best Buy co-brand relationship. Ford and Visa will collaborate on Ford's new FordPass Rewards Visa Card available to their 4 million FordPass rewards members and other Ford customers. Another recent co-brand win was with Verizon to launch a Visa credit card that provide savings on Verizon's industry-leading products and services along with benefits for everyday and essential purposes. And we signed a co-brand deal with Tiki, one of the leading e-commerce platforms in Vietnam. A key component to building issuance and acceptance is with fintechs. And this quarter we secured many wallet and neobank wins globally. Let me name a few. Careem, the biggest ride-hailing app in the Middle East and Africa will offer driver payouts with Visa Direct as well as credentials to their over 35 million user base. Hong Kong's digital transit card Octopus will accept Visa wallet top-ups allowing commuters to pay for transport and to pay in 35,000 retail outlets. In Saudi Arabia, we signed a strategic partnership with Hala [ph] a rising challenger bank that has the potential to penetrate an unbanked population of up to 7 million people. Neobank Vivid Money announced its official launch in Germany offering Visa debit cards in an all-in-one mobile application including innovative savings and cash-back solutions. In the U.S., U.S.-based Chime with over 8 million accounts launched access to a new Visa secured credit card, which allows consumers to build credit while spending on everyday purchases like groceries and monthly subscriptions. As I've often said, partnerships are fundamental to Visa's business model and these renewals and new deals will certainly help drive growth into the future. Before I close, I would be remiss if not to comment on the race situation in this country and around the world. For four centuries Black and African-American women and men have experienced many forms of social injustice and discrimination. It is offensive. It is frustrating and it's unacceptable. It must stop. At Visa, we are committed to do our part. Visa recently announced the next steps in our journey to drive inclusion and diversity across our company. We've announced a number of actions including the establishment of a Visa scholars and jobs program. And very importantly, last week, we announced that we are committing to increasing the number of underrepresented U.S. vice presidents and above by 50% in the next three years and increasing the number of underrepresented U.S. colleagues within Visa overall by 50% in the next five years. So to close, while there is some uncertainty in the near term for sure, we remain confident about our long-term strategy and growth prospects and our ability to make a positive difference in the world. On one hand, net revenue, EPS overall payments volume, cross-border volume and process transactions declined this quarter. Yet we saw growth in debit and in e-commerce volumes in Visa Direct transactions, growth in tap to pay and click-to-pay enablement and value-added services revenue. Furthermore, we've demonstrated our discipline. We've been able to reduce expenses by 5% this quarter while still investing in future growth. And we returned capital to our shareholders at historic levels and retained our dividend. All of this speaks to the resiliency of our business model. We have the scale, a trusted brand, digital products financial levers and most importantly, a talented team to emerge from this pandemic even stronger. We remain confident in the efficacy of our global network of network strategy, as we enable the movement of money for everyone everywhere. Now for more detail, let me turn it over to Vasant. Mike, I think you're on mute. Mike, you're on mute. So Vasant, I also understand that we had a technical issue that some people might not have heard the end of mine and the beginning of yours. I'm looking for a little -- I was hoping Mike would give us a little direction whether we should summarize those points. Maybe... Okay. So maybe what I would suggest is that let me just quickly summarize what I said at the end and maybe you could talk a little bit about U.S. debit before we open it up to questions. So what I said is that certainly the future is going to have uncertainty associated with it, but we continue to believe in our strategy and our growth prospects. Certainly, there were things that declined in the quarter: net revenue, EPS, overall payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. But we did see growth in a number of important areas: growth in debit, growth in e-commerce volumes, growth in Visa Direct transactions, growth in tap to pay, advances in click-to-pay enablement and growth in value-added services revenue.  We also demonstrated our ability to reduce our expenses while continuing to invest in the future and we returned capital to shareholders at historic levels and retained our dividend. So net-net, we believe that our business model is resilient and we have a lot of confidence in the efficacy of our global network of network strategy.  I think it would be helpful, if you'd Vasant could just comment on U.S. debit because I think a lot of people might not have heard it from what I understand. Well, Lisa as you might imagine, we have relationships with all of the companies that you would consider big techs. Some are a bit more extensive than others, but we certainly have relationships with all of them. I certainly can't comment and wouldn't comment on regulatory scrutiny that they are experiencing. But if it involves payments, and we can be helpful to them, or helpful to the government in either advocating or explaining what's going on we will jump into that. There was a case with a payment initiative that we had going with Facebook in Brazil in the last month, where we did just that as an example. I think that, these big techs are \u2013 certainly, have attracted lots and lots of users and have developed relationships with them. And some of those relationships are going to require money movement or payments capability. And we certainly want to be there, and be the partner to work with them on those particular things. And we'll leave it to them to figure out and deal with any of the regulatory issues that they're facing. And we're a phone call away, if we can be helpful. But I think in most cases, it's kind of up to them to resolve them. Jordanne, next question? Well, interestingly enough as you probably could see in some of our charts as card-not-present has \u2013 I'm sorry as card-not-present has started to work its way back it lagged obviously card-not-present it was impacted much more greatly by the pandemic. Card-not-present volumes have held up, so we're not seeing any declines there. And I think that what all issuers and anybody who's rooting for economies around the world to come back would love to see a situation where both card-not-present and card-present both bounce back and that bricks-and-mortar commerce on main streets and communities around the world continue to grow. I think the case for contactless Matt has been made. We have seen consumers and governments and merchants voting through their actions and contactless has had \u2013 or tap to pay had tremendous momentum kind of going into COVID. And if anything COVID had accelerated the momentum of tap to pay even in the United States, which we know has been further behind, but as I cited we've added 80,000 \u2013 or I'm sorry, our issuers have added 80 million credentials that are tap to pay-enabled in the first six months of the year. Something like 80% of the merchant volume is \u2013 that is occurring in the face-to-face world is occurring at terminals that are enabled for tap to pay. So I think it's going to just continue to grow everywhere around the world. And I believe that the COVID situation will help accelerate the growth here in the United States at a perhaps faster pace than it might have happened otherwise. As for Plaid \u2013 Matt, let me address your Plaid question. It's still pending regulatory approval. And we certainly are expecting to close by the end of the calendar year and are doing everything we can to comply with any request from the regulators that are looking at it. We are as excited about the Plaid acquisition today, as we were back in January, when we made the announcement. And we really believe we got the asset we wanted. And all of the various benefits that we have articulated in prior calls we believe are still there. Everything from the depth of their integration with fintechs, the fact that they are most attracted to a lot of fintechs that they're positioned in terms of how far along they are we believe they have the best team. And we see it as the best way to integrate into Visa. So we're \u2013 we remain very excited about Plaid and hopeful to close by the end of the year. So why don't I let Vasant answer the first piece and I'll come back and address the second piece? And Darrin on your second question, I'm very bullish on what's going to happen with value-added services in a post-COVID world. First of all two-thirds of our value-added service is a platform-type services, CyberSource issuer processing risk and fraud. The need for those is going to continue. And if anything the volumes and transactions that will run through those will go up. Where we've seen some declines are in travel-related card benefits which is going to get better as travel comes back. We've also waived some fees because of the pandemic. And once we're past the pandemic, we won't waive those fees as readily, so that volume will go up. Travel-related benefits will go up, as I said, as travel comes back. So I see value-added services being very well positioned coming out of COVID and feel very good about the contribution they'll make and how they'll continue to diversify our revenue profile over time. Well what I said in my remarks was that P2P is up almost 80% in third quarter and in Latin America -- that was in the United States I'm sorry up 80% in the third quarter. And in Latin America there we saw progress with two different apps -- P2P apps in Peru where we saw a nearly 400% increase in transactions in Q3 over the prior quarter Q2. We've got this tremendous track record of working with P2P providers. And as we said in the past, we were heavily skewed toward the United States and Russia. But we're -- and where we have relationships with most of the big P2P providers; Square Cash, Venmo, Zelle etcetera, I think that now we're seeing our P2P capability through our Visa Direct platform becomes something that people are looking to us for as P2P applications are developing in other countries around the world. Let me address your other two questions you asked about Durbin. Visa is fully compliant with all the requirements of the Durbin Amendment. And we don't have any rules or requirements or other restrictions that inhibit a merchant's ability to select their routing decisions make the routing decision of their choice. And merchants are free and often do route to various unaffiliated networks enabled on a debit card. So that would -- I think we're in good shape as it relates to Durbin. EPI, we have a history of dealing with either regions or groups of countries or countries developing their own scheme or intra-market network. It's something that we're very, very used to dealing with. We do know though that developing a network is not an inexpensive thing to do and it's not a onetime investment. You have to continue to push and invest and innovate and be creative to stay ahead as it relates to all the elements of security, fraud prevention, risk, authentication etcetera. And so we will continue to monitor and engage constructively with regulators and banks in Europe on EPI. But on the other hand, we're going to continue to invest heavily behind our various networks to make them as good as they could possibly be. And we will be continuing to focus on making sure that our clients know the benefits that they can obtain by doing business with us and running on our networks. And Tien-Tsin, it's Al. I would only add that I think the -- if I look back, same observation you do about the 2008, 2009 time frame. But e-commerce is just much, much bigger and it just appears that people who are doing card-not-present e-com non-travel are using their debit cards much more than their credit cards. Look, I think like many people governments are finding themselves in uncharted territory here. And they're all well intentioned trying to figure out the right things to do. Our biggest piece of advice to governments as it relates to core payments is to do no harm at the moment. I mean, right now I think the less amount of moving parts, as we're fighting through this pandemic is the best answer for everybody. This is not a time for any kind of changes. Governments are also increasingly talking to us in terms of looking for information that we have in terms of trends, because they're trying to understand what's happening in their economies. And in many ways, we could get them real-time picture of what's going on faster than they can get it themselves. And the last thing, I would say is that, there's a lot of interest in the form of governments to become more role models in terms of what they want to see in their countries from a digital adoption point of view. And so as they are \u2013 have genned up stimulus programs, unemployment programs, thank-you programs, and all kinds of other things, they're looking to Visa to help advise them on how they could distribute funds digitally as opposed to cutting checks. So, I think my view at the moment is that governments have \u2013 are being very, very thoughtful and reasonable in terms of what they're saying, and they're also being good listeners. And so, we're going to continue to do our job to provide them with whatever information they need and to provide them with whatever advice and counsel we can provide to be helpful to them both in their role as governments, and setters of laws as well as in their role as potential clients for various Visa services. Before we close out, one of the things I gather that did not \u2013 when we had a little blackout with \u2013 in terms of the transmission was I did before I closed make a comment about the race situation in the country and around the world. And I'd like to just cite that again. For four centuries, Black and African-American women and men have experienced incredible forms of social injustice and discrimination. And it's offensive, it's frustrating and it's unacceptable and it has to stop. At Visa we've committed to do our part. We recently announced the next steps in our journey to drive inclusion and diversity across our company. We announced a number of actions, including the establishment of a Visa scholars and jobs program. But very importantly, last week we announced that we're committing to increase the number of underrepresented U.S. vice presidents and above by 50% in the next three years and increase the number of underrepresented U.S. colleagues within Visa overall by 50% in the next five years. We want to do our part to eradicate the social injustice in the world. It's way past time that that has to be the case. With that, thank you to everybody. Mike, did you want to \u2013"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Vasant Prabhu",
            "content": "Thank you, Al and good afternoon, everyone. As we did last quarter, we will provide a fair amount of color on the business trends we are seeing as we navigate through this unprecedented time. I'll begin with the key business drivers then review our financial results and close with some perspectives on the next quarter. Starting with U.S. payments volume. For the quarter U.S. payments volume declined 7%, a sharp decline from mid-April was followed by a V-shaped domestic spending recovery. Volumes declined 18% in April, before returning to positive territory in June. July volumes through the 21st are up 7%. This recovery was jump-started by the economic impact payments and enhanced unemployment benefits, helped along by pent-up demand fulfillment and accelerated by the relaxation of shelter in place requirements. Debit outperformed credit by almost 30 points. Debit spending was up 8% while credit spending declined 21% in the quarter. Credit spending recovered 21 points from a decline of 30% in April to a decline of 9% in July through the 21st. Debit spending bounced 30 points from down 5% in April to up 25% in July. The outperformance of debit versus credit is driven by several factors. Some of them are more likely to persist than others. First, the government's economic impact payments were directly deposited into consumers checking accounts benefiting debit. Second, in times of economic uncertainty, consumers have a propensity to shift spending from money they borrow to money they have in the bank. Third, as you know, there has been a significant shift to online purchases in almost every day almost every \u2013 in most everyday spend categories which favors debit. Fourth, affluent customers tend to use credit for discretionary spending in categories such as travel, entertainment and restaurants, which have been especially hard-hit by the pandemic. Fifth, the last tranche of economic impact payments as well as unemployment benefits in over 20 states were distributed via Visa prepaid cards, which lifted debit growth by several points in May and June. Finally, in the U.S. Visa Direct was up over 75% this quarter, due to strong growth in a variety of use cases ranging from P2P, to insurance payouts, to payroll. The significant growth in debit demonstrates the acceleration of the secular shift away from cash to digital forms of payment as a result of the pandemic. The COVID crisis has also significantly accelerated the secular shift to e-commerce. Card not present spend excluding travel has grown over 25% every week since mid-April, which is 2x the pre-COVID growth rate. Card present spending improved steadily through the quarter as reopenings went into effect from declining almost 50% in early April to declining in the high single-digits by late June, but there has been little improvement since. It is too early to tell what all the underlying causes of this recent stabilization are. Recovery trajectories for card present volumes are relatively similar across states. In terms of U.S. spend by category excluding Visa Direct, performance can be summarized in three groups based on COVID impact and the recovery we've seen to-date. Each group represents roughly a third of our U.S. payments volume. The first group includes categories, such as food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. These categories have consistently grown at or above their pre-COVID growth rates in the high teens or even higher every week since mid-April. The second group includes categories that experienced spend declines between 10% to 50% in April and had all recovered to growth by the end of June. These segments include automotive, retail services, department and apparel stores, health care, education, government and business supplies. The third group includes categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic: travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants. These categories declined over 50% in April and are still declining year-over-year, although, each improved by between 20 to 45 points during the quarter. Travel remains the most impacted category still down over 50%. Fuel gallons purchased are growing again, but spend is down more than 15% in July driven by lower prices. Within the restaurant category, card present spend is still declining, while card not present spend continues to grow significantly with quick-service restaurants outperforming. Moving on to trends in the rest of the world. International payments volume declined over 12% in constant dollars in the third quarter. Similar to the U.S., debit significantly outperformed credit with debit down only 3% and credit down 20%. Card present spend improved through the quarter, as countries reopened, while card not present excluding travel spend remained elevated. Performance across categories was broadly similar to the U.S. Our best performing region continues to be CEMEA, which declined 5% in constant dollars. Within CEMEA, Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia had positive growth in the quarter fueled by a rapid recovery after April declines as well as client wins. Europe payments volume declined 10% in constant dollars in the third quarter. Central and Southeastern Europe which include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary recovered rapidly to post positive growth in the quarter. The U.K. returned to growth in June, driven by consistently strong card not present growth. Italy is almost back to prior year levels in June following one of the strictest lockdowns within Europe. Canada declined 15% and Latin America declined 13% in constant dollars. Brazil spend decline early in the quarter was one of the shallowest, but the recovery has also been slow. Brazil is now back near 2019 levels of domestic spending fueled by strong card not present growth. Asia Pacific payments volume declined 16% in constant dollars. Reopening of the Asian economies has been gradual with multiple phases depending on the country. Two of the least impacted countries were Korea and New Zealand, both of which were close to flat in the quarter. Domestic spending in Japan and Australia was back to 2019 levels by late June. India remains one of the most impacted markets globally. Processed transactions declined 13% in the quarter. Although this lags volume growth due to a mix shift, the trajectory of the processed transactions recovery is similar improving from a 24% decline in April to a 4% decline in June. Growth in July through the 21st is flat. Domestically, the mix of spend has shifted from low ticket to higher ticket categories. Cross-border transactions on the other hand are holding up better than volumes due to the mix shift from high ticket travel-related spending to lower ticket non-travel e-commerce. Cross-border -- constant dollar cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe declined 47% in the third quarter. Volumes declined 51% in April and improved marginally in May to decline 45%, but there has been little -- since. For the month of June and in July through the 21st, the rate of decline has stayed at 44%. Constant dollar cross-border volume including volume within Europe declined 37% in the quarter. It's important to remind you that cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe drives our international fees. As you know, the cross-border spend decline is driven by travel. Travel-related spend, which includes both card present and card not present in travel categories represented roughly two-third of our pre-COVID cross-border volume excluding volume within Europe. Travel-related spend declined 78% in the quarter and was still declining over 70% at the end of June. To have a recovery in cross-border travel, you have to have a reopening of borders. At this point, borders remain largely closed. The World Tourism Organization reported at the end of June that out of 217 countries, 189 or 87% had completely or partially closed their borders to foreign visitors. Of the remaining 28 countries, 10 had completely or partially suspended flights. Several other countries like the U.K. require quarantines and the rest had imposed visa restrictions or demand medical certificates. As we speak, cross-border travel, especially by air is even not possible or very difficult. While no one corridor derives a large portion of our volumes -- drives a large portion of our volumes, some of our most important corridors remain closed. Borders have to reopen before we can get a sense of what the cross-border recovery trajectory might be. In the few corridors, where cross-border travel is now possible, we have seen some significant recoveries. For example Americans are traveling again to Mexico and the Caribbean. Since the April low, these corridors have seen cross-border card-present volumes recover by 30 to 40 points. Travel to and from Switzerland to France and Germany is almost back to normal. Russian travel to neighboring countries has picked up. Travel from Europe to the UAE is gaining momentum. It is important to note that the vast majority of cross-border travel spend is on personal cards and not for business travel. Consumer travel demand for visits to friends relatives and for vacations is more likely to remain intact post-COVID perhaps even enhanced. The consumer travel recovery is likely to start with people going to countries within their geographic zone of comfort. This is already evident as we look at short-haul cross-border travel which we define as less than 3,000 miles. Short-haul air travel is recovering faster than longer haul corridors. Similarly drive to hotels are doing better as are leisure hotels versus business hotels. Growth in cross-border e-commerce spend excluding travel has been consistently in the high teens to low 20s since mid-April. The strong growth is fueled by retail spending which is growing about 30% since mid-April and drives the majority of non-travel e-commerce spend. In most countries, we see that once a consumer decides to buy something online rather than go to a local store, there is a higher likelihood the purchase becomes cross-border with little regard to where the item is shipped from. The strength in retail is offset by declines in entertainment, education, and government some of which are tied to travel and represent a meaningful portion of card-not-present non-travel spend. Much of the color I just provided excludes volume within Europe. Within the EU, borders have largely reopened. Intra-Europe cross-border card-present spend is up 40 points from the trough in April through three weeks in July, another indication of the possible trajectory of the cross-border recovery when borders do reopen. A quick review of our third quarter financial results. Net revenues declined 17% in the quarter or 16% in constant dollars. Third quarter service revenues were flat with prior year and reflect last quarter's volumes. Data processing revenues declined 5% supported by strong value-added services growth as well as acquisition-related revenue. International transaction revenues decreased 44% in line with the decline in cross-border volumes excluding volume within Europe. Other revenues declined 8% over the prior year due to value-added services impacted by the pandemic. The value-added services impacted by the pandemic include lower use of travel-related card benefits, lower marketing-related services for clients as many slowed marketing activities, and fees we waived on certain services which surged at the outset of the pandemic. We should note that had we reported service fees without a lag our service fees would have declined 11% and reported net revenues would have dropped an additional 4.5 points to approximately 21.5%. These lower service fees will impact our reported revenues next quarter. Before I move on, let me provide some more detail on where value-added services revenues are captured in the P&L. In the third quarter, total value-added services revenue grew in the mid-teens including acquisitions. Approximately two-thirds of our value-added services revenues are included in data processing as many of them are transaction-based revenue streams. These value-added services grew in the mid-teens driven by the strength in U.S. debit and prepaid issuer processing, CyberSource, as well as authentication and fraud services as Al highlighted. The remaining value-added services revenue is split roughly evenly between service fees and other revenue. Value-added services and service fees also grew in the mid-teens. Value-added services recorded in other revenues grew in the mid-single -igits due to acquisitions, increased use of our data products, and consulting, offset by declines in the usage of card benefits and marketing services I described earlier. Client incentives declined 2% versus last year and were 23.8% of gross revenue. As we've indicated before, the vast majority of incentives are tied to payments volumes. However, incentives declined less than gross revenue pushing up incentives as a percent of gross revenue. Let me explain why. First, incentives are generally tied to total payments volumes and only selectively to cross-border volumes. As declines in cross-border volumes have been deeper than total payments volumes and cross-border volumes have higher yields, incentive declines lag gross revenue declines. Second, heavy renewal activity like we had in fiscal year 2019, causes incentives to grow faster than gross revenue. As a result, the decline in incentives lags gross revenue on the way down. Offsetting these factors to some degree is the service fee lag. As I mentioned earlier, service fee lag mitigated the gross revenue decline reported this quarter. This will impact us negatively next quarter. Third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses declined 5% as we were able to execute additional cost management initiatives, particularly in the areas of marketing and G&A. These expense reductions were achieved while sustaining investments in our longer-term growth initiatives. Acting early and decisively has helped us to reduce expenses fast. Non-GAAP non-operating expense was $118 million for the fiscal third quarter. Interest income was lower due to the sharp drop in interest rates. Interest expense was higher from our $4 billion debt issue. The non-GAAP tax rate was 19%.  Finally, some perspectives on the fourth quarter. Forecasting revenues remains a challenge in this environment. It is difficult to predict when borders will reopen and what the trajectory of the cross-border travel recovery will be post re-openings. Domestic volumes have bounced back nicely in most countries and inevitably the rate of recovery will slow. Other uncertainties include the impact of the recent spike in infections and the economic impact of stimulus payments tapering off or ending altogether around the world.  A few points to note as you model revenue growth for the next quarter. As I indicated earlier had we reported service revenues without a lag, third quarter net revenue would have declined an additional 4.5 points. This will cause fourth quarter reported net revenue growth to be lower than the third quarter absent the change in trend on key business drivers.  Continued recovery in domestic payments volumes and transactions will improve the data processing revenue trend, but not reported service revenues. This will be partially offset by higher incentives related to the increasing volumes. As such the most important variable that would improve the fourth quarter net revenue growth rate is cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe.  One other point to note driven by these turbulent times: if the cross-border recovery remains sluggish through the fourth quarter, the revenue mix shift away from cross-border will persist. Adding in the impact of the service fee lag, incentives as a percent of gross revenues are likely to increase by two to three points over the third quarter levels. This percentage should normalize as cross-border volumes improve and the domestic volume recovery stabilizes.  Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter are expected to decline roughly in line with the reductions we delivered in the third quarter. Non-GAAP non-operating expenses are expected to be around $140 million. Even with a significant COVID-19 impact, we expect to generate a very healthy level of free cash flow this year. We ended the quarter with over $17 billion of cash equivalents and investment securities on hand. With access to the commercial paper market on favorable terms and our $5 billion revolver our liquidity position remains strong.  In the third quarter, we bought back 5.2 million shares for almost $900 million at an average price of $180.47. Year-to-date, we bought back 36 million shares for $6.5 billion at an average price of approximately $180. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. Crises create both risks and opportunities. We have moved fast to mitigate risks by ensuring strong liquidity, reducing expenses while sustaining key growth investments and closely monitoring network performance, security, daily settlement, fraud and other key metrics. The crisis accelerated many favorable secular trends: the digitization of cash, the shift to e-commerce and the penetration of tap to pay.  Visa Direct momentum has remained very strong and value-added services have continued to grow in the mid-teens. Our focus remains on helping all our stakeholders, cardholders, clients, governments, regulators and of course, our own associates as they navigate through these unusual times.  With that I'll turn this back to Mike. Al maybe we should turn to questions. Operator, why don't we move to questions? Okay. Mike is suggesting we keep going. Okay. Okay, Al. Yes. So I talked about why debit was outperforming credit. As you may have heard debit has bounced back about 30 points and is now growing at about 25% in the first three weeks of July whereas credit recovered by less than that and is still declining 9% through the first three weeks of July, whereas credit recovered by less than that and is still declining 9% through the first three weeks of July. I went through six reasons for that. I'll do those quickly. Economic impact payments going directly into checking accounts helps debit. In times of economic uncertainty, consumers do shift spending away from money they have borrowed, to money they have in the bank. Third reason, the shift to online has caused a lot of everyday spend categories to move to e-commerce, which has favored debit, because normally debit is used for everyday purchases. Affluent customers reason number four, tend to use credit for discretionary purposes like travel, entertainment and restaurants, which have been especially hard-hit in times like these. The economic impact payments this is reason number five, were distributed using Visa prepaid cards in 20 states, including the unemployment benefits which lifted our debit growth in May and June. And then finally, Visa Direct, which helps our debit numbers was up over 75% this quarter as a whole bunch of use cases performed really well. So I think, we'll probably stop there Al and take questions. I think we might have lost Mike, so we can take questions. Yes we can. Al, I might add a couple of things. One crisis fosters innovation as you know. And if anything this has made more and more merchants focus on omni-channel commerce which CyberSource is very much in the middle of. And increasingly merchants are getting better and better at serving customers, seamlessly across bricks-and-mortar as well as e-commerce. It has also made a lot of categories that never used e-commerce become a lot better at e-commerce. And that's \u2013 you've seen that in a lot of everyday spend categories. You've seen that with restaurants. And more broadly across retail people have come up with more innovative ways like curbside delivery has been perfected in many ways. And that we think is going to be here with us, which is really a way where you order online but you may pick up physically. So you have one more delivery option, you can get it delivered after a day or two delay or you can get it right away by going and picking it up. So there's a lot going on. And I think the most important point that Al made was that even as we've seen card-present improve from minus 50 to minus high single-digits, card-not-present has stayed very robust continuing to grow at those mid-20s levels for quite a while now. So lots of changes underway. Sure. So if you look at the various lines on the revenue line, service fees as you indicated and as we told you in the comments are known already. They're going to report service fees based on our volumes in the third quarter. And the volumes in the third quarter was hopefully the low point. And as we said had we not done a lag, our service fees would have been down 11% and total net revenue would have been down as you said in that 4, 4.5 range. So that is going to happen. That's a known fact. And even if volumes improve on the domestic front and transactions improve, the service fee number isn't going to change next quarter. So that's locked in. So when volumes do improve which we expect will be the case on domestic volumes and transactions, transactions revenues will definitely go up. Value-added services revenues will definitely go up. But the other thing that goes up is the contra-revenue line incentives. Incentives will go up to reflect the higher volumes because we don't book incentives with a lag. Incentives will go up but the benefit of that revenue from the higher incentives we won't get on the services line \u2013 service fee line, we will get it on \u2013 we will definitely get it on the processing line. So there's something of an offset there. I just want you to be aware of that. But the biggest variable is going to be cross-border. If there's a change in trend in cross-border and it improves then that would be the single biggest reason to expect Q4 trends to be better than Q3, recognizing that you've got pressure going in the other direction from the service fee lag. So there's some complexity created by these things because of the turbulent times we're in. We've tried to help you with it. And hopefully, we can help you some more if you like answer more questions later on. Yes. I think the other things to add there, three of our largest value-added services we think are going to sustain their growth which has already accelerated. Our issuer processing business, which is directed towards debit. Debit has become the engine for cash conversion right now. Debit growth rates as you saw are 25% in the first three weeks of July. So as long as debit growth rates are at an accelerated level, the issuer processing business will clearly have high growth rates. CyberSource always benefits from the shift to e-commerce. And now with their focus on omnicommerce, CyberSource clearly is benefiting from the shift. And then finally our risk and fraud services, certainly benefit as things move more to e-commerce which is where fraud is an area that we can really help a lot on. So they're reasons to believe that higher growth rates can sustain post-COVID. Since we had some issues earlier we'll run longer. So we'll probably go for at least 10 minutes past the hour. Yes. In times like these I think it's not easy to make long-term projections clearly. In terms of cross-border and its recovery yes it's possible I suppose that it remains sluggish. It all depends on borders reopening. Wherever borders have been opened or the restrictions have not been significant, we've seen some pretty quick recoveries. So to the extent that there are borders reopening, it may not be globally but there could be corridors opening up as we're already hearing Australia, New Zealand you've seen that it's mostly open across the EU. It's starting to open in other geographies within regions. So it's not black and white, I think in terms of the cross-border recovery. You could see some changes in travel patterns because of how countries open up. But if cross-border remains depressed certainly the mix won't help us. And that will cause the percentage of incentives to gross revenue to stay higher than what you might call -- what it would might have been normalized mix of earnings -- of revenues. The other factor that's influencing it is probably most acute in the fourth quarter which is the service fee lag. Normally our service fees from one quarter to another don't have such significant swings because our business tends to be quite stable, so that service fee lag effect will moderate. So I think the best way to describe it is, it will probably normalize from the levels you see in the fourth quarter. It will certainly normalize because of service fee stabilizing. It will probably normalize some because the cross-border business will recover in corridors, but we'll wait and see how fast cross-border normalizes. Yes. There are some modest yield differences depending on parts of the world and so on. I don't think you should view that as a huge factor. In terms of the reasons that might stick as we go ahead, I think we went through five reasons. One, the economic impact payments and unemployment benefits being distributed on Visa prepaid cards, clearly, that's linked to the crisis and probably is not something that will continue. Affluent customers putting off some discretionary items like travel entertainment and restaurants, which has hit credit in particular, that probably normalizes over time, so that you can attribute to COVID. The propensity for people to spend money -- spend the money they have versus money from -- borrowed money that is something you do see in times of uncertainty. And then, some of the economic incentive impact payments going into checking accounts, clearly, has helped debit. But there's a few others that are clearly sticking. The fact that Visa Direct is still going very strong, that has been helping debit for a long time and we'll continue to do that. The fact that debit has become the mechanism for cash conversion to digital in everyday spend categories and in just about -- in most categories, which have seen a big increase in e-commerce has benefited debit, I think some of that sticks. So I think the best way to describe it is that, the acceleration of cash conversion has disproportionately helped debit and that is most likely going to stick. Yes. So I think it's very important to continue to point people to the decline of cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe volumes. The decline was roughly -- was 47% in cross-border constant dollar volumes excluding intra-Europe. So the revenue decline is, roughly as you can see, in line with that. The reason being that -- and if you look at total cross-border volume that includes intra-Europe. Intra-Europe looks more like a domestic transaction. In fact in our international revenue line, the contribution from intra-Europe transactions is very small. The international revenue line is driven almost entirely by volume excluding intra-Europe. Now there's a few other things there that can have an impact. Exchange rate shifts can. Changes in currency volatility can. So that explains -- and then, some small changes in mix in terms of which corridors are doing better than others, because of some yield differences across corridors. But that explains the 44% decline in revenues versus the 47% decline in volumes ex intra-Europe. But as you can see watching that volume line ex intra-Europe is the best indicator and that's what you should focus on. Right. There's two factors driving it. One is that, cross-border transactions have held up a little better than cross-border volume. So the mix has helped a bit, because cross-border transactions for processing have a higher yield. And the second is we have value-added services and some acquisitions in that line. And as you heard, value-added services are growing in the mid-teens in that line. So those two things have helped data processing yields go up. The variables that can make a difference there, first of all the 44% to 47% is a relatively small delta. There'll always be some differences between the two. They won't match each other precisely. But you're right, currency volatility is one factor. Another factor would be mix. Certain corridors can have better yields than others. So if the recovery of cross-border favors higher-yielding corridors, you can have something of a difference. But other than that, it should track pretty closely to volumes, ex intra-Europe volumes."

Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Milotich, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Jordan. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Visa's fiscal second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted to the IR Web site. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's Web site and the Investor Relations section of our Web site. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and the reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And one last note before we get started. Given the amount of content we have today we want to allow time for Q&A, and so we're likely to run over by a few minutes. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Hey, Mike, thank you very much. And good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us today. First and foremost, I hope you and your families are well and safe. A year that looked quite promising after a solid first quarter has been substantially disrupted by COVID-19. While the business has been negatively impacted, in March and April, our focus has been doing the right things for our employees, our clients, and our communities around the world whose lives have been affected in unimaginable ways. We continue to manage our business for the long-term although we are pragmatic in understanding short-term circumstances. Through that end we are certainly being quite careful about our spending on our expense base, and we are pulling back on discretionary spending especially related to personnel, travel, professional services, and marketing. Throughout all of this we remain committed to investing in the future, in product development, in technology, our brand, and business development. You may recall that at our Investor Day we laid out a compelling case for Visa's growth as we look to be a single point of connection for money movement globally. And there are three primary levers to that growth, consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. I want to be absolutely clear that nothing has changed about these opportunities in terms of the medium and long-term growth for the company. On our call today, I'm going to cover our results, our response to COVID-19, and some updates on the underlying business and long-term prospects for growth. To start, our second quarter results. Net revenues in fiscal second quarter were $5.9 billion, an increase of 7% or 8% in constant dollars. Although cross-border volumes were already weakening in February, driven by Asia, for the most part the business drivers were not meaningfully impacted by COVID-19 until the latter part of March. A quick snapshot on our quarterly results are as follows. Payments volume grew globally 5% or 7% excluding China, with over 500 million transactions on Visa per day for each of the 91 days in the second quarter. Cross-border volume declined 2% on a constant dollar basis, and we processed 34.9 billion transactions on our network, an increase of 7% over the prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS growth was 9%, helped by prudent expense management. We recognize, given the environment, that the investment community would appreciate as much information on our performance as possible. And to that end, Vasant will dive into more detail than usual when I am finished my remarks. Since the COVID-19 outbreak we've been in very close and regular contact with employees, clients, partners, and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times. Our foremost priority is the health and wellbeing of our employees and their families. To that end, I pledge to our 20,000 employees that there would be no layoffs in calendar year 2020 related to COVID-19. We recognize the critical role Visa plays in maintaining the stability, security, and resiliency of the global payments ecosystem. And let me state that our network infrastructure and application performance has been unaffected even as we transition the vast majority of our employees to a work-from-home status. Our business operations have comprehensive and coordinated plans in place to address business continuity and recovery needs around the world. We're working closely with our clients in a number of initiatives, starting with tap to pay which has gained even more momentum in the United States with issuers and merchants as they seek to reduce the need for cardholders to make physical contact at the terminal. Navy Federal recently started issuing tap to pay cards. So now nine of top 10 U.S. issuers are participating, and we have surpassed 175 million tap to pay cards in the United States that have been issued, that is more than any other country on the globe. On the merchant side, a large grocery chain recently rolled out tap to pay to more than a thousand stores, so now nine of the top 10 grocery stores are enabled for tap to pay. At the end of the second quarter almost 60% of face-to-face transactions, excluding the United States, were tap to pay. And tap to pay transactions grew over 40% year-over-year. We've also launched a Web site where merchants can request free tap to pay signage for their terminals. And large merchants like KFC and Pizza Hut have ordered them for all their stores in the United States. Globally, we actively engaged with merchants, acquirers, issuers, and governments to increase tap to pay limits. In fact, over 50 markets in the last few weeks have announced increases. To name a few, 26 European countries, including the U.K., Poland, and Ireland, 25 countries in the Middle East and Africa, including the Ukraine, Georgia, and Egypt. Also Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have increased their limits. And we expect other countries to follow recognizing the benefits of digital payments. Visa is also working closely with governments around the world to respond to the crisis in a number of ways. For example, in the Dominican Republic we developed a virtual prepaid solution to rapidly expand the government's emergency disbursement program, from 800,000 to 1.5 million beneficiaries. Likewise, we will be deploying Visa Direct solution to support Guatemala's emergency relief program to reach two million households over the next three months. In the United States, Visa supports over two dozen state government programs, including unemployment insurance programs. And given the environment, we are seeing a 400% growth in accountholders just in the last. Data is another area where Visa has been able to assist governments during the crisis. We're providing helpful insights into economic performance to nearly 20 government agencies around the world. Visa is also helping our communities. We recently announced the commitment by the Visa Foundation of $210 million to support two programs. $10 million towards charitable organization on the frontlines responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as public health and food relief in each of the five geographic regions in which Visa operates, and $200 million to support small and micro businesses around the world with a focus on fostering women's economic advancement. Let me now shift to updates on the underlying business, which will be really very good for us in the medium to long-term prospects for growth. Even with COVID-19, commerce and innovation continued, and our core business had a number of positive developments with several key relationships renewed and new partnerships formed. This is all in support of the opportunities for meaningful growth that we see in consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Let me just highlight a few of them. In the United States, these are one two notable deals from issuers who recently completed mergers and previously had contracts with both Visa and the competitive network. We are very pleased to announce the extension and meaningful expansion of our consumer credit, consumer debit, small business, and commercial issuing, as well as our DPS debit processing partnerships with Truist, the sixth largest U.S. issuing bank. We look forward to working with this bank on a myriad of Truist brand building, innovation, and consumer experience efforts in the years ahead. Additionally, following the merger of TCF Bank and Chemical Bank to create the 27th largest banks in the United States, these are one of the existing business and new debit business. In Europe, we continue to make progress. In the U.K., we extended our long standing partnership with Barclays, which processes nearly half of the UK's debit and credit transactions, enabling us to jointly focus on innovation and support Barclays' growth into new markets. Also in the U.K., Visa signed an extended agreement with Cooperative Bank, building on our 30-year relationship to support their 3.4 million retail and small business customers. In France, Visa renewed a 10-year agreement with Group BPCE, our largest client in Continental Europe with more than 40 million customers. Visa and one of the largest German Banks Comdirect Bank announced an agreement to issue consumer debit cards and grow their consumer credit business, and ING-DiBa extended its relationship with Visa for both debit and credit. A Pan-European commercial bank selected Visa to grow their consumer credit and corporate card business across six European markets: Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the rest of the world, we renewed and expanded partnerships with some of our largest clients. We renewed deals with two large debit issuers, Al Rajhi Bank, the largest retail bank in Saudi Arabia, and Chunghwa Post, the Post Office in Taiwan. In Australia, we signed a 10-year exclusive issuing partnership renewal with the Bank of Queensland, one of Australia's leading regional banks to serve their close to 1 million personal and business customers. In Latin America and the Caribbean, we extended partnerships with the largest issuers we have in Panama, Peru, Jamaica and Costa Rica. In Brazil, we were chosen as the preferred brand by Caixa, the largest banking customers and debit card issuance; and XP, a leading investment platform that is moving to issue digital credentials and cards. We also obtained our license to operate as a clearinghouse for card payments in Mexico, which will allow Visa to provide domestic network processing services. This is a key step for Visa to bring innovative solutions as well as World Class security and reliability to a very important market. As you know, Visa is the global co-brand leader and this quarter was no exception in terms of sizable wins. We announced the co-brand partnership with core hotels as the fourth largest global hotel chain with 39 brands such as Fairmont and Sofitel. This represents the most significant de novo co-brand opportunity in the travel sector in recent history. Our partnership will expand the Accor Live Limitless Loyalty program to its 64 million loyal member base and more than 250 million customers globally. In February, United Airlines Chase and Visa announced an extension of our long-term credit card partnership into 2029. Visa is proud we've extended our partnership with United and Chase. We're excited to bring the strength of our brand and network to continue building on the program's success to deliver even more value and cardholder engagement. As Visa seeks to grow our consumer business, wallets remain very important for both new issuance and acceptance and we've made noteworthy progress this quarter. Previously mentioned partnership agreements with Paytm in India and Toss in South Korea are now issuing credentials. In addition, we add new wins with STC Pay in Saudi Arabia, AGA in Nigeria, PayCo in Korea, and Kias in Japan. In China, we signed a five-year partnership with Tencent, the parent of the WeChat platform with more than 1 billion monthly active users. This collaboration with Visa marks Tencent's first co-brand card with an international card scheme. And we look forward to partnering on innovative cross-border solutions for Chinese credential holders. In Sub-Saharan Africa, we've announced a strategic partnership with Safaricom, the largest telecommunications firm in Kenya, and the provider of financial services through M-PAiSA. With 24 million M-PAiSA users and 173,000 M-PAiSA merchants, wallet partnerships like these are paramount to expanding our issuance and acceptance globally. Collectively with WeChat and Safaricom, we now have relationships with wallet providers that give us the potential to embed Visa credentials in two billion wallets. Shifting to new flows with $185 trillion of opportunity, we're focused on moving money end-to-end for businesses, governments and consumers. In Europe, we're working with Lydia the number one Fintech in France for the younger, younger people that are below 30 in age and a P2P service with over three million users and growing at over 4,000 users per day. In the United States, we recently renewed our important relationship with Square for their cash app program, including Visa Direct capabilities and the cash card issuing platform. Visa Direct continues to be a powerful capability, especially in the COVID-19 environment. As one specific example, Visa Direct transactions for workers speaking earned wage access or on demand pay across supermarkets, quick serve restaurants, healthcare, and hospitality categories increased well over 100% year-over-year this quarter. We're also working on digitizing cross-border P2PAY. This quarter Remitly launched cross-border in seven countries. MoneyGram expanded to 11 additional countries and KB Kookmin card one of the leading issuers in South Korea also initiated a cross-border program, all with Visa Direct. Cross-border also plays a sizable role in the B2B space. And we entered into an agreement for B2B virtual cards with ICBC, the largest bank in China, representing our first B2B partnership with a bank in China. Visa and Australian cross-border Fintech Airwallex announced the new Global Partnership with the launch of a borderless B2B cross-border card, and we continue to look for new ways to drive new flows with unique capabilities and solutions. Value-added services are an extension of our core business and represent a significant opportunity for us to deepen relationships, help clients and grow our business. This quarter was no exception in terms of clients looking for assistance. In DPS, in addition to Truist, we renewed six issuer deals that represent nearly 20% of DPS's annual transaction volume. In terms of disputes, our recently acquired Disputes platform Verified signed an agreement with a large e-commerce provider to enable the delivery of key transaction details from their CRM systems to issuers in near real time which helps prevent disputes and reduces charge-backs. In terms of data, as you can imagine, our clients are very interested in benchmarking their performance throughout the quarter, leveraging our Visa Analytics platform. Nearly 5,000 client users were enabled at the end of the quarter, accessing 33% more reports than the first quarter for a total of 90,000 reports access. In consulting, clients are consulting and analytics at an increased rate. We delivered approximately 50% more projects than in the second quarter of last year. The CyberSource business continues to gain momentum globally and supportive acquirers and merchants around the world with innovative Omnicommerce, gateway, and fraud management services. For example in India, CyberSource is now the market leading payments gateway, in part due to the introduction of our safe quick technology for e-commerce merchants, which allows card holders to enroll and store card information for quick and secure checkout. Merchants also saw a 15% increase in authorization rates when using Safe Click. These are just some examples of how during challenging times our clients look to us. So, in closing, you can see that there's a lot of business momentum. Yes, there is no doubt that our performance will continue to be impacted by COVID-19. We continue to focus our attention on supporting the shift to e-commerce, the acceleration of PathToPay and do digital payments, as well as providing our clients with critical value added services. Although the road ahead will certainly have its challenges for a number of quarters, our business model is resilient, and our strategy to enable the movement of money globally is more relevant than ever. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. This is an unprecedented time. And we know you all have many questions about the COVID-19 impact on our business. To provide you with up-to-date data in this fast-moving crisis, we will discuss trends occurring after the quarter ended more than we normally would. Also, while the absolute level of growth or decline is important, the second derivative of the rate of change in trend lines is equally important. To help you with all this, we've added a slide to our earnings presentation with weekly data for March and for April through the 28th. This slide provides additional details on U.S. payments volume growth, as well as process transaction and cross-border volume growth. Starting with U.S. payments volume, after strong growth in January and February, payments volumes dropped precipitously in the second-half of March, as lockdowns went into effect across the U.S. By the last week of March, payments volumes were declining 28%. Credit spending was harder hit than debit and declines have been more than 25% every week in April. On the other hand, debit was down in the mid-teen through the first two weeks of April and spiked into positive territory in both week three and week four as the first wave of economic impact payments were distributed. It is too early to tell if this uptrend in the second-half of April is the start of a recovery, a new plateau, or will fade in a couple of weeks. Through April 28, U.S. payments volumes are down 19%, debit is down 6%, and credit is down 31%. As may be expected, there is a drastic difference in thought present and card not present performance with card not present or ecommerce volume excluding travel up 18% in April and card present volume down 45%. There are also significant differences in how lockdowns have been impacting spend categories. One-fifth of U.S. payments volume is full in drugstores along with Walmart, Costco and target. This is the only category still growing up approximately 20% in April, and essentially all this growth is coming from online spending up over 100% in the last two weeks of April, assisted by the adoption of curbside pickup and delivery. Another one-fifth of U.S. TV is in categories that are less discretionary, like telecom, utilities, insurance, and business supplies and equipment. These are holding up relatively well, shrinking less than 15% at the end of March, and have recovered to flat with a prior in April. A third of our U.S. payments volume is in categories that are declining between 15% to 50%, such as retail, automotive, healthcare, education and government. There are significant variations in performance within these categories with more essential purchases showing more resiliency. For example, home improvements within retail, or hospital and medical equipment within healthcare, categories where spending can be delayed or is more discretionary or more heavily impacted. For example, a federal spending within retail or dentist and doctor visits within healthcare. About one-fourth of our payments volume is in the hardest hit categories, including travel, fuel, restaurants and entertainment, all declining over 50% in April. The travel decline affects all sub sectors and is the deepest at around 80%. Fuel declines were driven both by falling prices and fewer gallons purchased, which typically offset one another to some degree, but not right now. Within restaurants, quick service restaurants are holding up better, in part due to being better equipped for this environment, but apps drive-thru and delivery infrastructures already in place. Within entertainment, amusement parks and movie theaters are especially hard hit, while gaming is a small component of the category is up over 200% Visa Direct activity has slowed a bit, but growth remains robust at around 70% in second quarter and in April. Use cases such as P2P and food delivery disbursements even accelerated while ride sharing and merchant settlement disbursements are negatively impacted. As economic impact payments have been distributed, we have seen significant increases in home improvement, automotive, health care and some retail goods and services categories. Travel fuel restaurant entertainment categories have not benefited. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 4% and over 7% excluding China in the second quarter. Growth remains strong CEMEA, and Latin America growing 19% and 14% respectively, in part due to climate both regions. Asia-Pacific, excluding China grew 3%, decelerating four percentage points from the last quarter, as the COVID-19 impact was significant starting in early February for a large part of the region. Europe grew 6%, down two percentage points versus last quarter, with the largest deceleration in central and southern Europe. Looking across some key international markets that we process the majority of transactions, major markets in Europe as well as Canada have trends similar to the U.S. both in terms of the trajectory and the depth of the decline. Australia appears to have lockdown better with a shallower decline. Much like the U.S., leverage in all these markets is outperforming credit, and there has been a tick up in the second-half of April. Within Asia, there are variations. Hong Kong dropped in early February along with the rest of China and appears to be recovering in April. Singapore dipped early then stabilized and has dropped sharply again under most stringent restrictions. Japan is on a downward trend, as a lockdown goes into effect. India with a very rigorous and sudden lockdown has experienced one of the fastest and deepest declines. Elsewhere, Brazil is doing relatively better so far. Across markets, performance by category is generally similar to the U.S. Differences across countries seem to be driven by the quality of the e-commerce infrastructure in place, and consumer adoption of digital payments prior to the outbreak. With economic stimulus payments in the second-half of April, categories benefiting the most are some sectors of retail like home improvement, business supplies and equipment, healthcare, education and government. Travel fuel, restaurants and entertainment generally remain depressed. In two key markets, where we do not process transactions, Korea and China we have some limited data sets. This data indicates Korea may have been among the least impacted markets. In April, a recovery is well underway in both markets. Process transactions grew 7% for the quarter, with sharp declines in March and are down 25% to April 28, slightly better than levels reached in the last week of March. Transactions typically grow several points faster than volume, as we penetrate small ticket transactions in everyday spend categories. In the recent uptrend or stimulus payments, that relationship has temporarily changed, as consumers have prioritized higher ticket categories like home improvement, and automotive over low ticket categories like restaurants and entertainment. Constant dollar cross-border volume declined 2% in the second quarter, or 5% excluding volume within Europe. Volume growth was strong and steady in January and started to slowdown in Asia by the second week of February, as the crisis spread around the world, we saw significant week on week volume declines in March, exiting the month declining 44% or 51% excluding intra-EU volumes, and volume remains down 43% to April 28 or 52% excluding intra-EU. The majority of the cross-border spend decline is travel related, both card present and card not present. All card present and travel related non-card present spend represents roughly two-thirds of our cross-border volume, excluding volume within Europe. This spend declined over 40% in the month of March, and is down 80% in April in line with the last week of March. The trajectory and depth of cross-border travel related declines is quite uniform across corridors and regions. Growth and cross-border e-commerce spend excluding travel decelerated in March, but remain positive led by retail spending. In April, cross-border ecommerce spending is recovering across categories and markets and has grown faster than pre-crisis levels. A quick review of our second quarter financial results, net revenues grew 7% in the quarter, or 8% in constant dollars. As a reminder, our service revenue is driven by last quarter's payment volume. Based on current quarter volumes, total net revenue growth would have been around two points lower. Second quarter service revenues grew 9%. Data processing revenues rose 11% supported by value added services and acquisition related revenue. International transaction revenues grew 2% continuing to benefit from last year's pricing actions. Other revenues rose 20% over the prior, aided by value added services. Client incentives were 22.6% of gross revenues, up slightly from last quarter. As we told you previously, the expected client incentives to step up due to high renewal activity, which continued in the second quarter as noted. The majority of client incentives are tied to overall payments volume growth in the current quarter, but there are contracts with clauses specific to cross-border, as well as annual or multi-year targets that are adjusted with changes in performance. GAAP operating expenses were up 4% excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring acquisition related costs. Non-GAAP expense growth was 3%. This is significantly lower than our original plans for the quarter as we moved fast reduce expenses when we saw the widest spreading more on expenses in the few minutes. GAAP non-operating expense was $95 million for the fiscal second quarter, including $2 million of med equity investment losses. Our GAAP Q2 tax rate was 19.4%. Moving now to how COVID-19 might affect the rest of this fiscal year. This pandemic is global in scope, very significant its impact and early in its evolution There is a high degree of uncertainty about what happens over the next few months. As is self-evident, a prior outlook for fiscal 2020 is no longer relevant. And it is not possible to provide you with any reliable forecasts for the second-half. Our revenue trajectory over the near term will be driven by three critical variables: first, the depth of the decline, second, the time we stay at trough level, and third, the trajectory of the recovery. It is impossible to reliably forecast for the depth of the decline, timing, trough and trajectory of recovery are going to be over the near term, especially since these variables differ across categories and countries. It will depends on many factors, which we will be tracking including city, county, state, and country decisions on when and how they reopen the staging of the reopening by business type and category. How permanent the shift in consumer behavior is by category, consumer willingness to engage in activities, where social distancing may be harder to execute, like dine in restaurants, mass entertainment, hotel stays, and airline travel, and when borders reopen, consumer confidence and venturing beyond the geographic zone of comfort. In the final analysis, this is a health crisis. As such consumer behavior and the pace of normalization will be significantly influenced by the availability of testing, advancements in therapeutics, and ultimately a vaccine. We have no crystal ball that allows us to reliably forecast revenues in this environment. As it relates to our revenue there is one point to note, we report service revenue with a one quarter lag, so when we have a recovery it will take another quarter before it shows up in reported service revenues. In fiscal year 2020, our third quarter will be helped, and the fourth quarter hurt by this lag. Why revenue outcomes are hard to predict? We can give you more clarity on expense outcomes, since we have more control over them. In early February, as we saw the impact of COVID-19 in Asia, we move fast to rethink our expense plans. As a result, we were able to reduce a second quarter expenses from our previous expectation of mid-teens growth to the 4% we reported. In fact, if you exclude the acquisition, we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19, which were not in our expenses in the second quarter last year, expenses were up only 1%. We have plans in place to hold second-half expenses flat compared to last year, and excluding acquisitions, our expenses will be down in the low single digits year-over-year. We're evaluating additional actions to reduce expenses even further. As you all know, ours is a business where expenses are largely fixed. And we want to preserve to the extent possible critical investments that will drive long-term growth in new flows and value-added services. Also, as Al has indicated, we will not layoff employees related to this crisis in calendar 2020. Operating within these parameters we have reduced expenses in the second-half by scaling back hiring plan to only the most critical roles, redeploying existing resources to high priority areas, reducing and redeploying marketing spend, as is planned for the now delayed Tokyo Olympics, prioritizing projects to reduce professional fees, and the use of external resources. And of course, like most companies, we're saving on travel and meetings for the foreseeable future. While we expect operating expenses to be flat or down in the second-half, non-operating expenses will be higher. With the $4 billion in debt reissued, in April, interest expenses will be higher, while interest income has dropped sharply with the rate declines. We now expect non-operating expense to in the $250 million in the second-half excluding gains on losses, versus $148 million in the first-half. Moving on to cash flow, liquidity, dividends and buybacks, our free cash flow in the first-half of fiscal year '20 has been tracking ahead of expectations. However, given the anticipated revenue decline in the second-half, our free cash flow this fiscal year will be below what we had planned last October. Despite the COVID-19 impact, given the cash characteristics of our business, we still expect to generate a very healthy level of free cash flow this year under any scenario. We ended the quarter with $13 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities on hand. Since the end of the quarter, we have added to our cash balance with our $4 billion debt issuance. We issued debt in three tranches, seven, 10, and 20-year maturities, at a weighted average coupon rate of 2.16%. We have ample liquidity with cash on hand as well as access to the commercial paper market on favorable terms, and a $5 billion revolver which remains undrawn. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. In the second quarter, we bought back 17.8 million shares for $3.2 billion at an average price of $180.10. Year-to-date we have bought back 30.9 million shares for $5.6 billion at an average price of $179.94. Our plan to buyback over $9 billion in stock this fiscal year remains unchanged. Crises bring with them both risks and opportunities, and this one is no different. We've acted fast to mitigate the risks. We are actively working on identifying and capturing the opportunities. It is very likely that this crisis could accelerate trends that were already underway, like the shift to ecommerce and the shift to digital forms of payment. It is speeding up tap to pay adoption, driving growth of new flow use cases we highlighted at our Investor Day, increasing demand for our value-added services, and offering opportunities to add to our capabilities through selective acquisitions. While our short-term performance will suffer a setback, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of our business. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: Thank you. Jordan, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning and I hope you guys are all staying well and healthy. Just a question now on the structural nature of travel, could you just talk about how you feel about cross-border travel and the structural impacts that might occur as a result, and when you expect it to rebound? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Sanjay. Hope you are well as well. Look, right now I think -- I don't know what percentage, but some huge percentage of countries are hunkered down, and that's largely driven by government mandates. I do think that over time people will -- obviously these lockouts will loosen up. And I think the first thing to come back will be domestic travel as people look at stretch their legs and move around a bit. I think cross-border travel will take a little bit longer to come back. I think we need some advances. And as Vasant made note of in his remarks, I think we're going to need some advances in terms of testing and therapeutics, and ultimately a vaccine will start to make everybody feel a lot more comfortable. So I think it's going to take some time and it's going to take -- but I think it will come back. I think it's possible that there could be some business travel that doesn't return at the same level given the fact that we're in an environment where people have been working from home for seven, eight, nine, 10 weeks depending upon the market, and realize that they can get done what they need to get done. So we'll have to see how that ultimately plays out. Offsetting that, Sanjay, is the reality that I think the cash displacement opportunity in the business as well as the explosion of ecommerce are going to be real structural opportunities that didn't really exist at the same level before COVID-19.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. So following up actually on that last question and answer, could you talk a little bit, Al, about the -- that evolution, if you will, of ecommerce and cash conversion. And related perhaps to the elements of the economics to your business of those types of transactions? And probably should have said at the outset, glad you are all healthy. Thanks for the extra data, and hope you can keep that up too.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Moshe, appreciate it. Hope you and your family are well as well. First of all, there isn't a tremendous amount of difference in terms of the economics to Visa whether it's credit or debt, or card present or card not present. There just isn't that much of a difference. I think that's the main point. I think beyond that we're seeing people during these last couple of months start to buy things in the ecommerce environment that they would typically buy in store, whether that's furniture, electronics, in some cases apparel. And I think to the degree that they've had good experiences, that that's a really good thing. And remember, when you think about ecommerce the reality is that it's a very, very positive thing for us because cash isn't a competitor in that space. So the reality is that we get a lot higher share from those transactions that go to ecommerce than we get in the face-to-face world, and I think there are some permanent changes. Now, whether gaming stays up at the level of that as people are finding things to do while they're home, I suspect that'll come back down a bit, but I think, in general, ecommerce will explode coming out of this.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, a couple of points -- data points to add to that. I mean you might have noticed that ecommerce -- cross-border ecommerce excluding travel is now trending at a faster growth rate than it was prior to the crisis, and a lot of that is what you might call retail spending. More than half of it falls into categories that are people buying goods and services on a cross-border ecommerce format. The other thing that perhaps could be permanent changes are there are categories now, for example, food and drug, where the propensity was more towards face-to-face transactions, that have had massive shifts to, obviously at this point for reasons where they have no alternative, to online buying. And some of these goods could be fairly permanent. And then beyond that, even face-to-face, there's certainly a growing tendency to not want to use cash, and also of course not even do -- just to tap your card. The aversion to cash could be persistent, which means that even in face-to-face transactions the penetration of digital forms of payment could be growing in a permanent and structural way faster then it might have prior to the crisis.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks so much for all this data. Just on the client incentive side, forgive me if I missed it, but did you give us a little bit of an outlook there on how to second-half might look on client incentives with all the wins that as we have listed. I heard the majority is tied to volume growth, but any other detail would be great. And then just as a quick follow-up on Truist, can we assume the legacy non-Visa SunTrust cards will be flipped or would those be reissued at expiration, just wanted to clarify that. Thanks. \nAl Kelly: Tien-Tsin, thank you, and hope you're well. I'll take the second-half and let Vasant comment on client incentives. We're obviously thrilled with [technical difficulty] deal came out, and over time there's going to be some cards swept, but we're going to work very hard to Truist. Remember, they're building a new brand here. So the BB&T and SunTrust brands, they're looking to sunset those and get the Truist brand out there as soon as possible. So I think given that these cards are a ongoing manifestation of the brand that are shown every time they get pulled out of the wallet, I think they're going to want the move fairly quickly, but we're still working through the details as the deal just recently got done. Vasant, you want to comment on the client incentives?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, Al. So on client incentives, I think you asked two questions. Our expectations in terms of client incentives as a percent of gross revenue, we gave you a range at the beginning of the year. I believe it was 22.5% to 23.5%. That range has not changed. So we still expect to be in that range, even as we've had, as we told you, a very, very high level of renewal activity as well as wins and so on, that Al went through. As far as how our incentives might respond to what's happening right now, the incentives are always meant to be linked to performance, and especially volume performance. So our incentives are pretty much linked to volume performance and should move with volumes. And that'll play out over the next few quarters. So hopefully that answers your two questions.\nTien-Tsin Huang: No, it does. I appreciate it, guys. Stay healthy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nBob Napoli: Hi, thank you and good afternoon everybody. A follow-up I guess on just the growth of value-added services and what you're seeing in the growth rate of value-added services over the last several weeks. And then I guess in line with adding the value-added services, the acquisition of Plaid, is that still on track, and how is Plaid performing?\nAl Kelly: Hey, Bob, thank you, nice to hear your voice. First in terms of value-added services, these tend to be excellent revenue streams and quite resilient. And some of them are certainly transaction-dependant, and the volume could go down, but honestly in times like this the value goes up though to our clients. So those would include things like CyberSource or our risk products or debit issuing processing products. And then obviously we have value-added services that really are not really tied to volume, and they're also extraordinarily valuable in times like that. I referenced two of them in my remarks, both the criticality of data to our clients, because everybody is seeing the numbers go down and they want to make sure that they're not way out of whack with where everybody else is, and then obviously consulting services. It's also an exciting time for us to be able to introduce other new clients to some of our value-added services. So the crisis gives us an opportunity to have dialogue and make sure that our clients are using all the tools that they can from Visa. So we're going to continue to make sure that we stay in close contact with our clients throughout this, and where appropriate introduce them to value-added services' offerings that they may not be using. As it relates to Plaid, we're on track. As you know, we have to go through regulatory review, and we expect to have that done by the end of the year, and we remain as excited about Plaid as we did when we talked about it at Investor Day. In terms of how it's doing, we don't own them so I can't really comment on that at this time.\nBob Napoli: Thanks, Al. Thanks, Vasant, appreciate it.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good evening, and good to hear your voices. The government involvement in the digitization of payments has been something that you mange very carefully because it has its pluses and minuses. As you're going through this crisis how do you anticipate how the governments might act differently with respect to digital payments coming out of the crisis, meaning any new regulations you could foresee, new government-funded initiatives, positives or negatives for your business? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Well, I think, Lisa, first of all, you're right on that I think that governments are just as interested in digitization as any other business at this point, and it helps with transparency, it helps them understand whether funds are going with more accuracy than they might get, they might get otherwise. Certainly, I think it's also possible that governments could on the other hand look at pricing in the marketplace. I continue to believe that pricing should be set by markets and not by governments. I think markets do a far better job of doing it than governments do, and I would say that specifically as it relates to Interchange, there's a tremendous amount of value delivered by our bank partners in terms of the credit, they extend to enable buying to the services they provide to the servicing they provide, to the fraud they provide, to the risk services they provide and rewards that they provide. So there's a tremendous amount of benefits that the economies of countries see and the individual citizens in those countries see. So and I would also say that any actions that would disrupt any type of recovery during a pandemic like this would be foolish and potentially very damaging.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citibank. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Al. Hi, Vasant. Hope you're all healthy, and appreciate the incremental detail. I wanted to ask about this pricing in the current environment, but the ability to exercise price improvements to reflect value and other factors and the willingness to use it when merchants are not in great shape. So that and then the quick follow-up just on the clarification on one of the charts, when I look at U.S. payments volume growth versus process transactions growth in the operational performance metrics mid-April, they both look down 30%, but now one is down 10% and the other is down 20%. So there's a different pace of recovery. I was wondering if you could explain that.\nVasant Prabhu: I can take that question on transactions versus payments volumes. And Al, I'm sure will take the other one. I had it in my comments. So, I'd encourage you to go back and look at them, but just to repeat that, it is we think a temporary shift. Typically, as you know, transactions growth does better than volume growth because we are penetrating more deeply into smaller and smaller transactions. The reason it's different in the last two weeks of April, is what we have seen is that as some of these stimulus payments have come through, people are prioritizing pent-up demand in areas like automotive, like home improvement, and they're not spending it on lower ticket categories, like entertainment and restaurants. So what you're seeing is a mixed shift in how people are spending money to hire higher ticket items. As a result, PV has improved more than transaction labs. So that's what you're seeing, and that's probably not what the long-term trend is going to be, but it's what we're seeing right now.\nAl Kelly: Hey, Ashwin, just let me first add to Vasant's comments, think about a normal day, when people actually go to work and they're not working from home, you go and you get some coffee at a gas station or at a mass transportation shop, you pay for your transit, you pay for your breakfast, you pay for your lunch, all of those kinds of everyday low ticket transactions are not happening in this environment. So, in addition to what Vasant was saying, you could just, that's a huge driver of the change here and why we're seeing higher average ticket costs, but lower level of transactions. The other question you asked was about pricing. Look, we're in an unprecedented period, certainly not something I've witnessed in my life where the impact of this pandemic is truly global. Our focus right now is to make sure that we're bringing as much stability through the payments ecosystem as possible, which is why we get into our major co-release this month of April where we normally do, and I don't know that we've ever not done it before, but this is the times where it was called for, and I think we're going to certainly be very cognizant of the uniqueness of this time in terms of pricing. As like, I think most companies in most industries will be reevaluating their plans on all kinds of fronts, including the pricing lever and how much they pull it given this new reality.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Bye. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hi, thanks guys. I'm glad everybody's doing okay there. Look, I wanted to start off just if we, Al, if we had to sort of put all the pieces together a longer-term, and assume that some travel maybe wouldn't come back per se, we're not sure yet, but there are enough positive implications of what's happening around contactless incremental flows, more digital and maybe some of your services that you think can actually offset that. Is this, I mean, have you done the work to think about whether those can add up to maybe offset, but then just one quick follow-up would be on capital allocation. I guess I maybe I missed it, but I didn't hear anything about changing plans around buybacks or anything along those lines. Can you just give us some update on that? Thanks guys.\nAl Kelly: So, I'll tackle the first question, and let Vasant tackle the question on capital allocation and buybacks. So Darrin, I again, I think that there are -- and we're still talking about it there might be others, but I think the big, big opportunities here are e-commerce and cash displacement. Cash, $18 trillion spent on cash, and I think people are realizing that currency is a germ-carrying mechanism, and people don't want to be subject to it moving from one person to another person, it's actually catching the joins that way. So I do think cash displacement is going to really, really take off, and we've seen that in terms of the interest of governments to raise contactless limits, the interest of merchants to move to contactless, the interest of issuers, who are lagging behind to issue contactless enabled cards, and I hope we see it, as we start to talk to long tail sellers or merchants, who might have here to for resisted jumping into card acceptance, and they'll realize now that they really need to on a going forward basis if people shun cash. So, I think that's a big opportunity. Likewise, I think e-commerce is a big opportunity, and I think Ryan McInerney in his presentation, talked about the fact that somewhere around $0.15 or $0.16 on every dollar around the world is spent on visa cards and the face-to-face world, but when you move into the world of e-commerce, it's like $0.44 or $0.45 that's a big opportunity for us. And then as you said, and I mentioned earlier, I think there'll be some negative on travel, certainly in the short-term, and I think that people are going to be quite reticent to leave their country in the short-term until there is some advances because they don't want to be, they want to be stuck somewhere. They don't want to be for a prolonged period of time. So I think the degree that travel comes back is not clear, but I think this world is still a world of globe -- full of global citizens who ultimately are going to feel the urge and the desire to get back on airplanes and explore the vastness of the earth. We have not done the work, Darrin to say how these things offset one another. I think at this point we're more interested in studying the things that Vasant referred to in his remarks to get a better sense of kind of just the recovery before we get into how this might create some permanent change. Obviously, these are things we're talking about, but not things we've dimensioned as of yet, but I do think there is some exciting opportunities that will largely your offset or fully offset the changes in consumer behavior as it relates to grab. Let me ask Vasant to answer your question on capital allocation Darrin.\nVasant Prabhu: So, with the list of capital allocation, first in line of course, as we want to invest as much as we need to in our business because we still think the long-term growth opportunity remains extraordinary, and to that end, even as we scale back expenses, we have preserved the investment in critical growth areas like new payment flows, including Visa Direct, B2B in our value-added services. So that's part one. Part two is M&A. We remain very focused on adding to our capabilities where it makes sense through acquisitions, and there may be some opportunities here over the next months and years, and certainly Plaid is something we're looking forward to closing on as Al said, but M&A would be next in line. In terms of dividends, there has been no change in our dividend policy. In fact, last week, our board approved our regular quarterly dividend. So those of you who are owners of our shares will get that soon. And finally, in terms of buybacks, we have had no changes in plans. As I mentioned in my comments, we have bought back $3.2 billion in stock in the second fiscal quarter. So through the first-half, we bought back $5.6 billion. So we're a little ahead of our pace. Since we view this particular crisis as structurally one that does not diminish our business in the long run and most likely enhances it, and we don't see any long-term secular trend lines changing. We felt that in period, in the month of March, our stock was trading below our views of intrinsic value, and therefore we were buyers. So there has been no change in our buyback program. We do have plenty of liquidity. We're watching that very closely. As I told you, we had $13 billion in cash and cash like instruments on hand, and then we issued $4 billion in debt. So, as we speak, we're close to $17 billion in cash on hand. So we are very focused on ensuring adequate liquidity, and that is cash on hand not counting our revolver or even our access to commercial paper markets. So, hopefully that addresses all your questions.\nDarrin Peller: Yes, it's helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon, thank you for taking my question. So I have a follow-up on e-commerce, as you noted that e-commerce very good for you as cash is simply not an option. Can you expand upon other benefits Visa sees in e-commerce in terms of greater sought services, tokenization value added as we process more of those digital transactions. And then as a follow-up based on what you're seeing in the market is the uptick in e-com usage coming from people who are already very avid e-com users or is it new demographics GOs were also coming online, who were historically reluctant to buy. We're just trying to figure out if new payment habits and digital views are being acquired now?\nAl Kelly: Thanks for the question. So in terms of e-commerce, certainly it gives us an opportunity amongst other opportunities to sell our CyberSource capability as more and more businesses I think are going to seek to be omni channel and businesses that didn't realize that they paid the price. I believe Vasant talked about it in his remarks that one of the differences that we saw from country to country was that countries that did not have mature e-commerce capabilities or infrastructure, definitely have suffered more than company or countries that that do have it. I think that e-commerce relationships and tend to be sticky as you can get their card front of digital wallet or front of on file. Certainly, as we've talked about it a few times, the reality is that we can easily see that e-commerce brings new people into the fold that previously wouldn't have spent -- if not having the capability for being able to buy online. So, I hope it does. It accelerates improvements and the experience in e-commerce. I've talked a number of times about the fact that we still have work to do because the abandonment rate is not very -- is still too high, authorization rates can be too low, and there's a real opportunity to improve those and improve the experience and FRC is one of the reasons that we want to do that. We're also seeing that new users in e-commerce is up materially in segments like food and drug, and restaurant, and QSR, where e-commerce was never big before as people are looking to have alternatives to just the food that they get from the supermarket. So we're seeing that uptick as well.\nMike Milotich: Last question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our last question comes from Eric Wasserstrom from UBS. Your line is open.\nEric Wasserstrom: Great, thanks very much. Can you hear me all right?\nAl Kelly: Yes.\nEric Wasserstrom: Okay, great. So I know it's a little difficult in the context of the withdrawn revenue guidance, and as you've underscored, there's many conflicting dynamics there, but is there some way that you could help us frame how we should be thinking about maybe the puts and takes in operating margin? Obviously, you've done a lot to contain costs. It sounds like there's going to be some yield shifts on the revenue side, of course, you've got Plaid on the horizon. So, is there some way over time you could help just frame what operating margin might look like or within some bounded range or something?\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. I think you can sort of get to it yourself. So, we gave you a sense of what our second-half expense growth is going to be. We said it would be flat, including acquisitions, it will be down in the low single-digits excluding acquisitions, and we hope to do better than that. We're still working on some expense reduction programs. So, if you have a general idea, and remember our non-operating income will be higher, non-operating expense will be higher because of interest expenses going up and interest income going down. So, you sort of know those lines. So, it all depends on where revenue comes out. So, you can model revenue decline, you know where expenses are, and it will tell you what the -- you know the margins will then end up being. As we've always said, we think of this as margins are an outcome, not an objective, but they're a function of what your revenue growth is versus your expense growth. The expenses are declining in the low single-digits, but your revenues are declining more than that, as is likely in the third quarter, then it will have a margin impact. In terms of modeling revenues, I mean, we've given you the most up to date information as to what the trends are. So, as we look at it, it all depends on do you think where we are is the trough, when do you think we will start to recover from that trough, and then what is the nature of recovery going to be, is it going to be a sharp V shaped recovery, is it going to be more like a U shaped recovery as people talk about, where it's a slow start and pics up steam or it will be -- is it fits and starts where you get some recovery and some stabilization, and then another recovery and some more stabilization, and as you saw, I mean this varies across categories, and it does vary across countries. So there's a lot of variables here, which is why we've chosen not to give you any kind of specific forecast. We'll wait and see.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thanks for the clarity.\nAl Kelly: And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to email or call us and Investor Relations team. So thanks again and have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Al Kelly",
            "content": "Hey, Mike, thank you very much. And good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us today. First and foremost, I hope you and your families are well and safe. A year that looked quite promising after a solid first quarter has been substantially disrupted by COVID-19. While the business has been negatively impacted, in March and April, our focus has been doing the right things for our employees, our clients, and our communities around the world whose lives have been affected in unimaginable ways. We continue to manage our business for the long-term although we are pragmatic in understanding short-term circumstances. Through that end we are certainly being quite careful about our spending on our expense base, and we are pulling back on discretionary spending especially related to personnel, travel, professional services, and marketing. Throughout all of this we remain committed to investing in the future, in product development, in technology, our brand, and business development. You may recall that at our Investor Day we laid out a compelling case for Visa's growth as we look to be a single point of connection for money movement globally. And there are three primary levers to that growth, consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. I want to be absolutely clear that nothing has changed about these opportunities in terms of the medium and long-term growth for the company. On our call today, I'm going to cover our results, our response to COVID-19, and some updates on the underlying business and long-term prospects for growth. To start, our second quarter results. Net revenues in fiscal second quarter were $5.9 billion, an increase of 7% or 8% in constant dollars. Although cross-border volumes were already weakening in February, driven by Asia, for the most part the business drivers were not meaningfully impacted by COVID-19 until the latter part of March. A quick snapshot on our quarterly results are as follows. Payments volume grew globally 5% or 7% excluding China, with over 500 million transactions on Visa per day for each of the 91 days in the second quarter. Cross-border volume declined 2% on a constant dollar basis, and we processed 34.9 billion transactions on our network, an increase of 7% over the prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS growth was 9%, helped by prudent expense management. We recognize, given the environment, that the investment community would appreciate as much information on our performance as possible. And to that end, Vasant will dive into more detail than usual when I am finished my remarks. Since the COVID-19 outbreak we've been in very close and regular contact with employees, clients, partners, and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times. Our foremost priority is the health and wellbeing of our employees and their families. To that end, I pledge to our 20,000 employees that there would be no layoffs in calendar year 2020 related to COVID-19. We recognize the critical role Visa plays in maintaining the stability, security, and resiliency of the global payments ecosystem. And let me state that our network infrastructure and application performance has been unaffected even as we transition the vast majority of our employees to a work-from-home status. Our business operations have comprehensive and coordinated plans in place to address business continuity and recovery needs around the world. We're working closely with our clients in a number of initiatives, starting with tap to pay which has gained even more momentum in the United States with issuers and merchants as they seek to reduce the need for cardholders to make physical contact at the terminal. Navy Federal recently started issuing tap to pay cards. So now nine of top 10 U.S. issuers are participating, and we have surpassed 175 million tap to pay cards in the United States that have been issued, that is more than any other country on the globe. On the merchant side, a large grocery chain recently rolled out tap to pay to more than a thousand stores, so now nine of the top 10 grocery stores are enabled for tap to pay. At the end of the second quarter almost 60% of face-to-face transactions, excluding the United States, were tap to pay. And tap to pay transactions grew over 40% year-over-year. We've also launched a Web site where merchants can request free tap to pay signage for their terminals. And large merchants like KFC and Pizza Hut have ordered them for all their stores in the United States. Globally, we actively engaged with merchants, acquirers, issuers, and governments to increase tap to pay limits. In fact, over 50 markets in the last few weeks have announced increases. To name a few, 26 European countries, including the U.K., Poland, and Ireland, 25 countries in the Middle East and Africa, including the Ukraine, Georgia, and Egypt. Also Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have increased their limits. And we expect other countries to follow recognizing the benefits of digital payments. Visa is also working closely with governments around the world to respond to the crisis in a number of ways. For example, in the Dominican Republic we developed a virtual prepaid solution to rapidly expand the government's emergency disbursement program, from 800,000 to 1.5 million beneficiaries. Likewise, we will be deploying Visa Direct solution to support Guatemala's emergency relief program to reach two million households over the next three months. In the United States, Visa supports over two dozen state government programs, including unemployment insurance programs. And given the environment, we are seeing a 400% growth in accountholders just in the last. Data is another area where Visa has been able to assist governments during the crisis. We're providing helpful insights into economic performance to nearly 20 government agencies around the world. Visa is also helping our communities. We recently announced the commitment by the Visa Foundation of $210 million to support two programs. $10 million towards charitable organization on the frontlines responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as public health and food relief in each of the five geographic regions in which Visa operates, and $200 million to support small and micro businesses around the world with a focus on fostering women's economic advancement. Let me now shift to updates on the underlying business, which will be really very good for us in the medium to long-term prospects for growth. Even with COVID-19, commerce and innovation continued, and our core business had a number of positive developments with several key relationships renewed and new partnerships formed. This is all in support of the opportunities for meaningful growth that we see in consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Let me just highlight a few of them. In the United States, these are one two notable deals from issuers who recently completed mergers and previously had contracts with both Visa and the competitive network. We are very pleased to announce the extension and meaningful expansion of our consumer credit, consumer debit, small business, and commercial issuing, as well as our DPS debit processing partnerships with Truist, the sixth largest U.S. issuing bank. We look forward to working with this bank on a myriad of Truist brand building, innovation, and consumer experience efforts in the years ahead. Additionally, following the merger of TCF Bank and Chemical Bank to create the 27th largest banks in the United States, these are one of the existing business and new debit business. In Europe, we continue to make progress. In the U.K., we extended our long standing partnership with Barclays, which processes nearly half of the UK's debit and credit transactions, enabling us to jointly focus on innovation and support Barclays' growth into new markets. Also in the U.K., Visa signed an extended agreement with Cooperative Bank, building on our 30-year relationship to support their 3.4 million retail and small business customers. In France, Visa renewed a 10-year agreement with Group BPCE, our largest client in Continental Europe with more than 40 million customers. Visa and one of the largest German Banks Comdirect Bank announced an agreement to issue consumer debit cards and grow their consumer credit business, and ING-DiBa extended its relationship with Visa for both debit and credit. A Pan-European commercial bank selected Visa to grow their consumer credit and corporate card business across six European markets: Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the rest of the world, we renewed and expanded partnerships with some of our largest clients. We renewed deals with two large debit issuers, Al Rajhi Bank, the largest retail bank in Saudi Arabia, and Chunghwa Post, the Post Office in Taiwan. In Australia, we signed a 10-year exclusive issuing partnership renewal with the Bank of Queensland, one of Australia's leading regional banks to serve their close to 1 million personal and business customers. In Latin America and the Caribbean, we extended partnerships with the largest issuers we have in Panama, Peru, Jamaica and Costa Rica. In Brazil, we were chosen as the preferred brand by Caixa, the largest banking customers and debit card issuance; and XP, a leading investment platform that is moving to issue digital credentials and cards. We also obtained our license to operate as a clearinghouse for card payments in Mexico, which will allow Visa to provide domestic network processing services. This is a key step for Visa to bring innovative solutions as well as World Class security and reliability to a very important market. As you know, Visa is the global co-brand leader and this quarter was no exception in terms of sizable wins. We announced the co-brand partnership with core hotels as the fourth largest global hotel chain with 39 brands such as Fairmont and Sofitel. This represents the most significant de novo co-brand opportunity in the travel sector in recent history. Our partnership will expand the Accor Live Limitless Loyalty program to its 64 million loyal member base and more than 250 million customers globally. In February, United Airlines Chase and Visa announced an extension of our long-term credit card partnership into 2029. Visa is proud we've extended our partnership with United and Chase. We're excited to bring the strength of our brand and network to continue building on the program's success to deliver even more value and cardholder engagement. As Visa seeks to grow our consumer business, wallets remain very important for both new issuance and acceptance and we've made noteworthy progress this quarter. Previously mentioned partnership agreements with Paytm in India and Toss in South Korea are now issuing credentials. In addition, we add new wins with STC Pay in Saudi Arabia, AGA in Nigeria, PayCo in Korea, and Kias in Japan. In China, we signed a five-year partnership with Tencent, the parent of the WeChat platform with more than 1 billion monthly active users. This collaboration with Visa marks Tencent's first co-brand card with an international card scheme. And we look forward to partnering on innovative cross-border solutions for Chinese credential holders. In Sub-Saharan Africa, we've announced a strategic partnership with Safaricom, the largest telecommunications firm in Kenya, and the provider of financial services through M-PAiSA. With 24 million M-PAiSA users and 173,000 M-PAiSA merchants, wallet partnerships like these are paramount to expanding our issuance and acceptance globally. Collectively with WeChat and Safaricom, we now have relationships with wallet providers that give us the potential to embed Visa credentials in two billion wallets. Shifting to new flows with $185 trillion of opportunity, we're focused on moving money end-to-end for businesses, governments and consumers. In Europe, we're working with Lydia the number one Fintech in France for the younger, younger people that are below 30 in age and a P2P service with over three million users and growing at over 4,000 users per day. In the United States, we recently renewed our important relationship with Square for their cash app program, including Visa Direct capabilities and the cash card issuing platform. Visa Direct continues to be a powerful capability, especially in the COVID-19 environment. As one specific example, Visa Direct transactions for workers speaking earned wage access or on demand pay across supermarkets, quick serve restaurants, healthcare, and hospitality categories increased well over 100% year-over-year this quarter. We're also working on digitizing cross-border P2PAY. This quarter Remitly launched cross-border in seven countries. MoneyGram expanded to 11 additional countries and KB Kookmin card one of the leading issuers in South Korea also initiated a cross-border program, all with Visa Direct. Cross-border also plays a sizable role in the B2B space. And we entered into an agreement for B2B virtual cards with ICBC, the largest bank in China, representing our first B2B partnership with a bank in China. Visa and Australian cross-border Fintech Airwallex announced the new Global Partnership with the launch of a borderless B2B cross-border card, and we continue to look for new ways to drive new flows with unique capabilities and solutions. Value-added services are an extension of our core business and represent a significant opportunity for us to deepen relationships, help clients and grow our business. This quarter was no exception in terms of clients looking for assistance. In DPS, in addition to Truist, we renewed six issuer deals that represent nearly 20% of DPS's annual transaction volume. In terms of disputes, our recently acquired Disputes platform Verified signed an agreement with a large e-commerce provider to enable the delivery of key transaction details from their CRM systems to issuers in near real time which helps prevent disputes and reduces charge-backs. In terms of data, as you can imagine, our clients are very interested in benchmarking their performance throughout the quarter, leveraging our Visa Analytics platform. Nearly 5,000 client users were enabled at the end of the quarter, accessing 33% more reports than the first quarter for a total of 90,000 reports access. In consulting, clients are consulting and analytics at an increased rate. We delivered approximately 50% more projects than in the second quarter of last year. The CyberSource business continues to gain momentum globally and supportive acquirers and merchants around the world with innovative Omnicommerce, gateway, and fraud management services. For example in India, CyberSource is now the market leading payments gateway, in part due to the introduction of our safe quick technology for e-commerce merchants, which allows card holders to enroll and store card information for quick and secure checkout. Merchants also saw a 15% increase in authorization rates when using Safe Click. These are just some examples of how during challenging times our clients look to us. So, in closing, you can see that there's a lot of business momentum. Yes, there is no doubt that our performance will continue to be impacted by COVID-19. We continue to focus our attention on supporting the shift to e-commerce, the acceleration of PathToPay and do digital payments, as well as providing our clients with critical value added services. Although the road ahead will certainly have its challenges for a number of quarters, our business model is resilient, and our strategy to enable the movement of money globally is more relevant than ever. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant. Thanks, Sanjay. Hope you are well as well. Look, right now I think -- I don't know what percentage, but some huge percentage of countries are hunkered down, and that's largely driven by government mandates. I do think that over time people will -- obviously these lockouts will loosen up. And I think the first thing to come back will be domestic travel as people look at stretch their legs and move around a bit. I think cross-border travel will take a little bit longer to come back. I think we need some advances. And as Vasant made note of in his remarks, I think we're going to need some advances in terms of testing and therapeutics, and ultimately a vaccine will start to make everybody feel a lot more comfortable. So I think it's going to take some time and it's going to take -- but I think it will come back. I think it's possible that there could be some business travel that doesn't return at the same level given the fact that we're in an environment where people have been working from home for seven, eight, nine, 10 weeks depending upon the market, and realize that they can get done what they need to get done. So we'll have to see how that ultimately plays out. Offsetting that, Sanjay, is the reality that I think the cash displacement opportunity in the business as well as the explosion of ecommerce are going to be real structural opportunities that didn't really exist at the same level before COVID-19. Thanks, Moshe, appreciate it. Hope you and your family are well as well. First of all, there isn't a tremendous amount of difference in terms of the economics to Visa whether it's credit or debt, or card present or card not present. There just isn't that much of a difference. I think that's the main point. I think beyond that we're seeing people during these last couple of months start to buy things in the ecommerce environment that they would typically buy in store, whether that's furniture, electronics, in some cases apparel. And I think to the degree that they've had good experiences, that that's a really good thing. And remember, when you think about ecommerce the reality is that it's a very, very positive thing for us because cash isn't a competitor in that space. So the reality is that we get a lot higher share from those transactions that go to ecommerce than we get in the face-to-face world, and I think there are some permanent changes. Now, whether gaming stays up at the level of that as people are finding things to do while they're home, I suspect that'll come back down a bit, but I think, in general, ecommerce will explode coming out of this. Tien-Tsin, thank you, and hope you're well. I'll take the second-half and let Vasant comment on client incentives. We're obviously thrilled with [technical difficulty] deal came out, and over time there's going to be some cards swept, but we're going to work very hard to Truist. Remember, they're building a new brand here. So the BB&T and SunTrust brands, they're looking to sunset those and get the Truist brand out there as soon as possible. So I think given that these cards are a ongoing manifestation of the brand that are shown every time they get pulled out of the wallet, I think they're going to want the move fairly quickly, but we're still working through the details as the deal just recently got done. Vasant, you want to comment on the client incentives? Hey, Bob, thank you, nice to hear your voice. First in terms of value-added services, these tend to be excellent revenue streams and quite resilient. And some of them are certainly transaction-dependant, and the volume could go down, but honestly in times like this the value goes up though to our clients. So those would include things like CyberSource or our risk products or debit issuing processing products. And then obviously we have value-added services that really are not really tied to volume, and they're also extraordinarily valuable in times like that. I referenced two of them in my remarks, both the criticality of data to our clients, because everybody is seeing the numbers go down and they want to make sure that they're not way out of whack with where everybody else is, and then obviously consulting services. It's also an exciting time for us to be able to introduce other new clients to some of our value-added services. So the crisis gives us an opportunity to have dialogue and make sure that our clients are using all the tools that they can from Visa. So we're going to continue to make sure that we stay in close contact with our clients throughout this, and where appropriate introduce them to value-added services' offerings that they may not be using. As it relates to Plaid, we're on track. As you know, we have to go through regulatory review, and we expect to have that done by the end of the year, and we remain as excited about Plaid as we did when we talked about it at Investor Day. In terms of how it's doing, we don't own them so I can't really comment on that at this time. Thanks, Bob. Well, I think, Lisa, first of all, you're right on that I think that governments are just as interested in digitization as any other business at this point, and it helps with transparency, it helps them understand whether funds are going with more accuracy than they might get, they might get otherwise. Certainly, I think it's also possible that governments could on the other hand look at pricing in the marketplace. I continue to believe that pricing should be set by markets and not by governments. I think markets do a far better job of doing it than governments do, and I would say that specifically as it relates to Interchange, there's a tremendous amount of value delivered by our bank partners in terms of the credit, they extend to enable buying to the services they provide to the servicing they provide, to the fraud they provide, to the risk services they provide and rewards that they provide. So there's a tremendous amount of benefits that the economies of countries see and the individual citizens in those countries see. So and I would also say that any actions that would disrupt any type of recovery during a pandemic like this would be foolish and potentially very damaging. Hey, Ashwin, just let me first add to Vasant's comments, think about a normal day, when people actually go to work and they're not working from home, you go and you get some coffee at a gas station or at a mass transportation shop, you pay for your transit, you pay for your breakfast, you pay for your lunch, all of those kinds of everyday low ticket transactions are not happening in this environment. So, in addition to what Vasant was saying, you could just, that's a huge driver of the change here and why we're seeing higher average ticket costs, but lower level of transactions. The other question you asked was about pricing. Look, we're in an unprecedented period, certainly not something I've witnessed in my life where the impact of this pandemic is truly global. Our focus right now is to make sure that we're bringing as much stability through the payments ecosystem as possible, which is why we get into our major co-release this month of April where we normally do, and I don't know that we've ever not done it before, but this is the times where it was called for, and I think we're going to certainly be very cognizant of the uniqueness of this time in terms of pricing. As like, I think most companies in most industries will be reevaluating their plans on all kinds of fronts, including the pricing lever and how much they pull it given this new reality. So, I'll tackle the first question, and let Vasant tackle the question on capital allocation and buybacks. So Darrin, I again, I think that there are -- and we're still talking about it there might be others, but I think the big, big opportunities here are e-commerce and cash displacement. Cash, $18 trillion spent on cash, and I think people are realizing that currency is a germ-carrying mechanism, and people don't want to be subject to it moving from one person to another person, it's actually catching the joins that way. So I do think cash displacement is going to really, really take off, and we've seen that in terms of the interest of governments to raise contactless limits, the interest of merchants to move to contactless, the interest of issuers, who are lagging behind to issue contactless enabled cards, and I hope we see it, as we start to talk to long tail sellers or merchants, who might have here to for resisted jumping into card acceptance, and they'll realize now that they really need to on a going forward basis if people shun cash. So, I think that's a big opportunity. Likewise, I think e-commerce is a big opportunity, and I think Ryan McInerney in his presentation, talked about the fact that somewhere around $0.15 or $0.16 on every dollar around the world is spent on visa cards and the face-to-face world, but when you move into the world of e-commerce, it's like $0.44 or $0.45 that's a big opportunity for us. And then as you said, and I mentioned earlier, I think there'll be some negative on travel, certainly in the short-term, and I think that people are going to be quite reticent to leave their country in the short-term until there is some advances because they don't want to be, they want to be stuck somewhere. They don't want to be for a prolonged period of time. So I think the degree that travel comes back is not clear, but I think this world is still a world of globe -- full of global citizens who ultimately are going to feel the urge and the desire to get back on airplanes and explore the vastness of the earth. We have not done the work, Darrin to say how these things offset one another. I think at this point we're more interested in studying the things that Vasant referred to in his remarks to get a better sense of kind of just the recovery before we get into how this might create some permanent change. Obviously, these are things we're talking about, but not things we've dimensioned as of yet, but I do think there is some exciting opportunities that will largely your offset or fully offset the changes in consumer behavior as it relates to grab. Let me ask Vasant to answer your question on capital allocation Darrin. Thanks for the question. So in terms of e-commerce, certainly it gives us an opportunity amongst other opportunities to sell our CyberSource capability as more and more businesses I think are going to seek to be omni channel and businesses that didn't realize that they paid the price. I believe Vasant talked about it in his remarks that one of the differences that we saw from country to country was that countries that did not have mature e-commerce capabilities or infrastructure, definitely have suffered more than company or countries that that do have it. I think that e-commerce relationships and tend to be sticky as you can get their card front of digital wallet or front of on file. Certainly, as we've talked about it a few times, the reality is that we can easily see that e-commerce brings new people into the fold that previously wouldn't have spent -- if not having the capability for being able to buy online. So, I hope it does. It accelerates improvements and the experience in e-commerce. I've talked a number of times about the fact that we still have work to do because the abandonment rate is not very -- is still too high, authorization rates can be too low, and there's a real opportunity to improve those and improve the experience and FRC is one of the reasons that we want to do that. We're also seeing that new users in e-commerce is up materially in segments like food and drug, and restaurant, and QSR, where e-commerce was never big before as people are looking to have alternatives to just the food that they get from the supermarket. So we're seeing that uptick as well. Yes. And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to email or call us and Investor Relations team. So thanks again and have a great evening."

            "name": "Vasant Prabhu",
            "content": "Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. This is an unprecedented time. And we know you all have many questions about the COVID-19 impact on our business. To provide you with up-to-date data in this fast-moving crisis, we will discuss trends occurring after the quarter ended more than we normally would. Also, while the absolute level of growth or decline is important, the second derivative of the rate of change in trend lines is equally important. To help you with all this, we've added a slide to our earnings presentation with weekly data for March and for April through the 28th. This slide provides additional details on U.S. payments volume growth, as well as process transaction and cross-border volume growth. Starting with U.S. payments volume, after strong growth in January and February, payments volumes dropped precipitously in the second-half of March, as lockdowns went into effect across the U.S. By the last week of March, payments volumes were declining 28%. Credit spending was harder hit than debit and declines have been more than 25% every week in April. On the other hand, debit was down in the mid-teen through the first two weeks of April and spiked into positive territory in both week three and week four as the first wave of economic impact payments were distributed. It is too early to tell if this uptrend in the second-half of April is the start of a recovery, a new plateau, or will fade in a couple of weeks. Through April 28, U.S. payments volumes are down 19%, debit is down 6%, and credit is down 31%. As may be expected, there is a drastic difference in thought present and card not present performance with card not present or ecommerce volume excluding travel up 18% in April and card present volume down 45%. There are also significant differences in how lockdowns have been impacting spend categories. One-fifth of U.S. payments volume is full in drugstores along with Walmart, Costco and target. This is the only category still growing up approximately 20% in April, and essentially all this growth is coming from online spending up over 100% in the last two weeks of April, assisted by the adoption of curbside pickup and delivery. Another one-fifth of U.S. TV is in categories that are less discretionary, like telecom, utilities, insurance, and business supplies and equipment. These are holding up relatively well, shrinking less than 15% at the end of March, and have recovered to flat with a prior in April. A third of our U.S. payments volume is in categories that are declining between 15% to 50%, such as retail, automotive, healthcare, education and government. There are significant variations in performance within these categories with more essential purchases showing more resiliency. For example, home improvements within retail, or hospital and medical equipment within healthcare, categories where spending can be delayed or is more discretionary or more heavily impacted. For example, a federal spending within retail or dentist and doctor visits within healthcare. About one-fourth of our payments volume is in the hardest hit categories, including travel, fuel, restaurants and entertainment, all declining over 50% in April. The travel decline affects all sub sectors and is the deepest at around 80%. Fuel declines were driven both by falling prices and fewer gallons purchased, which typically offset one another to some degree, but not right now. Within restaurants, quick service restaurants are holding up better, in part due to being better equipped for this environment, but apps drive-thru and delivery infrastructures already in place. Within entertainment, amusement parks and movie theaters are especially hard hit, while gaming is a small component of the category is up over 200% Visa Direct activity has slowed a bit, but growth remains robust at around 70% in second quarter and in April. Use cases such as P2P and food delivery disbursements even accelerated while ride sharing and merchant settlement disbursements are negatively impacted. As economic impact payments have been distributed, we have seen significant increases in home improvement, automotive, health care and some retail goods and services categories. Travel fuel restaurant entertainment categories have not benefited. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 4% and over 7% excluding China in the second quarter. Growth remains strong CEMEA, and Latin America growing 19% and 14% respectively, in part due to climate both regions. Asia-Pacific, excluding China grew 3%, decelerating four percentage points from the last quarter, as the COVID-19 impact was significant starting in early February for a large part of the region. Europe grew 6%, down two percentage points versus last quarter, with the largest deceleration in central and southern Europe. Looking across some key international markets that we process the majority of transactions, major markets in Europe as well as Canada have trends similar to the U.S. both in terms of the trajectory and the depth of the decline. Australia appears to have lockdown better with a shallower decline. Much like the U.S., leverage in all these markets is outperforming credit, and there has been a tick up in the second-half of April. Within Asia, there are variations. Hong Kong dropped in early February along with the rest of China and appears to be recovering in April. Singapore dipped early then stabilized and has dropped sharply again under most stringent restrictions. Japan is on a downward trend, as a lockdown goes into effect. India with a very rigorous and sudden lockdown has experienced one of the fastest and deepest declines. Elsewhere, Brazil is doing relatively better so far. Across markets, performance by category is generally similar to the U.S. Differences across countries seem to be driven by the quality of the e-commerce infrastructure in place, and consumer adoption of digital payments prior to the outbreak. With economic stimulus payments in the second-half of April, categories benefiting the most are some sectors of retail like home improvement, business supplies and equipment, healthcare, education and government. Travel fuel, restaurants and entertainment generally remain depressed. In two key markets, where we do not process transactions, Korea and China we have some limited data sets. This data indicates Korea may have been among the least impacted markets. In April, a recovery is well underway in both markets. Process transactions grew 7% for the quarter, with sharp declines in March and are down 25% to April 28, slightly better than levels reached in the last week of March. Transactions typically grow several points faster than volume, as we penetrate small ticket transactions in everyday spend categories. In the recent uptrend or stimulus payments, that relationship has temporarily changed, as consumers have prioritized higher ticket categories like home improvement, and automotive over low ticket categories like restaurants and entertainment. Constant dollar cross-border volume declined 2% in the second quarter, or 5% excluding volume within Europe. Volume growth was strong and steady in January and started to slowdown in Asia by the second week of February, as the crisis spread around the world, we saw significant week on week volume declines in March, exiting the month declining 44% or 51% excluding intra-EU volumes, and volume remains down 43% to April 28 or 52% excluding intra-EU. The majority of the cross-border spend decline is travel related, both card present and card not present. All card present and travel related non-card present spend represents roughly two-thirds of our cross-border volume, excluding volume within Europe. This spend declined over 40% in the month of March, and is down 80% in April in line with the last week of March. The trajectory and depth of cross-border travel related declines is quite uniform across corridors and regions. Growth and cross-border e-commerce spend excluding travel decelerated in March, but remain positive led by retail spending. In April, cross-border ecommerce spending is recovering across categories and markets and has grown faster than pre-crisis levels. A quick review of our second quarter financial results, net revenues grew 7% in the quarter, or 8% in constant dollars. As a reminder, our service revenue is driven by last quarter's payment volume. Based on current quarter volumes, total net revenue growth would have been around two points lower. Second quarter service revenues grew 9%. Data processing revenues rose 11% supported by value added services and acquisition related revenue. International transaction revenues grew 2% continuing to benefit from last year's pricing actions. Other revenues rose 20% over the prior, aided by value added services. Client incentives were 22.6% of gross revenues, up slightly from last quarter. As we told you previously, the expected client incentives to step up due to high renewal activity, which continued in the second quarter as noted. The majority of client incentives are tied to overall payments volume growth in the current quarter, but there are contracts with clauses specific to cross-border, as well as annual or multi-year targets that are adjusted with changes in performance. GAAP operating expenses were up 4% excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring acquisition related costs. Non-GAAP expense growth was 3%. This is significantly lower than our original plans for the quarter as we moved fast reduce expenses when we saw the widest spreading more on expenses in the few minutes. GAAP non-operating expense was $95 million for the fiscal second quarter, including $2 million of med equity investment losses. Our GAAP Q2 tax rate was 19.4%. Moving now to how COVID-19 might affect the rest of this fiscal year. This pandemic is global in scope, very significant its impact and early in its evolution There is a high degree of uncertainty about what happens over the next few months. As is self-evident, a prior outlook for fiscal 2020 is no longer relevant. And it is not possible to provide you with any reliable forecasts for the second-half. Our revenue trajectory over the near term will be driven by three critical variables: first, the depth of the decline, second, the time we stay at trough level, and third, the trajectory of the recovery. It is impossible to reliably forecast for the depth of the decline, timing, trough and trajectory of recovery are going to be over the near term, especially since these variables differ across categories and countries. It will depends on many factors, which we will be tracking including city, county, state, and country decisions on when and how they reopen the staging of the reopening by business type and category. How permanent the shift in consumer behavior is by category, consumer willingness to engage in activities, where social distancing may be harder to execute, like dine in restaurants, mass entertainment, hotel stays, and airline travel, and when borders reopen, consumer confidence and venturing beyond the geographic zone of comfort. In the final analysis, this is a health crisis. As such consumer behavior and the pace of normalization will be significantly influenced by the availability of testing, advancements in therapeutics, and ultimately a vaccine. We have no crystal ball that allows us to reliably forecast revenues in this environment. As it relates to our revenue there is one point to note, we report service revenue with a one quarter lag, so when we have a recovery it will take another quarter before it shows up in reported service revenues. In fiscal year 2020, our third quarter will be helped, and the fourth quarter hurt by this lag. Why revenue outcomes are hard to predict? We can give you more clarity on expense outcomes, since we have more control over them. In early February, as we saw the impact of COVID-19 in Asia, we move fast to rethink our expense plans. As a result, we were able to reduce a second quarter expenses from our previous expectation of mid-teens growth to the 4% we reported. In fact, if you exclude the acquisition, we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19, which were not in our expenses in the second quarter last year, expenses were up only 1%. We have plans in place to hold second-half expenses flat compared to last year, and excluding acquisitions, our expenses will be down in the low single digits year-over-year. We're evaluating additional actions to reduce expenses even further. As you all know, ours is a business where expenses are largely fixed. And we want to preserve to the extent possible critical investments that will drive long-term growth in new flows and value-added services. Also, as Al has indicated, we will not layoff employees related to this crisis in calendar 2020. Operating within these parameters we have reduced expenses in the second-half by scaling back hiring plan to only the most critical roles, redeploying existing resources to high priority areas, reducing and redeploying marketing spend, as is planned for the now delayed Tokyo Olympics, prioritizing projects to reduce professional fees, and the use of external resources. And of course, like most companies, we're saving on travel and meetings for the foreseeable future. While we expect operating expenses to be flat or down in the second-half, non-operating expenses will be higher. With the $4 billion in debt reissued, in April, interest expenses will be higher, while interest income has dropped sharply with the rate declines. We now expect non-operating expense to in the $250 million in the second-half excluding gains on losses, versus $148 million in the first-half. Moving on to cash flow, liquidity, dividends and buybacks, our free cash flow in the first-half of fiscal year '20 has been tracking ahead of expectations. However, given the anticipated revenue decline in the second-half, our free cash flow this fiscal year will be below what we had planned last October. Despite the COVID-19 impact, given the cash characteristics of our business, we still expect to generate a very healthy level of free cash flow this year under any scenario. We ended the quarter with $13 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities on hand. Since the end of the quarter, we have added to our cash balance with our $4 billion debt issuance. We issued debt in three tranches, seven, 10, and 20-year maturities, at a weighted average coupon rate of 2.16%. We have ample liquidity with cash on hand as well as access to the commercial paper market on favorable terms, and a $5 billion revolver which remains undrawn. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. In the second quarter, we bought back 17.8 million shares for $3.2 billion at an average price of $180.10. Year-to-date we have bought back 30.9 million shares for $5.6 billion at an average price of $179.94. Our plan to buyback over $9 billion in stock this fiscal year remains unchanged. Crises bring with them both risks and opportunities, and this one is no different. We've acted fast to mitigate the risks. We are actively working on identifying and capturing the opportunities. It is very likely that this crisis could accelerate trends that were already underway, like the shift to ecommerce and the shift to digital forms of payment. It is speeding up tap to pay adoption, driving growth of new flow use cases we highlighted at our Investor Day, increasing demand for our value-added services, and offering opportunities to add to our capabilities through selective acquisitions. While our short-term performance will suffer a setback, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of our business. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike. Yes, a couple of points -- data points to add to that. I mean you might have noticed that ecommerce -- cross-border ecommerce excluding travel is now trending at a faster growth rate than it was prior to the crisis, and a lot of that is what you might call retail spending. More than half of it falls into categories that are people buying goods and services on a cross-border ecommerce format. The other thing that perhaps could be permanent changes are there are categories now, for example, food and drug, where the propensity was more towards face-to-face transactions, that have had massive shifts to, obviously at this point for reasons where they have no alternative, to online buying. And some of these goods could be fairly permanent. And then beyond that, even face-to-face, there's certainly a growing tendency to not want to use cash, and also of course not even do -- just to tap your card. The aversion to cash could be persistent, which means that even in face-to-face transactions the penetration of digital forms of payment could be growing in a permanent and structural way faster then it might have prior to the crisis. Yes, Al. So on client incentives, I think you asked two questions. Our expectations in terms of client incentives as a percent of gross revenue, we gave you a range at the beginning of the year. I believe it was 22.5% to 23.5%. That range has not changed. So we still expect to be in that range, even as we've had, as we told you, a very, very high level of renewal activity as well as wins and so on, that Al went through. As far as how our incentives might respond to what's happening right now, the incentives are always meant to be linked to performance, and especially volume performance. So our incentives are pretty much linked to volume performance and should move with volumes. And that'll play out over the next few quarters. So hopefully that answers your two questions. I can take that question on transactions versus payments volumes. And Al, I'm sure will take the other one. I had it in my comments. So, I'd encourage you to go back and look at them, but just to repeat that, it is we think a temporary shift. Typically, as you know, transactions growth does better than volume growth because we are penetrating more deeply into smaller and smaller transactions. The reason it's different in the last two weeks of April, is what we have seen is that as some of these stimulus payments have come through, people are prioritizing pent-up demand in areas like automotive, like home improvement, and they're not spending it on lower ticket categories, like entertainment and restaurants. So what you're seeing is a mixed shift in how people are spending money to hire higher ticket items. As a result, PV has improved more than transaction labs. So that's what you're seeing, and that's probably not what the long-term trend is going to be, but it's what we're seeing right now. So, with the list of capital allocation, first in line of course, as we want to invest as much as we need to in our business because we still think the long-term growth opportunity remains extraordinary, and to that end, even as we scale back expenses, we have preserved the investment in critical growth areas like new payment flows, including Visa Direct, B2B in our value-added services. So that's part one. Part two is M&A. We remain very focused on adding to our capabilities where it makes sense through acquisitions, and there may be some opportunities here over the next months and years, and certainly Plaid is something we're looking forward to closing on as Al said, but M&A would be next in line. In terms of dividends, there has been no change in our dividend policy. In fact, last week, our board approved our regular quarterly dividend. So those of you who are owners of our shares will get that soon. And finally, in terms of buybacks, we have had no changes in plans. As I mentioned in my comments, we have bought back $3.2 billion in stock in the second fiscal quarter. So through the first-half, we bought back $5.6 billion. So we're a little ahead of our pace. Since we view this particular crisis as structurally one that does not diminish our business in the long run and most likely enhances it, and we don't see any long-term secular trend lines changing. We felt that in period, in the month of March, our stock was trading below our views of intrinsic value, and therefore we were buyers. So there has been no change in our buyback program. We do have plenty of liquidity. We're watching that very closely. As I told you, we had $13 billion in cash and cash like instruments on hand, and then we issued $4 billion in debt. So, as we speak, we're close to $17 billion in cash on hand. So we are very focused on ensuring adequate liquidity, and that is cash on hand not counting our revolver or even our access to commercial paper markets. So, hopefully that addresses all your questions. Sure. I think you can sort of get to it yourself. So, we gave you a sense of what our second-half expense growth is going to be. We said it would be flat, including acquisitions, it will be down in the low single-digits excluding acquisitions, and we hope to do better than that. We're still working on some expense reduction programs. So, if you have a general idea, and remember our non-operating income will be higher, non-operating expense will be higher because of interest expenses going up and interest income going down. So, you sort of know those lines. So, it all depends on where revenue comes out. So, you can model revenue decline, you know where expenses are, and it will tell you what the -- you know the margins will then end up being. As we've always said, we think of this as margins are an outcome, not an objective, but they're a function of what your revenue growth is versus your expense growth. The expenses are declining in the low single-digits, but your revenues are declining more than that, as is likely in the third quarter, then it will have a margin impact. In terms of modeling revenues, I mean, we've given you the most up to date information as to what the trends are. So, as we look at it, it all depends on do you think where we are is the trough, when do you think we will start to recover from that trough, and then what is the nature of recovery going to be, is it going to be a sharp V shaped recovery, is it going to be more like a U shaped recovery as people talk about, where it's a slow start and pics up steam or it will be -- is it fits and starts where you get some recovery and some stabilization, and then another recovery and some more stabilization, and as you saw, I mean this varies across categories, and it does vary across countries. So there's a lot of variables here, which is why we've chosen not to give you any kind of specific forecast. We'll wait and see."

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Mike, thank you; and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2020 is off to a strong start with Visa\u2019s first quarter performance. It\u2019s a reflection of our focus on clients and commitment to moving money globally, seamlessly and safely. In our time today, let me first touch on our results and then discuss how we\u2019re going to grow our core C2B or consumer payments business and capturing new payment flows, which is all part of our network-to-network strategies. To start, our first quarter results, we had a terrific quarter and the business is performing well. We reported net revenue growth of 10%. But if you adjust for exchange rates and very low currency volatility, our net revenue growth was approximately 13%. Our EPS growth was 12% or 14% on a constant-dollar basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions made after Q1 last year. Key business drivers were largely consistent with the fourth quarter as we expected. For the first time in our history, total network volume this quarter was over $3 trillion. Payment volume grew at 8% globally, 10% excluding China and the UK. Cross-border volume rose 9% on a constant-dollar basis and we processed nearly 38 billion total transactions on our network, up 11%. Let me touch briefly on holiday spending, starting with the United States, the growth was similar to the 2018 and 2017 holiday seasons, which were both strong years. Credit growth was slightly better than last year and debit growth slowed slightly due to lapping tax reform, which had a positive impact on U.S. debit growth throughout all of last year, including the holiday season. E-commerce grew three to four times faster than non-e-commerce. E-commerce also drove more than one-third of all consumer spend, up two percentage points versus last year. Retail spend growth was stronger than last year, fueled mostly by e-commerce. However, that was offset by slower growth in travel and restaurant spending. To give you a brief sense of the holiday season in the other major markets, Brazil and Canada saw slightly stronger growth than last year. The UK growth was similar to last year's level, and growth in Australia slowed slightly. Now let's look at the core business overall for the first quarter. We are growing our core payments business in three ways; through large clients and markets; number two, making progress to capture the opportunity in emerging and other markets through new partnerships, including wallets and fintech; and three, all while helping the ecosystem remove friction. We continue to have significant renewals and wins amongst some of our largest financial institutions. These have renewed our issuing agreement with Capital One effective January 1 of this year. We're very pleased to continue our longstanding relationship with Capital One. We recently renewed our agreement with DKB, our largest issuing bank in Germany, and we're looking forward to developing new service as a product within this exclusive innovation partnership. In the Caribbean, we\u2019ve renewed a multiyear contract with Royal Bank of Canada for credit and debit. This agreement also includes some new debit wins covering 17 Caribbean countries and territories. In Latin America, we're pleased to have won the credit and debit business for Santander in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. This leadership position with financial institutions also extends to the merchants, as we are a leader in co-brand with 13 of the top 20 portfolios globally. This quarter we could take it to solidify our leadership position. In the United States, we were selected for the new Venmo co-brand credit card reflection of our strong partnership with PayPal. The opportunity for this product is quite significant as Venmo has over 52 million users currently. We're excited to continue growing our longstanding co-brand relationships with Caesars Rewards and Harley Davidson. Sony has relaunched both of their co-branded credit cards connected with the Sony Rewards program. Together, Sony and Visa are partnering in a number of ways to grow these programs and bring compelling offers to their cardholders. We already had a strong relationship with Costco as their co-brand provider in United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Mexico, and just this corner secured the China co-brand. In Europe, Visa extended our co-brand partnerships with Norwegian Air Shuttle and S-Group, respectively. In CEMEA, we renew the Emirates NBD\u2019s credit business and half of that portfolio is represented by the Emirates Skywards co-brand program exclusively with Visa. And the rest of the portfolio is bank branded credit. Our wins are not limited to just large issuers and merchants as we continue to make progress to capture the opportunity in emerging and other markets through wallets and investments. In Africa, we have recently taken several steps to help accelerate the shift to digital payments. On the credential side, mobile money wallets are already prevalent across Africa. But without a virtual or physical debt or credential associated with them, many international online services are unavailable to users. To help solve this problem, we announced a collaboration with MFS Africa, which is Africa's largest digital payments hub connecting through one API to more than 180 million mobile wallets on the continent to distribute Visa payment credentials across the continent. In an effort to build acceptance, we recently announced an investment and partnership with Flutterwave, a Pan African digital payments platform that enables multipayment acceptance and processing. Together, Flutterwave will further scale its consumer payment service called Barter and its merchant acquiring service called Rave through Visa products such as Visa Direct, Visa QR and Virtual cards. In addition, Visa established its strategic partnership and will acquire a minority stake \u2013 equity stake in Interswitch, a company focused on the digitization of payments that processes more than 80% of domestic transactions in Nigeria, and sales payment processing across 23 other countries in Africa, and operates the largest domestic debit card scheme on the continent with 23 million cardholders. Our partnership will help accelerate Visa deployment of payment experiences, leveraging interswitches, processing and integration capabilities and scale their bill pay services across Africa. As we grow our business in emerging markets and with new players across the globe, we\u2019re ever focused on improving the point-of-sale experience and reduce the friction for the entire ecosystem. In the card-present environment, we continue to see meaningful momentum in tap to pay what we consider to be the most friction free way to pay in person. We have reached a point, where one in every three card-present transactions that runs over our network is tapped versus one in four a year ago this quarter. This past year, we doubled the number of countries, whose face-to-face transactions are at least two thirds contactless. Transit continues to be a key user case and an important way to habituate tapping behavior. In New York city on the MTA, Visa crossed two million taps in November, from the beginning of the pilot and three million in January. The MTA recently announced the tap to pay expansion to their entire system by the end of 2020. And we are currently pacing a 350,000 Visa taps a week on the MTA and nearly, one in every 10 transactions in the New York Metro area is a tap to pay on a Visa card. We also launched Africa\u2019s first contactless transit system in Johannesburg this quarter, in addition to launches in Ho Chi Minh city as well as Taiwan, Sweden, and Ukraine. In the e-commerce environment, click-to-pay or what we once called Secure Remote Commerce, speaks s to streamline the digital payment experience across networks offering greater security and improved sales. You may recall, we launched with a select number of merchants in October and by the end of December more than 40 merchants had adopted the new click-to-pay solution. Now that the holiday season is over, we recently completed the migration of 5,500 U.S. merchants to click-to-pay. We expect to complete the migration of the remainder of Visa Checkout merchants in the United States over the coming months. Additionally, all 50 million consumers, who are already enrolled with Visa Checkout, were automatically converted to click-to-pay. Globally, we continue to make progress on securing the ecosystem with tokens. Introduced in 2014, tokens have expanded into 107 countries equating to six billion tokenized transactions in 2019. We now have over 750 million tokens globally. Over the past 18 months, Visa Sign, it is now live with the majority of large e-commerce platform for card-on-file tokenizations, including Adyen, Raintree, CyberSource, PayPal, Stripe, as well as some big e-commerce companies including Amazon and Netflix, amounting to hundreds of millions of new tokens, which is accelerating the pace of e-commerce transactions now processed over the Visa token service. Collectively, we have secured merchant and partner commitments for tokenization in the e-comm space that will add up to approximately $1 trillion in Visa payments volume. Putting it together, our core business remains strong as we continue to win with traditional players, new players, and speak to remove friction. Outside of our traditional C2B business, we\u2019re making progress and capturing new payment flows. in the card-based B2B space, we had several wins in the first quarter. In Singapore, we\u2019ve won the government procurement card for Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation or OCBC with the Singapore government mandating the digitize payments by 2023; OCBC is targeted to capture a significant public sector procurement volume. Within the CEMEA region, Visa signed a partnership with NEC payments, a digital banking and payments processing platform to expand NEC\u2019s regional and international issuing business focused on virtual card for B2B payments such as travel and insurance. In Hong Kong, we partnered with Neat, a fintech offering digital business account services to be an exclusive partner with Visa\u2019s issue virtual commercial cards. Visa Direct serves P2P, B2C and even B2small business with over 700 million transactions in the first quarter of 2020. This quarter, we wanted to highlight significant progress in the B2B cross-border space. MoneyGram announced it is now live enabling international transfers that rely on Visa Direct, the new service, which has been available within the United States in September; it\u2019s starting with transfers to Spain and the Philippines. TransferWise, the global technology company for international payments will also begin offering its customers the ability to send, receive funds in real-time to Visa Direct. The integrated capability currently available in six countries including Spain and Poland will soon be available across more countries in Europe. Our continued progress with Visa Direct speaks to our network of network strategy, where consumers did business as in governments to move money to anyone anywhere, each new network endpoints be it a car, the consumer or a business account or a wallet, compounds the value of the capabilities we offer to partners and improves the customer experience through a single Visa connections. As I talk about network, it\u2019s hard not to mention Plaid, although I\u2019m not going to cover into too much detail until the transaction closes. We see Plaid is having the potential to deliver real value to Visa in multiple ways. We have received a number of questions on their revenue model. So, I thought I would cover it quickly. Similar to us, we have a usage base revenue model, pricing is structured on a pay per API call basis, and varies by product depending on the type of financial data consumed by the customers at the fintech, which speaks to the power of their network. We are truly excited about the acquisition. To close, we\u2019re off to a strong start in the first quarter with much to be excited about as we look forward. We are deepening partnerships with traditional players in markets and expanding assets with new players. We\u2019re removing friction in the ecosystem and we\u2019re making significant progress to capture new flow. This is all part of our network of network strategy as we continue to focus on clients and moving money globally, seamlessly and safely. I want to take a quick moment to mention our Investor Day on February 11 here in San Francisco, which will simultaneously be webcast. You will hear from for knowledgeable and deep bench of leaders will discuss our view on the evolution of the ecosystem and how we intend to deliver Visa\u2019s future growth to our customer \u2013 consumer payments business, new flows and value-added services. The formal presentations should run from about 8:00 AM to 2:30 PM Pacific Time and we look forward to your participation. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al and good afternoon everyone. We had a strong start to fiscal 2020 with results coming in consistent with our expectations, excluding acquisitions and investment gains, constant-dollar net revenue and EPS growth about 11% and 14% respectively. Exchange rates reduced revenue growth by over one point and EPS growth by approximately one and a half points. The four acquisitions completed in the last six months, increased reported revenue growth by approximately half a point and expense growth by approximately three points. starting in fiscal 2020, we're providing adjustments to our GAAP numbers each quarter to help investors\u2019 better track ongoing business performance. Non-GAAP results will exclude three items: 1) the impact of equity investment gains and losses 2) amortization of acquired intangible assets or acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2019 and forward, and 3) certain non-recurring acquisition-related costs. Prior non-GAAP results were also adjusted to reflect this change. this quarter, the impact of non-GAAP adjustments is de minimis. In addition, you will find a helpful schedule on the first slide of our earnings presentation. In addition to GAAP and non-GAAP results, we provide the growth rate impacts of exchange rates as well as the inorganic impact of acquisitions. in other words, the revenue expense and EPS impact that acquisitions had on our reported numbers this year, which were not in our reported numbers in the first quarter last year. A few highlights from the quarter. Key business driver growth rates, payments, volume, process transactions and cross-border volume that's stable and consistent with prior quarters. Net revenue grew 10%. However, the underlying growth trend in revenues is masked by two significant drags related to currencies. First, a stronger dollar reduced nominal net revenue growth rates by over one point. second, currency volatilities were at the lowest level we have seen in over five years. as maybe expected, the sharp decline in currency volatility had a significant impact on international fee revenue. If you adjust for the drag from unusually low currency volatility and the drag from the strong dollar, underlying net revenue growth is robust at approximately 13%. Constant-dollar payments volume growth of 8%, slowed by one point compared to last quarter. This trend \u2013 this change in trend is driven by differences in processing days when compared to the first and fourth quarters of last year. The processing day impact was over one point in the U.S. and several points in Canada. excluding the processing the impact, Q1 payments volume growth was similar to last quarter and second quarter service revenues associated with these volumes will be in line with our expectation. constant-dollar cross-border growth rates, excluding volumes within Europe, were also stable at 9%. our reported constant-dollar cross-border growth rates accelerated 2.9% as we are now lapping the pan-European e-commerce platform, which re-oriented acquiring across countries last year, converting transactions from cross-border to domestic. As we have discussed in the past, this shift at minimal revenue impact to Visa, has cross-border transactions within Europe, have revenue yields similar to domestic yields. We repurchased 13 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $179.71 with $2.3 billion in the quarter. Our board has authorized a new $9.5 billion share repurchase program. with this additional authorization and the $1.7 billion of remaining authorized funds as of December 31, 2019, we have $11.2 billion available for share repurchases. including our quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, we returned approximately $3 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Turning now to our key business drivers and financial performance. payments volume growth in constant dollars was 8%, credit was up 6%, debit was up 11%, growth excluding China and the UK was 10%. as a reminder, Chinese domestic volumes are impacted by dual-branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was up 8% with credit growing 7% and debit 9%. Excluding the processing day impact I described earlier, growth accelerated almost one point due to a partial lapping of the Cabela\u2019s conversion and multi-higher fuel prices. Underlying consumer spending growth was largely consistent with the last quarter. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 8% and 12% excluding China and the UK. Growth in CEMEA remains robust 22% with strong growth across Russia and the middle East. Latin America also remains strong at 17%, given by some wins and strong performance of existing clients. Asia Pacific excluding China grew 8% decelerating over two points primarily due to slow growth in Japan, Australia and Hong Kong. Europe excluding the UK grew 12%. UK growth remains weak and slowed one point after improving in each of the last two quarters. process transactions continue to grow at 11%. constant-dollar cross-border growth of 9% was up two points from the last quarter that\u2019s stable that 9% excluding volumes within Europe. Both travel and e-commerce growth were in line with the last quarter excluding volumes within Europe. Outbound commerce accelerated from Russia, Africa and across Europe, which was offset by weaker growth out of the U.S. and Asia. Inbound commerce accelerated a bit into the U.S., but decelerated a little into Europe, which is consistent with the weakening dollar, compared to the pound in Europe. Growth into China and Hong Kong remains weak. Net revenues grew 10% or 11% in constant dollars excluding acquisition. The impact of our acquisitions on revenue growth was approximately half a point. Service revenue growth is consistent with the last quarter at 9%. data processing revenue growth was also in line with the last quarter at 16%. international transaction revenue grew 9%, decreasing two points from the fourth quarter despite its smaller exchange rate drag due to the unusually low currency volatility. other revenues grew 22% slowing 13 points from the fourth quarter as we lap ASC 606 impacts from last year, partially offset by faster growth in our value-added services. client incentives were in line with our expectations at 22.4% of gross revenue, up 30 [ph] basis points from last quarter. As we told you in October, the expected client incentives to step up from our fiscal 2019 exit percentage, the lower end of our full-year outlook range in the first quarter due to the level of deal activity this quarter and last year. GAAP operating expenses were up 14%. excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets and nonrecurring acquisition-related costs from the four acquisitions that closed in the last six months. Non-GAAP expense growth was 13%. Personnel expense growth is primarily driven by increases in stuff to drive our growth initiatives, which we\u2019ve stepped up in the second half of last year. Acquisitions and some nonrecurring expenses also contributed to personnel expense growth. Marketing expenses decreased 1% due to the timing of some spending as well as the reporting change that shifted some expenses to the general and administrative line. The impact of acquisitions added two points from non-GAAP expense growth. Exchange rates reduced reported expense growth by approximately one point. Non-operating income/expenses include equity investment gains of $13 million, which we are now excluding in our non-GAAP results. Investment income also includes a small non-recurring benefit, which is exactly offset in personnel expenses with no impact on earnings. Excluding these non-recurring items, investment income is lower this year due to falling interest rates and lower cash balances. Our tax rate of 17.7% was lower due to some items that are unique to our first quarter each year. This was anticipated and reflected in our outlook for tax rate this year. Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. First, let me share business driver growth for the first four weeks of the quarter. Through January 28th U.S. payments volume growth was 10%, with U.S. credit growing 9% and debit 12%. Processed transactions grew 13%. Cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis grew 8% or 7% excluding cross-border volume within Europe. Cross-border volumes in the last two weeks of January are negatively impacted by the shifts in the Chinese new year with potentially some initial effects of the coronavirus outbreak. As we look ahead to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we\u2019re assuming stable growth trends on key business drivers, payments volumes, processed transactions, and cross-border volume. The exchange rate drag on net revenue in the second quarter could be approximately 1 point, 50 basis points better than our prior outlook and consistent with the first quarter due to some weakness in the dollar since September. More than offsetting the small benefit could be the unexpected drag from currency volatility. The unusually low currency volatility so far this fiscal year continues to persist into January. As maybe expected \u2013 as expected client incentives as a percent of gross revenue will climb to the upper half of our outlook range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Count by the extra day in a leap year, second quarter net revenue growth rates are expected to be in the low-double digit and modestly better than the first quarter. Our second quarter revenue outlook does not reflect the potential effects of the recent coronavirus outbreak in China. It is too early to assess this impact. Second quarter expense growth is also expected to be modestly higher than the first quarter. As we had indicated in October, expenses will grow at the highest rate for the year in the second quarter as marketing expenses ramp up relative to a low level of spend last year. Also as the dollar has weakened the exchange rate benefit on reported expense growth will be about 1 point, 50 basis points lower than we had anticipated in October. Our non-operating income/expense in the first quarter had a run rate of around $65 million, when you exclude the $13 million gain from equity investments and the small non-recurring benefit I mentioned earlier. The run rate of non-operating expenses will be somewhat higher in the second quarter due to lower interest income as a result of lower cash balances and lower interest rates. Our tax rate outlook for the second quarter remains unchanged at 19% to 19.5%. Overall, we\u2019re maintaining our outlook for fiscal year 2020. I will mention a few adjustments and trends that they're monitoring. On the net revenue front, we are still expecting low-double digit net revenue growth in constant dollars. Based on current exchange rate and future expectations, the currency translation drag could be at the lower end of our previous 1 percentage point to 1.5 percentage point range at approximately 1 point. The four acquisitions we\u2019ve completed in the past six months are still expected to add around 0.5 point of net revenue growth. As we highlighted in October, a significant factor impacting fiscal year 2020 net revenue growth is the unusually high volume of renewal activity. In fiscal year 2019 we renewed 30% of our payment volume, with 15% renewed in the fourth quarter alone. And we indicated fiscal year 2020 renewal activity could be front loaded, with another 15% to 20% of payment volume renewed in the first half. Since then, it has become apparent the renewal activity in fiscal year 20 could be even higher, with three to four large unplanned renewals now on a discussion. We could bring this year level of renewal activity almost on par with last year. We are pleased about this since in most of these situations, we will most likely not only renew our existing business but could also gain a larger share of these clients over the term of our new contracts. One major client renewal is already complete, and the other could get done in the next two or three months. As such, we now expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be at the high end of our outlook range of 22.5% to 23.5% in FY2020. Excluding acquisitions and last year\u2019s MDL-related special item, our outlook assumed four expense growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range in constant dollars or 7% to 8%. This climbs to low double-digit growth when you add in the four acquisitions we have closed on in the past six months, which contribute three points to four points to expense growth. Based on current exchange rates and future expectation, nominal expense growth is likely to benefit by one point. As such, our expense growth for the year is expected to be in the double-digits, with 50 basis points \u2013 which is about 50 basis points higher than we expected in October. As I indicated earlier, non-operating expense at a run rate of approximately $55 million in the first quarter. This expense will move modestly higher in each successive quarter this year due to declining interest income from lower rates. Our full year outlook for tax rates remains unchanged at 19% to 19.5%. Q1 tax rates were lower than the full year outlook due to some items that are unique to our first quarter each year and were largely anticipated in our full year outlook. Excluding the four acquisitions, our outlook for adjusted fiscal year 2020 EPS, constant-dollar growth remains in the mid-teens, built off fiscal year 2019 EPS of $5.40. Four acquisitions are expected to dilute EPS by $0.05 or $0.06 a one point drag on EPS growth. Based on current exchange rates and future expectations, exchange rates could reduce EPS growth at approximately one point. Including the acquisition and exchange rate impacts of 2 points, our outlook for adjusted fiscal year 2020 nominal EPS growth would be in the 12% to 14% range. We still expect for the fourth quarter to be the highest EPS growth quarter. Our fiscal year 2020 outlook does not include any impact from the planned acquisition. We will update our outlook when we have more clarity on the timing for closing on the transaction. When we announced the acquisition, we gave you some preliminary estimates of revenue and earnings of revenue and earnings implications for fiscal year 2020 and 2021. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: We're now ready to take questions, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, good afternoon, guys. So just wanted to start on the incentive side, I mean the guidance change here is really only half a point, I mean if people were previously modeling the middle of the range. I'm just wondering if you expect to make up for that half a point through better gross revenue or does it feel more like you just may land net revenue slightly lower within that overall unchanged low-double digit guidance range, especially since the currency volatility has fallen off as you guys pointed out?\nAl Kelly: Yes, a couple of things, Jason. Yes, we'll see how incentives play out for the year, but the way it looks right now, the renewal activity will be higher and so we are signaling that it could be at the upper end of the range. And as you said, if people are in the middle of the range, that's up a point higher. On the other hand, we are signaling that if exchange rates stay roughly in the range they're in on where people are expecting, that is about at the lower end of the range too. So you pick up some of it there. In terms of currency volatility, we were able to absorb most of it in the first quarter and still get very close to as you saw what our expectations were. We're factoring that into our second quarter outlook. What is going to be for the second half? I think we'll wait and see. It's not something you can predict further out and the time will tell.\nMike Milotich: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nDan Dolev: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So a quick question on cross-border, it looks like a nice uptick. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Well, I guess, remember last year, Dan, you had a number of things going on, especially at the back end of the quarter with a government shutdown, Brexit, U.S.-China trade talks, et cetera. So we were expecting some uptick off of some of those factors that had a negative impact on cross-border at the time. And so we're back up in what I think we would expect to be a fairly normal range at this point.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks so much. Everything was really consistent here, but just looking at the regional volumes, just a couple of questions or clarifications. On the Asia front, it looks like it\u2019s slowed to the 4% zone. Curious what was the outlook here based on what you see? And then with Europe, I'm pretty stable, soften and tends to go low end of the 8% to 9% range. But I know you guys have made a lot of investments there. What are your expectations for European? Can you sort of break out of this zone based on some of the investments you've made? What do you see there? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Yes, I might start and I'm sure we'll add. In Asia, we highlighted three areas. Japan was really more of a quarter-over-quarter comparison. There were some changes in consumption taxes in Japan that seemed to push some spending into the period ahead of the tax going up. So it was pushed more into the last quarter. And so it's \u2013 we don't think that's an ongoing issue. The other one was Australia. Australia, you had some of the wildfire impact. And that seems to be one of the bigger factors there. And last was Hong Kong, and you saw \u2013 you know what some of those are. We have seen impacts in Hong Kong from some of the protests going on. So that was pretty much it. Across the rest of Asia, the trends are very good. In Europe \u2013 UK is a big chunk of our business and the UK has been very weak and actually slowed through the elections and had a very relatively weak holiday season and slowed by a point in the quarter. If you take the UK out, growth was a pretty healthy 12% in the rest of Europe. The only thing \u2013 I'd add two points, Tien-Tsin, one is the consumption tax that Vasant referred to. Now the government has decided to re-date some of that consumption tax when people do contactless transactions in Japan as part of the government's push on the cashless going into the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. So that actually going to turn out to hopefully be a good thing, not only stimulate spending, but to stimulate tap-to-pay spending. The other point on Europe; as Vasant rightly pointed out, the UK has been a bit of a drag for us, but we've been extremely focused on the continent and had some \u2013 we've had some good wins in fintechs and some good renewals. And those things are in the pipeline and I feel pretty good about where Europe's going to head over the next couple of years in terms of growth.\nMike Milotich: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller: Hey, thanks, guys. Just a couple of quick ones. One is on the, look, the improvement in volume we're seeing in January seems to really underscore the comments you made around like nuances in Q \u2013 calendar Q4, like the processing day. Just if you can comment on what you're seeing in terms of the consumer given, are these improvements into January just timing or do you actually see a healthier type of spending trend? Al, just one quick follow-up also was around the rebates incentives given, so many are being done now. Can you just comment on the types of returns you're expecting to see for those? Are these longer contracts than they used to be? Are they coming with more value added offerings? Something along those lines would be great.\nAl Kelly: Well, I think Darrin other than in the UK consumer has held up pretty darn well. And our volume in this last quarter when you factor in the processing day change, which is kind of a bit of an anomaly, but if you look in September, the last day of September in 2018 was a Sunday and a lot of merchants that acquires whole volume on a Sunday. So what ended up happening, a bunch of one day worth of \u2013 a lot of volume for one day got pushed into the first quarter of 2019. We did not have that same phenomena this past quarter because the last day of September this year was a Monday. So we just simply had a dynamic that it was \u2013 was hard to grow over. And so when you actually adjust for that, our growth quarter-over-quarter was pretty similar. So in general, I think the consumer has held up quite well and there's no reason to see it go down other than, again, depending upon where this coronavirus ends up going and who knows at this point. Just to be clear, when you have to have rebates and incentives, when I was referring to the rebate, that was a rebate being given by the government in Japan. I don't know whether that's what you\u2019re referring to. But in general, we are trying to obviously strike the right balance in terms of incentives that we do in deals, try to make many of them as many of those incentive dollars growth-oriented as possible so that as partners\u2019 volume picks up, their incentives picks up, but we're also getting the associated volume with them. And as \u2013 it\u2019s probably no guarantee, we obviously push for contracts that are as long as possible. There's \u2013 to some degree, most of them kind of fall in a five- to seven-year cycle. Every once in awhile there's some 10-year deals. And then there's issuers that like to do deals every couple of years and those would tend to be more of the issuers that have dual issuers. So, it\u2019s always a bit of a balancing act to try to get to the right level, but I think we try to structure these incentives in smart ways, where they\u2019re growth oriented, they\u2019re focused on consumption of different numbers of Visa products, and try to build relationships with issuers that go well beyond just an issuing relationship to encompass Visa Direct to encompass tokenization, et cetera.\nMike Milotich: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys. I wanted to ask about Capital One, I know Mastercard also announced a renewal with Capital One. So maybe, you could help us sort out of that contract breaks and if this is a net positive for both networks. And then just secondly, Vasant, on expense growth, I think your comments last quarter was expected to be similar to the fourth quarter, which I think was around 11.4% that came in a little bit higher. Was there any pull forward in expenses, because I think operating margins at the street we\u2019re expecting were a little higher than they came in. Thanks so much.\nAl Kelly: Bryan, let me just try to point on Capital One and then I\u2019ll let Vasant comment on acquisition. Look, Capital One has been a classic dual issuer and it \u2013 always, it depends on what portfolios each network happens to have and how they perform at any given point in time. But there were big terrific banks with a lot of innovative people on your team. We love working with them. and so it\u2019s a good thing for us and I\u2019m sure that next, I would say it\u2019s a good thing for them as well.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Expense growth was a couple of points higher than we might have expected. Some of it is exchange rate. So, as you saw, the exchange rates were somewhat better than \u2013 the exchange rate impact was somewhat better than we expected on revenues, which means on the expense side were somewhat worse, I think that was about a point. And as we \u2013 as I indicated in my comments, there were a few other non-recurring types of things that added another point. So, in general, they want any real surprises, they will pull forward of investments that it was just a couple of these kinds of items.\nMike Milotich: Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nTrevor Williams: Hi, good afternoon, and appreciate you taking the question. This is a little bit higher level, but I\u2019m curious internationally with a couple of government-backed systems like Mir in Russia and Troy in Turkey that mandate domestic processing. I guess first just, how you see your role in the economics you can earn in both of those markets over the longer term. And then second, more broadly, if you\u2019re comparing today\u2019s backdrop to, I don\u2019t know, five or 10 years ago, just what kind of threat you guys think nationalist\u2019s payments agendas could pose to the international business going forward? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Trevor, some of these domestic \u2013 our processing platforms with domestic teams are not terribly new. Our objective is to work closely with both regulators to make sure it\u2019s an even playing field and then work closely with our clients to make sure that we get a fair share of business. Many times our processing network of VisaNet actually just playing a simple has a lot more richness to its various offerings. And people we\u2019ve had cases, where banks see that and preferred to process with us, because of the investment, the level of security, level of innovation. So, we\u2019ll continue to be up against this kind of \u2013 this backdrop, but I think, it\u2019s still allowing us to grow at healthy levels and we\u2019re trying to partner in a thoughtful way as much as we can. Your question about the backdrop on nationalism today versus and years ago, I think you\u2019d have to say, it has become a little bit more pronounced simply, because it wasn\u2019t that nearly as prominent, a decade or so ago. But again, I think our job is to continue to innovate more closely with regulators and with our clients to have as much of an even playing field as possible and continue to show that processing on Visa or minimally partnering with Visa as your team has good advantages to it that people want to work with us.\nMike Milotich: Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Al, if I look at a long-term history of your growth versus your largest competitor, it\u2019s been quite stable more recently though the last one or two years, you\u2019ve seen some Delta open up between your metrics and your peers. So, can you talk about some of the drivers of this and more importantly, if you look out next few years, can we expect the gap to narrow, because of what you\u2019re doing with fintechs internationally in order to strengthen Visa direct?\nAl Kelly: Thank you, Harshita. Look, both companies that perform extremely well on a number of dimensions, look at the most recent quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with our results. And look, Mastercard had a great quarter and they\u2019ve had some good quarters, the last couple of years as have we. That said a few points, first of all, volume metrics are \u2013 don\u2019t have any standards attached to them and it\u2019s really difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison between the two companies and really understand what\u2019s going on fully in terms of the volume. On the revenue side, revenue Deltas have been a bit smaller in a number of the recent quarters is huge mix differences in our business. We\u2019ve had a very big position in the United States and we want to trade that for the world. It\u2019s just playing simple and much more mature market that doesn\u2019t have the same high double-digit, mid double-digit, even over 20% kind of growth prospects to it. But we\u2019re certainly pleased to have the partnerships with the banks that we have in the position that we have in the United States. The last one I\u2019d make is I \u2013 my expectation is based on the investments that we\u2019re making in value-added services, in new payment flows, in working with fintechs, working with neobanks, working on engagement with our existing customers, building out our effective footprint that I\u2019m quite confident that overtime, we\u2019ll close that gap and continue to perform very well for our investors.\nMike Milotich: Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon guys. A question on Visa Direct, you mentioned the greater than 700 million transactions in 1Q. You\u2019ve highlighted previously the Visa Direct was growing in the triple digit. So, I guess question one is it still growing that rate and then also how are the yields tracking in Visa Direct? I mean, is it sort of comparable to debit? I know there\u2019s a lot of cross-border in there too. And last one, Al, related to Visa Direct, I promise that you mentioned a few new partnerships as you complete the Earthport integration. What are some of the major use cases for Visa Direct you\u2019re seeing rolling in as we move through 2020? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: So, first of all, Lisa, our growth of Visa Direct remains incredible. It didn\u2019t quite get the triple-digit growth this quarter, but it was a very, very high single-digit, double-digit and close to that level. In terms of yields, we really haven\u2019t talked much about it. but to your point, this addressing is going to increasingly have some more cross-border transactions that will run over that, that platform and that our push platform. and that is obviously a very \u2013 a very good thing for us. I think when we talk about use cases, I think they\u2019re going to fall into some of the same topics they fall into today P2P disbursements, remittances and I think that those businesses will continue to grow. And you\u2019ll see on Investor Day that we\u2019ll highlight a good number of Visa Direct use cases with quite a few specific examples. So, we look forward to taking you through on 11th.\nMike Milotich: Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good afternoon. Given the ongoing weakness you\u2019re seeing in UK volumes and the incremental one point deceleration you called out, could you update us out on your growth pivot moving employees out of London and into some of the higher growth markets of Italy, Poland and Germany, and when might this growth pivot accelerate your volume growth in Europe?\nAl Kelly: So, David, we don\u2019t have any active plans to kind of move people out of the UK. We\u2019re just playing simple as we grow the business, adding employees on the continent and certainly, adding the vast majority of employees, where we would add in that region or in market offices on the continent. First, I\u2019d also comment that I\u2019m certainly hopeful now that at least there is some clarity around the Brexit outcome that we might find a new normal in the UK that would allow their economy to pick up. Certainly, I was in Davos last week and certainly, the officials in the UK that I talked to feel as if it\u2019s on the verge of starting to come back. We\u2019ll see what happens. in terms of the continent, in many of these markets, we\u2019ve been behind playing simple. And over the last four or five quarters, we\u2019ve been \u2013 after we got the integration behind as we started in investing in fairly significant ways and we\u2019re winning deals and trying to build our credit business, build our acceptance footprint. And so it takes a little bit of time for the pipeline to work its way into the numbers. But I think over the next couple of years, we\u2019ll start to see some real payback for the progress that we\u2019re making now on the continent of Europe.\nMike Milotich: Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I appreciate your commentary on the coronavirus, but I was wondering if you could dimensionalize the cross-border China business and maybe, any impact it may have and sort of how you could address it? And then secondly, on the three to four unplanned renewals, is there any context as to why it\u2019s happening that banks are choosing to renew early? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: So, on coronavirus, it\u2019s \u2013 let me start, it\u2019s certainly just too early to know. When we look at our numbers, we see some declines. But Chinese New Year this year was earlier this week, January 25, and last year in 2019, it was February 5 and spending slows around the holiday. So, we\u2019re given that we\u2019re about 12 days earlier this year, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s really impacting the volumes at this stage. As said, that\u2019s definitely going to be impacted. I mean, when planes are being halted both in and out of China, and you\u2019re probably reading as we are that companies were telling their employees to stay home. So, even for the e-commerce world, employees are staying home, who\u2019s picking and \u2013 who\u2019s picking goods and shipping them. So, I think for sure, there\u2019ll be some impacts and \u2013 but we\u2019ll have to see how pronounced it gets and how long it goes. I\u2019m not into predicting game for that at the moment. In terms of the early renewals, what tends to happen is probably about half the time, it\u2019s us and half the time, it\u2019s the client, who says as we\u2019re talking to them about deepening our relationship and we\u2019re talking about to them about all the dynamics that are going on in payments and/or we\u2019re talking to them about building a deeper relationship by them consuming more and more of Visa\u2019s capabilities and solutions. If a deal is going to be up in a year or a year and a half or two years \u2013 excuse me, that\u2019s no longer than that. But if the deals are going to come up and say you haven\u2019t had the two years or less, one of the two of us also the client will say, why don\u2019t we just get our deal done and extend it out a number of years, so that we can focus on all of these capabilities and we can work together on trying to grow the business versus starting down a path, where we\u2019re starting to consume \u2013 the client is starting to consume more Visa products. And then we have to halt everything while our teams on both sides go into negotiation mode and it just goes down the wheels of progress. And I think what\u2019s happening, because payments is just more complex than it was four or five years ago, and the number of offerings is greater than it was, even two or three years ago. I think that this is what\u2019s kind of driving this, I don\u2019t want to call it a phenomenon, but driving this occurrence. and this year, as Vasant said in his remarks, there are four decent-sized financial institution that were not scheduled to be up this year. They were not built into our numbers or incentive. One of them is already done, I referred to it in my remarks, which we saw then they on the deals that we did with them in South America. So there's three others where there's live discussion going on right now and it's too early to tell whether a deal definitely gets done or not, but my expectation is that more likely than that, at least a couple of them that were not planned will get done.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please?\nOperator: Next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the acquisitions that you've been doing, and perhaps the changing reporting, what that may indicate. In the past, Visa has done a lot of investments in companies and fintech, et cetera, even before fintech was coined as a term, but it seems like you've picked up, at least in the last year the pace of acquisition. Is this part of \u2013 should we expect more acquisitions and you'd be more active in actually acquiring companies that then you have been the past? Or is this maybe a little bit anomalous? Just wondering how you're thinking about incorporating some of the development that's happening outside Visa into Visa proper?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, I think I will add some more things. We'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but just a quick response to that question. I don't think we are deliberately stepping up the level of acquisition activity or investment activity in some kind of change of direction. Our approach has always been, we build any core capability and if it is faster or cheaper or the talent that we can get from the outside that would be valuable. Then you would consider acquisitions and there's a logic to every one of those we did. On the investment side, typically, when it's complementary capabilities, we prefer to partner and we do lots and lots of partnerships, as you know. Business has built on partnerships. Occasionally, we get into a situation where a company may like us to invest or we want to invest because we do want to enhance our relationship, get closer, have a better commercial agreement, get some exclusivity and so on. The reason the volume has gone up to some degrees because as you know, there's a lot of activity nowadays in terms of companies with business models and capabilities that are very valuable to us, either as capabilities for us to own or capabilities to partner with. So it reflects what's going on in the marketplace too. And it will \u2013 the pace of activity will depend on exactly applying the criteria I just mentioned. It could go up if we find more than meets our criteria or it could go down.\nMike Milotich: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. Al, you went through a pretty exhaustive list of breaking down core versus new flows and then reduced friction has kind of three big tenets of growth. Where I'm trying to, I guess parsed out, how do you break those down? I mean, it's core like 80% of the growth as we think about the next couple of years. Then layering in these other two to three assets? Or how should we kind of parse out that as we kind of think through all of these opportunities for you? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Well, yes, Dan, on Investor Day, we'll talk a lot about all three of these. To be very honest, we don't have a debt mix that we're trying to get to across the three items that you cited. We're trying to make sure that we do as well as we possibly can against all three, to try to make sure that we're delivering a sustained good level of revenue growth. And some of it will depend on what's happening at a particular point in time and economies and where we end up choosing to put investment dollars. So there's a lot of factors that go into it. But we're not setting out to hit some certain mix. We're setting out to do a really good job in our core business. We're doing to try to extend the business through new payment flows and value-added services. And with the acquisition of Plaid extend of business and our network and network business even further. So that's really what our objective is. Dan.\nMike Milotich: And one last question Jordan.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is now open.\nDave Koning: Hey guys, thank you. When we look at cross-border, the reported volume growth all through last year was pretty slow and I know that has to do with just currency, right? But the revenue growth was way, way above volume growth. This quarter volume growth has gotten better, but the disconnect, I guess between volume and revenue has gotten smaller. Like that gap between volume and reported revenue growth has gotten smaller. Why is that? And should it be closer? Should it stay closer like that throughout this year?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, the delta between volume growth and revenue growth are driven by a variety of factors. The most important of currency related, right? Most of the time the delta is driven by currency impacts. Clearly pricing plays a role. So there was some pricing in there that was causing the revenue growth to be faster than volume growth. Currency effects can then move in one direction or the other. And then when volatility is moving in a big way and this quarter, we had a very big move. If you're looking at volatilities, we are at five years lows now, not seen since 2014. Historically, those have corrected over time, so that we think is a transient thing. But when volatility has declined, the revenues related to those volatilities are also in that line. And this quarter those had a big impact. If volatilities were the same year-over-year, our revenue growth would have been fairly comparable to last quarter on the international fee line.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Jordan. And thank you all for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or email our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.",

            "name": "Al Kelly",
            "content": "Mike, thank you; and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2020 is off to a strong start with Visa's first quarter performance. It's a reflection of our focus on clients and commitment to moving money globally, seamlessly and safely. In our time today, let me first touch on our results and then discuss how we're going to grow our core C2B or consumer payments business and capturing new payment flows, which is all part of our network-to-network strategies. To start, our first quarter results, we had a terrific quarter and the business is performing well. We reported net revenue growth of 10%. But if you adjust for exchange rates and very low currency volatility, our net revenue growth was approximately 13%. Our EPS growth was 12% or 14% on a constant-dollar basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions made after Q1 last year. Key business drivers were largely consistent with the fourth quarter as we expected. For the first time in our history, total network volume this quarter was over $3 trillion. Payment volume grew at 8% globally, 10% excluding China and the UK. Cross-border volume rose 9% on a constant-dollar basis and we processed nearly 38 billion total transactions on our network, up 11%. Let me touch briefly on holiday spending, starting with the United States, the growth was similar to the 2018 and 2017 holiday seasons, which were both strong years. Credit growth was slightly better than last year and debit growth slowed slightly due to lapping tax reform, which had a positive impact on U.S. debit growth throughout all of last year, including the holiday season. E-commerce grew three to four times faster than non-e-commerce. E-commerce also drove more than one-third of all consumer spend, up two percentage points versus last year. Retail spend growth was stronger than last year, fueled mostly by e-commerce. However, that was offset by slower growth in travel and restaurant spending. To give you a brief sense of the holiday season in the other major markets, Brazil and Canada saw slightly stronger growth than last year. The UK growth was similar to last year's level, and growth in Australia slowed slightly. Now let's look at the core business overall for the first quarter. We are growing our core payments business in three ways; through large clients and markets; number two, making progress to capture the opportunity in emerging and other markets through new partnerships, including wallets and fintech; and three, all while helping the ecosystem remove friction. We continue to have significant renewals and wins amongst some of our largest financial institutions. These have renewed our issuing agreement with Capital One effective January 1 of this year. We're very pleased to continue our longstanding relationship with Capital One. We recently renewed our agreement with DKB, our largest issuing bank in Germany, and we're looking forward to developing new service as a product within this exclusive innovation partnership. In the Caribbean, we've renewed a multiyear contract with Royal Bank of Canada for credit and debit. This agreement also includes some new debit wins covering 17 Caribbean countries and territories. In Latin America, we're pleased to have won the credit and debit business for Santander in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. This leadership position with financial institutions also extends to the merchants, as we are a leader in co-brand with 13 of the top 20 portfolios globally. This quarter we could take it to solidify our leadership position. In the United States, we were selected for the new Venmo co-brand credit card reflection of our strong partnership with PayPal. The opportunity for this product is quite significant as Venmo has over 52 million users currently. We're excited to continue growing our longstanding co-brand relationships with Caesars Rewards and Harley Davidson. Sony has relaunched both of their co-branded credit cards connected with the Sony Rewards program. Together, Sony and Visa are partnering in a number of ways to grow these programs and bring compelling offers to their cardholders. We already had a strong relationship with Costco as their co-brand provider in United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Mexico, and just this corner secured the China co-brand. In Europe, Visa extended our co-brand partnerships with Norwegian Air Shuttle and S-Group, respectively. In CEMEA, we renew the Emirates NBD's credit business and half of that portfolio is represented by the Emirates Skywards co-brand program exclusively with Visa. And the rest of the portfolio is bank branded credit. Our wins are not limited to just large issuers and merchants as we continue to make progress to capture the opportunity in emerging and other markets through wallets and investments. In Africa, we have recently taken several steps to help accelerate the shift to digital payments. On the credential side, mobile money wallets are already prevalent across Africa. But without a virtual or physical debt or credential associated with them, many international online services are unavailable to users. To help solve this problem, we announced a collaboration with MFS Africa, which is Africa's largest digital payments hub connecting through one API to more than 180 million mobile wallets on the continent to distribute Visa payment credentials across the continent. In an effort to build acceptance, we recently announced an investment and partnership with Flutterwave, a Pan African digital payments platform that enables multipayment acceptance and processing. Together, Flutterwave will further scale its consumer payment service called Barter and its merchant acquiring service called Rave through Visa products such as Visa Direct, Visa QR and Virtual cards. In addition, Visa established its strategic partnership and will acquire a minority stake \u2013 equity stake in Interswitch, a company focused on the digitization of payments that processes more than 80% of domestic transactions in Nigeria, and sales payment processing across 23 other countries in Africa, and operates the largest domestic debit card scheme on the continent with 23 million cardholders. Our partnership will help accelerate Visa deployment of payment experiences, leveraging interswitches, processing and integration capabilities and scale their bill pay services across Africa. As we grow our business in emerging markets and with new players across the globe, we're ever focused on improving the point-of-sale experience and reduce the friction for the entire ecosystem. In the card-present environment, we continue to see meaningful momentum in tap to pay what we consider to be the most friction free way to pay in person. We have reached a point, where one in every three card-present transactions that runs over our network is tapped versus one in four a year ago this quarter. This past year, we doubled the number of countries, whose face-to-face transactions are at least two thirds contactless. Transit continues to be a key user case and an important way to habituate tapping behavior. In New York city on the MTA, Visa crossed two million taps in November, from the beginning of the pilot and three million in January. The MTA recently announced the tap to pay expansion to their entire system by the end of 2020. And we are currently pacing a 350,000 Visa taps a week on the MTA and nearly, one in every 10 transactions in the New York Metro area is a tap to pay on a Visa card. We also launched Africa's first contactless transit system in Johannesburg this quarter, in addition to launches in Ho Chi Minh city as well as Taiwan, Sweden, and Ukraine. In the e-commerce environment, click-to-pay or what we once called Secure Remote Commerce, speaks s to streamline the digital payment experience across networks offering greater security and improved sales. You may recall, we launched with a select number of merchants in October and by the end of December more than 40 merchants had adopted the new click-to-pay solution. Now that the holiday season is over, we recently completed the migration of 5,500 U.S. merchants to click-to-pay. We expect to complete the migration of the remainder of Visa Checkout merchants in the United States over the coming months. Additionally, all 50 million consumers, who are already enrolled with Visa Checkout, were automatically converted to click-to-pay. Globally, we continue to make progress on securing the ecosystem with tokens. Introduced in 2014, tokens have expanded into 107 countries equating to six billion tokenized transactions in 2019. We now have over 750 million tokens globally. Over the past 18 months, Visa Sign, it is now live with the majority of large e-commerce platform for card-on-file tokenizations, including Adyen, Raintree, CyberSource, PayPal, Stripe, as well as some big e-commerce companies including Amazon and Netflix, amounting to hundreds of millions of new tokens, which is accelerating the pace of e-commerce transactions now processed over the Visa token service. Collectively, we have secured merchant and partner commitments for tokenization in the e-comm space that will add up to approximately $1 trillion in Visa payments volume. Putting it together, our core business remains strong as we continue to win with traditional players, new players, and speak to remove friction. Outside of our traditional C2B business, we're making progress and capturing new payment flows. in the card-based B2B space, we had several wins in the first quarter. In Singapore, we've won the government procurement card for Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation or OCBC with the Singapore government mandating the digitize payments by 2023; OCBC is targeted to capture a significant public sector procurement volume. Within the CEMEA region, Visa signed a partnership with NEC payments, a digital banking and payments processing platform to expand NEC's regional and international issuing business focused on virtual card for B2B payments such as travel and insurance. In Hong Kong, we partnered with Neat, a fintech offering digital business account services to be an exclusive partner with Visa's issue virtual commercial cards. Visa Direct serves P2P, B2C and even B2small business with over 700 million transactions in the first quarter of 2020. This quarter, we wanted to highlight significant progress in the B2B cross-border space. MoneyGram announced it is now live enabling international transfers that rely on Visa Direct, the new service, which has been available within the United States in September; it's starting with transfers to Spain and the Philippines. TransferWise, the global technology company for international payments will also begin offering its customers the ability to send, receive funds in real-time to Visa Direct. The integrated capability currently available in six countries including Spain and Poland will soon be available across more countries in Europe. Our continued progress with Visa Direct speaks to our network of network strategy, where consumers did business as in governments to move money to anyone anywhere, each new network endpoints be it a car, the consumer or a business account or a wallet, compounds the value of the capabilities we offer to partners and improves the customer experience through a single Visa connections. As I talk about network, it's hard not to mention Plaid, although I'm not going to cover into too much detail until the transaction closes. We see Plaid is having the potential to deliver real value to Visa in multiple ways. We have received a number of questions on their revenue model. So, I thought I would cover it quickly. Similar to us, we have a usage base revenue model, pricing is structured on a pay per API call basis, and varies by product depending on the type of financial data consumed by the customers at the fintech, which speaks to the power of their network. We are truly excited about the acquisition. To close, we're off to a strong start in the first quarter with much to be excited about as we look forward. We are deepening partnerships with traditional players in markets and expanding assets with new players. We're removing friction in the ecosystem and we're making significant progress to capture new flow. This is all part of our network of network strategy as we continue to focus on clients and moving money globally, seamlessly and safely. I want to take a quick moment to mention our Investor Day on February 11 here in San Francisco, which will simultaneously be webcast. You will hear from for knowledgeable and deep bench of leaders will discuss our view on the evolution of the ecosystem and how we intend to deliver Visa's future growth to our customer \u2013 consumer payments business, new flows and value-added services. The formal presentations should run from about 8:00 AM to 2:30 PM Pacific Time and we look forward to your participation. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant. Yes, a couple of things, Jason. Yes, we'll see how incentives play out for the year, but the way it looks right now, the renewal activity will be higher and so we are signaling that it could be at the upper end of the range. And as you said, if people are in the middle of the range, that's up a point higher. On the other hand, we are signaling that if exchange rates stay roughly in the range they're in on where people are expecting, that is about at the lower end of the range too. So you pick up some of it there. In terms of currency volatility, we were able to absorb most of it in the first quarter and still get very close to as you saw what our expectations were. We're factoring that into our second quarter outlook. What is going to be for the second half? I think we'll wait and see. It's not something you can predict further out and the time will tell. Well, I guess, remember last year, Dan, you had a number of things going on, especially at the back end of the quarter with a government shutdown, Brexit, U.S.-China trade talks, et cetera. So we were expecting some uptick off of some of those factors that had a negative impact on cross-border at the time. And so we're back up in what I think we would expect to be a fairly normal range at this point. Yes, I might start and I'm sure we'll add. In Asia, we highlighted three areas. Japan was really more of a quarter-over-quarter comparison. There were some changes in consumption taxes in Japan that seemed to push some spending into the period ahead of the tax going up. So it was pushed more into the last quarter. And so it's \u2013 we don't think that's an ongoing issue. The other one was Australia. Australia, you had some of the wildfire impact. And that seems to be one of the bigger factors there. And last was Hong Kong, and you saw \u2013 you know what some of those are. We have seen impacts in Hong Kong from some of the protests going on. So that was pretty much it. Across the rest of Asia, the trends are very good. In Europe \u2013 UK is a big chunk of our business and the UK has been very weak and actually slowed through the elections and had a very relatively weak holiday season and slowed by a point in the quarter. If you take the UK out, growth was a pretty healthy 12% in the rest of Europe. The only thing \u2013 I'd add two points, Tien-Tsin, one is the consumption tax that Vasant referred to. Now the government has decided to re-date some of that consumption tax when people do contactless transactions in Japan as part of the government's push on the cashless going into the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. So that actually going to turn out to hopefully be a good thing, not only stimulate spending, but to stimulate tap-to-pay spending. The other point on Europe; as Vasant rightly pointed out, the UK has been a bit of a drag for us, but we've been extremely focused on the continent and had some \u2013 we've had some good wins in fintechs and some good renewals. And those things are in the pipeline and I feel pretty good about where Europe's going to head over the next couple of years in terms of growth. Well, I think Darrin other than in the UK consumer has held up pretty darn well. And our volume in this last quarter when you factor in the processing day change, which is kind of a bit of an anomaly, but if you look in September, the last day of September in 2018 was a Sunday and a lot of merchants that acquires whole volume on a Sunday. So what ended up happening, a bunch of one day worth of \u2013 a lot of volume for one day got pushed into the first quarter of 2019. We did not have that same phenomena this past quarter because the last day of September this year was a Monday. So we just simply had a dynamic that it was \u2013 was hard to grow over. And so when you actually adjust for that, our growth quarter-over-quarter was pretty similar. So in general, I think the consumer has held up quite well and there's no reason to see it go down other than, again, depending upon where this coronavirus ends up going and who knows at this point. Just to be clear, when you have to have rebates and incentives, when I was referring to the rebate, that was a rebate being given by the government in Japan. I don't know whether that's what you're referring to. But in general, we are trying to obviously strike the right balance in terms of incentives that we do in deals, try to make many of them as many of those incentive dollars growth-oriented as possible so that as partners' volume picks up, their incentives picks up, but we're also getting the associated volume with them. And as \u2013 it's probably no guarantee, we obviously push for contracts that are as long as possible. There's \u2013 to some degree, most of them kind of fall in a five- to seven-year cycle. Every once in awhile there's some 10-year deals. And then there's issuers that like to do deals every couple of years and those would tend to be more of the issuers that have dual issuers. So, it's always a bit of a balancing act to try to get to the right level, but I think we try to structure these incentives in smart ways, where they're growth oriented, they're focused on consumption of different numbers of Visa products, and try to build relationships with issuers that go well beyond just an issuing relationship to encompass Visa Direct to encompass tokenization, et cetera. Bryan, let me just try to point on Capital One and then I'll let Vasant comment on acquisition. Look, Capital One has been a classic dual issuer and it \u2013 always, it depends on what portfolios each network happens to have and how they perform at any given point in time. But there were big terrific banks with a lot of innovative people on your team. We love working with them. and so it's a good thing for us and I'm sure that next, I would say it's a good thing for them as well. Trevor, some of these domestic \u2013 our processing platforms with domestic teams are not terribly new. Our objective is to work closely with both regulators to make sure it's an even playing field and then work closely with our clients to make sure that we get a fair share of business. Many times our processing network of VisaNet actually just playing a simple has a lot more richness to its various offerings. And people we've had cases, where banks see that and preferred to process with us, because of the investment, the level of security, level of innovation. So, we'll continue to be up against this kind of \u2013 this backdrop, but I think, it's still allowing us to grow at healthy levels and we're trying to partner in a thoughtful way as much as we can. Your question about the backdrop on nationalism today versus and years ago, I think you'd have to say, it has become a little bit more pronounced simply, because it wasn't that nearly as prominent, a decade or so ago. But again, I think our job is to continue to innovate more closely with regulators and with our clients to have as much of an even playing field as possible and continue to show that processing on Visa or minimally partnering with Visa as your team has good advantages to it that people want to work with us. Thank you, Harshita. Look, both companies that perform extremely well on a number of dimensions, look at the most recent quarter, we're very pleased with our results. And look, Mastercard had a great quarter and they've had some good quarters, the last couple of years as have we. That said a few points, first of all, volume metrics are \u2013 don't have any standards attached to them and it's really difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison between the two companies and really understand what's going on fully in terms of the volume. On the revenue side, revenue Deltas have been a bit smaller in a number of the recent quarters is huge mix differences in our business. We've had a very big position in the United States and we want to trade that for the world. It's just playing simple and much more mature market that doesn't have the same high double-digit, mid double-digit, even over 20% kind of growth prospects to it. But we're certainly pleased to have the partnerships with the banks that we have in the position that we have in the United States. The last one I'd make is I \u2013 my expectation is based on the investments that we're making in value-added services, in new payment flows, in working with fintechs, working with neobanks, working on engagement with our existing customers, building out our effective footprint that I'm quite confident that overtime, we'll close that gap and continue to perform very well for our investors. So, first of all, Lisa, our growth of Visa Direct remains incredible. It didn't quite get the triple-digit growth this quarter, but it was a very, very high single-digit, double-digit and close to that level. In terms of yields, we really haven't talked much about it. but to your point, this addressing is going to increasingly have some more cross-border transactions that will run over that, that platform and that our push platform. and that is obviously a very \u2013 a very good thing for us. I think when we talk about use cases, I think they're going to fall into some of the same topics they fall into today P2P disbursements, remittances and I think that those businesses will continue to grow. And you'll see on Investor Day that we'll highlight a good number of Visa Direct use cases with quite a few specific examples. So, we look forward to taking you through on 11th. So, David, we don't have any active plans to kind of move people out of the UK. We're just playing simple as we grow the business, adding employees on the continent and certainly, adding the vast majority of employees, where we would add in that region or in market offices on the continent. First, I'd also comment that I'm certainly hopeful now that at least there is some clarity around the Brexit outcome that we might find a new normal in the UK that would allow their economy to pick up. Certainly, I was in Davos last week and certainly, the officials in the UK that I talked to feel as if it's on the verge of starting to come back. We'll see what happens. in terms of the continent, in many of these markets, we've been behind playing simple. And over the last four or five quarters, we've been \u2013 after we got the integration behind as we started in investing in fairly significant ways and we're winning deals and trying to build our credit business, build our acceptance footprint. And so it takes a little bit of time for the pipeline to work its way into the numbers. But I think over the next couple of years, we'll start to see some real payback for the progress that we're making now on the continent of Europe. So, on coronavirus, it's \u2013 let me start, it's certainly just too early to know. When we look at our numbers, we see some declines. But Chinese New Year this year was earlier this week, January 25, and last year in 2019, it was February 5 and spending slows around the holiday. So, we're given that we're about 12 days earlier this year, it's hard to know what's really impacting the volumes at this stage. As said, that's definitely going to be impacted. I mean, when planes are being halted both in and out of China, and you're probably reading as we are that companies were telling their employees to stay home. So, even for the e-commerce world, employees are staying home, who's picking and \u2013 who's picking goods and shipping them. So, I think for sure, there'll be some impacts and \u2013 but we'll have to see how pronounced it gets and how long it goes. I'm not into predicting game for that at the moment. In terms of the early renewals, what tends to happen is probably about half the time, it's us and half the time, it's the client, who says as we're talking to them about deepening our relationship and we're talking about to them about all the dynamics that are going on in payments and/or we're talking to them about building a deeper relationship by them consuming more and more of Visa's capabilities and solutions. If a deal is going to be up in a year or a year and a half or two years \u2013 excuse me, that's no longer than that. But if the deals are going to come up and say you haven't had the two years or less, one of the two of us also the client will say, why don't we just get our deal done and extend it out a number of years, so that we can focus on all of these capabilities and we can work together on trying to grow the business versus starting down a path, where we're starting to consume \u2013 the client is starting to consume more Visa products. And then we have to halt everything while our teams on both sides go into negotiation mode and it just goes down the wheels of progress. And I think what's happening, because payments is just more complex than it was four or five years ago, and the number of offerings is greater than it was, even two or three years ago. I think that this is what's kind of driving this, I don't want to call it a phenomenon, but driving this occurrence. and this year, as Vasant said in his remarks, there are four decent-sized financial institution that were not scheduled to be up this year. They were not built into our numbers or incentive. One of them is already done, I referred to it in my remarks, which we saw then they on the deals that we did with them in South America. So there's three others where there's live discussion going on right now and it's too early to tell whether a deal definitely gets done or not, but my expectation is that more likely than that, at least a couple of them that were not planned will get done. Well, yes, Dan, on Investor Day, we'll talk a lot about all three of these. To be very honest, we don't have a debt mix that we're trying to get to across the three items that you cited. We're trying to make sure that we do as well as we possibly can against all three, to try to make sure that we're delivering a sustained good level of revenue growth. And some of it will depend on what's happening at a particular point in time and economies and where we end up choosing to put investment dollars. So there's a lot of factors that go into it. But we're not setting out to hit some certain mix. We're setting out to do a really good job in our core business. We're doing to try to extend the business through new payment flows and value-added services. And with the acquisition of Plaid extend of business and our network and network business even further. So that's really what our objective is. Dan. Thanks, Jordan. And thank you all for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or email our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day."

            "name": "Vasant Prabhu",
            "content": "Thank you, Al and good afternoon everyone. We had a strong start to fiscal 2020 with results coming in consistent with our expectations, excluding acquisitions and investment gains, constant-dollar net revenue and EPS growth about 11% and 14% respectively. Exchange rates reduced revenue growth by over one point and EPS growth by approximately one and a half points. The four acquisitions completed in the last six months, increased reported revenue growth by approximately half a point and expense growth by approximately three points. starting in fiscal 2020, we're providing adjustments to our GAAP numbers each quarter to help investors' better track ongoing business performance. Non-GAAP results will exclude three items: 1) the impact of equity investment gains and losses 2) amortization of acquired intangible assets or acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2019 and forward, and 3) certain non-recurring acquisition-related costs. Prior non-GAAP results were also adjusted to reflect this change. this quarter, the impact of non-GAAP adjustments is de minimis. In addition, you will find a helpful schedule on the first slide of our earnings presentation. In addition to GAAP and non-GAAP results, we provide the growth rate impacts of exchange rates as well as the inorganic impact of acquisitions. in other words, the revenue expense and EPS impact that acquisitions had on our reported numbers this year, which were not in our reported numbers in the first quarter last year. A few highlights from the quarter. Key business driver growth rates, payments, volume, process transactions and cross-border volume that's stable and consistent with prior quarters. Net revenue grew 10%. However, the underlying growth trend in revenues is masked by two significant drags related to currencies. First, a stronger dollar reduced nominal net revenue growth rates by over one point. second, currency volatilities were at the lowest level we have seen in over five years. as maybe expected, the sharp decline in currency volatility had a significant impact on international fee revenue. If you adjust for the drag from unusually low currency volatility and the drag from the strong dollar, underlying net revenue growth is robust at approximately 13%. Constant-dollar payments volume growth of 8%, slowed by one point compared to last quarter. This trend \u2013 this change in trend is driven by differences in processing days when compared to the first and fourth quarters of last year. The processing day impact was over one point in the U.S. and several points in Canada. excluding the processing the impact, Q1 payments volume growth was similar to last quarter and second quarter service revenues associated with these volumes will be in line with our expectation. constant-dollar cross-border growth rates, excluding volumes within Europe, were also stable at 9%. our reported constant-dollar cross-border growth rates accelerated 2.9% as we are now lapping the pan-European e-commerce platform, which re-oriented acquiring across countries last year, converting transactions from cross-border to domestic. As we have discussed in the past, this shift at minimal revenue impact to Visa, has cross-border transactions within Europe, have revenue yields similar to domestic yields. We repurchased 13 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $179.71 with $2.3 billion in the quarter. Our board has authorized a new $9.5 billion share repurchase program. with this additional authorization and the $1.7 billion of remaining authorized funds as of December 31, 2019, we have $11.2 billion available for share repurchases. including our quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, we returned approximately $3 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Turning now to our key business drivers and financial performance. payments volume growth in constant dollars was 8%, credit was up 6%, debit was up 11%, growth excluding China and the UK was 10%. as a reminder, Chinese domestic volumes are impacted by dual-branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was up 8% with credit growing 7% and debit 9%. Excluding the processing day impact I described earlier, growth accelerated almost one point due to a partial lapping of the Cabela's conversion and multi-higher fuel prices. Underlying consumer spending growth was largely consistent with the last quarter. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 8% and 12% excluding China and the UK. Growth in CEMEA remains robust 22% with strong growth across Russia and the middle East. Latin America also remains strong at 17%, given by some wins and strong performance of existing clients. Asia Pacific excluding China grew 8% decelerating over two points primarily due to slow growth in Japan, Australia and Hong Kong. Europe excluding the UK grew 12%. UK growth remains weak and slowed one point after improving in each of the last two quarters. process transactions continue to grow at 11%. constant-dollar cross-border growth of 9% was up two points from the last quarter that's stable that 9% excluding volumes within Europe. Both travel and e-commerce growth were in line with the last quarter excluding volumes within Europe. Outbound commerce accelerated from Russia, Africa and across Europe, which was offset by weaker growth out of the U.S. and Asia. Inbound commerce accelerated a bit into the U.S., but decelerated a little into Europe, which is consistent with the weakening dollar, compared to the pound in Europe. Growth into China and Hong Kong remains weak. Net revenues grew 10% or 11% in constant dollars excluding acquisition. The impact of our acquisitions on revenue growth was approximately half a point. Service revenue growth is consistent with the last quarter at 9%. data processing revenue growth was also in line with the last quarter at 16%. international transaction revenue grew 9%, decreasing two points from the fourth quarter despite its smaller exchange rate drag due to the unusually low currency volatility. other revenues grew 22% slowing 13 points from the fourth quarter as we lap ASC 606 impacts from last year, partially offset by faster growth in our value-added services. client incentives were in line with our expectations at 22.4% of gross revenue, up 30 [ph] basis points from last quarter. As we told you in October, the expected client incentives to step up from our fiscal 2019 exit percentage, the lower end of our full-year outlook range in the first quarter due to the level of deal activity this quarter and last year. GAAP operating expenses were up 14%. excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets and nonrecurring acquisition-related costs from the four acquisitions that closed in the last six months. Non-GAAP expense growth was 13%. Personnel expense growth is primarily driven by increases in stuff to drive our growth initiatives, which we've stepped up in the second half of last year. Acquisitions and some nonrecurring expenses also contributed to personnel expense growth. Marketing expenses decreased 1% due to the timing of some spending as well as the reporting change that shifted some expenses to the general and administrative line. The impact of acquisitions added two points from non-GAAP expense growth. Exchange rates reduced reported expense growth by approximately one point. Non-operating income/expenses include equity investment gains of $13 million, which we are now excluding in our non-GAAP results. Investment income also includes a small non-recurring benefit, which is exactly offset in personnel expenses with no impact on earnings. Excluding these non-recurring items, investment income is lower this year due to falling interest rates and lower cash balances. Our tax rate of 17.7% was lower due to some items that are unique to our first quarter each year. This was anticipated and reflected in our outlook for tax rate this year. Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. First, let me share business driver growth for the first four weeks of the quarter. Through January 28th U.S. payments volume growth was 10%, with U.S. credit growing 9% and debit 12%. Processed transactions grew 13%. Cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis grew 8% or 7% excluding cross-border volume within Europe. Cross-border volumes in the last two weeks of January are negatively impacted by the shifts in the Chinese new year with potentially some initial effects of the coronavirus outbreak. As we look ahead to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we're assuming stable growth trends on key business drivers, payments volumes, processed transactions, and cross-border volume. The exchange rate drag on net revenue in the second quarter could be approximately 1 point, 50 basis points better than our prior outlook and consistent with the first quarter due to some weakness in the dollar since September. More than offsetting the small benefit could be the unexpected drag from currency volatility. The unusually low currency volatility so far this fiscal year continues to persist into January. As maybe expected \u2013 as expected client incentives as a percent of gross revenue will climb to the upper half of our outlook range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Count by the extra day in a leap year, second quarter net revenue growth rates are expected to be in the low-double digit and modestly better than the first quarter. Our second quarter revenue outlook does not reflect the potential effects of the recent coronavirus outbreak in China. It is too early to assess this impact. Second quarter expense growth is also expected to be modestly higher than the first quarter. As we had indicated in October, expenses will grow at the highest rate for the year in the second quarter as marketing expenses ramp up relative to a low level of spend last year. Also as the dollar has weakened the exchange rate benefit on reported expense growth will be about 1 point, 50 basis points lower than we had anticipated in October. Our non-operating income/expense in the first quarter had a run rate of around $65 million, when you exclude the $13 million gain from equity investments and the small non-recurring benefit I mentioned earlier. The run rate of non-operating expenses will be somewhat higher in the second quarter due to lower interest income as a result of lower cash balances and lower interest rates. Our tax rate outlook for the second quarter remains unchanged at 19% to 19.5%. Overall, we're maintaining our outlook for fiscal year 2020. I will mention a few adjustments and trends that they're monitoring. On the net revenue front, we are still expecting low-double digit net revenue growth in constant dollars. Based on current exchange rate and future expectations, the currency translation drag could be at the lower end of our previous 1 percentage point to 1.5 percentage point range at approximately 1 point. The four acquisitions we've completed in the past six months are still expected to add around 0.5 point of net revenue growth. As we highlighted in October, a significant factor impacting fiscal year 2020 net revenue growth is the unusually high volume of renewal activity. In fiscal year 2019 we renewed 30% of our payment volume, with 15% renewed in the fourth quarter alone. And we indicated fiscal year 2020 renewal activity could be front loaded, with another 15% to 20% of payment volume renewed in the first half. Since then, it has become apparent the renewal activity in fiscal year 20 could be even higher, with three to four large unplanned renewals now on a discussion. We could bring this year level of renewal activity almost on par with last year. We are pleased about this since in most of these situations, we will most likely not only renew our existing business but could also gain a larger share of these clients over the term of our new contracts. One major client renewal is already complete, and the other could get done in the next two or three months. As such, we now expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be at the high end of our outlook range of 22.5% to 23.5% in FY2020. Excluding acquisitions and last year's MDL-related special item, our outlook assumed four expense growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range in constant dollars or 7% to 8%. This climbs to low double-digit growth when you add in the four acquisitions we have closed on in the past six months, which contribute three points to four points to expense growth. Based on current exchange rates and future expectation, nominal expense growth is likely to benefit by one point. As such, our expense growth for the year is expected to be in the double-digits, with 50 basis points \u2013 which is about 50 basis points higher than we expected in October. As I indicated earlier, non-operating expense at a run rate of approximately $55 million in the first quarter. This expense will move modestly higher in each successive quarter this year due to declining interest income from lower rates. Our full year outlook for tax rates remains unchanged at 19% to 19.5%. Q1 tax rates were lower than the full year outlook due to some items that are unique to our first quarter each year and were largely anticipated in our full year outlook. Excluding the four acquisitions, our outlook for adjusted fiscal year 2020 EPS, constant-dollar growth remains in the mid-teens, built off fiscal year 2019 EPS of $5.40. Four acquisitions are expected to dilute EPS by $0.05 or $0.06 a one point drag on EPS growth. Based on current exchange rates and future expectations, exchange rates could reduce EPS growth at approximately one point. Including the acquisition and exchange rate impacts of 2 points, our outlook for adjusted fiscal year 2020 nominal EPS growth would be in the 12% to 14% range. We still expect for the fourth quarter to be the highest EPS growth quarter. Our fiscal year 2020 outlook does not include any impact from the planned acquisition. We will update our outlook when we have more clarity on the timing for closing on the transaction. When we announced the acquisition, we gave you some preliminary estimates of revenue and earnings of revenue and earnings implications for fiscal year 2020 and 2021. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike. Yes. Expense growth was a couple of points higher than we might have expected. Some of it is exchange rate. So, as you saw, the exchange rates were somewhat better than \u2013 the exchange rate impact was somewhat better than we expected on revenues, which means on the expense side were somewhat worse, I think that was about a point. And as we \u2013 as I indicated in my comments, there were a few other non-recurring types of things that added another point. So, in general, they want any real surprises, they will pull forward of investments that it was just a couple of these kinds of items. Well, I think I will add some more things. We'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but just a quick response to that question. I don't think we are deliberately stepping up the level of acquisition activity or investment activity in some kind of change of direction. Our approach has always been, we build any core capability and if it is faster or cheaper or the talent that we can get from the outside that would be valuable. Then you would consider acquisitions and there's a logic to every one of those we did. On the investment side, typically, when it's complementary capabilities, we prefer to partner and we do lots and lots of partnerships, as you know. Business has built on partnerships. Occasionally, we get into a situation where a company may like us to invest or we want to invest because we do want to enhance our relationship, get closer, have a better commercial agreement, get some exclusivity and so on. The reason the volume has gone up to some degrees because as you know, there's a lot of activity nowadays in terms of companies with business models and capabilities that are very valuable to us, either as capabilities for us to own or capabilities to partner with. So it reflects what's going on in the marketplace too. And it will \u2013 the pace of activity will depend on exactly applying the criteria I just mentioned. It could go up if we find more than meets our criteria or it could go down. Yes, the delta between volume growth and revenue growth are driven by a variety of factors. The most important of currency related, right? Most of the time the delta is driven by currency impacts. Clearly pricing plays a role. So there was some pricing in there that was causing the revenue growth to be faster than volume growth. Currency effects can then move in one direction or the other. And then when volatility is moving in a big way and this quarter, we had a very big move. If you're looking at volatilities, we are at five years lows now, not seen since 2014. Historically, those have corrected over time, so that we think is a transient thing. But when volatility has declined, the revenues related to those volatilities are also in that line. And this quarter those had a big impact. If volatilities were the same year-over-year, our revenue growth would have been fairly comparable to last quarter on the international fee line."

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Jennifer, thank you very much. And good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. In the fourth quarter and throughout Fiscal 2021, Visa's delivered strong results against the backdrop of economic uncertainty and the lingering impacts of the COVID pandemic.  In doing so, we demonstrated the resiliency of our business and validated our growth strategy as we continue to drive the rapid growth of digital payments and enable innovation in money movement globally.  A quick summary of Q4 results. Fourth-quarter payments volume was a 121% of 2019 up about 0.8 points from Q3 and up 17% year-over-year despite the backdrop of a global pandemic this quarter.  We also set a record with total global payments volume of $2.8 trillion. Cross-border volume, excluding intra -Europe, was 86% of 2019, 4 points better than Q3 and up 46% year-over-year and process transactions were a 124% of 2019 up 4 points from Q3 and up 21% year-over-year.  Our net revenues grew 29% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was a $1.62 up 44%. And talking too many of you over the last few months, I know you're wondering what the head for Visa and the payments ecosystem as we emerge from the pandemic.  So rather than doing my usual report card on the quarter, I'm going to speak more broadly today about the four key reasons why we believe that these as even better positioned for growth than before the pandemic: 1. there's still enormous opportunity ahead in consumer payments, 2.  We continue to enhance our network of networks capability to facilitate money movement more seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem and accelerate the penetration of new flows. Third, value-added services simultaneously help our clients leverage our scale and sophistication while diversifying these as business and driving more volume. 4.  We enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps to accelerate Visa's growth. So let me start with number 1, the enormous opportunity in consumer payments. We see that the pandemic has helped to further digitize cash.  In the last 12 months, global debit Cash volumes, which are primarily the amount of cash withdrawn from Visa debit cards has increased 4%, while debit payments volume has grown 23%, both on a constant dollar basis. In 2021, the number of monthly active e-commerce credentials and spend per active credential continue to grow strongly.  For example, in the U.S., monthly active credentials and active spend per credential both grew by more than 20% on average versus 2019. We've grown credentials for both traditional and new players to 3.7 billion up 7% year-over-year. After renewing client contacts that represented 55% of our payments volume in the previous 2 years, we renewed contracts that represented 20% in 2021.  Let me just highlight a few of those deals in Q4. In our Asia-Pacific region, we renewed 3 of these as top 20 issuers, including China Merchants Bank and Bank of China. And in North America, we renewed 3 of the top 15 issuers. PNC renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit at small business credit and debit portfolios.  Regions also renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit at small business credit and debit portfolios. And RBC and Visa have ventured into a renewal of their agreement with respect to the issuance of credit, debit and prepaid cards in Canada. Fintechs have also fueled our growth.  In the last year, nearly 30% more fintechs issued Visa credentials, and they have more than double their payments volume. Furthermore, fintechs are scaling. Robust, growing acceptance to more than 80 million merchant locations up 14% year-over-year. And when you include small businesses behind players like Stripe and Square, the number is north of a 100 million merchant locations.  We've grown top to pay to 70% of all face-to-face transactions globally. Excluding the U.S., we have more than 70 countries with over 50% contact with penetration. U.S. penetration is now over 15% more than double from just a year ago with 400 million cards; quadruple what we had 2 years ago.  We know from other markets that tapping brings increased spending and transactions while digitizing cash. We also continue to innovate to make it easier for partners to access and utilize our platforms and capabilities.  One recent example is Visa Cloud Connect, which enables clients to connect to VisaNet via the Cloud, eliminating the need for investment in local data centers, telecommunications infrastructure, and any specialized payment hardware. To summarize, consumer payments as an opportunity, and Visa's credentials, acceptance, and innovation that make us feel confident about our ability to accelerate growth in the future.  Moving now to our network of networks, we continue to enhance our capabilities to facilitate money movement seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem while accelerating the penetration of new flows. The total new flows opportunity is $185 trillion. Payments infrastructure, regulations and settlement systems, are all very local in nature, which creates a lot of complexity in a world of global trade.  Our network of networks capability enables Visa as the single connection point to help clients to move value domestically and cross-border over all networks including Visa's own networks, RTPs -- ACH is a new network in the future, like stable coins and public blockchain. In FY '21, we continue to build out Visa directs global reach surpassing 5 billion transactions across 500 programs in nearly 550 enablers, such as acquirers, processors, banks and fintechs.  In the U.S. alone, nearly 120 million cards have sent or received funds using Visa Direct. Visa Direct is unique as it is more -- has more endpoints and more used cases compared to the next competitor and offers flexible technology. Our growth plan for Visa Direct focuses on four key levers. First in trench existing use cases. P2P is our largest use case and an FY 2021; we surpassed 200 P2P programs globally.  An insurance disbursement is another use case, and this quarter we added nationwide to begin distributing claims. Second, we want to capture the cross-border opportunity for cross-border P2P during the fourth quarter, we added pay send, and soon Western Union's U.S. customers will be able to send funds to eligible Visa cards in the Philippines, Thailand, Colombia, and Jamaica, followed by a robust expansion plan for other countries.  The odd remittances we're also leveraging our cross-border capabilities for marketplaces, supplier payments. Student tuition payments and more. Our third lever to grow is scale the over 20 live use cases. Recent examples include, tipping, fund raising, brokerage account funding in airline vouchers, and in the fourth quarter, we added Yardi in the rental space area for property managers to distribute the security deposits.  Finally, scale new markets. Visa directed scaled rapidly in several markets, but there are many more where the market conditions are right for acceleration. For example, in Peru, we have a strong P2P footprint and are now adding new use cases like the innovative payrolls solution launched in partnership to?swell.  We have? Salary on-demand provider that also seeks to improve financial inclusion. Globally, we have more than quadruple the number of earned wage access providers on our platform since 2019. In short, we are just scratching the surface on Visa Direct and expect to drive rapid growth in the years ahead to capture the $65 trillion market opportunity. We also have many examples of partners utilizing Visa Direct and our B2B capabilities.  This quarter we're pleased that BIM will offer their 400,000 plus business customers the ability to make B2B payments via Visa Direct and through Visa virtual cards. We also have wins with Credorax in Europe for travel through a new commercial card agreement and through JPMorgan's participation in Visa's commercial pace solution.  These initiatives will support virtual card capabilities spur growth in new payment flows and drive incremental volume over time. Visa B2B Connect now operates in more than 100 markets and offers a multilateral network with distributed ledger technology that addresses the pain points of existing solutions, which include transparency and speed.  We're also pleased to have launched a partnership with Citi to be a global settlement bank for Visa B2B Connect, which broadens the endpoints available for clients to include Citi's business accounts for moving money cross-border, and their clearing capabilities for banks that have not yet been integrated into the B2B Connect network.  Given the size and breadth of Citi and our role in facilitating money movement, we're very excited about this capability to expand the Visa B2B Connect network. Looking ahead, open banking plays a V essential role in the network of networks. We believe Visa can accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe with our pending acquisition of Tink. Together we can provide a secure, reliable platform for innovation that can be expanded globally.  Whether it's leveraging account data for value-added services or facilitating account to account or paid by Bank money movement. Open banking creates opportunities from Visa to offer our clients and partners a one-stop shop for money movement, security, data, and valuable customer experiences. Blockchains also will continue to expand our network of networks.  Our settlement capabilities on our continued innovation around Crypto APIs and services have been key to winning new partnerships. We have nearly 60 crypto platform partners with the capability to issue Visa credentials, and there -- we're already capturing over 3.5 billion of payment volume in FY21.  The third reason we're even better positioned for growth post COVID is value-added services, where our scale and sophistication simultaneously help our clients be more successful while diversifying Visa's business and driving more value. Our value-added solutions differentiate Visa's network enable our clients to adapt to the changing payments ecosystem and deliver valuable services across other rails, enhancing our network and network capabilities.  In 2021, 40% of our clients used 5 or more value-added services and nearly 30% use 10 or more, which is up from 20% in 2020. Let me highlight a few services that have grown significantly in 2021. Cybersource added 28 new acquirer partners and 45,000 merchants. As a result -- and as a result, we're growing payments volume twice as fast as our broader client base and our risk solution on Cybersource called Decision Manager grew over 30%.  We have doubled the number of tokens over the past year to 2.6 billion and enhance the capabilities to manage them through Visa Cloud token across more than 8,600 issuers and 800, 0000 merchant\u2019s tokens have led to a 2.5% increase in approval rate and a 28% reduction in fraud rates.  These adept authorizations and Visa Risk Manager utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, which helped reduce fraud by $26 billion screening 30% more transactions in 2021 than in 2020. All of our efforts in authentication, risk, and identity and authorization optimization have led to cross-border card-not-present approval rates increasing by nearly 2% in the past year.  Therefore, value-added services revenue grew 25% in Q4 and also drove additional volume. Since the pandemic began, our bags revenue has averaged the quarterly growth rate in the high teens and was approximately $5 billion in FY '21.  Finally, the fourth reason that we that we believe we have great room to grow is, that we can enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps accelerate Visa's growth. These as past, present, and future about fostering innovation and enabling new partners capabilities than used cases.  We enable the disruptors -- we help them scale. Disruptors are good for payments at good for Visa. Given our role in the ecosystem, we don't pick winners or losers that we're well-positioned for growth across many potential outcomes. Let's take Wallets as an example. Wallets have done a tremendous job of building a user base in some cases building acceptance.  But at some point they reach a point where they are seeking a digital growth and many of them are embedding Visa credentials in their wallet. So the consumer can use anywhere these as accepted, as well as receive and send cross-border P2P payments. Line pays an excellent example with four portfolios totaling 5.6 million Visa credentials across 3 countries, including a new co-brand in Thailand that was launched in the fourth quarter.  Buy Now Pay Later or BNPL is a newer example. But we think we'll have a similar outcome. While installments are fast-growing, there just a fraction of the total industries payment volume estimated to be about 100 to 150 billion. But we are bringing scale to disruptors. We have a two-pronged strategy where we provide a network solution as well as solutions for our BNPL, Fintech partners.  The network solution offers issuers the ability to extend installments to their existing credit clients and merchants to offer a seamless installment option to their customer with flexible terms; we continue to expand our partnerships in Q4 with HSBC in Malaysia, Moneris, Canada's largest payment processor by volume, and ANZ in Australia with 2022 large volumes.  We also partnered with fintechs in a number of ways. We generate revenue as customers pay their installments with a Visa card through virtual cards for B2B or consumer payments, and through value-added services. The majority of the installment payoffs are on cards today. For example, in Canada over the last year, the number of Visa cards used to repay installments has grown more than 300%.  We believe we're currently experiencing BNPL 1.0. Individual fintechs and companies are cutting individual deals, merchant by merchant. Eventually, we believe the business model we evolve to BNPL 2.0 data with fintechs partners issue Visa credentials to leverage our acceptance and platforms to overcome the difficulty of scaling acceptance globally, merchant by merchant.  We're already seeing this evolution begin to take shape. Just this quarter, Florida signed a global brand deal that accelerate expansion at scale into several markets. So to close, Visa is better positioned than before the pandemic to capture the opportunity ahead supported by the strong growth in consumer payments, the scale of our platforms, network, and capabilities, and new flows and value-added services becoming a greater portion of our revenue.  And as cross-border volumes return over the next 2 years, it will only help to further drive our growth. Furthermore, over the history of our Company, we've demonstrated that our innovation, willingness to partner, and compelling and competitive offers have made our business resilient and successful.  With that, I will now turn it over to Vasant to review Q4 and also provide a view of what we believe these -- all these opportunities mean for Visa's financial performance in the coming year. Vasant, over to you.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon everyone. Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of two very different halves. In the first half, net revenues declined 4%, and non-GAAP EPS was down 2% as we lapped a pre -COVID first half of 2020. In the second half, the recovery was well underway, and we were lapping some of the worst 2020 COVID impacts. As a result, net revenue grew 28%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 43%.  Fiscal's fourth quarter results were better than we expected with net revenues up 29% driven by strong U.S. domestic trends. Robust value-added services, growth, and higher cross-border volumes from a faster than anticipated recovery in travel. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter's payment volumes, net revenue growth would have been approximately 22%.  GAAP EPS grew 70%, including equity in Investment gains and a one-time non-cash tax expense last year. Non-GAAP EPS rose 44% helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shift increased both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 0.5 a point. In constant dollar, global payments volume was up 17% led by continued strength in debit, as well as improving credit spending.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, global payments volume was 21% higher, 0.8% point acceleration from Q3, with debit slowing 1point, and credit improving by 3 points versus Q3. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 18% or 26% higher than 2019, and a 1 point acceleration from the third quarter.  China domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded [inaudible 00:19:57] conversion, which are minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume was up 30% over 2019, consistent with the third quarter. Credit improved 3 points to 17%, about 19 helped by consumer small business and commercial spending.  Debit closed 4 points, but remained very strong at 44% about 2019 without much benefit from economic impact payments. Card-present spend improved 3 points to 15% of our 2019, its highest level yet in the pandemic, driven by higher fuel and restaurants spending.  Card-not-present volume excluding travel, slowed 6 points to 53% over 2019 at some food and drug spending shifted back to card-present, and retail spend was not as strong without the benefit of stimulus payments. International constant dollar payments volume improved 3 points from Q3, up 15% over 2019 levels.  A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 58% from 2019, accelerated 10 points from the third quarter with robust performance across the region fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our EMEA region remains strong, up 48% from 2019 levels consistent with Q3, also fueled by cash digitization and client wins.  Europe was up 20% from 2019, improving Q3 points from Q3 due mostly to strong performance across Continental Europe, Asia-Pacific remains our weakest region, up 5% from 2019 and consistent with Q3, excluding China. Many countries instituted restrictions in the quarter including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Singapore, but all have started to recover in the past few weeks.  India payments volume has fully recovered from the severe COVID outbreak in Q3. Global process transactions with 24% over 2019, improving 4 points from the third quarter as transactions improved faster than volume. Tap to pay penetration increase in many markets and ticket sizes started to return to normal in the US.  Visa Direct transactions grew 35% down from the 50s in the previous 3 quarters. This quarter, we lapped a very strong Q4 of fiscal year 20 when Visa Direct hit 1 billion transactions for the first time. Stimulus payments have ended and we're lapping the COVID-related spike in P2P, which is moderating U.S. growth rates.  Meanwhile, the international business is ramping nicely, as well as growth from new skills such as cross-border remittances, earned wage access, and marketplace pay out. Across broader volume, recovery continued as more countries open their borders, while e-commerce spending, excluding travel, remains strong.  Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe was at 86% of 2019 volumes, a 4 point improvement from Q3, driven by the continued recovery in travel that started in May. Cross-border card-not-present volume excluding travel, continue to be very strong at 43% above 2019, declining 13 points from the third quarter, but consistent with Q2. As a reminder, the boost we saw in Q3 was primarily from cryptocurrency purchases.  Cross-border travel-related spending excluding intra -Europe versus 2019 improved 13 points from Q3 to Q4. It has risen from 40% of 2019 in April to 50% in June, to 61% in September. In terms of air travel, related spending is improving. The flights in Asia-Pacific outbound spend in each region is indexing at similar levels versus 2019 and each improved by between 10 to 20 points in Q4 versus Q3.  The largest improvements were in Canada, the Middle East, and across Europe. Europe in-bound spend improved by 24 points versus 2019 as popular travel destinations such as France and Italy relaxed their border restrictions. As we've seen consistently during the pandemic, there is pent up demand for travel as bookings accelerate when the borders opened.  Latin America remains by far the strongest destination, well over 2019 levels. U.S. to Mexico travel remained robust with spend more than 60% of our 2019 levels in Q4, Asia-Pacific remains mostly closed and did not meaningfully improve in the fourth quarter, remaining below 30% of 2019, both inbound and outbound.  Moving now to a quick review of fourth quarter financial results, service revenues grew 41% consistent with 39% nominal growth in third quarter payments volume and helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 20%, in line with 21% trusted transactions growth with a small impact from unfavorable country mix.  International transaction revenue were up 41%, 7 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding into Europe due to lapping, high-currency volatility last year and unfavorable regional mix. Other revenues grew 36% led by consulting and data services, as well as travel benefits.  In total, value-added services revenue grew 25% led by security and identity, as well as consulting and data services with some benefit from COVID-related lapping effects. Client incentive is lift 26.7% of gross revenues in line with our expectations.  The 90 basis point increase from Q3 was primarily driven by strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America and fewer adjustments for underperformance in certain geographies, partially offset by improving cross-border volume. Operating expenses grew 15% in line with our expectations. Marketing expenses grew 58% in the quarter as we stepped up spending and also lapped reductions in Q4 last year.  Personnel and professional services spend also accelerated as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We recorded gains from our equity investments of 101 million excluding investment gains, non-GAAP, and non-operating expense worth 118 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax matter.  GAAP EPS was $1.65, non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 44% over last year. We bought 13.2 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $231.33 for 3.1 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned over 3.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. On October 22nd, Visa's Board of Directors authorized a 17% increase in the quarterly dividend to $37.5 per share.  For the full-year, net revenues increased 10%, and non-GAAP EPS of $5.91 was up 17% the return 11.5 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 39.7 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $219.34 for an $8.7 billion and by paying dividend of 2.8 billion.  Before we discuss the year ahead, let me share performance through the first 3 weeks of October. U.S. payments volume was up 32% about 2019, consistent with September with debit at 44% and credit at 22% about 2019. Process transactions were 26% about 2019. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis was 94% of 2019, which is up 8 points from Q4 and 2 points from September.  Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 4 points compared to September to 65% of 2019. Card-not-present non-travel was 49% about 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter and down 2 points from September. Looking ahead to Fiscal Year 2022, our business has been on a recovery track for the past 3 to 4 quarters.  However, we're not back to normal yet globally. There are many factors to consider as we project the trajectory of the recovery. Debit and e-commerce outperformed and stay resilient even if credit recovers and in-store shopping returns. The full impact of stimulus payments and support programs ending remains to be seen.  Cross-border travel is recovering well, but still well below peak levels with the pace of recovery depend on cross-border -- on border openings. Asia has not reopened to the degree the rest of the world has. The timing of reopening in key countries across Asia, both domestically and for cross-border travel is a key variable.  Most importantly, COVID variants are still with us and vaccination rates remained low in large parts of the globe. With these factors as the backdrop for casting the trajectory of the return to normalcy remains difficult. Visibility, 4 quarters out, while improved, is still not great. For the past few quarters, we have been providing you our best sense of the business one quarter at a time and we will continue that practice in fiscal year '22.  Assuming current trends are sustained through December, you would expect first quarter net revenue growth in the high teens. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are likely to be in the 26% to 27% range, in line with the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. Sustained investment spending combined with low comparable last year, leads to operating expenses continuing to grow in the mid-teens.  Non-operating expense is expected to be in a 120 to 130 million range and tax rates in the 19% to 19.5% range. Looking for quarters out projecting growth, revenue growth poses the greatest challenge, in a significantly dependent on the pace of the cross-border travel recovery, as well as the other factors I just mentioned. It is all a function of your assumptions for these variables.  In order to be helpful, we will share the assumptions we are making for internal planning purposes. For domestic volumes and transactions, were assuming no disruptions from COVID-related lockdowns. As such, we assume that the recovery trajectory underway in payments volume and process transactions stays intact through Fiscal Year '22.  Cross-border travel, we assume that recovery underway continue steadily through Fiscal Year '22 to reach 2019 levels in the summer of 2023. We assume the index to 2019 climate from around 60 currently to around 80 by September 2022. We also assume the strong growth in cross-border e-commerce continues.  We expect new flows and value-added services growth in the high teens. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to range between 26% to 27% for the year, consistent with the fourth quarter, Fiscal Year '21 level. Pre -COVID, this percentage increased by 50 to 100 basis points each year due to the impact of new deals and renewals.  In Fiscal Year '22, we expect to benefit from revenue mix improvement as cross-border travel continues to recover; partially offset by the lapping of incentive reductions we had in Fiscal Year '21 due to the COVID impact. These assumptions result in high end of mid-teens net revenue growth for Fiscal Year '22, including over 0.5 point of exchange rate drag from the strengthening dollar.  First quarter growth in the high teens will moderate through the year, as we lap the recovery in Fiscal Year '21. As I said, these are our assumptions for internal planning purposes. We will continue to provide our outlook for the business one quarter at a time for Fiscal Year '22.  In terms of the other elements of the P&L, we expect operating expenses to grow in the low-teens in fiscal year '22 as we step up investment across all 3 lines of business to lay the foundation for sustained higher growth post-COVID. We're already increased marketing investment. We will invest heavily in our technology platforms to continue to enhance functionality, flexibility, security, and reliability.  We will invest to sustain the high growth we have in our new flows and value-added services business. And we will continue to add resources in-market to help our clients utilize all of our new capabilities. Expense growth will be higher in the first half and moderate in the second half as we lap the resumption of investment spending in Fiscal Year '21.  Non-operating expense is expected to be in the 120 to 130 million ranges each quarter, and our tax rate for the year is also expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range. None of these assumptions include tinker Currencycloud, which we expect to close in the first half of the fiscal year. They will not be material to Fiscal Year '22 revenue or non-GAAP EPS.  Visa remains a network of choice for innovative and money movement. We enabled the innovators and disruptors. We help them scale. And in turn, innovators drive our growth. We have continued to enhance the functionality and flexibility of our network to substantially expand the money movement use cases we saw, supporting the new-generation of fintechs as well as driving growth in our new flows business.  A value-added services, our differentiation, and create more value for our clients than alternative networks can. Our network of networks strategy substantially increases our loans, which we believe can create more value for all network participants than any closed loop or geographically limited network.  As we said at our Investor Day, we have a 10x growth opportunity ahead of us, and we are well-positioned to capture it. We ended Fiscal Year '21 the good momentum, a high-growth, resilient dividend e-commerce business, recovering credit and cross-border travel, and new flows and value-added services on newer growth engine driving further acceleration. With that, I'll hand it over to Mike Q&A.\nMike Milotich: Thank you Vasant. We're ready to take questions, Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson, you may go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Al, I wanted to follow up on number 2 on your list that was related to Visa's network of networks. You highlighted open banking as one area that you view as a positive for Visa because it enables new flows and value-added services.  It's often perceived, so actually that open banking as a negative for Visa because it can shift volume away from debit. Can you just elaborate on this point and how Visa benefits from open banking? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thank you, Lisa. Look, I think -- first of all open banking as you know is in its early stages. We believe by jumping into the middle of it, that we can help the ecosystem determine what is the best routing for different transactions. There are certainly are transactions that will lend themselves to A to A kind of approach which we know is one of the things that people will think about as a threat.  But there are an awful lot of transactions, many transactions where people appreciate the protections that are provided by a network like dispute resolution, fraud security, and the like. When money is moved instantaneously that's nice at one level. But if once it's moved, it's awfully hard to get it back and it's much more about other elements than just speed.  We also think by getting involved with Tink we are right at -- and have the opportunity to really learn as we go and we think that there is an opportunity to potentially provide value-added services even on transactions that might route over a different network. So I would say, Lisa, the bottom line is you could see some transactions that are incremental, that might move off these or off of our normal rail, but what the way we look at it as by leaning in, we're going to learn more about it and we're going to be able to influence what's happening and will also be able to make sure that we can provide other capabilities and value-added services to the various transactions.\nOperator: Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: David Koning from Baird, you may go ahead, sir.\nDavid Koning: Oh, yeah. Hey, thanks, guys. One thing I noticed was the last 6 years. I looked at the fiscal years and every year, U.S. volumes grew the same or faster than rest of world volumes. Maybe discuss a little bit. I know COVID the last year generated some of that, but as we look over the next 5 or even 10 years, A, does that reverse, and B, as part of the U.S. growth, just all the new fintechs stuff that's happened in the US, just creating a lift that is allowing kind of that outpacing?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think David; it's a combination of things. It's certainly is the explosion of some of the neobanks and fintechs. Although you're saying those really developed all the way around the world, I would also say though that our Visa Direct platform is much more mature in the U.S. than it is in other markets besides somewhat alluded to that point in his remarks, and that has certainly helped spark some of the growth as well.  I also think that the U.S. had -- prior to the pandemic at least been more advanced in e-commerce capabilities. And was much adjusted even more quickly than other markets might have. As we saw a rapid move towards cash digitization as COVID set upon us in March of 2020. All that said, we are setting out to invest around the globe and we want our business to grow in all markets and territories in which we do work.  We are more than happy to have the U.S. continue to grow, but I think as I look at the future of the business over the next 5 to 10 years, I expect still healthy growth in the U.S., but I do expect our volumes to continue to grow in a nice way around the world.  I mean, you saw this prior quarter as good as the growth was in the U.S. in the quarter, both Latin America and CEMEA had very, very strong quarters. And International growth was really held back by Asia-Pacific, which is really been hit very, very hard by lockdowns and restrictions as a result of the pandemic.\nVasant Prabhu: One other thing I might add as you look ahead, I mean, all the things Al said that even international is a little held back right now is because Asia, which is almost 20% of our payments volume is only growing at the levels -- low-single-digit levels, because they are largely still not open. The one thing to think about as we look ahead, as we said earlier, that Al said on his comments, contactless payments are already 70% penetrated outside the U.S.  So that's still a growth engine in the U.S. that is just beginning to take off and given the size of the U.S., that will be a meaningful contributor to transactions growth. And we also know that Tap to Pay digitizes cash and allows us to capture a much larger share of transactions at the point-of-sale.\nDavid Koning: Thanks, guys. Great.\nOperator: Thank you. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead, sir.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. I want to go back to one of the comments that you made as it relates to Buy Now, Pay Later in the growth of that, and how you see that as a growth avenue for Visa. Can you talk a little bit?  I think I conceptually get the idea of expanding acceptance and the advantages that this can provide there, but if you provide a little bit more color of like how you think that evolves and what those transactions will look like in a way that will benefit Visa? Thank you very much.\nAl Kelly: I think in the short-term, James, we're seeing many, many of these players use us and use our credentials, whether they're virtual cards or debit or credit card to actually pay off the various installments. And so we're getting instead of one transaction, we're getting four transactions. And certainly that's very good for us.  The point I was making is that in many ways, BNPL is a closed loop capability; somewhat it came to what Wallets were 3 years ago. And close looks just end up hitting a wall. They don't end up -- they end up hitting a wall where it's hard to scale, it's hard to bring the level of depth of choice that you can add to your customers.  And so what I think is going to happen is that BNPL players will become issuers who will issue Visa credentials that we'll have the, their value proposition for installments embedded within the product itself.  So that they can therefore scale very, very quickly by immediately having access to the 100 million merchants that I referenced in my remarks. And so that's what I believe based on history is going to happen and that's what I'm referring to when I say BNPL 2.0.\nJames Faucette: That's great, Kelly. Thanks, Al.\nOperator: Thank you. Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW, you may go ahead, sir.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. So the reopening of the U.S. border should be a pretty big catalyst for you guys. I'm just curious if you guys are seeing anything in terms of bookings that's giving you any perspectives on the trajectory that you outlined. And maybe what's assumed inside your expectations. Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: The U.S. border, the inbound to the U.S. maybe referred to the fact that international revenues have not grown as much as international volumes. Lots of the reason is the inbound travel has been quite strong into the CEMEA region and Latin America, which have been quite open. And it has improved quite a bit in Europe.  And because of the U.S. being largely restricted for inbound travel other than for U.S. citizens inbound to the U.S. is still -- it's better than Asia, but it is -- I'd say weaker than any of the other regions, Ex - Asia. So that's a clear upside there. It is a higher-yielding corridor, and so clearly there will be benefited there as the travel from Canada, travels from Europe is permitted. In general, I mean, it's hard to predict the mix.  It is incorporated in our views of how cross-border is going to improve. Cross-border travel, for it to go from what we said to the levels we are assuming at the end of fiscal year '22. You would have to assume improvement inbounds to the U.S. and that's all part of the equation.\nMike Milotich: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. You may go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. And I wanted to follow up on your comments and enabling disruptors as they could try for Visa. As we're seeing this rise of two-sided networks around the world, digital wallets, buy now pay later constraints, super apps.  And you talked about them becoming newest issuers of Visa credentials or something that you're already seeing. Do you think they also pose risk if they use account-to-account payments that open banking at the funding mix in terms of cost longer term? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Again, my view on all of these new players has always been that we assume they can be additive to the ecosystem, and we assume that we can be helpful to them. And so we lean into all of these new players very, very early. It's one of the reasons why we had the position we have right now in crypto where we have partnerships with over 60 players because we leaned in right from the beginning.  And all of them have the capability and many of them are already issuing these credentials. I think some of these players will help continue to digitize payments and take money away from cash. I think that it's extremely likely that some transactions will be A to A, but there's A to A transactions today, a lot of regular bill pay is for all types of purposes A to A. So I'm not really sure.  It's that that new bigger deal, but that said, we think that we're in a far better position to buy leaning in and working with these players. And if we don't actually have the transaction on our net. Network or we're out of the processing of the transaction overall, there's still the possibility of providing other capabilities from our tool box of solutions in value-added services to bring to the party.  So how it's all going to play out, we'll have to see, but I'm optimistic that the position that we're taking, which is to lean into all of this is going to put us in the best place to be successful.\nVasant Prabhu: Our approach on network of networks strategy is fundamentally to go to people with solutions that can meet all their money movement means. And we've told you about how we do it with a variety of players. Whether it's cross-border remittance providers, we allow them to do account-to-account, account-to-card, and card-to-account, any which way they can. We make it easy for them with one connection to get them money wherever it needs to go.  In effect, we get your money from point A to point B. The entire journey may not be on our rails, maybe part of the journey are on some other rails, but we can get it there and we provide all the things you expect from Visa, which is the trust our brand brings the reliability, the flexibility, the security, the dispute resolution, and all those capabilities. So fundamentally, it's all about solution providing -- about providing solutions, and not just about rails.\nHarshita Rawat: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Hey. Thanks, guys. It's kind of a two - sided question, but first is on the medium to long term. When we look at debit being stronger, understanding obviously an acceleration on e-com and just the other structural positives you've seen with cross-border 94% of '19, even with travel, it only 65 services strong.  I just be curious if you can touch on what you see structurally sustainable about these higher than probably what you'd expect pre -pandemic trends, standing versus not. And then when you think about your '22 qualitative look, what would you say were the areas you would try to build in the most conservatism into the outlook in terms of macro assumptions?\nVasant Prabhu: I think the first question. First. So in terms of the structural changes that have happened -- that are sustainable, the cash digitization engine is clearly extremely healthy. And that is a big driver of debit, because debit is the first gateway to digital payments that consumers use. And we've seen that debit has sustained its growth almost globally.  Even as we have seen, card present come back and reopening happen and similar statements go where there's been quite a bit resilience to debit strength helped by Visa Direct too. So all indications are that the cash digitization engine, especially in emerging markets, is really taken off because habits are being formed and people have gotten used to using digital forms of payment.  So we think there's quite bit resilience there and as evidence of that, even as things have started to normalize. The shift to e-commerce too has been remarkably resilient. We've seen -- if you see the charts we send out with our press release, you can see card-present has a pretty decent recovery in the past few quarters.  And if you look at how well e-commerce has held up. Card-not-present has held up. Again, there's been quite a bit of resilience there. Many new categories, people have gotten used to doing using e-commerce. And the biggest thing is cross-border e-commerce. Cross-border e-commerce has been extremely resilient.  If you look at it, it's indexing in the 140s. We saw a spike last quarter because of crypto currencies, but its back into the 140s as it was in the second quarter, which is very hefty growth compared to its prior growth rate. And it has held up even as cross-border travel is coming back. And even as card presence spending is coming back. So those 2 structural changes have shown quite a bit of resilience.  Once you look past those our value-added services have held up extremely well through the pandemic. If you look at the average growth in our value-added services over the past 6 to 8 quarters when we had the pandemic, it's been in the high teens. And our new flows businesses have been extremely high growth too. We're expecting high teen\u2019s next tier.  So those two new growth engines have shown quite a bit of resilience all the way through the pandemic. And that clearly lays a great foundation for the future as they become a larger and larger part of our business. If they're growing faster than our core consumer payments business. So that's a structurally higher growth rate because they are larger part of our mix.\nOperator: Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead, sir.\nBryan Keane: Hi. Good afternoon. Al, some of your peers have decided to buy the ACH rails and Visa has decided not to take that strategy and rely more on Visa Direct. So I was just hoping you could give us your latest thoughts on not needing to own the ACH rails and how it stacks up versus competitively versus what you guys have on Visa Direct.\nAl Kelly: Well, whether it's -- Bryan, whether it's ACH or RTP rails, they're -- is available to us as they are to anybody else. And we don't believe that we have to operate them in order to be successful in our network of networks strategies.  We think there's other places to spend our time and our money and core to what our view is, is that we want to be the traffic cop and facilitator and enabler so that we -- a sender can provide us the funds and tell us where the destination is around the world and through Visa Direct or B2B Connect, and utilizing for the first or last mile at ACH network or an RTP network gives us a great capability to reach what we believe is an unprecedented level of endpoints around the world that we think very, very much a differentiator.  And Visa Direct beyond its reach because we're using our Visa net platform, offers incredible operating scale. It allows us to leverage our value-added services that operate on VisaNet. So and we've had great success in commercializing the capabilities through the various use cases that I referred to in my remarks.  So we think the place to invest is in the capabilities to move funds seamlessly with great transparency and good economics, and continuing to invest there is where we take the smart thing to do.\nVasant Prabhu: I might just try to; perhaps clear up what maybe a misconception in the question you asked. Most ACH rails are owned by bank consortiums, the central banks around the world. You might be referring to -- if I think it's the competitor you're referring to they -- that's the RTP rails you're talking about and they don't own the rail. The RTP rails are typically always owned by bank consortiums, essential banks.  They are in the business of building the rails and then handing them over. And then in some cases, operating the rail, which by the way as I said opens to everybody to use a regulated rate. So the competitive you're referring to does not own RTP rails to the best of my knowledge anywhere. They have, in some cases, the opportunity to operate them in return for building them.  In some cases, they just build them and move on and they're not proprietary rails. They're open to everybody including us. And we looked at it hard and we concluded that the business of building these rails is not an attractive business. And the business of using these rails and the business of adding value-added capability as intelligence through these rails is a good business, and that's the business that we choose to be in.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thanks for the clarification.\nOperator: Thank you. Trevor Williams from Jefferies, you may go ahead, sir.\nTrevor Williams: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on yields in data processing. I know there are a few moving pieces in there, but was a little surprised this quarter to see those ticked down by a few percent from the September quarter, despite the improvement in cross-border.  So I think it'd be helpful just to get a sense of what the main variables or there I think from Vasant\u2019s comments, it sounds like there was just some country mix, but as we look to 4Q and 22. Just with the expectation that travel keeps working back towards the 2019 levels, like you guys have embedded just I mean, how much can that yield line benefit next year? And if there's any pricing that we should be thinking about rolling on next year with that, thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: I'm not sure there was any yield impact. If you just look at first of all, on the data processing line, both volumes and revenues are -- there's no lag, right? So the revenue should move in line with volumes in the quarter. And it did this quarter. I believe it was 20% and 21% or something volumes in net revenues. So they moved in line.  So there really wasn't really any change in yield. Now, clearly, the cross-border business is, relatively speaking, still recovering and below where it was, and therefore, the yields have been impacted by the mix shifting away from cross-border, and the mix improving is clearly helping the yields. But from one quarter to another, the yields were relatively stable.  There was nothing unusual going on there. I'm sure after the call, if there's any confusion, Mike and Jennifer could clear it up. But my short answer would be the yields are just fine and there was nothing unusual there.\nTrevor Williams: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\nTien Tsin Huang: Thank you so much. [Indiscernible] getting late, I just want to ask as you put your internal budget and investments together for fiscal '22, aside from cross-border recovering, what products or initiatives [Indiscernible] side are you most excited about this year? I know you lead with the 4 points about bigger picture growth been thinking about just near-term products and initiatives that we should be focused on.\nAl Kelly: I'll go with that, Vasant respond as well, Tien - Tsin. Look, I think you know each of the last 3 or 4 quarters, we've seen the recovery take more shape and I think there's --I'm in -- I feel very good about the way the business is advancing right now. I think consumer payments is positioned to stay strong, but in response to the question, a few questions ago, I think e-commerce is going to sustain.  I think Tap to Pay is going to sustain. We're starting to see some of the benefits of our acceptance footprint in places like Latin America grow and we're starting to see more of a shift to PV and away from cash throughout that region.  So consumer payments is still bread and butter for our Company and growing credentials, growing acceptance points, and continuing to work with our issuing partners on engagement and getting the most out of their existing customer base remain a very, very high priority for us. And I think we've gotten really good traction on our two other revenue streams in new flows and value-added services.  And I'm -- we've got a new flows value Visa Direct. We've talked a bunch about and feel very good about that. And I think as the world starts to see people return to the office and travel start to return, I think that's going to help the B2B space. And I think a lot of what I commented on in terms of wins and advances and value-added services in Fiscal '21 will continue into Fiscal '22.  So I think in short I like the fact that we've got a more diverse business model and more leverage to pull. Of course, we want to continue to plant flags and geographies where the business is still are payments and money movements a little bit more, more nascent. But all-in-all, I'm quite bullish on how the business looks as we enter Fiscal '22. Vasant, you want to add to anything?\nVasant Prabhu: Sure and then just to sort of give you a sense of where all the investment money is going. I mean, the broad team is we have substantially expanded the services we offer. The use cases we serve. And so what that means is we are investing significantly to continue to make our network more flexible. Add more functionality. Every day, our network is getting more flexible and adds more capability. We are substantially more services now to sell to our clients.  And there are many new types of issuers and new types of acceptance points. So significantly increasing the number of sort of the boots on the ground closest to our clients. So there's a big investment in the ground closest to clients to make our clients easily incorporate these services into their business, and also to bring in all these new types of fintechs if you want to call them, the innovators into our ecosystem.  The third dimension also is broadening of our brand. You've seen our new brand positioning. If you have watched the Olympics, you couldn't have missed it. It reflects where the future of Visa is.  It's not just about consumer payments. So there's clearly an investment in making sure that that message gets across. So broadly speaking, it's enabling new U.S. cases, new geographies, new clients, and repositioning the whole brand for essentially the leader in money movement.\nTien Tsin Huang: Thank you both for the update.\nOperator: Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse, you may go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks a lot for taking the question. I'll make this a little bit more of an industry question, but out alludes to something you mentioned earlier in terms of consumer protections, charge-backs to speed processes associated with card-based transactions. Maybe you could just talk a little bit broadly about in terms of, of course, there are many account to account and bank-based payment methods that are out there globally.  Generally speaking, what types of protections do they have, if any? And then the follow-up to that is how Visa can potentially work with some of those account-to-account and our bank-based payment methods to help add some of this in terms of the scheme, the process, the protections, security etc.\nAl Kelly: Well, the protections are very important. People tend to be on the biggest consumer protections that we think about are obviously fraud, making sure that consumers are not liable for fraud and charge-back protection that if you order a red large shirt and you get a blue medium one, that the ecosystem will stand behind you and either get you a replacement or get your money back.  To the best of my knowledge, Tim, I don't think that the A2A options offer any of those kinds of protections to consumers today that I'm aware of. And I think we'll have to see as A2A advances and as we get deeper into open banking, particularly starting in Europe, which is really ground zero for open banking. And obviously one of the reasons why we're excited about owning Tink.  We'll have to see whether we think that there's a way for us to step into try to help provide some of those protections for A or it could well be that A2A just has a different profile for our profile of protections or lack thereof for those transactions versus transactions on the run on network like Visa.\nTimothy Chiodo: Excellent. I really appreciate that context. Thank you so much Al.\nMike Milotich: We have time for one last question Michelle\nOperator: Thank you. Ashwin, Shirvaikar from Citi. You may go ahead, sir.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. So I mean, less than I think it was in your comments you mentioned sustained higher growth post-COVID and unpack this along the lines of U.S. versus non-U.S. in some of the debit versus credit parts. So that was quite helpful, my question is what the margin structure looks like as the revenue structures. First normalized and then possibly steps up beyond what was historically.\nVasant Prabhu: Looking at the average operating margins for the Company, as we've said before, our general view is that our goal is to grow volumes and revenues based on the opportunities available which we -- which as we've discussed are significant. And then we invest what it takes to do that. Margins are an outcome and not an objective.  Our business does tend to have a high fixed cost structure, the marginal transaction comes a low marginal costs. Value-added services businesses have good margins. New flows businesses have good margins. Yields and margins are different. The new flows businesses can have different yields than our core payments business.  But given that it leverages, the infrastructure and it's very much a scale business does come with very good margin. So you saw what happened to margins this year. We had a nice improvement from the drop we had in the COVID era. So net-net, I mean, we don't see anything vastly different from a margin perspective in the future, it will still be driven by the same factors. As I said, it's an outcome, not an objective.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Understood. Thank you.\nMike Milotich: Well, thank you, everyone for joining us today. If you have additional questions, feel free to reach out to myself for Jennifer and we're happy to help you. And thanks again and have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Al Kelly",
            "content": "Jennifer, thank you very much. And good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. In the fourth quarter and throughout Fiscal 2021, Visa's delivered strong results against the backdrop of economic uncertainty and the lingering impacts of the COVID pandemic.  In doing so, we demonstrated the resiliency of our business and validated our growth strategy as we continue to drive the rapid growth of digital payments and enable innovation in money movement globally.  A quick summary of Q4 results. Fourth-quarter payments volume was a 121% of 2019 up about 0.8 points from Q3 and up 17% year-over-year despite the backdrop of a global pandemic this quarter.  We also set a record with total global payments volume of $2.8 trillion. Cross-border volume, excluding intra -Europe, was 86% of 2019, 4 points better than Q3 and up 46% year-over-year and process transactions were a 124% of 2019 up 4 points from Q3 and up 21% year-over-year.  Our net revenues grew 29% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was a $1.62 up 44%. And talking too many of you over the last few months, I know you're wondering what the head for Visa and the payments ecosystem as we emerge from the pandemic.  So rather than doing my usual report card on the quarter, I'm going to speak more broadly today about the four key reasons why we believe that these as even better positioned for growth than before the pandemic: 1. there's still enormous opportunity ahead in consumer payments, 2.  We continue to enhance our network of networks capability to facilitate money movement more seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem and accelerate the penetration of new flows. Third, value-added services simultaneously help our clients leverage our scale and sophistication while diversifying these as business and driving more volume. 4.  We enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps to accelerate Visa's growth. So let me start with number 1, the enormous opportunity in consumer payments. We see that the pandemic has helped to further digitize cash.  In the last 12 months, global debit Cash volumes, which are primarily the amount of cash withdrawn from Visa debit cards has increased 4%, while debit payments volume has grown 23%, both on a constant dollar basis. In 2021, the number of monthly active e-commerce credentials and spend per active credential continue to grow strongly.  For example, in the U.S., monthly active credentials and active spend per credential both grew by more than 20% on average versus 2019. We've grown credentials for both traditional and new players to 3.7 billion up 7% year-over-year. After renewing client contacts that represented 55% of our payments volume in the previous 2 years, we renewed contracts that represented 20% in 2021.  Let me just highlight a few of those deals in Q4. In our Asia-Pacific region, we renewed 3 of these as top 20 issuers, including China Merchants Bank and Bank of China. And in North America, we renewed 3 of the top 15 issuers. PNC renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit at small business credit and debit portfolios.  Regions also renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit at small business credit and debit portfolios. And RBC and Visa have ventured into a renewal of their agreement with respect to the issuance of credit, debit and prepaid cards in Canada. Fintechs have also fueled our growth.  In the last year, nearly 30% more fintechs issued Visa credentials, and they have more than double their payments volume. Furthermore, fintechs are scaling. Robust, growing acceptance to more than 80 million merchant locations up 14% year-over-year. And when you include small businesses behind players like Stripe and Square, the number is north of a 100 million merchant locations.  We've grown top to pay to 70% of all face-to-face transactions globally. Excluding the U.S., we have more than 70 countries with over 50% contact with penetration. U.S. penetration is now over 15% more than double from just a year ago with 400 million cards; quadruple what we had 2 years ago.  We know from other markets that tapping brings increased spending and transactions while digitizing cash. We also continue to innovate to make it easier for partners to access and utilize our platforms and capabilities.  One recent example is Visa Cloud Connect, which enables clients to connect to VisaNet via the Cloud, eliminating the need for investment in local data centers, telecommunications infrastructure, and any specialized payment hardware. To summarize, consumer payments as an opportunity, and Visa's credentials, acceptance, and innovation that make us feel confident about our ability to accelerate growth in the future.  Moving now to our network of networks, we continue to enhance our capabilities to facilitate money movement seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem while accelerating the penetration of new flows. The total new flows opportunity is $185 trillion. Payments infrastructure, regulations and settlement systems, are all very local in nature, which creates a lot of complexity in a world of global trade.  Our network of networks capability enables Visa as the single connection point to help clients to move value domestically and cross-border over all networks including Visa's own networks, RTPs -- ACH is a new network in the future, like stable coins and public blockchain. In FY '21, we continue to build out Visa directs global reach surpassing 5 billion transactions across 500 programs in nearly 550 enablers, such as acquirers, processors, banks and fintechs.  In the U.S. alone, nearly 120 million cards have sent or received funds using Visa Direct. Visa Direct is unique as it is more -- has more endpoints and more used cases compared to the next competitor and offers flexible technology. Our growth plan for Visa Direct focuses on four key levers. First in trench existing use cases. P2P is our largest use case and an FY 2021; we surpassed 200 P2P programs globally.  An insurance disbursement is another use case, and this quarter we added nationwide to begin distributing claims. Second, we want to capture the cross-border opportunity for cross-border P2P during the fourth quarter, we added pay send, and soon Western Union's U.S. customers will be able to send funds to eligible Visa cards in the Philippines, Thailand, Colombia, and Jamaica, followed by a robust expansion plan for other countries.  The odd remittances we're also leveraging our cross-border capabilities for marketplaces, supplier payments. Student tuition payments and more. Our third lever to grow is scale the over 20 live use cases. Recent examples include, tipping, fund raising, brokerage account funding in airline vouchers, and in the fourth quarter, we added Yardi in the rental space area for property managers to distribute the security deposits.  Finally, scale new markets. Visa directed scaled rapidly in several markets, but there are many more where the market conditions are right for acceleration. For example, in Peru, we have a strong P2P footprint and are now adding new use cases like the innovative payrolls solution launched in partnership to?swell.  We have? Salary on-demand provider that also seeks to improve financial inclusion. Globally, we have more than quadruple the number of earned wage access providers on our platform since 2019. In short, we are just scratching the surface on Visa Direct and expect to drive rapid growth in the years ahead to capture the $65 trillion market opportunity. We also have many examples of partners utilizing Visa Direct and our B2B capabilities.  This quarter we're pleased that BIM will offer their 400,000 plus business customers the ability to make B2B payments via Visa Direct and through Visa virtual cards. We also have wins with Credorax in Europe for travel through a new commercial card agreement and through JPMorgan's participation in Visa's commercial pace solution.  These initiatives will support virtual card capabilities spur growth in new payment flows and drive incremental volume over time. Visa B2B Connect now operates in more than 100 markets and offers a multilateral network with distributed ledger technology that addresses the pain points of existing solutions, which include transparency and speed.  We're also pleased to have launched a partnership with Citi to be a global settlement bank for Visa B2B Connect, which broadens the endpoints available for clients to include Citi's business accounts for moving money cross-border, and their clearing capabilities for banks that have not yet been integrated into the B2B Connect network.  Given the size and breadth of Citi and our role in facilitating money movement, we're very excited about this capability to expand the Visa B2B Connect network. Looking ahead, open banking plays a V essential role in the network of networks. We believe Visa can accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe with our pending acquisition of Tink. Together we can provide a secure, reliable platform for innovation that can be expanded globally.  Whether it's leveraging account data for value-added services or facilitating account to account or paid by Bank money movement. Open banking creates opportunities from Visa to offer our clients and partners a one-stop shop for money movement, security, data, and valuable customer experiences. Blockchains also will continue to expand our network of networks.  Our settlement capabilities on our continued innovation around Crypto APIs and services have been key to winning new partnerships. We have nearly 60 crypto platform partners with the capability to issue Visa credentials, and there -- we're already capturing over 3.5 billion of payment volume in FY21.  The third reason we're even better positioned for growth post COVID is value-added services, where our scale and sophistication simultaneously help our clients be more successful while diversifying Visa's business and driving more value. Our value-added solutions differentiate Visa's network enable our clients to adapt to the changing payments ecosystem and deliver valuable services across other rails, enhancing our network and network capabilities.  In 2021, 40% of our clients used 5 or more value-added services and nearly 30% use 10 or more, which is up from 20% in 2020. Let me highlight a few services that have grown significantly in 2021. Cybersource added 28 new acquirer partners and 45,000 merchants. As a result -- and as a result, we're growing payments volume twice as fast as our broader client base and our risk solution on Cybersource called Decision Manager grew over 30%.  We have doubled the number of tokens over the past year to 2.6 billion and enhance the capabilities to manage them through Visa Cloud token across more than 8,600 issuers and 800, 0000 merchant's tokens have led to a 2.5% increase in approval rate and a 28% reduction in fraud rates.  These adept authorizations and Visa Risk Manager utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, which helped reduce fraud by $26 billion screening 30% more transactions in 2021 than in 2020. All of our efforts in authentication, risk, and identity and authorization optimization have led to cross-border card-not-present approval rates increasing by nearly 2% in the past year.  Therefore, value-added services revenue grew 25% in Q4 and also drove additional volume. Since the pandemic began, our bags revenue has averaged the quarterly growth rate in the high teens and was approximately $5 billion in FY '21.  Finally, the fourth reason that we that we believe we have great room to grow is, that we can enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps accelerate Visa's growth. These as past, present, and future about fostering innovation and enabling new partners capabilities than used cases.  We enable the disruptors -- we help them scale. Disruptors are good for payments at good for Visa. Given our role in the ecosystem, we don't pick winners or losers that we're well-positioned for growth across many potential outcomes. Let's take Wallets as an example. Wallets have done a tremendous job of building a user base in some cases building acceptance.  But at some point they reach a point where they are seeking a digital growth and many of them are embedding Visa credentials in their wallet. So the consumer can use anywhere these as accepted, as well as receive and send cross-border P2P payments. Line pays an excellent example with four portfolios totaling 5.6 million Visa credentials across 3 countries, including a new co-brand in Thailand that was launched in the fourth quarter.  Buy Now Pay Later or BNPL is a newer example. But we think we'll have a similar outcome. While installments are fast-growing, there just a fraction of the total industries payment volume estimated to be about 100 to 150 billion. But we are bringing scale to disruptors. We have a two-pronged strategy where we provide a network solution as well as solutions for our BNPL, Fintech partners.  The network solution offers issuers the ability to extend installments to their existing credit clients and merchants to offer a seamless installment option to their customer with flexible terms; we continue to expand our partnerships in Q4 with HSBC in Malaysia, Moneris, Canada's largest payment processor by volume, and ANZ in Australia with 2022 large volumes.  We also partnered with fintechs in a number of ways. We generate revenue as customers pay their installments with a Visa card through virtual cards for B2B or consumer payments, and through value-added services. The majority of the installment payoffs are on cards today. For example, in Canada over the last year, the number of Visa cards used to repay installments has grown more than 300%.  We believe we're currently experiencing BNPL 1.0. Individual fintechs and companies are cutting individual deals, merchant by merchant. Eventually, we believe the business model we evolve to BNPL 2.0 data with fintechs partners issue Visa credentials to leverage our acceptance and platforms to overcome the difficulty of scaling acceptance globally, merchant by merchant.  We're already seeing this evolution begin to take shape. Just this quarter, Florida signed a global brand deal that accelerate expansion at scale into several markets. So to close, Visa is better positioned than before the pandemic to capture the opportunity ahead supported by the strong growth in consumer payments, the scale of our platforms, network, and capabilities, and new flows and value-added services becoming a greater portion of our revenue.  And as cross-border volumes return over the next 2 years, it will only help to further drive our growth. Furthermore, over the history of our Company, we've demonstrated that our innovation, willingness to partner, and compelling and competitive offers have made our business resilient and successful.  With that, I will now turn it over to Vasant to review Q4 and also provide a view of what we believe these -- all these opportunities mean for Visa's financial performance in the coming year. Vasant, over to you. Thank you, Lisa. Look, I think -- first of all open banking as you know is in its early stages. We believe by jumping into the middle of it, that we can help the ecosystem determine what is the best routing for different transactions. There are certainly are transactions that will lend themselves to A to A kind of approach which we know is one of the things that people will think about as a threat.  But there are an awful lot of transactions, many transactions where people appreciate the protections that are provided by a network like dispute resolution, fraud security, and the like. When money is moved instantaneously that's nice at one level. But if once it's moved, it's awfully hard to get it back and it's much more about other elements than just speed.  We also think by getting involved with Tink we are right at -- and have the opportunity to really learn as we go and we think that there is an opportunity to potentially provide value-added services even on transactions that might route over a different network. So I would say, Lisa, the bottom line is you could see some transactions that are incremental, that might move off these or off of our normal rail, but what the way we look at it as by leaning in, we're going to learn more about it and we're going to be able to influence what's happening and will also be able to make sure that we can provide other capabilities and value-added services to the various transactions. Thank you. Well, I think David; it's a combination of things. It's certainly is the explosion of some of the neobanks and fintechs. Although you're saying those really developed all the way around the world, I would also say though that our Visa Direct platform is much more mature in the U.S. than it is in other markets besides somewhat alluded to that point in his remarks, and that has certainly helped spark some of the growth as well.  I also think that the U.S. had -- prior to the pandemic at least been more advanced in e-commerce capabilities. And was much adjusted even more quickly than other markets might have. As we saw a rapid move towards cash digitization as COVID set upon us in March of 2020. All that said, we are setting out to invest around the globe and we want our business to grow in all markets and territories in which we do work.  We are more than happy to have the U.S. continue to grow, but I think as I look at the future of the business over the next 5 to 10 years, I expect still healthy growth in the U.S., but I do expect our volumes to continue to grow in a nice way around the world.  I mean, you saw this prior quarter as good as the growth was in the U.S. in the quarter, both Latin America and CEMEA had very, very strong quarters. And International growth was really held back by Asia-Pacific, which is really been hit very, very hard by lockdowns and restrictions as a result of the pandemic. I think in the short-term, James, we're seeing many, many of these players use us and use our credentials, whether they're virtual cards or debit or credit card to actually pay off the various installments. And so we're getting instead of one transaction, we're getting four transactions. And certainly that's very good for us.  The point I was making is that in many ways, BNPL is a closed loop capability; somewhat it came to what Wallets were 3 years ago. And close looks just end up hitting a wall. They don't end up -- they end up hitting a wall where it's hard to scale, it's hard to bring the level of depth of choice that you can add to your customers.  And so what I think is going to happen is that BNPL players will become issuers who will issue Visa credentials that we'll have the, their value proposition for installments embedded within the product itself.  So that they can therefore scale very, very quickly by immediately having access to the 100 million merchants that I referenced in my remarks. And so that's what I believe based on history is going to happen and that's what I'm referring to when I say BNPL 2.0. Again, my view on all of these new players has always been that we assume they can be additive to the ecosystem, and we assume that we can be helpful to them. And so we lean into all of these new players very, very early. It's one of the reasons why we had the position we have right now in crypto where we have partnerships with over 60 players because we leaned in right from the beginning.  And all of them have the capability and many of them are already issuing these credentials. I think some of these players will help continue to digitize payments and take money away from cash. I think that it's extremely likely that some transactions will be A to A, but there's A to A transactions today, a lot of regular bill pay is for all types of purposes A to A. So I'm not really sure.  It's that that new bigger deal, but that said, we think that we're in a far better position to buy leaning in and working with these players. And if we don't actually have the transaction on our net. Network or we're out of the processing of the transaction overall, there's still the possibility of providing other capabilities from our tool box of solutions in value-added services to bring to the party.  So how it's all going to play out, we'll have to see, but I'm optimistic that the position that we're taking, which is to lean into all of this is going to put us in the best place to be successful. Well, whether it's -- Bryan, whether it's ACH or RTP rails, they're -- is available to us as they are to anybody else. And we don't believe that we have to operate them in order to be successful in our network of networks strategies.  We think there's other places to spend our time and our money and core to what our view is, is that we want to be the traffic cop and facilitator and enabler so that we -- a sender can provide us the funds and tell us where the destination is around the world and through Visa Direct or B2B Connect, and utilizing for the first or last mile at ACH network or an RTP network gives us a great capability to reach what we believe is an unprecedented level of endpoints around the world that we think very, very much a differentiator.  And Visa Direct beyond its reach because we're using our Visa net platform, offers incredible operating scale. It allows us to leverage our value-added services that operate on VisaNet. So and we've had great success in commercializing the capabilities through the various use cases that I referred to in my remarks.  So we think the place to invest is in the capabilities to move funds seamlessly with great transparency and good economics, and continuing to invest there is where we take the smart thing to do. I'll go with that, Vasant respond as well, Tien - Tsin. Look, I think you know each of the last 3 or 4 quarters, we've seen the recovery take more shape and I think there's --I'm in -- I feel very good about the way the business is advancing right now. I think consumer payments is positioned to stay strong, but in response to the question, a few questions ago, I think e-commerce is going to sustain.  I think Tap to Pay is going to sustain. We're starting to see some of the benefits of our acceptance footprint in places like Latin America grow and we're starting to see more of a shift to PV and away from cash throughout that region.  So consumer payments is still bread and butter for our Company and growing credentials, growing acceptance points, and continuing to work with our issuing partners on engagement and getting the most out of their existing customer base remain a very, very high priority for us. And I think we've gotten really good traction on our two other revenue streams in new flows and value-added services.  And I'm -- we've got a new flows value Visa Direct. We've talked a bunch about and feel very good about that. And I think as the world starts to see people return to the office and travel start to return, I think that's going to help the B2B space. And I think a lot of what I commented on in terms of wins and advances and value-added services in Fiscal '21 will continue into Fiscal '22.  So I think in short I like the fact that we've got a more diverse business model and more leverage to pull. Of course, we want to continue to plant flags and geographies where the business is still are payments and money movements a little bit more, more nascent. But all-in-all, I'm quite bullish on how the business looks as we enter Fiscal '22. Vasant, you want to add to anything? Well, the protections are very important. People tend to be on the biggest consumer protections that we think about are obviously fraud, making sure that consumers are not liable for fraud and charge-back protection that if you order a red large shirt and you get a blue medium one, that the ecosystem will stand behind you and either get you a replacement or get your money back.  To the best of my knowledge, Tim, I don't think that the A2A options offer any of those kinds of protections to consumers today that I'm aware of. And I think we'll have to see as A2A advances and as we get deeper into open banking, particularly starting in Europe, which is really ground zero for open banking.

            "content": "Thank you, Al. Good afternoon everyone. Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of two very different halves. In the first half, net revenues declined 4%, and non-GAAP EPS was down 2% as we lapped a pre -COVID first half of 2020. In the second half, the recovery was well underway, and we were lapping some of the worst 2020 COVID impacts. As a result, net revenue grew 28%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 43%.  Fiscal's fourth quarter results were better than we expected with net revenues up 29% driven by strong U.S. domestic trends. Robust value-added services, growth, and higher cross-border volumes from a faster than anticipated recovery in travel. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter's payment volumes, net revenue growth would have been approximately 22%.  GAAP EPS grew 70%, including equity in Investment gains and a one-time non-cash tax expense last year. Non-GAAP EPS rose 44% helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shift increased both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 0.5 a point. In constant dollar, global payments volume was up 17% led by continued strength in debit, as well as improving credit spending.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, global payments volume was 21% higher, 0.8% point acceleration from Q3, with debit slowing 1point, and credit improving by 3 points versus Q3. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 18% or 26% higher than 2019, and a 1 point acceleration from the third quarter.  China domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded [inaudible 00:19:57] conversion, which are minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume was up 30% over 2019, consistent with the third quarter. Credit improved 3 points to 17%, about 19 helped by consumer small business and commercial spending.  Debit closed 4 points, but remained very strong at 44% about 2019 without much benefit from economic impact payments. Card-present spend improved 3 points to 15% of our 2019, its highest level yet in the pandemic, driven by higher fuel and restaurants spending.  Card-not-present volume excluding travel, slowed 6 points to 53% over 2019 at some food and drug spending shifted back to card-present, and retail spend was not as strong without the benefit of stimulus payments. International constant dollar payments volume improved 3 points from Q3, up 15% over 2019 levels.  A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 58% from 2019, accelerated 10 points from the third quarter with robust performance across the region fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our EMEA region remains strong, up 48% from 2019 levels consistent with Q3, also fueled by cash digitization and client wins.  Europe was up 20% from 2019, improving Q3 points from Q3 due mostly to strong performance across Continental Europe, Asia-Pacific remains our weakest region, up 5% from 2019 and consistent with Q3, excluding China. Many countries instituted restrictions in the quarter including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Singapore, but all have started to recover in the past few weeks.  India payments volume has fully recovered from the severe COVID outbreak in Q3. Global process transactions with 24% over 2019, improving 4 points from the third quarter as transactions improved faster than volume. Tap to pay penetration increase in many markets and ticket sizes started to return to normal in the US.  Visa Direct transactions grew 35% down from the 50s in the previous 3 quarters. This quarter, we lapped a very strong Q4 of fiscal year 20 when Visa Direct hit 1 billion transactions for the first time. Stimulus payments have ended and we're lapping the COVID-related spike in P2P, which is moderating U.S. growth rates.  Meanwhile, the international business is ramping nicely, as well as growth from new skills such as cross-border remittances, earned wage access, and marketplace pay out. Across broader volume, recovery continued as more countries open their borders, while e-commerce spending, excluding travel, remains strong.  Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe was at 86% of 2019 volumes, a 4 point improvement from Q3, driven by the continued recovery in travel that started in May. Cross-border card-not-present volume excluding travel, continue to be very strong at 43% above 2019, declining 13 points from the third quarter, but consistent with Q2. As a reminder, the boost we saw in Q3 was primarily from cryptocurrency purchases.  Cross-border travel-related spending excluding intra -Europe versus 2019 improved 13 points from Q3 to Q4. It has risen from 40% of 2019 in April to 50% in June, to 61% in September. In terms of air travel, related spending is improving. The flights in Asia-Pacific outbound spend in each region is indexing at similar levels versus 2019 and each improved by between 10 to 20 points in Q4 versus Q3.  The largest improvements were in Canada, the Middle East, and across Europe. Europe in-bound spend improved by 24 points versus 2019 as popular travel destinations such as France and Italy relaxed their border restrictions. As we've seen consistently during the pandemic, there is pent up demand for travel as bookings accelerate when the borders opened.  Latin America remains by far the strongest destination, well over 2019 levels. U.S. to Mexico travel remained robust with spend more than 60% of our 2019 levels in Q4, Asia-Pacific remains mostly closed and did not meaningfully improve in the fourth quarter, remaining below 30% of 2019, both inbound and outbound.  Moving now to a quick review of fourth quarter financial results, service revenues grew 41% consistent with 39% nominal growth in third quarter payments volume and helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 20%, in line with 21% trusted transactions growth with a small impact from unfavorable country mix.  International transaction revenue were up 41%, 7 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding into Europe due to lapping, high-currency volatility last year and unfavorable regional mix. Other revenues grew 36% led by consulting and data services, as well as travel benefits.  In total, value-added services revenue grew 25% led by security and identity, as well as consulting and data services with some benefit from COVID-related lapping effects. Client incentive is lift 26.7% of gross revenues in line with our expectations.  The 90 basis point increase from Q3 was primarily driven by strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America and fewer adjustments for underperformance in certain geographies, partially offset by improving cross-border volume. Operating expenses grew 15% in line with our expectations. Marketing expenses grew 58% in the quarter as we stepped up spending and also lapped reductions in Q4 last year.  Personnel and professional services spend also accelerated as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We recorded gains from our equity investments of 101 million excluding investment gains, non-GAAP, and non-operating expense worth 118 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax matter.  GAAP EPS was $1.65, non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 44% over last year. We bought 13.2 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $231.33 for 3.1 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned over 3.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. On October 22nd, Visa's Board of Directors authorized a 17% increase in the quarterly dividend to $37.5 per share.  For the full-year, net revenues increased 10%, and non-GAAP EPS of $5.91 was up 17% the return 11.5 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 39.7 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $219.34 for an $8.7 billion and by paying dividend of 2.8 billion.  Before we discuss the year ahead, let me share performance through the first 3 weeks of October. U.S. payments volume was up 32% about 2019, consistent with September with debit at 44% and credit at 22% about 2019. Process transactions were 26% about 2019. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis was 94% of 2019, which is up 8 points from Q4 and 2 points from September.  Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 4 points compared to September to 65% of 2019. Card-not-present non-travel was 49% about 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter and down 2 points from September. Looking ahead to Fiscal Year 2022, our business has been on a recovery track for the past 3 to 4 quarters.  However, we're not back to normal yet globally. There are many factors to consider as we project the trajectory of the recovery. Debit and e-commerce outperformed and stay resilient even if credit recovers and in-store shopping returns. The full impact of stimulus payments and support programs ending remains to be seen.  Cross-border travel is recovering well, but still well below peak levels with the pace of recovery depend on cross-border -- on border openings. Asia has not reopened to the degree the rest of the world has. The timing of reopening in key countries across Asia, both domestically and for cross-border travel is a key variable.  Most importantly, COVID variants are still with us and vaccination rates remained low in large parts of the globe. With these factors as the backdrop for casting the trajectory of the return to normalcy remains difficult. Visibility, 4 quarters out, while improved, is still not great. For the past few quarters, we have been providing you our best sense of the business one quarter at a time and we will continue that practice in fiscal year '22.  Assuming current trends are sustained through December, you would expect first quarter net revenue growth in the high teens. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are likely to be in the 26% to 27% range, in line with the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. Sustained investment spending combined with low comparable last year, leads to operating expenses continuing to grow in the mid-teens.  Non-operating expense is expected to be in a 120 to 130 million range and tax rates in the 19% to 19.5% range. Looking for quarters out projecting growth, revenue growth poses the greatest challenge, in a significantly dependent on the pace of the cross-border travel recovery, as well as the other factors I just mentioned. It is all a function of your assumptions for these variables.  In order to be helpful, we will share the assumptions we are making for internal planning purposes. For domestic volumes and transactions, were assuming no disruptions from COVID-related lockdowns. As such, we assume that the recovery trajectory underway in payments volume and process transactions stays intact through Fiscal Year '22.  Cross-border travel, we assume that recovery underway continue steadily through Fiscal Year '22 to reach 2019 levels in the summer of 2023. We assume the index to 2019 climate from around 60 currently to around 80 by September 2022. We also assume the strong growth in cross-border e-commerce continues.  We expect new flows and value-added services growth in the high teens. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to range between 26% to 27% for the year, consistent with the fourth quarter, Fiscal Year '21 level. Pre -COVID, this percentage increased by 50 to 100 basis points each year due to the impact of new deals and renewals.  In Fiscal Year '22, we expect to benefit from revenue mix improvement as cross-border travel continues to recover; partially offset by the lapping of incentive reductions we had in Fiscal Year '21 due to the COVID impact. These assumptions result in high end of mid-teens net revenue growth for Fiscal Year '22, including over 0.5 point of exchange rate drag from the strengthening dollar.  First quarter growth in the high teens will moderate through the year, as we lap the recovery in Fiscal Year '21. As I said, these are our assumptions for internal planning purposes. We will continue to provide our outlook for the business one quarter at a time for Fiscal Year '22.  In terms of the other elements of the P&L, we expect operating expenses to grow in the low-teens in fiscal year '22 as we step up investment across all 3 lines of business to lay the foundation for sustained higher growth post-COVID. We're already increased marketing investment. We will invest heavily in our technology platforms to continue to enhance functionality, flexibility, security, and reliability.  We will invest to sustain the high growth we have in our new flows and value-added services business. And we will continue to add resources in-market to help our clients utilize all of our new capabilities. Expense growth will be higher in the first half and moderate in the second half as we lap the resumption of investment spending in Fiscal Year '21.  Non-operating expense is expected to be in the 120 to 130 million ranges each quarter, and our tax rate for the year is also expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range. None of these assumptions include tinker Currencycloud, which we expect to close in the first half of the fiscal year. They will not be material to Fiscal Year '22 revenue or non-GAAP EPS.  Visa remains a network of choice for innovative and money movement. We enabled the innovators and disruptors. We help them scale. And in turn, innovators drive our growth. We have continued to enhance the functionality and flexibility of our network to substantially expand the money movement use cases we saw, supporting the new-generation of fintechs as well as driving growth in our new flows business.  A value-added services, our differentiation, and create more value for our clients than alternative networks can. Our network of networks strategy substantially increases our loans, which we believe can create more value for all network participants than any closed loop or geographically limited network.  As we said at our Investor Day, we have a 10x growth opportunity ahead of us, and we are well-positioned to capture it. We ended Fiscal Year '21 the good momentum, a high-growth, resilient dividend e-commerce business, recovering credit and cross-border travel, and new flows and value-added services on newer growth engine driving further acceleration. With that, I'll hand it over to Mike Q&A. One other thing I might add as you look ahead, I mean, all the things Al said that even international is a little held back right now is because Asia, which is almost 20% of our payments volume is only growing at the levels -- low-single-digit levels, because they are largely still not open. The one thing to think about as we look ahead, as we said earlier, that Al said on his comments, contactless payments are already 70% penetrated outside the U.S.  So that's still a growth engine in the U.S. that is just beginning to take off and given the size of the U.S., that will be a meaningful contributor to transactions growth. And we also know that Tap to Pay digitizes cash and allows us to capture a much larger share of transactions at the point-of-sale. The U.S. border, the inbound to the U.S. maybe referred to the fact that international revenues have not grown as much as international volumes. Lots of the reason is the inbound travel has been quite strong into the CEMEA region and Latin America, which have been quite open. And it has improved quite a bit in Europe.  And because of the U.S. being largely restricted for inbound travel other than for U.S. citizens inbound to the U.S. is still -- it's better than Asia, but it is -- I'd say weaker than any of the other regions, Ex - Asia. So that's a clear upside there. It is a higher-yielding corridor, and so clearly there will be benefited there as the travel from Canada, travels from Europe is permitted. In general, I mean, it's hard to predict the mix.  It is incorporated in our views of how cross-border is going to improve. Cross-border travel, for it to go from what we said to the levels we are assuming at the end of fiscal year '22. You would have to assume improvement inbounds to the U.S. and that's all part of the equation. Our approach on network of networks strategy is fundamentally to go to people with solutions that can meet all their money movement means. And we've told you about how we do it with a variety of players. Whether it's cross-border remittance providers, we allow them to do account-to-account, account-to-card, and card-to-account, any which way they can. We make it easy for them with one connection to get them money wherever it needs to go.  In effect, we get your money from point A to point B. The entire journey may not be on our rails, maybe part of the journey are on some other rails, but we can get it there and we provide all the things you expect from Visa, which is the trust our brand brings the reliability, the flexibility, the security, the dispute resolution, and all those capabilities. So fundamentally, it's all about solution providing -- about providing solutions, and not just about rails. I think the first question. First. So in terms of the structural changes that have happened -- that are sustainable, the cash digitization engine is clearly extremely healthy. And that is a big driver of debit, because debit is the first gateway to digital payments that consumers use. And we've seen that debit has sustained its growth almost globally.  Even as we have seen, card present come back and reopening happen and similar statements go where there's been quite a bit resilience to debit strength helped by Visa Direct too. So all indications are that the cash digitization engine, especially in emerging markets, is really taken off because habits are being formed and people have gotten used to using digital forms of payment.  So we think there's quite bit resilience there and as evidence of that, even as things have started to normalize. The shift to e-commerce too has been remarkably resilient. We've seen -- if you see the charts we send out with our press release, you can see card-present has a pretty decent recovery in the past few quarters.  And if you look at how well e-commerce has held up. Card-not-present has held up. Again, there's been quite a bit of resilience there. Many new categories, people have gotten used to doing using e-commerce. And the biggest thing is cross-border e-commerce. Cross-border e-commerce has been extremely resilient.  If you look at it, it's indexing in the 140s. We saw a spike last quarter because of crypto currencies, but its back into the 140s as it was in the second quarter, which is very hefty growth compared to its prior growth rate. And it has held up even as cross-border travel is coming back. And even as card presence spending is coming back. So those 2 structural changes have shown quite a bit of resilience.  Once you look past those our value-added services have held up extremely well through the pandemic. If you look at the average growth in our value-added services over the past 6 to 8 quarters when we had the pandemic, it's been in the high teens. And our new flows businesses have been extremely high growth too. We're expecting high teen's next tier.  So those two new growth engines have shown quite a bit of resilience all the way through the pandemic. And that clearly lays a great foundation for the future as they become a larger and larger part of our business. If they're growing faster than our core consumer payments business. So that's a structurally higher growth rate because they are larger part of our mix. I might just try to; perhaps clear up what maybe a misconception in the question you asked. Most ACH rails are owned by bank consortiums, the central banks around the world. You might be referring to -- if I think it's the competitor you're referring to they -- that's the RTP rails you're talking about and they don't own the rail. The RTP rails are typically always owned by bank consortiums, essential banks.  They are in the business of building the rails and then handing them over. And then in some cases, operating the rail, which by the way as I said opens to everybody to use a regulated rate. So the competitive you're referring to does not own RTP rails to the best of my knowledge anywhere. They have, in some cases, the opportunity to operate them in return for building them.  In some cases, they just build them and move on and they're not proprietary rails. They're open to everybody including us. And we looked at it hard and we concluded that the business of building these rails is not an attractive business. And the business of using these rails and the business of adding value-added capability as intelligence through these rails is a good business, and that's the business that we choose to be in. I'm not sure there was any yield impact. If you just look at first of all, on the data processing line, both volumes and revenues are -- there's no lag, right? So the revenue should move in line with volumes in the quarter. And it did this quarter. I believe it was 20% and 21% or something volumes in net revenues. So they moved in line.  So there really wasn't really any change in yield. Now, clearly, the cross-border business is, relatively speaking, still recovering and below where it was, and therefore, the yields have been impacted by the mix shifting away from cross-border, and the mix improving is clearly helping the yields. But from one quarter to another, the yields were relatively stable.  There was nothing unusual going on there. I'm sure after the call, if there's any confusion, Mike and Jennifer could clear it up. But my short answer would be the yields are just fine and there was nothing unusual there. Sure and then just to sort of give you a sense of where all the investment money is going. I mean, the broad team is we have substantially expanded the services we offer. The use cases we serve. And so what that means is we are investing significantly to continue to make our network more flexible. Add more functionality. Every day, our network is getting more flexible and adds more capability. We are substantially more services now to sell to our clients.  And there are many new types of issuers and new types of acceptance points. So significantly increasing the number of sort of the boots on the ground closest to our clients. So there's a big investment in the ground closest to clients to make our clients easily incorporate these services into their business, and also to bring in all these new types of fintechs if you want to call them, the innovators into our ecosystem.  The third dimension also is broadening of our brand. You've seen our new brand positioning. If you have watched the Olympics, you couldn't have missed it. It reflects where the future of Visa is.  It's not just about consumer payments. So there's clearly an investment in making sure that that message gets across. So broadly speaking, it's enabling new U.S. cases, new geographies, new clients, and repositioning the whole brand for essentially the leader in money movement. Looking at the average operating margins for the Company, as we've said before, our general view is that our goal is to grow volumes and revenues based on the opportunities available which we -- which as we've discussed are significant. And then we invest what it takes to do that. Margins are an outcome and not an objective.  Our business does tend to have a high fixed cost structure, the marginal transaction comes a low marginal costs. Value-added services businesses have good margins. New flows businesses have good margins. Yields and margins are different. The new flows businesses can have different yields than our core payments business.  But given that it leverages, the infrastructure and it's very much a scale business does come with very good margin. So you saw what happened to margins this year. We had a nice improvement from the drop we had in the COVID era. So net-net, I mean, we don't see anything vastly different from a margin perspective in the future, it will still be driven by the same factors. As I said, it's an outcome, not an objective."

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAlfred Kelly: Thanks, Jennifer. Good afternoon. Thank you for joning us. We had a really strong fiscal third quarter as payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volume, all approved globally. In our time today, I will first cover our results, and then discuss our performance to date across our three growth levers: consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. The first Q3 results, net revenue rose 27% or 39% if service revenues were recognized on the current quarter's payment volume. This growth far exceeded our expectations due to the strength in the U.S., improving cross-border volumes and lower-than-expected client incentives, largely due to deal timing. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.49, up 41%.  As we look at volumes of transactions, keep in mind that year-over-year growth rates are less indicative of performance and the business trajectory due to the COVID-19 impact. So once again, we provide metrics compared to 2019 on a constant dollar basis as well as year-over-year growth rates. Payments volume was a 121% of 2019, which is up 5 points from the second quarter and represents a 34% year-over-year growth rate.  Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe was 82% of 2019, 7 points better than the second quarter, and up 53% year-over-year. The process transactions were a 120% of 2019, up 4 points from Q2 and up 39% year-over-year. Vasant will provide more color on our results, so now let me transition to progress relative to our business strategy efforts across our three growth levers helped to fuel strong results while positioning us to capture future opportunities.  In consumer payments this quarter, we saw a favorable secular trends and had a number of wins with large issuers, co-brands and fintechs. Cash displacement trends continued this quarter. Globally, cash volume on Visa debit credentials. The dollar amount of cash taken out of ATMs was 98% of 2019 levels flat on Visa debit credentials, was 140% of 2019 levels, up 5 points from Q2. While debit remains strong and has accelerated since Q2, credit spending is now also improving. Global credit payments volume was a 104% of 2019, up 4 points from the second quarter.  At the same time, face-to-face payments, volume trends are stable to improving, while eCommerce or card-not-present remains elevated. When we average across our top markets where we process versus 2019, we see card present improved 10 points, with card-not-present, excluding travel improved 1 point in Q3 over Q2. Travel is starting to recover both domestically and in cross-border. Again, averaging across our top markets, where we process versus 2019, domestic travel spending improved more than 20 points in Q3 over Q2.  Globally, cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe versus 2019, improved 6 points in Q3 over Q2 and exited the quarter with June at 50% of 2019. Simply looking at the absolute levels, it was a record quarter for these with $2.7 trillion in payments volume and payment transactions per day globally, which is up $60 million per day from the last quarter and nearly a $160 million transactions per day from a year ago. And we expect much more recovery to come, especially in the areas of credit and cross-border travel.  Tap-to-pay is a key accelerator for many of these trends, including face-to-face spending in both credit and debit. We continue to see countries increasing tap-to-pay limits. For example, in Brazil, the limit was doubled five months ago and the face-to-face tap-to-pay penetration has already more than doubled from 6% to 14% in that short period. In the United States, this quarter, we surpassed $370 million tap-to-pay enabled cards and we now have three cities above 25% face-to-face tap-to-pay penetration: New York, San Francisco, and San Jose. Merchant progress continued as well. Target has doubled its tap-to-pay penetration in the last year to two out of every five face-to-face transactions, and Costco 's U.S. gas stations have reached 40% penetration in tap-to-pay payments, since enabling this feature, approximately six months ago. Now shifting to clients. We continue to win with large issuers globally. Let me share a few examples from the quarter. In the United States, we're pleased to have renewed our long-standing partnership with Navy Federal Credit Union, the largest U.S. credit union with over 10.5 million members for a multiyear credit, debit, and processing agreement. Also in the U.S., Google Pay introduced the Visa Virtual Card that links to U.S. Android users' global pay balances, enabling these users to spend their balances at stores. In Italy, we extended our agreement with Banca Sella, part of the Sella Group, the largest private and independent banking group in Italy, for the consumer credit and commercial portfolios with plans to launch a new innovative digital credit small business solution.  In Singapore, we're expanding our strong partnership with DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia. We have [Techinical Difficulty] and we will continue to grow in the DBS debit portfolio. Latin America, we renewed the HSBC debit portfolio, one of the top five portfolios in Mexico. In our CEMEA region, we won the consumer credit portfolio of Qatar National Bank, the largest financial institution in the Middle East and Africa, and we renew the credit portfolio of Saudi British Bank, one of the largest Saudi Banks. We're also building momentum as the global leader in co-brands. In the U.S. alone, we have 7 of the top 10 co-brands And this quarter, we're pleased to renew higher than the U.S. and renew and grow the Williams-Sonoma co-brand, which will be relaunched with an expanded scope across the Williams-Sonoma brands, including Pottery Barn and West Elm. We secured a new co-brand relationship with PayPal in Australia and MercadoLibre, the largest e-commerce retailer in Latin America. In partnership with Banco Itau, we also won the co-brand business of Magalu, a major retailer with one of the largest co-brand portfolios in Brazil. Finally, in the Asia-Pacific region, we have secured a significant part of LINE Pay's business, with a partnership renewal and Taiwan, the largest co-brand program in the country. Fintechs are also core to our consumer payments growth. And this quarter, we forged new partnerships and deepened relationships with long-time clients. I just mentioned LINE Pay in Taiwan and we also continue to see strong momentum in our partnership with LINE Pay in Japan and with LINE BK in Thailand. Over the last year, they have added more than 2 million Visa credentials across those markets. Likewise, in India, longtime partner, Paytm, has issued 6 million virtual Visa debit card. In addition, they've recently started to issue physical Visa debit cards, which they expect to ramp up over the coming months. Kakao Pay, one of the top three mobile wallet providers in Korea with more than 30 million users, recently signed on to issue Visa credit cards. In the Middle East, we're partnering of STC Pay, the fintech subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's largest telecom operator to embed [Technical Difficulty] STC Pay wallets.  More than a million Visa credentials have been issued since September of 2020.. Rappi, Latin America's Super App with over 70 million users, has now started issuing Visa credit cards in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Peru, with plans to expand to additional countries in coming months. And at the crypto space, we recently signed three partnerships: one with Tala, the partner on cryptocurrency solutions for the global unbanked, and two with crypto exchanges, FTX and CoinZoom to begin offering Visa cards.  We now have more than 50 crypto wallet and platforms up from 35 in Q1 and more than the next leading network. And collectively, they drove over $1 billion in payments volume [Technical Difficulty] represents a significant engine of growth. The market opportunity in new flows is 10 times greater and we continue to make progress in our efforts. We had several capabilities within carded B2B that have been gaining traction. Our freedom solution enables corporates to control and monitor corporate card spending and expand to new use cases, including payables and virtual card capabilities.  Across Australia and New Zealand, we have renewed our long-standing partnerships with ANZ Bank for Freedom\u2019s expense management capabilities as well as NAB and BNZ to deliver expense management and payable solutions. And in the United States, Wells Fargo will deliver these capabilities to their corporate clients as part of our partnership we announced earlier this year. Visa\u2019s commercial pay, which offers a mobile app enabling virtual card issuance and management of business incidentals with enhanced data, will be part of OCBC Bank\u2019s virtual purchasing card offering in Singapore.  Visa Direct transaction growth remains robust with nearly a 0.5 billion more transactions this quarter than in the third quarter of last year. We continue to see large banks enable Visa Direct payouts for their customers, including CIBC this quarter. In the payroll category, ADP, a leading global technology company, providing human capital management solutions, recently integrated its wisely offering with Visa Direct to provide ADP clients with a digitally-enabled, convenient, and cost-effective solution for employee off-cycle payments. In the P2P space, the WhatsApp payment feature, powered by Visa Direct and Visa Cloud Token Framework, launched in Brazil in May. And we're seeing early success with a significant number of Visa credentials enrolled and sizable growth in P2P money transfers. PayPal announced instant transfers for merchants settlement and P2P via Visa Direct in Australia. We also developed new use cases this quarter for Visa Direct. First, GoFundMe is integrating Visa Direct to soon launch funds disbursement to individuals and organizations. Second, Questrade, the Canadian brokerage platform, announced the launch of Instant Deposit, allowing investors to fund their trade accounts in seconds. Let's now move to our third growth lever, value-added services, where revenue growth grew 28% in Q3. Let me discuss our efforts across a few of our capabilities. First, installments. In addition to investing in and partnering with numerous installment providers globally, we've also developed our own solution, which had some notable progress in the quarter. In Canada, Scotiabank is extending their post-purchase installments offering to -- they're offering to eligible Visa retail credit clients. CIBC is launching installments during purchase and Desjardin, North America's largest financial cooperative will be offering during purchase installments for their eligible Visa customers. In addition, Global Payments is enabling on installment solution for their merchant customers. Second, CyberSource, our omni-channel gateway platform has grown as a result of three drivers: one, increased e-commerce and omni-channel volumes; two, more business creating online and omni-channel presences, while leveraging our risk tools; and three, more acquirers, white labeling the solution. This past quarter, top 20 U.S. acquirer, Paya and Qatar National Bank, both signed to utilize CyberSource\u2019s capabilities. Third, DPS. I mentioned the processing agreement earlier with Navy Federal, they intend to utilize DPS. In addition, Current, one of the fastest-growing U.S. fintechs with nearly 3 million members have selected Visa DPS as its partner. Current will integrate with DPS\u2019 newest all digital processing solution called DPS Forward, which combines issuer processing capabilities with a new suite of APIs that integrate with modern digital banking players to create unique card programs and payment solutions. Finally, Visa Consulting and Analytics. Our advisory teams have delivered nearly 1,000 projects year-to-date in 88 countries to help our clients to be more successful. Let me just share a couple of examples. In Latin America, we developed a digital acquisition platform and help one of the top issuers in the region improved credit approval turn around times from days to minutes will also better qualifying leads to reach a 4 times improvement and approval rate compared to their prior solution. Globally, we have launched a new program called Visa Portfolio Health Check, where we review client's portfolios, tracking 30-plus key performance indicators. Year-to-date, we have held health checks across 55 countries, identify nearly 300 specific opportunities worth nearly $50 billion in incremental payment volume. Before I close, let me touch briefly on the two recently announced acquisitions. First, out of the open banking platform, Tink. Visa's proven infrastructure and sustained investment in resilient cyber security and fraud prevention, combined with Tink's API, their technology and customer relationships is expected to help accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe by ensuring a secure, reliable platform for innovation, which will help consumers and businesses. Second is the acquisition of Currencycloud, a global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide their customer and business customers innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments around the world.  As part of our network of networks strategy, the combination of currencies - Currencycloud\u2019s capabilities on the front end of the transaction through their API and our settlement capabilities across VisaNet and other Visa networks such as Plus, Earthport and Visa B2B Connect will be very compelling value propositions for our partners. In closing, as we look to finish our fiscal year, I'm very encouraged by the recovery trajectory across the board and pleased with the momentum in many of our key growth areas. Our recently launched new brand campaign describes Visa as the network working for everyone and we are increasingly sitting at the center of enabling money movement. I'm confident that our strategy combined with \u2013 our network-to-network strategy combined with our three growth levers of consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services remains more relevant than ever and positions us well as we look forward to our robust recovery. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant. Vasant?\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you. Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results exceeded our expectations with net revenues up 27%, driven by robust growth in both credit and debit in the U.S., higher cross-border volumes from a faster-than-anticipated recovery in travel, as well as a spike in cryptocurrency purchases and low client incentives largely due to deal timing. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, net revenue growth would have been 39%.  The reason for this large difference in growth is a result of the significant quarter-over-quarter change in growth rates of payments volumes, both last year and this year. The third quarter last year experienced the steepest drop in payments volume. And third quarter this year has been our strongest growth quarter since the pandemic started. When adjusted for the service fee recognition lag, net revenues for Q3 FY '20 are lower and net revenues for Q3 this year are higher. GAAP EPS grew 10%, primarily due to a non-recurring, non-cash step-up in deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently announced increase in UK tax rates starting in 2023. Non-GAAP EPS rose 41% helped by lower-than-expected expense growth and a lower tax rate.  Exchange rate shift lifted net revenue growth by 1 point and EPS growth by 2 points. As we did last quarter, to help you better assess both the magnitude and the trajectory of the recovery, we have also provided key performance metrics relative to fiscal year '19. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 34%, led by continued strength in debit, as well as improved credit spending. Compared to the third quarter of 2019 global payments volume was 21% higher, a 5-point acceleration from the second quarter, with debit and credit improving by 5 points and 4 points, respectively. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 38% or 25% higher than 2019 and the 5-point acceleration from the second quarter. Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded cost conversions, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was 40% and up 30% over 2019 benefiting from economic impact payments in the first half of the quarter, and then from the lifting of COVID related restrictions across the country. Debit growth accelerated 4 points up 48% from 2019, remaining strong throughout the quarter as the trend towards accelerated cash digitalization and e-commerce was sustained, even as the economy reopened.  Credit draught improved 8 points up 14 points from 2019, the credit improvement of fuelled by two interrelated factors, a significant acceleration in travel, entertainment, and restaurants spending, as well as the resurgence of affluent cardholder spending. Card presents spend accelerated by 9 points to 12% above 2019, even as card-not-present volume, excluding travel improved four points to 59% over '19 Online shopping habits acquired during the pandemic are persisting. As the U.S. reopened, travel and entertainment spending improved steadily through the quarter, both up about 25 points from the second quarter.  Travel is approaching 2019 levels in July, while entertainment surpassed 2019 levels in May. Restaurant spending in the quarter was over 20% above 2019 levels. Growth across all other expense categories remained strong and stable. International constant dollar payments volume growth improved four points from the second quarter up 13% over 2019 levels. A few regional highlights. Growth in our CEMEA region remains strong, up 48% from 2019 levels consistent with Q2 fueled by cash digitization and client wins.  Latin America was also up 48% from 2019, accelerating 8 points from the second quarter with robust performance across the region fueled by market share gains. Brazil volumes are seemingly unaffected by the high level of COVID cases due to significant cash due [Indiscernible] and large increases in eCommerce adoption. We are also benefiting from our digital partnerships and client [Indiscernible] in Brazil. Europe was up 17% from 2019, improving 9 points from the second quarter, the largest sequential acceleration among our regions. Across Europe, restrictions were relaxed and in-store spending recovered while e-commerce spend remained strong.  Asia-Pacific remains our weakest region, up 5% from 2019, and down three points from the second quarter, excluding China. Performance across the region varied based on the level of infections and COVID-related restrictions. There were intermittent restrictions during the quarter in Australia, Japan, and Singapore. Much of Southeast Asia was significantly impacted by rising COVID infections and result in lockdowns. In India, a sharp slowdown in spending starting in mid-April and to May was followed by a quick rebound with July trending well about 2019 levels.  Global profits transaction growth was 20% over 2019, improving 4 points from the second quarter as transactions increase with volume across every region, except the U.S., where transaction growth still large payments volume growth due to higher ticket sizes. Visa Direct transaction growth remained robust in the mid 50s. The profit model volume recovery continued as more countries open their borders. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was at 82% of 2019 volume, a 7-point improvement from Q2, led by a steady increase in travel, as well as the spike in cross-border cryptocurrency purchases from mid April through the end of May.  Cross-border Card Not Present volume excluding travel, continued to be very strong, up 56% from 2019, improving 12 points from the second quarter, with cryptocurrency purchases representing most of that acceleration. We have seen more active guard and more spend for guard in cryptocurrencies, currency purchases. We saw the normal seasonal uptick in cross-border travel spending during March and April. However, cross-border travel in May and June was stronger than the typical seasonal trend as many [Indiscernible] reopened or ease requirements.  Cross-border travel related spend, excluding Intra-Europe was at 45% of 2019 levels. Expanding 6 points in the second quarter, rising from 40% of 2019 April to 50% in June. The state of the cross-border travel recovery vary significantly across regions depending on border openings, quarantine, and other requirements, as well as, infection levels. Outbound travel from the U.S. and Latin America was back to around 60% of 2019 levels in the third quarter. But as Europe and CEMEA, were about half way back. Inbound travel has recovered the most into Latin America and CEMEA, with Latin America, above 2019 levels due to Mexico. but as the U.S. and Europe are only about a third of 2019 levels.  Asia-Pacific cross-border travel, both in and out, has recovered the least, still at around a quarter of 2019 levels. We've seen immediate impacts and popular travel destinations open their borders. Greece opened borders in April and inbound [Indiscernible] spend rose nearly 30 points by the end of June relative to 2019 levels. France opened on June 9th and [Indiscernible] volumes rose nearly 20 points by the end of June relative to 2019. Travel to Mexico has been strong for several quarters, where the third quarter accelerated further, helped by travels from the U.S. amid vaccination progress.  Since April, [Indiscernible] present cross-border spend in Mexico from the U.S. rose nearly 50 points to over 170% of 2019 levels. Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 17% led by 11% growth in the second quarter, constant dollar payments volume helped further by favorable exchange rates and mix, as well as small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 32% due to very strong domestic process transaction growth, particularly outside the U.S. The 7% point difference between revenue and process transaction growth reflected the mix shift away from higher yielding cross-border transactions.  In addition, while value-added services recorded in Data Processing revenues had strong and accelerating growth, This was slower than overall process transaction growth, which benefited from lapping effects. International transaction revenues were up 54%, 8 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding Intra-Europe due to lapping high currency volatility last year, and a less favorable regional mix. Other revenues grew 31% led by consulting and data services, and helped by lapping cover impacts last year. In total, value-added services revenue grew 28%. Of the 14-point acceleration from the second quarter, about two-thirds was due to COVID-related lapping effects.  Client incentive is about 25.8% of gross revenues, consistent with the second quarter but lower than our expectations due to both numerator and denominator effects. A lower-than-expected numerator at some deals with delayed and are now expected for the fourth quarter. Also, higher incentives from U.S. outperformance, the largely offset by lower incentives from underperformance in Asia-Pacific. A higher-than-expected denominator, as we had stronger cross-border volumes and value-added services revenue, both of which don't have significant incentives associated with them.  Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 12% below our expectations, mostly due to timing of some initiatives being pushed into Q4, particularly marketing spend and professional fees. Marketing expenses did grow over 50% in the quarter as we lapped with reductions in spending at the outbreak of will that last? Steel G&A expenses decreased year-over-year due to favorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower indirect taxes. The recorded gains from our equity investments of 439 million. Visa has minority investments in over 50 strategic partners.  When there is a new financing round or an IPO, per the accounting rules, we mark our investments to market which can result in gains or losses. Our investment portfolio has been performing very well. That will gains across several of our investments. The gain recorded this quarter was largely driven by one partner's financing round and another partner's IPO, excluding investment gains, non-GAAP, non-operating expense, was a 114 million in the fiscal third quarter. Our GAAP tax rate was 41.3% due to a billion-dollar, non-recurring, non-cash tax charge pertaining to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and the taxes related to investment gains.  The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected at 17.9% due to the recognition of a tax benefit. GAAP EPS was a $1.18, non-GAAP EPS was a $1.49 up 21% over last year. We bought 9.5 million shares of Class A common stock, at an average price of $227.83 for 2.2 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. we returned approximately 2.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Moving on to our outlook for the fourth quarter. I'll start with business trends through July 21st. U.S. payments volume growth was 31% about 2019, consistent with the third quarter, with debit up 46% and credit up 17% versus 2019. As you said before, weekly numbers can have noise in them.  For example, in the third week of 07/2019, a major online retailer had debt annual sales event which impacted performance index to 2019, particularly e-commerce spending using credit. International payments volume trends versus 2019 are moderately above the third quarter, but in line with June. Notable exceptions include improvements in India, Canada, and Brazil, with modest slowdowns in Australia and Japan. Process transaction growth continued to improve up 23% versus 2019.  Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis, were 81% of 2019, which is 1 point below the third quarter in June. Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 3 points compared to June, offset by lower e-commerce growth, mostly due to cryptocurrency purchases falling back to pre April levels. The recent announcements by the UK and Canada regarding border openings in August should be helpful in the fourth quarter, while Asia-Pacific remained largely close to travelers.  As [Indiscernible] July trends continue fourth quarter and net revenue growth is expected to be in line with the third quarter. We expect a benefit from the service fee recognition lag and the cross-border travel recoveries to be partially offset by cryptocurrency purchases falling back to pre-April levels, as well smaller year-over-year lapping benefits in transactions processing and value-added services revenues. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenue to increase 0.5 to 1 versus the third quarter due to delayed from the third quarter.  And the typical increase we see in Q4 due to the end of fiscal year deal closings. The third quarter was the first quarter of growth relative to Fiscal year '19, we have had since the pandemic started. Based on current trends, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth relative to Fiscal year '19 to be in the same range as the third quarter. Q4 operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-teens, inclusive of some expenses, land for the third quarter, which will push into Q4. Non-operating expense is expected to be around $125 million. Our tax rate expectations are in the 19% to 19.5% range.  In summary, we had a stronger - than -expected third quarter as economies and borders reopened. Even as card spend recovers e-commerce spend stayed strong. Debit spending sustained high growth rates as cash digitalization remains robust. The cross-border travel recovery is gaining momentum. Our new flows and value-added service businesses continued to grow at high rates as they have all through the pandemic.  We're stepping up investments in key growth initiatives as we look ahead to several quarters of recovery and prepare to capture the exciting opportunities available to us in the fourth quarter over the year. With that, I'll hand it over to Mike for questions and answers.\nMike Milotich: We're now ready to take questions, Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question coming from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thank you very much. Great results here. A lot I could ask, but let me ask on debit versus credit dynamics. I'm really focused on the U.S. here. I'm just curious about some of your views on relative growth between debit and credit change based on what you've observed so far in the recovery and with all these fintech things and investing in card growth and card engagement, I think, you mentioned Current and some others. So just curious what your thinking is there on structural growth between?\nVasant Prabhu: I think what we're seeing now is, as you've seen on the numbers, debit has had a indexing close to 150 pre-COVID levels, that reflects really a huge step-up in the digitalization of cash. It's evident all over the world. You see that in CEMEA numbers, you see it in Latin America numbers. So debit is the engine of cash digitization. So structurally, debit is benefiting from cash digitization picking up, as well as the move to e-commerce. What you are seeing though, is that credit is accelerating quite fast. And if you look at the numbers, the biggest quarter-over-quarter recovery has been quite significant in credit. Structurally, I think what we're seeing is the affluent customer come back to spending because economies have reopened and the plastic sectors that would benefit from reopening like restaurants, travel, and entertainment are also picking up. There's so many things going on here that are -- let's call it recovery-related or fundamental changes, like cash digitilization and e-commerce, that it's too early to tell whether there is a significant structural change between the use of debit and credit. I think credit has got quite a few quarters to go of recovery and the trend remains quite robust even as we look at July.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you. I appreciate that.\nAlfred Kelly: The only thing I would add, Tien-Tsin, is that, we saw major separation through the pandemic, part of the pandemic between credit and debit growth. And this quarter, the separation between them in the business was more like 6 points, where we've seen quarters closer to 30 points.. So that's further indication of credit starting to rebound for the reasons that Vasant articulated.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. You may go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Al, Vasant, can you talk about open banking and what it means for Visa in light of the accelerated activity there and also your recent acquisition of Tink? In what way Visa can participate in this global move towards open banking? And also, can you talk about the potential to take Tink\u2019s capabilities beyond Europe into other goes? Thanks.\nAlfred Kelly: Well, I'll star and Vasant can jump in. The epicenter of open banking is Europe, which is what attracted us to Tink. It is a open banking platform that has footprint in 18 markets that allows through single API customers, which are primarily developers to access financial data and Tink has connectivity to about 3,400 banks and FIs and about 10,000 developers in Europe. And it's one of 400 players versus other markets. There's an awful lot of players in the open banking space in Europe because of the fact that it is in ground \u2013 it is ground zero.  And we do think that the combination of our various capabilities and relationships combined with Tink 's technology and relationships is going to ideally accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe. It's early days, but there is going to be an increased adoption of open banking and we see making progress in Europe first even beyond the 18 markets that Tink is in. And there's no reason why we can't take the business to other parts of the world, particularly in Asia and CEMEA.\nHarshita Rawat: Thank you very much.\nMike Milotich: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. You may go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Could you update us on B2B Connect and talk a little bit how your go-to-market strategy there is evolving? How is it ramping? And just give us a general update on what's happening with B2B Connect?\nAlfred Kelly: Well, I think as we've talked in the past, that the most important thing with B2B Connect is to continue to grow out the infrastructure and that requires both signing key partners and we had announced last quarter, I guess, the signing of Goldman Sachs' Transaction Banking as a user of B2B Connect. And we're using bank integrators like ACI and Fiserv and Bottomline to help us as well in terms of driving more players in B2B Connect. At this point, that's our emphasis.  Our emphasis is building out this, the robustness of this network, so it has more endpoints and more clients. Again, we see this as a $10 billion opportunity. And we think that B2B Connect is - has the capability to be a much better than a Swift kind of alternative for driving payments without having to build - cross-border payments, without having to build out a corresponding banking network.  So we've continued to sign players and they've continued to do their infrastructure connections to us and we've started to drive transactions. But at this point what I have an update on B2B Connect, I'm much more interested in how we're doing in driving the robustness of the network versus being at a point where we're counting progress on the number of transactions that we're actually seeing flow over the network.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah, one other thing I might add to that is, you may have seen the announcement of Visa Payout Service. Essentially, we are integrating both Visa Direct and B2B Connect to offer a single-point for our customers to come to us for all kinds of cross-border payments, either business customers, B2B customers, whether they are low-ticket, high-volume, which we can handle through the Visa Direct capability and Earthport, or if their high-value, low-volume transactions which we can handle through B2B Connect.  So, essentially, from a client standpoint, they don't -- they just interface with us. And whatever their needs are, we can meet them in any form, whether it's to account to card or to any part of the world. So it's important to note that it's also sort of integrates well with our other capabilities to provide a single point of contact.\nRamsey El-Assal: That's terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig in a little on value-added services and new flows given the call out that value-added services grew 28%, I think, you said in the quarter. With peeking back at Investor Day, February 2020, which is of course, a lifetime ago now, but at the time, you would kind of put this framework out that new flows and value-added services were around 23% of revenues growing in the high teens and that was sort of a momentum expected going forward.  Can you just broadly talk about now 18 months later through the pandemic, how your outlook for new flows and value-added services has evolved? Do you now expect it to be faster and bigger, given both the secular shifts during the pandemic, as well as some of the acquisitions you've made, maybe what's just changed in that outlook? Thank you.\nAlfred Kelly: Well, Lisa, we remain extremely robust and excited about the opportunities in value-added services and new flows. Obviously, some of our value-added services, we actually saw our declines during the pandemic. Certainly, people were buying less travel benefits from us. There were less transactions in certain cases against which we could sell value-added services. But as I said, we started to see transactions really roll back this quarter.  For the first time ever, we averaged over 600 million transactions in the quarter -- and for every day in the quarter, I should say. And that was up 160 from -- by more than 160 million transactions a day a year ago during the pandemic. So I think that, as we start to get into what I believe is going to be a robust recovery and a continued growth in transactions.  We're going to continue to see our platform-type services, CyberSource, our issuer processing, our risk and identity services, which represent about two-thirds of our value-added services, grow very nicely. I think we've continued to start to see recoveries on the other side and things like our consulting. And I think as travel comes back, our card benefits and travel-related card benefits will increase.  So I think that while we rent during the height of the pandemic, we got off our trajectory of where we want it to be in 5 years. I feel like we're going to get right back on that trajectory and maybe even do better than we might have thought we would do. In terms of new flows, I'd say a couple of things. One is obviously Visa Direct continues to do very well. I cited that it was almost 0.5 billion more transactions in the quarter than the prior year. And I think in Vasant's remarks, he talked about mid-50s percent growth levels continuing and we've seen this for numbers of quarters now. And in the B2B space, we're starting to see some recovery.  The B2B space looks like the consumer credit space, so it's the commercial volumes kind of echoing or following that, mirroring that, although small businesses obviously recovering quicker than large market. But as I think, as people start to come back to work, as business travel starts to return, as I feel good that the commercial volume will continue to come back as well. So again, I would say that in the new flows area, while we, again, went off trajectory for what we would have said at Investor Day, the reality is I think we'll get right back on now as we're seeing a really very good beginning to what I think will be a robust recovery.\nLisa Ellis: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. You may go ahead, sir.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. I guess my question is, if you parse through the granular spending trends, I'm curious how much of the spend outperformance you're seeing is related to pent-up demand versus stimulus benefits. I'm just trying to think through how to run rate the outperformance. And then, specific to the fourth quarter expectations, maybe you could just speak, Vasant, your expectations relative to the third quarter, particularly on cross-border. Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. So as it relates to your the second part of your question, if you look at the trends in the first three weeks of July and I want to emphasize as you said before that three weeks don't make a trend and you shouldn't read too much into it.  I told you that the third week of July in the U.S. was impacted by what happened in the third week of July in 2019 because that's sort of, we often look at it as a clean year, but when you look at week-by-week numbers is always going to be unusual things about what happened in the same week in 2019, or what day of the week was when -- or what holidays impact [Indiscernible], and so on. So setting that aside, what you saw in the first 3 weeks of July was quite a bit of stability on the cross-border side. And we think that's sort of the trend for the fourth quarter.  We see some of the cryptocurrency cross-border purchases have fallen back to pre-recall levels. We had a spike in April and May, as we mentioned. So that will -- has pulled back in July, as you can see. That was replaced by travel continuing to recover. And so that gives you a certain amount of stability. The big question mark is, what kind of a summer travel improvement will we get in cross-border travel, given that wider borders have opened and substantially more borders are opened than they were before.  It's still not normal in that all borders are not opened and especially borders in Asia are not open. So I think our best sort of view of the fourth quarter as it relates to cross-border travel and cross-border in general. Is that cross-border in general stays relatively stable with the third quarter, with travel recovering and cryptocurrency purchases falling back a bit and so on balance we're at neutral. In terms of the domestic businesses around the world, we provided you some color in the comments.  Everything we're seeing so far, if you adjust for unique things that's happened in 2019 is a trend that's either stable or slightly better in the U.S. and around the world, either stable or slightly better, with no evidence right now anywhere of Delta impact in the spending. And an important correlation there is mobility. Mobility is highly correlated with spendingly fine. And mobility -- in mobility indexes in general are either stable or climbing still, even as infections are finding in many parts of the world. And even where infections have gone up a lot, mobility doesn't seem to be impacted yet. No evidence of it, nor are we seeing any impact on spending.\nAlfred Kelly: The only thing I would add is that the action where there's been stimulus that is certainly impacted some spending, but it tends to drive spending for a couple of weeks and then wain over the third to fifth week. I might use a different phrase than pent-up demand. I think it's a little bit of a return to normal. And I'd also bring back -- we're starting -- gyms are open, people are going to sporting events. A nd then I'd come back to something besides cited in response to one of the earlier questions, which is the affluent customers jumped back into the Marketplace. These are the people that drive up white tablecloth restaurant spending, if the people make discretionary purchases. These are the people who are heading to Mexico and other places as borders open up. And so I think again, I echo what Vasant said that mobility can continue to improve. I think we just get closer and closer to returning to a more normal and therefore feel like there's going to be good run here of a good recovery for the business.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research, you may go ahead, sir.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. When we look at cross-border at 85% of 2019 travel is still 50% to 60% of ' 19 levels. Clearly there's considerable room to the upside when that travel resumed, especially looking at how e-com's held up. So we just revisit the incremental net revenue opportunity from that? I know there's a lower correlation on rebates incentives from cross-border, and it's a higher margin business. So a, if you could just reconfirm that, and then would you let much of that pass-through per shareholders, just given that we've missed out on a year-and-a-half of cross-border into the same magnitude we should have had?\nAlfred Kelly: Well, if you do simple math and say that the cross-border business would have continued to grow at roughly 10% a year as it was growing pre-pandemic. And we're indexing right now, as you said, around 82% than '19. I mean, you can do the math yourself, right? We would've been indexing closer to 120 or 121, I suppose, if you assume 10%. and that delta between 82 and 121 gives you a sense if you apply that to our international revenues line, it gives you a sense of it. Now, we do have some additional cross-border revenues in the Data Processing line because that is -- the data processing revenue associated with cross-border too. But if you do the math, I mean, you can see that it's a sizable amount of revenue. Yes, you're right.\nVasant Prabhu: Incentives are not generally tied to cross-border. There are in some parts of the world, particularly Asia, where for travel-related portfolios, we may have some incentives tied to cross-border in those portfolios. So a fair chunk of it would flow through to the net revenue line. And that's largely a reason, in fact, why our incentives as a percent of gross revenues have climbed. It's because of this mix shift.  As far as how that how much of that flows through into the bottom line, our approach has been -- we need to invest as much as we need to invest to grow the business. There are significant opportunities available. We've already told you about how the expenses will grow in the mid-teens in the fourth quarter. If cross-border recovers faster, that won't necessarily change our investment plans. And we've never managed for margins. Margins are in outcome. Our goal is to drive as much more human revenue growth as we can and to invest what we need to drive that growth.\nDarrin Peller: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. You may go ahead, sir.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. And good afternoon. Question just following up on the Currencycloud acquisition and the growth of cross-border Visa's view on the growth of cross-border, maybe?Ex physical? travel. With all the different marketplaces out in the world, it seems like there's been an acceleration potentially. So any -- just any thoughts on the growth of cross-border long term?Ex? travel and the -- how Visa in particular is looking to get more deeply, I guess, engaged?\nAlfredKelly: Well, I'll start to emphasize to pick up. Look, the reality is the world is shrinking from the perspective of how easy it is for people to buy from sellers in different countries, in different regions around the world. And we've seen a dramatic increase millions of millions of people shopping online during the pandemic, who never shopped online before. So I our expectation is that you are going to continue to see very, very good growth in cross-border eCommerce going forward.  I think that the whole eCommerce trend, both domestically and in terms of cross-border, is something you're not going to be able to nor want to have go back to the way it was before. I think that this is a fundamental change in how people shop and it's going to continue to drive the cash digitization that we've been talking about.  Currencycloud, the acquisition we announced, I don't know, a week or two ago, I think builds on and extends our existing capabilities to provide better FX services and easier connectivity to FinTechs, financial institutions, and other partners. And they have a really cool set of APIs and And we think that combination of Currencycloud capabilities on the front end of a transaction via those API's. And our settlement capabilities across VisaNet and our other networks, B2B Connect, Northport pluses, cetera, is going to create a very powerful combination.  So, ultimately, our intention is to provide global?reach here? with simplicity and flexibility at competitive pricing. And we want to leverage our settlement scale and make sure that we're also leveraging our sophistication in managing risks. So we like -- we like the asset in Currencycloud, we like this to be combination of these capabilities and Currencycloud capabilities. And I -- we like the fact that from a dynamics perspective, we see cross-border travel continuing to come back over time, And we see the eCommerce cross-border continuing to be robust as we look forward.\nVasant Prabhu: And going back to your question about moving past our traditional business of enabling payments to merchants cross-border. You heard us talk about the extraordinary progress we're making in remittances for example. We signed up all the major Remington's providers and we can provide a very flexible, very attractive proposition for their consumers at a very attractive cost. And remittances is almost as big in volume as,?falling? direct investment. And it's not an area that we served before. Beyond that, you heard earlier about Visa payment service, payout service, which is very valuable to pay gig economy players around the world, as well as it has a big role to play in marketplace payouts and so on.  The third one I would highlight is the partnerships you signed with a whole range of cryptocurrency wallets that enable the use of Visa credentials that they issue at 70 million merchants around the world, and a big chunk of that business is expected to be cross-border too. So in our business in cross-border has gone well beyond the traditional, let's call it C2B space to P2P cross-border to B2B cross-border of course. And a significant chunk of D2C cross-border.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citibank. You may go ahead, sir.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, I'm Ashwin. I was hoping that you might be able to answer a framework question, as investors think primarily about Fiscal '22 rather than 4Q. As you're going through your budget planning process. How are you thinking about pricing? How are you thinking about expenses? What would it take for you to say, return to providing a full-year outlook? If you could kind of provide a framework of how you're thinking.\nVasant Prabhu: It's too early to give you a perspective on 2022. I think we'll save that for October. And where do we provide a full-year outlook or do what we've done this quarter is to give you the best sense we have of what, what we see around us right now and how it might play out for a quarter or two. Altogether, we go further than that, I think we'll look fast as we go along. As we've said, we've already given you some indications of our posture as it relates to investment. We are preparing for multiple quarters of recovery.  You'd -- perhaps, you've heard earlier about the conversation about the cross-border recovery that still remains ahead of us. So clearly, there's plenty of recovery still to come. And we are investing in preparation for the post - COVID world where we see extraordinary opportunities in new flows and value-added services. So we are stepping up investments, and our expenses are growing in the mid-teens and so on. But in terms of projecting where revenues are going to be or what the volume trends are going to be. We'll save a lot of that discussion and pricing and our thoughts for that for October.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good afternoon. Recently, your U.S. centric competitor sharply increased consumer rewards on one of its mass affluent credit cards and some of those reward increases were matched by Visa issuers. So I'm curious for your view on how this step-up in the rewards battle will impact credit card spending going forward, especially since many of these rewards are tied to travel and entertainment spend.\nAlfred Kelly: Well, I think what issuers are dealing is getting ready for our return to travel being a important spend category. As you well know, many of these reward propositions in North America, both in the U.S. and in Canada, are very tied to travel. All the big airlines, all the?booked big hotels? have co-brand programs and even for other programs that reward programs th at are more generic, a lot of their bird options are tied to travel.  So I think that travel's going to -- has started to come back, it will continue to come back as mobility increases, as restrictions get lifted, etcetera. And I think issuers are trying to make sure that as that happens and as the affluent consumer and the middle market consumer starts to get in their car and get on airplanes more, that their their product will be top of wallet and I think that's really what's driving the?activity?.\nMike Milotich: We've time for one more question, Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you. Dan Dolev from Mizuho, you may go ahead, sir.\nDan Dolev: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I was just surprised to see the impact of crypto on April trends like can you maybe help us quantify little more what drove the bump and how should we think about it in the future if we get into more crypto volatility, just to get some more color. Because I don't think this was a big factor in the prior quarters. Thank you so much.\nVasant Prabhu: we've seen a few months here and there of these kinds of spikes and purchases. So essentially, most of the time cryptocurrency impacts our business then purchases go up, a lot of the people who?microbe? go on buying them from entities that our non-U.S. based, often based in Europe. So these end up being cross-border transactions when they buy cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. And so when there is a spike in buying activity, you will see that in some of our cross-border e-commerce numbers. In terms of quantifying how much it is, if you look at the cross-border e-commerce business, ex-travel, has been quite stable through several weeks and months.  You will see a bump up in April and into May, and you can attribute a fair amount of that strictly to cryptocurrency purchases. We've had this before. There was another spike when there was a big run-up in crypto prices and then a collapse; I don't know, must have been a year ago. So it has happened before. It has now fallen back to pre-April levels, although it's still running at a level that is higher than it was 6 months ago. But you can quantify it if you look at the numbers.\nDan Dolev: Guys, thank you so much.\nMike Milotich: And that's all the time we have, so thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, you can always feel free and call or email Jennifer or myself. So thank you so much and have a good evening.\nOperator: And thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Vasant Prabhu",
            "content": "Thank you. Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results exceeded our expectations with net revenues up 27%, driven by robust growth in both credit and debit in the U.S., higher cross-border volumes from a faster-than-anticipated recovery in travel, as well as a spike in cryptocurrency purchases and low client incentives largely due to deal timing. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, net revenue growth would have been 39%.  The reason for this large difference in growth is a result of the significant quarter-over-quarter change in growth rates of payments volumes, both last year and this year. The third quarter last year experienced the steepest drop in payments volume. And third quarter this year has been our strongest growth quarter since the pandemic started. When adjusted for the service fee recognition lag, net revenues for Q3 FY '20 are lower and net revenues for Q3 this year are higher. GAAP EPS grew 10%, primarily due to a non-recurring, non-cash step-up in deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently announced increase in UK tax rates starting in 2023. Non-GAAP EPS rose 41% helped by lower-than-expected expense growth and a lower tax rate.  Exchange rate shift lifted net revenue growth by 1 point and EPS growth by 2 points. As we did last quarter, to help you better assess both the magnitude and the trajectory of the recovery, we have also provided key performance metrics relative to fiscal year '19. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 34%, led by continued strength in debit, as well as improved credit spending. Compared to the third quarter of 2019 global payments volume was 21% higher, a 5-point acceleration from the second quarter, with debit and credit improving by 5 points and 4 points, respectively. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 38% or 25% higher than 2019 and the 5-point acceleration from the second quarter. Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded cost conversions, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was 40% and up 30% over 2019 benefiting from economic impact payments in the first half of the quarter, and then from the lifting of COVID related restrictions across the country. Debit growth accelerated 4 points up 48% from 2019, remaining strong throughout the quarter as the trend towards accelerated cash digitalization and e-commerce was sustained, even as the economy reopened.  Credit draught improved 8 points up 14 points from 2019, the credit improvement of fuelled by two interrelated factors, a significant acceleration in travel, entertainment, and restaurants spending, as well as the resurgence of affluent cardholder spending. Card presents spend accelerated by 9 points to 12% above 2019, even as card-not-present volume, excluding travel improved four points to 59% over '19 Online shopping habits acquired during the pandemic are persisting. As the U.S. reopened, travel and entertainment spending improved steadily through the quarter, both up about 25 points from the second quarter.  Travel is approaching 2019 levels in July, while entertainment surpassed 2019 levels in May. Restaurant spending in the quarter was over 20% above 2019 levels. Growth across all other expense categories remained strong and stable. International constant dollar payments volume growth improved four points from the second quarter up 13% over 2019 levels. A few regional highlights. Growth in our CEMEA region remains strong, up 48% from 2019 levels consistent with Q2 fueled by cash digitization and client wins.  Latin America was also up 48% from 2019, accelerating 8 points from the second quarter with robust performance across the region fueled by market share gains. Brazil volumes are seemingly unaffected by the high level of COVID cases due to significant cash due [Indiscernible] and large increases in eCommerce adoption. We are also benefiting from our digital partnerships and client [Indiscernible] in Brazil. Europe was up 17% from 2019, improving 9 points from the second quarter, the largest sequential acceleration among our regions. Across Europe, restrictions were relaxed and in-store spending recovered while e-commerce spend remained strong.  Asia-Pacific remains our weakest region, up 5% from 2019, and down three points from the second quarter, excluding China. Performance across the region varied based on the level of infections and COVID-related restrictions. There were intermittent restrictions during the quarter in Australia, Japan, and Singapore. Much of Southeast Asia was significantly impacted by rising COVID infections and result in lockdowns. In India, a sharp slowdown in spending starting in mid-April and to May was followed by a quick rebound with July trending well about 2019 levels.  Global profits transaction growth was 20% over 2019, improving 4 points from the second quarter as transactions increase with volume across every region, except the U.S., where transaction growth still large payments volume growth due to higher ticket sizes. Visa Direct transaction growth remained robust in the mid 50s. The profit model volume recovery continued as more countries open their borders. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was at 82% of 2019 volume, a 7-point improvement from Q2, led by a steady increase in travel, as well as the spike in cross-border cryptocurrency purchases from mid April through the end of May.  Cross-border Card Not Present volume excluding travel, continued to be very strong, up 56% from 2019, improving 12 points from the second quarter, with cryptocurrency purchases representing most of that acceleration. We have seen more active guard and more spend for guard in cryptocurrencies, currency purchases. We saw the normal seasonal uptick in cross-border travel spending during March and April. However, cross-border travel in May and June was stronger than the typical seasonal trend as many [Indiscernible] reopened or ease requirements.  Cross-border travel related spend, excluding Intra-Europe was at 45% of 2019 levels. Expanding 6 points in the second quarter, rising from 40% of 2019 April to 50% in June. The state of the cross-border travel recovery vary significantly across regions depending on border openings, quarantine, and other requirements, as well as, infection levels. Outbound travel from the U.S. and Latin America was back to around 60% of 2019 levels in the third quarter. But as Europe and CEMEA, were about half way back. Inbound travel has recovered the most into Latin America and CEMEA, with Latin America, above 2019 levels due to Mexico. but as the U.S. and Europe are only about a third of 2019 levels.  Asia-Pacific cross-border travel, both in and out, has recovered the least, still at around a quarter of 2019 levels. We've seen immediate impacts and popular travel destinations open their borders. Greece opened borders in April and inbound [Indiscernible] spend rose nearly 30 points by the end of June relative to 2019 levels. France opened on June 9th and [Indiscernible] volumes rose nearly 20 points by the end of June relative to 2019. Travel to Mexico has been strong for several quarters, where the third quarter accelerated further, helped by travels from the U.S. amid vaccination progress.  Since April, [Indiscernible] present cross-border spend in Mexico from the U.S. rose nearly 50 points to over 170% of 2019 levels. Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 17% led by 11% growth in the second quarter, constant dollar payments volume helped further by favorable exchange rates and mix, as well as small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 32% due to very strong domestic process transaction growth, particularly outside the U.S. The 7% point difference between revenue and process transaction growth reflected the mix shift away from higher yielding cross-border transactions.  In addition, while value-added services recorded in Data Processing revenues had strong and accelerating growth, This was slower than overall process transaction growth, which benefited from lapping effects. International transaction revenues were up 54%, 8 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding Intra-Europe due to lapping high currency volatility last year, and a less favorable regional mix. Other revenues grew 31% led by consulting and data services, and helped by lapping cover impacts last year. In total, value-added services revenue grew 28%. Of the 14-point acceleration from the second quarter, about two-thirds was due to COVID-related lapping effects.  Client incentive is about 25.8% of gross revenues, consistent with the second quarter but lower than our expectations due to both numerator and denominator effects. A lower-than-expected numerator at some deals with delayed and are now expected for the fourth quarter. Also, higher incentives from U.S. outperformance, the largely offset by lower incentives from underperformance in Asia-Pacific. A higher-than-expected denominator, as we had stronger cross-border volumes and value-added services revenue, both of which don't have significant incentives associated with them.  Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 12% below our expectations, mostly due to timing of some initiatives being pushed into Q4, particularly marketing spend and professional fees. Marketing expenses did grow over 50% in the quarter as we lapped with reductions in spending at the outbreak of will that last? Steel G&A expenses decreased year-over-year due to favorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower indirect taxes. The recorded gains from our equity investments of 439 million. Visa has minority investments in over 50 strategic partners.  When there is a new financing round or an IPO, per the accounting rules, we mark our investments to market which can result in gains or losses. Our investment portfolio has been performing very well. That will gains across several of our investments. The gain recorded this quarter was largely driven by one partner's financing round and another partner's IPO, excluding investment gains, non-GAAP, non-operating expense, was a 114 million in the fiscal third quarter. Our GAAP tax rate was 41.3% due to a billion-dollar, non-recurring, non-cash tax charge pertaining to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and the taxes related to investment gains.  The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected at 17.9% due to the recognition of a tax benefit. GAAP EPS was a $1.18, non-GAAP EPS was a $1.49 up 21% over last year. We bought 9.5 million shares of Class A common stock, at an average price of $227.83 for 2.2 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. we returned approximately 2.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Moving on to our outlook for the fourth quarter. I'll start with business trends through July 21st. U.S. payments volume growth was 31% about 2019, consistent with the third quarter, with debit up 46% and credit up 17% versus 2019. As you said before, weekly numbers can have noise in them.  For example, in the third week of 07/2019, a major online retailer had debt annual sales event which impacted performance index to 2019, particularly e-commerce spending using credit. International payments volume trends versus 2019 are moderately above the third quarter, but in line with June. Notable exceptions include improvements in India, Canada, and Brazil, with modest slowdowns in Australia and Japan. Process transaction growth continued to improve up 23% versus 2019.  Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis, were 81% of 2019, which is 1 point below the third quarter in June. Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 3 points compared to June, offset by lower e-commerce growth, mostly due to cryptocurrency purchases falling back to pre April levels. The recent announcements by the UK and Canada regarding border openings in August should be helpful in the fourth quarter, while Asia-Pacific remained largely close to travelers.  As [Indiscernible] July trends continue fourth quarter and net revenue growth is expected to be in line with the third quarter. We expect a benefit from the service fee recognition lag and the cross-border travel recoveries to be partially offset by cryptocurrency purchases falling back to pre-April levels, as well smaller year-over-year lapping benefits in transactions processing and value-added services revenues. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenue to increase 0.5 to 1 versus the third quarter due to delayed from the third quarter.  And the typical increase we see in Q4 due to the end of fiscal year deal closings. The third quarter was the first quarter of growth relative to Fiscal year '19, we have had since the pandemic started. Based on current trends, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth relative to Fiscal year '19 to be in the same range as the third quarter. Q4 operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-teens, inclusive of some expenses, land for the third quarter, which will push into Q4. Non-operating expense is expected to be around $125 million. Our tax rate expectations are in the 19% to 19.5% range.  In summary, we had a stronger - than -expected third quarter as economies and borders reopened. Even as card spend recovers e-commerce spend stayed strong. Debit spending sustained high growth rates as cash digitalization remains robust. The cross-border travel recovery is gaining momentum. Our new flows and value-added service businesses continued to grow at high rates as they have all through the pandemic.  We're stepping up investments in key growth initiatives as we look ahead to several quarters of recovery and prepare to capture the exciting opportunities available to us in the fourth quarter over the year. With that, I'll hand it over to Mike for questions and answers. I think what we're seeing now is, as you've seen on the numbers, debit has had a indexing close to 150 pre-COVID levels, that reflects really a huge step-up in the digitalization of cash. It's evident all over the world. You see that in CEMEA numbers, you see it in Latin America numbers. So debit is the engine of cash digitization. So structurally, debit is benefiting from cash digitization picking up, as well as the move to e-commerce. What you are seeing though, is that credit is accelerating quite fast. And if you look at the numbers, the biggest quarter-over-quarter recovery has been quite significant in credit. Structurally, I think what we're seeing is the affluent customer come back to spending because economies have reopened and the plastic sectors that would benefit from reopening like restaurants, travel, and entertainment are also picking up. There's so many things going on here that are -- let's call it recovery-related or fundamental changes, like cash digitilization and e-commerce, that it's too early to tell whether there is a significant structural change between the use of debit and credit. I think credit has got quite a few quarters to go of recovery and the trend remains quite robust even as we look at July. Yeah, one other thing I might add to that is, you may have seen the announcement of Visa Payout Service. Essentially, we are integrating both Visa Direct and B2B Connect to offer a single-point for our customers to come to us for all kinds of cross-border payments, either business customers, B2B customers, whether they are low-ticket, high-volume, which we can handle through the Visa Direct capability and Earthport, or if their high-value, low-volume transactions which we can handle through B2B Connect.  So, essentially, from a client standpoint, they don't -- they just interface with us. And whatever their needs are, we can meet them in any form, whether it's to account to card or to any part of the world. So it's important to note that it's also sort of integrates well with our other capabilities to provide a single point of contact. Sure. So as it relates to your the second part of your question, if you look at the trends in the first three weeks of July and I want to emphasize as you said before that three weeks don't make a trend and you shouldn't read too much into it.  I told you that the third week of July in the U.S. was impacted by what happened in the third week of July in 2019 because that's sort of, we often look at it as a clean year, but when you look at week-by-week numbers is always going to be unusual things about what happened in the same week in 2019, or what day of the week was when -- or what holidays impact [Indiscernible], and so on. So setting that aside, what you saw in the first 3 weeks of July was quite a bit of stability on the cross-border side. And we think that's sort of the trend for the fourth quarter.  We see some of the cryptocurrency cross-border purchases have fallen back to pre-recall levels. We had a spike in April and May, as we mentioned. So that will -- has pulled back in July, as you can see. That was replaced by travel continuing to recover. And so that gives you a certain amount of stability. The big question mark is, what kind of a summer travel improvement will we get in cross-border travel, given that wider borders have opened and substantially more borders are opened than they were before.  It's still not normal in that all borders are not opened and especially borders in Asia are not open. So I think our best sort of view of the fourth quarter as it relates to cross-border travel and cross-border in general. Is that cross-border in general stays relatively stable with the third quarter, with travel recovering and cryptocurrency purchases falling back a bit and so on balance we're at neutral. In terms of the domestic businesses around the world, we provided you some color in the comments.  Everything we're seeing so far, if you adjust for unique things that's happened in 2019 is a trend that's either stable or slightly better in the U.S. and around the world, either stable or slightly better, with no evidence right now anywhere of Delta impact in the spending. And an important correlation there is mobility. Mobility is highly correlated with spendingly fine. And mobility -- in mobility indexes in general are either stable or climbing still, even as infections are finding in many parts of the world. And even where infections have gone up a lot, mobility doesn't seem to be impacted yet. No evidence of it, nor are we seeing any impact on spending. Incentives are not generally tied to cross-border. There are in some parts of the world, particularly Asia, where for travel-related portfolios, we may have some incentives tied to cross-border in those portfolios. So a fair chunk of it would flow through to the net revenue line. And that's largely a reason, in fact, why our incentives as a percent of gross revenues have climbed. It's because of this mix shift.  As far as how that how much of that flows through into the bottom line, our approach has been -- we need to invest as much as we need to invest to grow the business. There are significant opportunities available. We've already told you about how the expenses will grow in the mid-teens in the fourth quarter. If cross-border recovers faster, that won't necessarily change our investment plans. And we've never managed for margins. Margins are in outcome. Our goal is to drive as much more human revenue growth as we can and to invest what we need to drive that growth. And going back to your question about moving past our traditional business of enabling payments to merchants cross-border. You heard us talk about the extraordinary progress we're making in remittances for example. We signed up all the major Remington's providers and we can provide a very flexible, very attractive proposition for their consumers at a very attractive cost. And remittances is almost as big in volume as,?falling? direct investment. And it's not an area that we served before. Beyond that, you heard earlier about Visa payment service, payout service, which is very valuable to pay gig economy players around the world, as well as it has a big role to play in marketplace payouts and so on.  The third one I would highlight is the partnerships you signed with a whole range of cryptocurrency wallets that enable the use of Visa credentials that they issue at 70 million merchants around the world, and a big chunk of that business is expected to be cross-border too. So in our business in cross-border has gone well beyond the traditional, let's call it C2B space to P2P cross-border to B2B cross-border of course. And a significant chunk of D2C cross-border. It's too early to give you a perspective on 2022. I think we'll save that for October. And where do we provide a full-year outlook or do what we've done this quarter is to give you the best sense we have of what, what we see around us right now and how it might play out for a quarter or two. Altogether, we go further than that, I think we'll look fast as we go along. As we've said, we've already given you some indications of our posture as it relates to investment.

We'll save a lot of that discussion and pricing and our thoughts for that for October. we've seen a few months here and there of these kinds of spikes and purchases.

            "content": "Thanks, Jennifer. Good afternoon. Thank you for joning us. We had a really strong fiscal third quarter as payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volume, all approved globally. In our time today, I will first cover our results, and then discuss our performance to date across our three growth levers: consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. The first Q3 results, net revenue rose 27% or 39% if service revenues were recognized on the current quarter's payment volume. This growth far exceeded our expectations due to the strength in the U.S., improving cross-border volumes and lower-than-expected client incentives, largely due to deal timing. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.49, up 41%.  As we look at volumes of transactions, keep in mind that year-over-year growth rates are less indicative of performance and the business trajectory due to the COVID-19 impact. So once again, we provide metrics compared to 2019 on a constant dollar basis as well as year-over-year growth rates. Payments volume was a 121% of 2019, which is up 5 points from the second quarter and represents a 34% year-over-year growth rate.  Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe was 82% of 2019, 7 points better than the second quarter, and up 53% year-over-year. The process transactions were a 120% of 2019, up 4 points from Q2 and up 39% year-over-year. Vasant will provide more color on our results, so now let me transition to progress relative to our business strategy efforts across our three growth levers helped to fuel strong results while positioning us to capture future opportunities.  In consumer payments this quarter, we saw a favorable secular trends and had a number of wins with large issuers, co-brands and fintechs. Cash displacement trends continued this quarter. Globally, cash volume on Visa debit credentials. The dollar amount of cash taken out of ATMs was 98% of 2019 levels flat on Visa debit credentials, was 140% of 2019 levels, up 5 points from Q2. While debit remains strong and has accelerated since Q2, credit spending is now also improving. Global credit payments volume was a 104% of 2019, up 4 points from the second quarter.  At the same time, face-to-face payments, volume trends are stable to improving, while eCommerce or card-not-present remains elevated. When we average across our top markets where we process versus 2019, we see card present improved 10 points, with card-not-present, excluding travel improved 1 point in Q3 over Q2. Travel is starting to recover both domestically and in cross-border. Again, averaging across our top markets, where we process versus 2019, domestic travel spending improved more than 20 points in Q3 over Q2.  Globally, cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe versus 2019, improved 6 points in Q3 over Q2 and exited the quarter with June at 50% of 2019. Simply looking at the absolute levels, it was a record quarter for these with $2.7 trillion in payments volume and payment transactions per day globally, which is up $60 million per day from the last quarter and nearly a $160 million transactions per day from a year ago. And we expect much more recovery to come, especially in the areas of credit and cross-border travel.  Tap-to-pay is a key accelerator for many of these trends, including face-to-face spending in both credit and debit. We continue to see countries increasing tap-to-pay limits. For example, in Brazil, the limit was doubled five months ago and the face-to-face tap-to-pay penetration has already more than doubled from 6% to 14% in that short period. In the United States, this quarter, we surpassed $370 million tap-to-pay enabled cards and we now have three cities above 25% face-to-face tap-to-pay penetration: New York, San Francisco, and San Jose. Merchant progress continued as well. Target has doubled its tap-to-pay penetration in the last year to two out of every five face-to-face transactions, and Costco 's U.S. gas stations have reached 40% penetration in tap-to-pay payments, since enabling this feature, approximately six months ago. Now shifting to clients. We continue to win with large issuers globally. Let me share a few examples from the quarter. In the United States, we're pleased to have renewed our long-standing partnership with Navy Federal Credit Union, the largest U.S. credit union with over 10.5 million members for a multiyear credit, debit, and processing agreement. Also in the U.S., Google Pay introduced the Visa Virtual Card that links to U.S. Android users' global pay balances, enabling these users to spend their balances at stores. In Italy, we extended our agreement with Banca Sella, part of the Sella Group, the largest private and independent banking group in Italy, for the consumer credit and commercial portfolios with plans to launch a new innovative digital credit small business solution.  In Singapore, we're expanding our strong partnership with DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia. We have [Techinical Difficulty] and we will continue to grow in the DBS debit portfolio. Latin America, we renewed the HSBC debit portfolio, one of the top five portfolios in Mexico. In our CEMEA region, we won the consumer credit portfolio of Qatar National Bank, the largest financial institution in the Middle East and Africa, and we renew the credit portfolio of Saudi British Bank, one of the largest Saudi Banks. We're also building momentum as the global leader in co-brands. In the U.S. alone, we have 7 of the top 10 co-brands And this quarter, we're pleased to renew higher than the U.S. and renew and grow the Williams-Sonoma co-brand, which will be relaunched with an expanded scope across the Williams-Sonoma brands, including Pottery Barn and West Elm. We secured a new co-brand relationship with PayPal in Australia and MercadoLibre, the largest e-commerce retailer in Latin America. In partnership with Banco Itau, we also won the co-brand business of Magalu, a major retailer with one of the largest co-brand portfolios in Brazil. Finally, in the Asia-Pacific region, we have secured a significant part of LINE Pay's business, with a partnership renewal and Taiwan, the largest co-brand program in the country. Fintechs are also core to our consumer payments growth. And this quarter, we forged new partnerships and deepened relationships with long-time clients. I just mentioned LINE Pay in Taiwan and we also continue to see strong momentum in our partnership with LINE Pay in Japan and with LINE BK in Thailand. Over the last year, they have added more than 2 million Visa credentials across those markets. Likewise, in India, longtime partner, Paytm, has issued 6 million virtual Visa debit card. In addition, they've recently started to issue physical Visa debit cards, which they expect to ramp up over the coming months. Kakao Pay, one of the top three mobile wallet providers in Korea with more than 30 million users, recently signed on to issue Visa credit cards. In the Middle East, we're partnering of STC Pay, the fintech subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's largest telecom operator to embed [Technical Difficulty] STC Pay wallets.  More than a million Visa credentials have been issued since September of 2020.. Rappi, Latin America's Super App with over 70 million users, has now started issuing Visa credit cards in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Peru, with plans to expand to additional countries in coming months. And at the crypto space, we recently signed three partnerships: one with Tala, the partner on cryptocurrency solutions for the global unbanked, and two with crypto exchanges, FTX and CoinZoom to begin offering Visa cards.  We now have more than 50 crypto wallet and platforms up from 35 in Q1 and more than the next leading network. And collectively, they drove over $1 billion in payments volume [Technical Difficulty] represents a significant engine of growth. The market opportunity in new flows is 10 times greater and we continue to make progress in our efforts. We had several capabilities within carded B2B that have been gaining traction. Our freedom solution enables corporates to control and monitor corporate card spending and expand to new use cases, including payables and virtual card capabilities.  Across Australia and New Zealand, we have renewed our long-standing partnerships with ANZ Bank for Freedom's expense management capabilities as well as NAB and BNZ to deliver expense management and payable solutions. And in the United States, Wells Fargo will deliver these capabilities to their corporate clients as part of our partnership we announced earlier this year. Visa's commercial pay, which offers a mobile app enabling virtual card issuance and management of business incidentals with enhanced data, will be part of OCBC Bank's virtual purchasing card offering in Singapore.  Visa Direct transaction growth remains robust with nearly a 0.5 billion more transactions this quarter than in the third quarter of last year. We continue to see large banks enable Visa Direct payouts for their customers, including CIBC this quarter. In the payroll category, ADP, a leading global technology company, providing human capital management solutions, recently integrated its wisely offering with Visa Direct to provide ADP clients with a digitally-enabled, convenient, and cost-effective solution for employee off-cycle payments. In the P2P space, the WhatsApp payment feature, powered by Visa Direct and Visa Cloud Token Framework, launched in Brazil in May. And we're seeing early success with a significant number of Visa credentials enrolled and sizable growth in P2P money transfers. PayPal announced instant transfers for merchants settlement and P2P via Visa Direct in Australia. We also developed new use cases this quarter for Visa Direct. First, GoFundMe is integrating Visa Direct to soon launch funds disbursement to individuals and organizations. Second, Questrade, the Canadian brokerage platform, announced the launch of Instant Deposit, allowing investors to fund their trade accounts in seconds. Let's now move to our third growth lever, value-added services, where revenue growth grew 28% in Q3. Let me discuss our efforts across a few of our capabilities. First, installments. In addition to investing in and partnering with numerous installment providers globally, we've also developed our own solution, which had some notable progress in the quarter. In Canada, Scotiabank is extending their post-purchase installments offering to -- they're offering to eligible Visa retail credit clients. CIBC is launching installments during purchase and Desjardin, North America's largest financial cooperative will be offering during purchase installments for their eligible Visa customers. In addition, Global Payments is enabling on installment solution for their merchant customers. Second, CyberSource, our omni-channel gateway platform has grown as a result of three drivers: one, increased e-commerce and omni-channel volumes; two, more business creating online and omni-channel presences, while leveraging our risk tools; and three, more acquirers, white labeling the solution. This past quarter, top 20 U.S. acquirer, Paya and Qatar National Bank, both signed to utilize CyberSource's capabilities. Third, DPS. I mentioned the processing agreement earlier with Navy Federal, they intend to utilize DPS. In addition, Current, one of the fastest-growing U.S. fintechs with nearly 3 million members have selected Visa DPS as its partner. Current will integrate with DPS' newest all digital processing solution called DPS Forward, which combines issuer processing capabilities with a new suite of APIs that integrate with modern digital banking players to create unique card programs and payment solutions. Finally, Visa Consulting and Analytics. Our advisory teams have delivered nearly 1,000 projects year-to-date in 88 countries to help our clients to be more successful. Let me just share a couple of examples. In Latin America, we developed a digital acquisition platform and help one of the top issuers in the region improved credit approval turn around times from days to minutes will also better qualifying leads to reach a 4 times improvement and approval rate compared to their prior solution. Globally, we have launched a new program called Visa Portfolio Health Check, where we review client's portfolios, tracking 30-plus key performance indicators. Year-to-date, we have held health checks across 55 countries, identify nearly 300 specific opportunities worth nearly $50 billion in incremental payment volume. Before I close, let me touch briefly on the two recently announced acquisitions. First, out of the open banking platform, Tink. Visa's proven infrastructure and sustained investment in resilient cyber security and fraud prevention, combined with Tink's API, their technology and customer relationships is expected to help accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe by ensuring a secure, reliable platform for innovation, which will help consumers and businesses. Second is the acquisition of Currencycloud, a global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide their customer and business customers innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments around the world.  As part of our network of networks strategy, the combination of currencies - Currencycloud's capabilities on the front end of the transaction through their API and our settlement capabilities across VisaNet and other Visa networks such as Plus, Earthport and Visa B2B Connect will be very compelling value propositions for our partners. In closing, as we look to finish our fiscal year, I'm very encouraged by the recovery trajectory across the board and pleased with the momentum in many of our key growth areas. Our recently launched new brand campaign describes Visa as the network working for everyone and we are increasingly sitting at the center of enabling money movement. I'm confident that our strategy combined with \u2013 our network-to-network strategy combined with our three growth levers of consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services remains more relevant than ever and positions us well as we look forward to our robust recovery. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant. Vasant? The only thing I would add, Tien-Tsin, is that, we saw major separation through the pandemic, part of the pandemic between credit and debit growth. And this quarter, the separation between them in the business was more like 6 points, where we've seen quarters closer to 30 points.. So that's further indication of credit starting to rebound for the reasons that Vasant articulated. Well, I'll star and Vasant can jump in. The epicenter of open banking is Europe, which is what attracted us to Tink. It is a open banking platform that has footprint in 18 markets that allows through single API customers, which are primarily developers to access financial data and Tink has connectivity to about 3,400 banks and FIs and about 10,000 developers in Europe. And it's one of 400 players versus other markets. There's an awful lot of players in the open banking space in Europe because of the fact that it is in ground \u2013 it is ground zero.  And we do think that the combination of our various capabilities and relationships combined with Tink 's technology and relationships is going to ideally accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe. It's early days, but there is going to be an increased adoption of open banking and we see making progress in Europe first even beyond the 18 markets that Tink is in. And there's no reason why we can't take the business to other parts of the world, particularly in Asia and CEMEA. Well, I think as we've talked in the past, that the most important thing with B2B Connect is to continue to grow out the infrastructure and that requires both signing key partners and we had announced last quarter, I guess, the signing of Goldman Sachs' Transaction Banking as a user of B2B Connect. And we're using bank integrators like ACI and Fiserv and Bottomline to help us as well in terms of driving more players in B2B Connect. At this point, that's our emphasis.  Our emphasis is building out this, the robustness of this network, so it has more endpoints and more clients. Again, we see this as a $10 billion opportunity. And we think that B2B Connect is - has the capability to be a much better than a Swift kind of alternative for driving payments without having to build - cross-border payments, without having to build out a corresponding banking network.  So we've continued to sign players and they've continued to do their infrastructure connections to us and we've started to drive transactions. But at this point what I have an update on B2B Connect, I'm much more interested in how we're doing in driving the robustness of the network versus being at a point where we're counting progress on the number of transactions that we're actually seeing flow over the network. Well, Lisa, we remain extremely robust and excited about the opportunities in value-added services and new flows. Obviously, some of our value-added services, we actually saw our declines during the pandemic. Certainly, people were buying less travel benefits from us. There were less transactions in certain cases against which we could sell value-added services. But as I said, we started to see transactions really roll back this quarter.  For the first time ever, we averaged over 600 million transactions in the quarter -- and for every day in the quarter, I should say. And that was up 160 from -- by more than 160 million transactions a day a year ago during the pandemic. So I think that, as we start to get into what I believe is going to be a robust recovery and a continued growth in transactions.  We're going to continue to see our platform-type services, CyberSource, our issuer processing, our risk and identity services, which represent about two-thirds of our value-added services, grow very nicely. I think we've continued to start to see recoveries on the other side and things like our consulting. And I think as travel comes back, our card benefits and travel-related card benefits will increase.  So I think that while we rent during the height of the pandemic, we got off our trajectory of where we want it to be in 5 years. I feel like we're going to get right back on that trajectory and maybe even do better than we might have thought we would do. In terms of new flows, I'd say a couple of things. One is obviously Visa Direct continues to do very well. I cited that it was almost 0.5 billion more transactions in the quarter than the prior year. And I think in Vasant's remarks, he talked about mid-50s percent growth levels continuing and we've seen this for numbers of quarters now. And in the B2B space, we're starting to see some recovery.  The B2B space looks like the consumer credit space, so it's the commercial volumes kind of echoing or following that, mirroring that, although small businesses obviously recovering quicker than large market. But as I think, as people start to come back to work, as business travel starts to return, as I feel good that the commercial volume will continue to come back as well. So again, I would say that in the new flows area, while we, again, went off trajectory for what we would have said at Investor Day, the reality is I think we'll get right back on now as we're seeing a really very good beginning to what I think will be a robust recovery. The only thing I would add is that the action where there's been stimulus that is certainly impacted some spending, but it tends to drive spending for a couple of weeks and then wain over the third to fifth week. I might use a different phrase than pent-up demand. I think it's a little bit of a return to normal. And I'd also bring back -- we're starting -- gyms are open, people are going to sporting events. A nd then I'd come back to something besides cited in response to one of the earlier questions, which is the affluent customers jumped back into the Marketplace. These are the people that drive up white tablecloth restaurant spending, if the people make discretionary purchases. These are the people who are heading to Mexico and other places as borders open up. And so I think again, I echo what Vasant said that mobility can continue to improve. I think we just get closer and closer to returning to a more normal and therefore feel like there's going to be good run here of a good recovery for the business. Well, if you do simple math and say that the cross-border business would have continued to grow at roughly 10% a year as it was growing pre-pandemic. And we're indexing right now, as you said, around 82% than '19. I mean, you can do the math yourself, right? We would've been indexing closer to 120 or 121, I suppose, if you assume 10%. and that delta between 82 and 121 gives you a sense if you apply that to our international revenues line, it gives you a sense of it. Now, we do have some additional cross-border revenues in the Data Processing line because that is -- the data processing revenue associated with cross-border too. But if you do the math, I mean, you can see that it's a sizable amount of revenue. Yes, you're right. Well, I'll start to emphasize to pick up. Look, the reality is the world is shrinking from the perspective of how easy it is for people to buy from sellers in different countries, in different regions around the world. And we've seen a dramatic increase millions of millions of people shopping online during the pandemic, who never shopped online before. So I our expectation is that you are going to continue to see very, very good growth in cross-border eCommerce going forward.  I think that the whole eCommerce trend, both domestically and in terms of cross-border, is something you're not going to be able to nor want to have go back to the way it was before. I think that this is a fundamental change in how people shop and it's going to continue to drive the cash digitization that we've been talking about.  Currencycloud, the acquisition we announced, I don't know, a week or two ago, I think builds on and extends our existing capabilities to provide better FX services and easier connectivity to FinTechs, financial institutions, and other partners. And they have a really cool set of APIs and And we think that combination of Currencycloud capabilities on the front end of a transaction via those API's. And our settlement capabilities across VisaNet and our other networks, B2B Connect, Northport pluses, cetera, is going to create a very powerful combination.  So, ultimately, our intention is to provide global?reach here? with simplicity and flexibility at competitive pricing. And we want to leverage our settlement scale and make sure that we're also leveraging our sophistication in managing risks. So we like -- we like the asset in Currencycloud, we like this to be combination of these capabilities and Currencycloud capabilities. And I -- we like the fact that from a dynamics perspective, we see cross-border travel continuing to come back over time, And we see the eCommerce cross-border continuing to be robust as we look forward. Well, I think what issuers are dealing is getting ready for our return to travel being a important spend category. As you well know, many of these reward propositions in North America, both in the U.S. and in Canada, are very tied to travel. All the big airlines, all the?booked big hotels? have co-brand programs and even for other programs that reward programs th at are more generic, a lot of their bird options are tied to travel.  So I think that travel's going to -- has started to come back, it will continue to come back as mobility increases, as restrictions get lifted, etcetera. And I think issuers are trying to make sure that as that happens and as the affluent consumer and the middle market consumer starts to get in their car and get on airplanes more, that their their product will be top of wallet and I think that's really what's driving the?activity?."

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Jennifer, thank you and congratulations on your second anniversary with Visa. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. I'm going to provide a few quick stats on the quarter and then share my thoughts on what's ahead as the world continues to recover. The recovery is going to take many different shapes and the timing will differ around the world based on vaccination rollouts and the easing of restrictions. But we believe we're at the beginning of the end of the pandemic. And the recovery is well underway, at least in a number of markets. First, Q2 results, revenue declined 2% year-over-year, but would be slightly positive at 20 basis points if service revenues were recognized on current quarter payments volume. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.38, a decrease of 1%. When looking at volumes and transactions growth, keep in mind that we're now lapping the start of the pandemic as growth rates are now less indicative of performance and the business trajectory. We're going to also provide some metrics compared to 2019 on a constant dollar basis. So payments volume grew 11%, improving seven points from Q1 and reached 116% of 2019, which is up three points from Q1. Cross-border volume excluding inter-Europe declined 21%, but improved 12 points from Q1 and it's 75% of 2019 levels, three points better than Q1. Process transactions growth of 8% improved four points from Q1 and represented 116% of 2019, which is consistent with the first quarter. This quarter, we continue to make progress across our three growth levers. First, consumer payments, in Asia-Pacific, we renewed our partnership with Rakuten Card, a subsidiary of Rakuten Group, the largest e-commerce marketplace in Japan. In Korea, Visa won the first hotel chain co-brand in the country with Marriott and Shinhan Card, Korea's largest issuer. In China, we renewed our credit portfolios with CITIC Bank and Agricultural Bank of China, two of the top 10 largest banks in the country. Also on the co-brand front in Brazil, Samsung in partnership with Banco Ita\u00fa, we will issue their inaugural co-brand in Latin America with Visa targeting Samsung's 57 million Brazilian users. In Europe, Visa won incremental business with BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium. This expands our relationship to include four million debit cards, in addition to our existing credit relationship. In Switzerland, we gained significant traction in growing Visa Debit. Since this January of 2019, we have signed 13 new debit deals, representing an incremental 2.6 million cards. In new flows, Visa Direct transactions grew almost 60% in the second quarter. We're pleased to have clients going live now with Visa Direct payouts which offers a flexible set of API for Visa partners globally to use a single point of connection for push payments to cards and accounts. MoneyGram, Goldman Sachs' Transaction Banking, Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong and KyckGlobal are among the first to start utilizing Visa Direct payouts for B2C, cross-border P2P and B2b payouts. A few additional highlights on specific Visa Direct use cases include that in the marketplace payouts, Airbnb, which now has four million hosts globally will offer host payouts using Visa Direct in select markets. In cross-border P2P, Remitly, a top digital remittance FinTech has renewed its Visa Direct relationship building upon the past two years of partnership. And Monobank in Ukraine enabled cross-border P2P to their 1.7 million cardholders. In the payroll category, the earned wage access use case continues to grow with 25 earn wage access platforms now offering Visa Direct for fast and convenient access to employee earnings. G2C continues to grow as well, Global Blue, a leading tax-free shopping solutions company covering 52 countries and 35 million tax-free transactions in 2019 is utilizing Visa Direct to distribute tax refund payments across Europe. Separate from Visa Direct, we supported the U.S. government's disbursements of economic impact payments to nearly 13 million Visa prepaid credentials in the U.S. so far this year. And add to our third growth, our value-added services were continuing to see strong adoption. Let me highlight a couple of examples. For CyberSource, Planet, our European acquirer and payment services provider that delivers payment processing and currency conversion solutions to over 600,000 merchants. We'll be partnering with CyberSource to simplify payments across the hospitality, food and beverage and retail sectors. KeyBanc, a top U.S. acquire will begin to offer CyberSource to its merchant clients. And as e-commerce continued to grow Decision Manager, a key risk offering of CyberSource increased transactions over 30% fiscal year-to-date. Our other risk fraud and authentication capabilities grew as well. For example, we've now crossed the two billion token milestone, up from 1.4 billion tokens just in September. One of our key authentication capabilities, CardinalCommerce grew revenue almost 50% year-over-year this quarter by rapidly expanding beyond the U.S. origins. In the next year, we plan to more than double our clients in Europe and Central Europe, Middle East and Africa. So while the pandemic has disrupted the world, it has not changed our strategy. In fact, it has reinforced our belief that our three areas of focus will deliver robust growth for years to come. As we look ahead with COVID recovery underway, a few key important realities, namely the way consumers feel about e-commerce, cash and travel will particularly impact Visa. The pandemic has accelerated e-commerce, global card-not-present credentials, excluding travel grew over 20% in the quarter versus last year. Our growth in card-not-present payment volume, excluding travel has averaged at least 30% in the United States, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, India, and Singapore over the last three quarters. And in global cross-border, excluding into Europe, it's averaged 20% growth. We believe this shift is likely to persist as the convenience of e-commerce is indisputable and its growth continues to be robust even as card-present begins to return. In March in the United States, as some states loosened transactions, card-present as a percentage of 2019 spend improved 11 points versus February. While at the same time card-not-present excluding travel, still expanded eight points. You look at that in Germany \u2013 in Japan, where restrictions were also lifted card-present improved six points and card-not-present excluding travel, still improved four points in that same comparison between March and February. The pandemic has accelerated the digitization of cash. And we see the impact and tap to pay. When we look at cash usage in the last 12 months, just on the Visa brand, such as with ATM withdrawals, we see that global debit cash volumes have decreased by 7%, while debit payments growth \u2013 payments side have grown 16% both on a constant dollar basis. This 20 point GAAP is more than doubled at historic GAAP in growth rates and relatively consistent globally demonstrating cash digitization in both mature and emerging regions. Overall, these tap to pay transactions have grown over 30% year-over-year in March. In Europe, less than a year since contact with limits increased across the region, Visa has seen $1 billion additional touch-free transactions. In the United States, one in 10 face-to-face Visa transactions are now done with a tap, more than a two times increase since the beginning of the pandemic. In New York city, the penetration is nearly 30%, demonstrating the potential of focused issuance and merchant enablement along the transit. In the past three years alone, we've enabled nearly 250 transit systems globally. And we can see based on our research that enabling tap to pay on transit can bring more than a 15% lift in transactions for merchants in the surrounding neighborhoods. The decline in travel is temporary, and we're starting to see some early signs of recovery. Cross-border travel-related spending excluding Intra-Europe, improved from Q1 driven by two factors. First, those who were abroad are spending more likely because of fewer restrictions. This quarter, essentially all the cross-border travel spend improvement was driven by higher spend per card rather than more active cause. Second, we continue to see strain from countries with open-border. For example, U.S. to Mexico volume was almost 20% above 2019 levels for the quarter. We also saw several top corridors between the U.S. and Latin America, improved by more than 10 points through the quarter versus 2019. Travel will certainly take more time to recover than other sectors, but we believe personal travel in particular will come back and that's good for Visa for two primary reasons. One, because the vast majority of the travel we capture on our credentials is consumer. And two, we are the global leader in travel co-brands. With the backdrop of travel, cash digitization and e-commerce, let's briefly explore the future potential of our three growth levers. In consumer payments, in the last two years, we've grown our credentials to $3.6 billion and physical merchant locations to over $70 million, up 7% and 34%, respectively. And remember that our merchant locations only count our partners like PayPal and Square each as one. That said, there's ample opportunity as we focus on specific region\u2019s requirements. Looking at regions, even with our leading position in both emerging and developed markets, our market-driven approach to growing credentials is succeeding, and Europe is an excellent example. From 2018 to 2020, we grew active card credentials by 10%. And looking ahead, we have line of sight to more than 25 million additional credentials across 50 clients in the next few years. Let me site a couple of recent partnerships that would show this rapid growth. Since fintech Revolut signed a global agreement in September 2019, selecting these as their lead issuing partner, they've increased the number of cards and payments volume by more than 200% through December 2020. Crypto.com has launched Visa cards in 39 markets across their 10 million user base since 2018. And just this quarter, they find a global growth agreement with us covering 12 markets with plans to expand to even more. There are so many more partners issuing credentials and building acceptance. For example, wallet providers represent the potential for another 2 billion credentials in 70 billion acceptance locations over time, and the pace of growth here is fast. YooMoney in Russia recently signed on to issue Visa credentials, and has achieved more than 1 million credentials in just five months. In fiscal Q2 last year, we announced that stc pay, Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest wireless operator with 25 million subscribers plan to embed credentials in their stc wallet \u2013 pay wallet. To-date, more than a 1 million Visa credentials have been issued. Our ongoing partnership with Paytm has enabled us to add more than 250,000 contactless enabled acceptance locations at new to card merchants, while the number of Visa credentials issued by Paytm has more than doubled since September of 2020 reaching a total of 3 million. Around the world, tap to phone has also been a significant acceptance effort. Today more than 35 markets offer it with 13 more being added this year. Wallets and tap to phone are just a couple of next-gen partners and capabilities that we believe will help us bring the $1.7 billion unbanked into the financial mainstream, growing the pie for digital payments. The growth will come from a regional approach and openness to partnering with traditional and new players and by developing new ways to engage the ecosystem all rooted in our strong brand and in technology. In new flows, our success in the United States is a real asset. While they have been impacted by the pandemic, our strategies against $120 trillion opportunity represent near, medium and longer term growth for Visa. In the near-term, we're focused on supporting businesses small and large. To-date, we've helped 12 million micro and small businesses to digitize and grow against our 50 million global goal. And we continue to focus on card-based solutions. Visa has about 20% more commercial issuers today than we did four years ago. In the medium-term, Visa B2B Connect addresses the major pain points with the current top solution in cross-border B2B. And we are continuing to add banks to reach scale. In the longer-term, we're working with key partners to solve the challenges in accounts payable and accounts receivable. For the other $65 trillion of new flows, Visa Direct has five clear competitive advantages that we believe will continue to drive growth. The first one is reach. In Visa Direct, the endpoints are card credentials and bank accounts, and we can reach $5 billion endpoints globally. This is unrivaled by anyone else. Second, operating scale; Visa Direct is built upon the operating scale of VisaNet and leverages its real-time authorization, clearing and settlement capabilities. This means we can deliver industry-leading solutions with low marginal cost. Third is commitment to network strategy. Visa Direct is truly multi-rail, which provides clients flexibility and efficiency. Just in the last year, it has utilized 16 card-based networks, 65 ACM schemes, seven RTP networks and five payment gateways. That is more connections, coverage and capability that we've seen from any other network offerings. Fourth, investments in our capabilities. We have invested in leading technology stack for both payouts and account funding capabilities. For example, our crowdfunding capabilities include unique codes to help clients manage risk, compliance and authorizations for money movement transactions with API to streamline implementation for apps, neobanks, and fintechs. To our knowledge, no one else has this capability. This is commercialization. We've now enabled over 20 use cases with more than 450 new program launches. And we will continue to expand by, one, growing existing use cases like marketplaces and cross-border P2P; two, bringing existing use cases like P2P payroll and earned wage access to other new markets; and three, developing new use cases such as tipping. Visa Direct also brings a network effect in terms of benefits to Visa. For every dollar received on a debit card through Visa Direct, about half of it is then used for debit card purchases. Furthermore card holders who receive payments through Visa Direct can spend up to 50% more than those who do not. So Visa Direct is actually not only helping new flows, but it is helping consumer payments. Lastly, let's turn to value added services, which are being utilized by our clients more and more. In fiscal year 2020, more than 60% of our clients use at least five value added services from Visa and more than 30% of our clients use 10 or more. Our toolbox is large with hands-on consulting, sophisticated and flexible technology platforms, valuable data and insight and card benefits, all which will improve with the recovery. We also have three platform businesses that scale, very profitably, CyberSource, issuer processing, and risk identity and authentication. With the recovery and the continued strength in e-commerce and debit these capabilities are well aligned with trends toward digitization. Let me just speak about CyberSource as an example, our strategy to partner with acquirers creates a leveraged opportunity for future growth, both transaction growth and cross selling value added services. We mentioned last year that Japanese acquire SMCC was going to start offering CyberSource capabilities to its merchant customers. Starting with one nationwide convenience store chain and rapidly expanding to over 30,000 merchants. SMCC is now delivering next generation acquiring solutions to Japanese merchants and CyberSource is processing over half a million e-commerce and in-person transactions per day. With all this opportunity across the three levers, we\u2019re investing heavily to drive future growth in several areas, including simple compelling user experiences examples include Tap to Pay, Tap to Phone and quick to that. Capabilities to scale new flows and value-added services examples include new needs and direct use cases and advancing fraud and identity solutions. Specific markets that can benefit from targeted resources, such as Europe and Africa. Innovations in payment \u2013 in the payments ecosystem such as crypto API for banks and digital currency settlement. To close, Visa has weathered the COVID storm, it is emerging from the pandemic even stronger. There\u2019s significant opportunity ahead and Visa\u2019s existing presence, scale and capabilities, position us well to capture more growth in the future. With that, now let me turn it over to Vasant for more colors on our financials and what we see ahead. Vasant, over to you.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter results were stronger than we expected with net revenue down 2% largely due to improving cross model volumes and lower than expected client incentives. GAAP EPS was flat to last year and non-GAAP EPS declined 1% helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shift increased net revenue by 0.5 point, but lower EPS by 0.5 point due to currency related benefits in the second quarter last year. As Al mentioned, as we lacked the most significant COVID-19 impact, starting in March, 2020, year-over-year growth rates are not the best indicator of the underlying trend. To help you better assess what the magnitude and the trajectory of the recovery so far, they also provided growth rates for key performance metrics relative to fiscal year 2019. In constant dollars, global payments volume year-over-year growth was over 11% fueled by continued strength in debit, as well as improving credit spending. Compared to the corresponding quarter in 2019, the other payments volume was 16% higher, but 3 point acceleration from the first quarter. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 13% or 20% higher than 2019 as Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was 18% and up 24% from 2019 benefiting from economic impact payments in early January and mid-March, as well as the relaxing of COVID-related restriction in many States partially offset by bad weather lowering spending in mid-February. Even after adjusting for economic impact payments, U.S. payments volumes have bounced back to the people that trend line. Debit growth accelerated 13 points to 34%, up 44% from 2019 boosted by the two economic impact payments in this quarter. Credit growth of 2% up 6% from 2019, the credit improvement of health by increases in retail, travel, restaurant and entertainment spending mostly starting in early March as restrictions were relaxed in many States. It is important to note that credit has improved without debits volume pointing to accelerated cash displacement. Card not present volume excluding travel continued to grow over 30% in the quarter and what 55% about 2019 levels primarily driven by retail spend. The most notable sign of a domestic recovery was card presence spent growing 4%, which is up 3% over 2019 and 8 point acceleration from the first quarter led by retail and restaurant spending. Improving card presence spending did not slow e-commerce indicating that e-commerce trend is likely to continue even as card presence spent recovers. International constant dollars payments volume growth was 6% up 9% from 2019 a few regional highlights. CEMEA remains our fastest growing region, growing 26%, up 50% from 2019 levels. The easing of COVID-related restrictions, particularly in the Middle East and Russia, as well as 0:25:52 drove the robust growth. Latin America grew 23%, up 40% from 2019, but consistently strong performance across the region mostly fueled by accelerating e-commerce adoption and usage as well as client wins. Europe grew 2% up 8% from 2019, but decelerated from the last quarter, as many countries put significant COVID restrictions in place, particularly the UK, France, Italy and Germany. In Asia-Pacific, excluding China, second quarter spending grew 4% up 8% from 2019. Performance across the region vary based on the level of COVID restrictions that markets like New Zealand and Singapore growing strongly by markets like Hong Kong and Japan, which had restrictions for most of the quarter the weaker. Global profits transaction growth was 8% up 16% from 2019 lagging volume growth due to higher ticket sizes, particularly in the U.S. and significant code restrictions in Europe. Visa direct continues to perform well. The transaction is growing almost 60% globally this quarter, consistent for the first quarter. The cross model volume recovery continued despite most models remaining completely or partially closed. Constant dollars cross model volume excluding transactions within Europe declined 21% in the second quarter, another 75% of 2019 volumes. Looking at the trajectory versus 2019, this was a feed point improvement from the first quarter. We\u2019re seeing the typical seasonal uptake in March and into April, which is a positive sign as we look ahead to the summer. Card not present excluding travel volume continued to be very strong growing 28% year-over-year, up 44% from 2019 driven mostly by retail spending and some benefit from cryptocurrency purchases. Cross model travel-related spend declined 55% year-over-year and more than 39% of 2019 levels. Card presence spend as a percentage of 2019 expanded 3 points versus the first quarter. Some color on the state of cross model travel as we approach the important summer travel season. Travel to and from the U.S. and Latin America is the best performing corridor almost at 90% of 2019 levels by March. Help by U.S. travel, travel into Latin America in general has recovered to over 80% of 2019. Travel between Russia and neighboring countries, as well as travel in and out of the Gulf States has helped CEMEA cross model travel to recover two-thirds of its pre-COVID volume. Cross model travel in and out of Asian countries remains very depressed down almost 75% versus 2019 and flat lining for the past six months. Travel into the U.S. an important corridor for us, but also down 70% versus 2019 in March, but hasn\u2019t been recovering slowly. The significant U.S., Canada border restriction travel is still down about 80% relative to 2019 in this corridor. As Europe has increased COVID restrictions, travel in and out of Europe remain hard hit down over 50% versus 2019 in March. Moving now to a quick review of second quarter financial results. Net revenue declined 2% as we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, net revenue growth would have been slightly positive. Service revenues grew 8% helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 11% with strong value-added services growth continuing to be partially offset by the mixed shift away from higher using cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 19% in line with nominal cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe. Other revenues were flat, negatively impacted by low usage of travel related card benefits and client marketing projects pushed to later in the year, while advisory services continued to grow strongly. In total, value added services revenue continue to perform well growing 14% with strong growth in CyberSource security and identity solutions. This quarter, we reclassified some prior period travel related card benefits as value-added services. And as such, our previously reported first quarter revenue growth would have been similar to the second quarter on a comparable basis. Prime incentives were 25.8% of gross revenues, lower than expected due to better than cross-border volume lifting gross revenue and lower Europe and Asia Pacific volumes benefiting client incentives. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 3% in line with expectations. Recorded gain from our equity investments of $156 million. Excluding investment gains non-GAAP non-operating expense was $109 million for the fiscal second quarter, below our expectations, primarily due to benefits, one of which is offset in personnel expenses and the other is related to the completion of certain tax audits. These completed audits also benefited our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate with a non-GAAP tax rate lower than expected at 16.8%. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS was $1.38. We bought 8.3 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $208.51 for $1.7 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share returned approximately $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Turning from the past to the future, I\u2019ll start with key business driver trends through April 21. As we look at these weekly trends, keep in mind, three key factors. One, year-over-year growth is napping the 2020 lows in many cases. Two, the timing of Easter is impactful. Three, in the U.S., there are peaks in debit spending when economic impact payments are deposited in people\u2019s bank accounts. Through April 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 64% with U.S. debit growing 67% and credit up 61%. Compared to 2019, U.S. payments volume, debit and credit were up 29%, 51% and 9% respectively, all consistent with the March trend. Looking outside the U.S., trends versus 2019 are relatively stable, notable exception is included the UK improving as restrictions relaxed, while India is slowing as restrictions increase. Profits transaction growth was 58% up 16% from 2019, which is consistent with the second quarter. Cross border volume excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis grew 63% and more than 78% of 2019, which is three points above the second quarter and one point above March. As we look ahead, there are several positive cross border travel indicators to highlight. Travel bubbles were being created. Australia, New Zealand is already in place with an immediate and substantial uptick in bookings. Hong Kong, Singapore is starting in late May with more likely. So far, all indications are that some popular tourist destination in Southern Europe will be open for the summer and bookings are trending well. Just this week, it was announced that Europe\u2019s border will be open to vaccinated visitors from the U.S. this summer. As a U.S. vaccination program moves along fast, it is possible that travel to and from the U.S. will gather momentum into the summer. Airlines are adding capacity in anticipation. The trajectory of the cross-border travel recovery remains a key metric to watch. We will be monitoring all leading indicators, using a border restriction for the bookings, as well as surveys of consumer intention and we\u2019ll update you as we learn more. As the previous quarters, accurate forecasting is difficult in this fast changing environment. Assuming stable to improving trends relative to FY2019 continue, Q3 net revenue growth is expected to be in the high teens. The cross border travel recovery trajectory will be the key factor to watch. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are expected to increase 1 to 1.5 points above the second quarter level as client volumes grow significantly over the last year low. And so this fees are recognized that the quarter lag. We plan to increase operating expenses in the mid-teens in the third quarter, as we step up investments on marketing and key initiatives to capture the significant growth opportunities Al described. We expect non-operating expense to be around $130 million consistent with the second quarter, excluding the non-recurring impacts I mentioned earlier. Our tax rate expectations are 19% to 19.5%, again, consistent with last quarter\u2019s expectations before the tax audit completions in the second quarter, I mentioned earlier. In closing, we\u2019re stepping up our investments to drive accelerated growth in a post COVID world. A few points to highlight. Our net revenue on profit by the fiscal year 2019 levels, even as the rebound in travel, especially cross-border travel still remains ahead of us after the world is vaccinated and borders reopen. That a significant pent up demand for travel in particular, personal travel. Large swaths of new consumers worldwide have been introduced to the ease, convenience and security that digital payments can offer. This is evidenced by the significant global growth in debit as consumers abandoned cash at an accelerated pace. These are habits we believe will not only stick, but also continue to grow help my initiatives such as staff to pay. Consumers, merchants and governments globally have recognized the value of e-commerce through the pandemic. Governments are upgrading the digital infrastructure, merchants are significantly enhancing their e-commerce capabilities and more consumers are turning to e-commerce across more categories and also cross-border. We expect these trends will only accelerate. But in our new flows business, Visa Direct has continued to grow an extraordinary rates. The pandemic has expanded adoption of use cases in P2P, B2C and G2C, many use cases and markets are just starting to scale. B2B remains a huge opportunity and they\u2019re committed to our three-pronged approach to drive growth, card based, cross-border and large enterprise accounts receivables and payables that many capabilities scaling or launching in the near future. Our value-added services have sustained high growth, despite lower usage of travel related services. That is an e-commerce acceleration have driven growth in our debit processing, security and identity and CyberSource businesses and the recovery in travel related services lies ahead. As a result, we see acceleration across all three vectors of growth in consumer payments, new flows and value added services. As Al indicated, we\u2019re investing in the strategies and capabilities required to capture these growth opportunities. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Mike for the Q&A session.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Vasant. Jordan, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks a lot for taking the question. I wanted to touch on the evolving mix of the cross-border business. So within cross-border, you call it out a couple of use cases for Visa Direct. Earlier you touched on remittances, you touched on marketplace payouts. But separately, we\u2019d add to that list some of the new flows within cross-border B2B. So maybe you could just comment a little bit on the prospects for those new areas of cross-border to come into the mix and maybe the more meaningful portion over the next, call it, three to five years.\nAl Kelly: Well, I think as we grow out our capabilities, if you see the recovery in the pandemic. I think that these have payouts capability we just put in place, which basically brings together what was earth for. And Visa Direct is a single point of connection is going to facilitate many more use cases and make it very, very easy for, for people to spend money cross-border. And that\u2019s kind of the high volume, lower value types of transactions. I think we are continuing to make progress in connecting more banks around the world to B2B Connect. And as we complete the grow out of that network over the next few years, I see us as having great capability to drive cross-border B2B high value, lower volume types of transactions. So I think the combination of our capabilities, what has happened in terms of continued adoption of digitization and the capabilities that we have built in and the use cases that we are working with today and anticipate adding to the mix over time. I think this is going to become an increasingly important and growing part of our business.\nVasant Prabhu: A couple of things to add, before we got into the pandemic two-thirds of our cross-border business was travel related, one-third was e-commerce related. Today, in the second quarter two-thirds of our business was cross-border e-commerce, one-third was travel. It says two things, one how much our cross-border e-commerce business has grown and the second, how much recovery is left in our cross-border travel business, because Al has said, most of our cross-border travel is personal travel and there's a substantial amount of personal travel that is going to come back once border is reopened. So the traditional, cross-border e-commerce is an area of significant growth we've seen that as people move online, they become somewhat less sensitive to where the product is shipped from. And there's just a lot more cross-border e-commerce. The other use case that pulls a lot of potential is to the extent that crypto related transactions become significant and they are enabling a vast number of them. One use case that is particularly useful in either stable coin or Bitcoin type of scenarios is cross-border. And that is another new use case that could have a lot of potential in the long-term.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks, Vasant. That's exactly what I was trying to get at, the mix has certainly flipped to more e-com and there are some new flows that are coming in to keep the travel portion lower than it was pre-COVID. So thank you so much for taking the question.\nVasant Prabhu: Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks guys and nice job. When we look at the Slide, the index to 2019 was really helpful, showing 16% up from 2019 levels. I mean, there's a lot of considerations we're getting at about including stimulus and higher savings rates, but clearly also structural changes in the industry, which \u2013 some of which we just touched on e-com, but just more going on to debit cards faster across the whole industry. How do you parse out what you see as structurally sustainable, e-commerce is a part that you mentioned, but even beyond that, just more on maybe small ticket versus what was maybe stimulus driven or near-term? Thanks guys.\nAl Kelly: But \u2013 I will start Darrin. First of all, I think we definitely see millions of new people coming into the e-com shoppers who weren't there before, and I don't think they're going to turn backward at all. So I think that certainly remains obviously as we get out of the pandemic, the stimulus types of money will dry up and that will go away. I think the people being concerned about cash and much more comfortable shopping online, the combination of that will continue. I think that will also see structurally much more Tap to Pay as people find that to be a more helpful way to shop. I think we're seeing governments during this pandemic become bigger clients and they're increasingly interested in showing the way in terms of digitizing more of what they do as a government and I think we'll see more of that activity taking as well. I think that, in general we had before the pandemic a very little separation in growth rate between debit and credit, in any given month or quarter, they would kind of grow within a percentage point of each other. We saw incredible separation during the pandemic as much as 40 points of differential incomes of growth. We're now seeing in this quarter credit come back a bit and then start to drift into a positive territory. But I think that at least for the foreseeable future and maybe for longer, that I think you're going to see debit continue to grow above credit, although as travel comes back that should certainly help bounce back credit buyers, particularly since most of the travel co-brand cards and many of the actual travelers tend to use credit cards.\nVasant Prabhu: I mean, a couple of other things to add there is, as you know, debit has become the engine for cash digitization. And what we see in this pandemic, especially as it has gone on for quite a while, is there's often a hurdle in getting people to change habits. So people are used to using cash, getting them to use digital forms of payment, not take some time. This pandemic has called a range of changes in behavior, because there was no choice, whether it's an emerging markets, where there was a greater propensity to use cash or certain cultures, you've heard of Germany and Japan as having been very cash based economies for a very long time or habits in terms of people using cash for certain categories like food and drug that's changing, more people using more cash at the physical point of sale, as Al said, with the cash dirty risk, as well as Tap to Pay are making payments easy at the physical point of sale, we're seeing a substantial shift towards cash digitization, even at the physical point of sale. And then the point you said about smaller and smaller transactions that used to be cash moving digital, again Tap to Pay is a big engine for that and the trajectory of Tap to Pay remains very significant. And we are probably within a year of coming to the point where the U.S. will be in takeoff with on Tap to Pay to which is a very big market.\nDarrin Peller: Really helpful guys, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much. Just bridging to Darrin\u2019s question on structural changes, when you look at the heightened shift to e-commerce, which you've indicated will likely accelerate even post-COVID. Can you talk about your funding mix of e-commerce transactions, debit versus credit, specifically how you expect that to evolve with economic reopening, would you expect consumers to lean a little bit more heavily on their credit cards as the economy rebounds or should debit likely remain the primary funding of e-commerce transactions?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, David, I think one of the incredible stories of the pandemic was that, debit has become the cash of the e-commerce world and people are doing much more everyday shopping post the pandemic than they did pre the pandemic. The amount of food orders that are placed and takeout orders that are placed, buying normal household staples that might have been, many of them were in person or the vast majority and maybe even some of them were in cash. But we're just seeing the type of transaction that typically goes along with debit is everyday spend. And so what we're seeing as a real structural change is, everyday spend is food from in-person to e-commerce in a big way. I do think though that credit will make a rebound particularly as some of the larger discretionary spending comes back in as the affluent get back into making travel reservations as the online travel agency business starts to grow. I think that there'll be a closing of the gap between debit growth and credit growth. But again, as I said to Darrin, I'm not sure that we get back to those two different card platforms growing at the same level going forward. I think we certainly closed the gap, but I think at least as far out as I'm looking right now, debit will continue to outpace the growth of credit.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks so much. You gave a lot of volume growth, a good detail here. I want to ask maybe differently about credential growth building on the last couple of answers here. It seems like everyone is trying to bank their users by giving them cards and there's a lot of new use cases around virtual cards, so I'm wondering either kind of is either out, if you're thinking about credential growth and you compare that to 2019 or are you thinking about potential for issuance or the pipeline for new cards that might be coming out globally? How does that measure it today? If you want to qualify that, is it much larger than what you would have expected, let's say pre-pandemic?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think the \u2013 first of all, good to hear from you. I think that the pandemic has interrupted a little bit, a real bolstering of credentials that was driven by a combination of marketplace platforms, wallets, Neobanks et cetera. I cited a number of examples in my remarks about the fact that we think that there's upwards of 2 billion more credentials out there from a lot of those types of players and we've seen, but I do it by building partnerships with numbers of Fintechs over the course of the last year or two, a tremendous amount of opportunity to grow these credentials. Either by having these players become issuers and acquirers for us, which is a very big and important trend particularly in developing countries, but also just getting currencies and credentials into some of the existing wallets. But we believe there's an enormous opportunity to grow the number of credentials. And it's something that we're certainly focused on particularly as we talked to the FinTechs, the Wallets, and then the Neobank around the world.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Appreciate that.\nAl Kelly: Thanks Tien-Tsin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hey guys. Great quarter. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit \u2013 you spoke a little bit about Bitcoin earlier and about the used case for Crypto and Bitcoin on cross border transactions. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 more about that and kind of the progress you're making on settlement and stable coins and the steps you've taken on a theory. I think there's a lot of interest out there and what you guys are doing there and how it's progressing? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Well, thanks, Dan. This is an interesting subject. So let me give a little bit of background to talk about where we see the opportunities. So first of all there's two market segments as we see it. No one is, are the Bitcoin to kind of, which are primarily assets held by people, they're not used much in a form of payments. We kind of think of them as the digital gold, and then there are digital currencies including central bank digital currencies and stable coins that are directly backed by existing fiat currencies, and they're definitely emerging as a payment option. And they're running on public blockchain, which is really an essence and additional network, much like an RTP or ACH might be. So our focus is on five different opportunities that we see in this space. And I would say that this is space that we are leaning into in a very, very big way and I think are extremely well positioned. The first opportunity is really at the core of what we do, which is enabling consumers to make a purchase of these currencies or Bitcoins, and we're working hard with Wallets and exchanges to just make sure we're facilitating acceptance of people's ability to use their Visa cards to buy. And besides referenced that in his remarks that we through our some increase, some of them by paying for people making these purchases on Visa card. Secondly, the second opportunity is enabling digital currency cash outs to fiat. So converting a digital currency to a fiat on a Visa credential, which then makes that those funds available for shopping at any one of the 70 million Visa merchants and gives immediate utility to the digital currency and we're the clear leader here. We've got over 35 digital currency platforms and wallets that have chosen to work with us. Coin based crypto.com, block five-fold BitPay are just some examples. And, so that's certainly the second big opportunity. Thirdly is enabling financial institutions and FinTech partners to be able to have a crypto option for their customers. So what we've done in this space is we created APIs that enable financial institution customers to purchase custody, or even trade digital currencies held by anchorage, which is the first federally charted digital asset bank in the U.S. and we've done our first rollout with first Boulevard, which is a digital Neobank focused on building generational wealth for the black community. So that's the third opportunity just helping FIS and FinTechs have this crypto option for their customers. Four point is settlement, which you started to reference, we've upgraded our infrastructure to allow a financial institution to settle with Visa in a digital currency with stable coin, starting with USDC. As you think, today we transact in 160 currencies every day, and we settle every evening in 25 currencies. So we're going to now be able to support digital currencies as an additional settlement currency on our network. And on our end, we're going to settling in USDC is pretty similar to settling in U.S. dollars, but the mechanics of receiving these funds is a bit different and requires just some integration work with several crypto custodian like players like anchorage. And then the fifth area of opportunities just working with central banks. Central bank digital currencies being explored in many nations and I think it could end up being proved to be quite valuable in countries where the infrastructure to distribute cash is either unavailable or limited. And it's one of the factors that hinders these 1.7 billion people I referred to on remarks that are outside the financial mainstream for being in the financial mainstream. So we're talking to central banks about the criticality though of public private partnership, and in particular the criticality of acceptance, because for these central bank digital currencies to have value they're going to have to both these secure in the minds of consumers and that's something we have a long track record with and can help. And then secondly, obviously they have to have some form of utility. So Dan, that's a bit about how we're thinking about crypto with our real focus on digital currencies and those five opportunities.\nDan Dolev: Thank you, Al. Yes, it definitely sounds like you guys are at the forefront of these. So recharge on that. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon guys. Al, I'll use your comment there that debit is becoming the cash of online transactions as an opening task about the online debit competitive environment. Can you just highlight or describe what in your view from Visa's perspective are the advantages of Visa signature debit products over alternatives like account-to-account transfers or pinless debit for online transactions? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Al, I think you're on mute.\nAl Kelly: Sorry, Vasant. I'd better tread a little bit lightly there in light of the DOJ case, so we feel very good about our Visa debit business. We think we've got very, very good capabilities and we believe that the innovations that we have the ability to stand behind customers in disputes and other cases makes our products something that both consumers, merchants and issuers look to true. And we will continue to invest in debit for a product that we hope people use both online and in purchases around the world.\nLisa Ellis: Perfect. Thank you. Thanks for covering.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks and good evening. I in keeping with the kind of structural change being that we all seem to be on tonight. All of these new products, I'm just wondering how the long-term growth rates of the company are going to be sustainable if not accelerating from these kind of levels. You're using these indexes back to 2019, but I'm thinking back even a couple of years, it's a much larger organization. You seem to outline many potential avenues of growth. So I'm wondering, are you at a point now where there is just this pivot in the actual business itself where it constructionally grow faster than they did over the next five to 10 years, then maybe you did over the prior five to 10 years, just given all of the new constituents that you're ultimately servicing these days?\nAl Kelly: Well, Dan, we don't typically get into forecasting out that far, but obviously you hopefully got a good sense in my remarks that we feel like we have three very strong growth drivers and we think each of them has tremendous gas left in the tank. We \u2013 and our consumer payments which has been our staple for years still has huge upside, you're back to Tien-Tsin\u2019s question about credentials growth. We think there is tremendous amount of growth in credentials, we think there is tremendous amount of growth in acceptance footprint. We think there is a tremendous amount of growth when we look at various geographies, and we look at the 1.7 billion people that are outside the financial mainstream. When we look at new flows there is $185 trillion of opportunity there. So we think we've got two big efforts going in both B2B and Visa directed to take advantage of those. And value-added services is relatively new as well, but we've got to \u2013 in terms of how we talk about it, we've had many value-added services or capabilities or solutions for years and they've always contributed well to our revenue, but we were increasingly been focused on them the last two years. And we\u2019re driving a lot more revenue and higher revenue growth than we had in consumer payments through value-added services. And so we think there is still a tremendous amount of upside there, I commented about the fact that we're getting high usage from a lot of our clients, but there is still a huge amount of room to grow with existing \u2013 with clients that are already using value-added services, as well as clients that are not assuming as many of their value-added services. So I look ahead and say the future is very, very bright and adding on top of that a lot of what we've talked about in terms of digitization and the fact that we will come out of this pandemic and we'll start to see travel recover all of those are extremely good trends for us.\nDan Perlin: Excellent. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. My question is on the growth in buy now, pay later. In a very long time horizon, how do you see the NPL coexisting with credit and debit? And I know it\u2019s globally very small right now, but the growth rates are very interesting. Given your partnerships with the NPL providers your installment relations, it\u2019s a growth here as it's growing opportunity from your perspective. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: I don't know where installments is going to end up, but we are attacking that, like we attack crypto and other things and assuming that it's going to be successful and that we want to lean in heavily and be in the middle of it and be a driver of what's going to potentially happen. As you alluded to, we have both strategy working with third-party providers as well as offering our own Visa proprietary platform that would allow issuers to offer their own buy now, pay later capability. And we see it as potentially having a very, very good effect for us. I mean, we could see \u2013 we could work with a whole bunch of options, virtual cards from Visa could be used for repayments, a Visa card on file could be used for repayment, we could explore Visa Direct as a way for installments to be paid off. And in many of those cases, if that's the case, what ends up happening is a single purchase turns into a number of installments. So that one transaction can end up being three to four or five payment transactions, which is certainly very, very good for us. We also think that this is a space where we can sell value-added services, data analytics broadband providers underwriting for example are risk products to help some of the third-party provider. So we\u2019re doing a lot in this space, we're committed to it, there are countries where it has taken off, there is other countries where it's nascent. Again, I can't predict exactly where it's going to land, but we are going to the degree that it takes off, we're going to be there to be part of it.\nHarshita Rawat: Great. Thanks, Al.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJamie Friedman: Al, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the trajectory and the spend per card, I was hoping you could elaborate on that. How you see that evolving, I would think with the recovery of travel, there would be more gas in the tank, there as well? But anything you have on spend per card, would appreciate it. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Well, in my remarks, what I believe I referenced was that in travel, we were seeing higher spend per card versus seeing more people active. And while we haven't been able to study that, what we think is happening is that with \u2013 in places that people can travel, there tend to be also just less restrictions. And that's just opening up more options for people to actually spend. And for instance instead of doing takeout, go to a restaurant and eat a more expensive meal or a nice bottle of wine and et cetera. So I think that right now, what we're seeing is simply higher spend per card in terms of travel. We haven't commented on spend per card beyond that.\nJamie Friedman: Got it. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: One last question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey guys. Thank you. I was just curious if you could share with us some of your underlying assumptions for the different gross revenue lines, if we look at the high teens revenue growth outlook for the June quarter, I know there is a lot of moving parts in the macroenvironment, it just seems like high teens could maybe be conservative based on what you've seen in April so far, even though I know the comps won't be as easy in May in June. So would just love to hear more about how you're thinking about the different pieces of gross revenue, because you outlined the rebate piece pretty clearly.\nVasant Prabhu: On revenues \u2013 high teens is our best estimate. Service revenues as you know were recognizing with a quarter lag. So the service revenues you've seen in the third quarter remember will not reflect the revenues related to the volumes in the third quarter. So the third quarter will have a big ramp in volumes as you're seeing, because we're lapping, but the revenues in service fees will reflect the revenues from the volumes in the second quarter, it's important to remind people of that. In terms of the cross border business, I think you see what the trends are. In terms of transactions, I think the trends are fairly stable at this point quarter-over-quarter. A point to make on incentives, it's important for you to note that last year third quarter was when our incentives were really hit because volumes declined, even though we recognized and received that allowed \u2013 our incentives are recognized in the quarter based on quarter volumes. So this quarter we'll see a big ramp in volumes relative to last year, which are going to cause incentives to go up a lot and be compared to a quarter last year where they went down. The second thing is, we have these incentives tied to certain thresholds being achieved last year because of all the drops, thresholds were not achieved, this year we're resuming the ability, so you get an additional amount of incentive, because clients are going to hit certain thresholds. So you have to factor in the fact that year-over-year incentives growth is going to be quite high in the third quarter and factor in the fact that we won't have the benefit of the volumes in our service fees because of the lag. So you should make sure you have all that as you think about our third quarter revenue growth.\nJamie Friedman: Right, okay. Well, thank you for all the color.\nAl Kelly: And with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. If you have additional questions, you can always reach out to myself or Jennifer and we're happy to help you. So thanks so much and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference, you may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Al Kelly",
            "content": "Jennifer, thank you and congratulations on your second anniversary with Visa. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. I'm going to provide a few quick stats on the quarter and then share my thoughts on what's ahead as the world continues to recover. The recovery is going to take many different shapes and the timing will differ around the world based on vaccination rollouts and the easing of restrictions. But we believe we're at the beginning of the end of the pandemic. And the recovery is well underway, at least in a number of markets. First, Q2 results, revenue declined 2% year-over-year, but would be slightly positive at 20 basis points if service revenues were recognized on current quarter payments volume. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.38, a decrease of 1%. When looking at volumes and transactions growth, keep in mind that we're now lapping the start of the pandemic as growth rates are now less indicative of performance and the business trajectory. We're going to also provide some metrics compared to 2019 on a constant dollar basis. So payments volume grew 11%, improving seven points from Q1 and reached 116% of 2019, which is up three points from Q1. Cross-border volume excluding inter-Europe declined 21%, but improved 12 points from Q1 and it's 75% of 2019 levels, three points better than Q1. Process transactions growth of 8% improved four points from Q1 and represented 116% of 2019, which is consistent with the first quarter. This quarter, we continue to make progress across our three growth levers. First, consumer payments, in Asia-Pacific, we renewed our partnership with Rakuten Card, a subsidiary of Rakuten Group, the largest e-commerce marketplace in Japan. In Korea, Visa won the first hotel chain co-brand in the country with Marriott and Shinhan Card, Korea's largest issuer. In China, we renewed our credit portfolios with CITIC Bank and Agricultural Bank of China, two of the top 10 largest banks in the country. Also on the co-brand front in Brazil, Samsung in partnership with Banco Itau\u0301, we will issue their inaugural co-brand in Latin America with Visa targeting Samsung's 57 million Brazilian users. In Europe, Visa won incremental business with BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium. This expands our relationship to include four million debit cards, in addition to our existing credit relationship. In Switzerland, we gained significant traction in growing Visa Debit. Since this January of 2019, we have signed 13 new debit deals, representing an incremental 2.6 million cards. In new flows, Visa Direct transactions grew almost 60% in the second quarter. We're pleased to have clients going live now with Visa Direct payouts which offers a flexible set of API for Visa partners globally to use a single point of connection for push payments to cards and accounts. MoneyGram, Goldman Sachs' Transaction Banking, Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong and KyckGlobal are among the first to start utilizing Visa Direct payouts for B2C, cross-border P2P and B2b payouts. A few additional highlights on specific Visa Direct use cases include that in the marketplace payouts, Airbnb, which now has four million hosts globally will offer host payouts using Visa Direct in select markets. In cross-border P2P, Remitly, a top digital remittance FinTech has renewed its Visa Direct relationship building upon the past two years of partnership. And Monobank in Ukraine enabled cross-border P2P to their 1.7 million cardholders. In the payroll category, the earned wage access use case continues to grow with 25 earn wage access platforms now offering Visa Direct for fast and convenient access to employee earnings. G2C continues to grow as well, Global Blue, a leading tax-free shopping solutions company covering 52 countries and 35 million tax-free transactions in 2019 is utilizing Visa Direct to distribute tax refund payments across Europe. Separate from Visa Direct, we supported the U.S. government's disbursements of economic impact payments to nearly 13 million Visa prepaid credentials in the U.S. so far this year. And add to our third growth, our value-added services were continuing to see strong adoption. Let me highlight a couple of examples. For CyberSource, Planet, our European acquirer and payment services provider that delivers payment processing and currency conversion solutions to over 600,000 merchants. We'll be partnering with CyberSource to simplify payments across the hospitality, food and beverage and retail sectors. KeyBanc, a top U.S. acquire will begin to offer CyberSource to its merchant clients. And as e-commerce continued to grow Decision Manager, a key risk offering of CyberSource increased transactions over 30% fiscal year-to-date. Our other risk fraud and authentication capabilities grew as well. For example, we've now crossed the two billion token milestone, up from 1.4 billion tokens just in September. One of our key authentication capabilities, CardinalCommerce grew revenue almost 50% year-over-year this quarter by rapidly expanding beyond the U.S. origins. In the next year, we plan to more than double our clients in Europe and Central Europe, Middle East and Africa. So while the pandemic has disrupted the world, it has not changed our strategy. In fact, it has reinforced our belief that our three areas of focus will deliver robust growth for years to come. As we look ahead with COVID recovery underway, a few key important realities, namely the way consumers feel about e-commerce, cash and travel will particularly impact Visa. The pandemic has accelerated e-commerce, global card-not-present credentials, excluding travel grew over 20% in the quarter versus last year. Our growth in card-not-present payment volume, excluding travel has averaged at least 30% in the United States, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, India, and Singapore over the last three quarters. And in global cross-border, excluding into Europe, it's averaged 20% growth. We believe this shift is likely to persist as the convenience of e-commerce is indisputable and its growth continues to be robust even as card-present begins to return. In March in the United States, as some states loosened transactions, card-present as a percentage of 2019 spend improved 11 points versus February. While at the same time card-not-present excluding travel, still expanded eight points. You look at that in Germany \u2013 in Japan, where restrictions were also lifted card-present improved six points and card-not-present excluding travel, still improved four points in that same comparison between March and February. The pandemic has accelerated the digitization of cash. And we see the impact and tap to pay. When we look at cash usage in the last 12 months, just on the Visa brand, such as with ATM withdrawals, we see that global debit cash volumes have decreased by 7%, while debit payments growth \u2013 payments side have grown 16% both on a constant dollar basis. This 20 point GAAP is more than doubled at historic GAAP in growth rates and relatively consistent globally demonstrating cash digitization in both mature and emerging regions. Overall, these tap to pay transactions have grown over 30% year-over-year in March. In Europe, less than a year since contact with limits increased across the region, Visa has seen $1 billion additional touch-free transactions. In the United States, one in 10 face-to-face Visa transactions are now done with a tap, more than a two times increase since the beginning of the pandemic. In New York city, the penetration is nearly 30%, demonstrating the potential of focused issuance and merchant enablement along the transit. In the past three years alone, we've enabled nearly 250 transit systems globally. And we can see based on our research that enabling tap to pay on transit can bring more than a 15% lift in transactions for merchants in the surrounding neighborhoods. The decline in travel is temporary, and we're starting to see some early signs of recovery. Cross-border travel-related spending excluding Intra-Europe, improved from Q1 driven by two factors. First, those who were abroad are spending more likely because of fewer restrictions. This quarter, essentially all the cross-border travel spend improvement was driven by higher spend per card rather than more active cause. Second, we continue to see strain from countries with open-border. For example, U.S. to Mexico volume was almost 20% above 2019 levels for the quarter. We also saw several top corridors between the U.S. and Latin America, improved by more than 10 points through the quarter versus 2019. Travel will certainly take more time to recover than other sectors, but we believe personal travel in particular will come back and that's good for Visa for two primary reasons. One, because the vast majority of the travel we capture on our credentials is consumer. And two, we are the global leader in travel co-brands. With the backdrop of travel, cash digitization and e-commerce, let's briefly explore the future potential of our three growth levers. In consumer payments, in the last two years, we've grown our credentials to $3.6 billion and physical merchant locations to over $70 million, up 7% and 34%, respectively. And remember that our merchant locations only count our partners like PayPal and Square each as one. That said, there's ample opportunity as we focus on specific region's requirements. Looking at regions, even with our leading position in both emerging and developed markets, our market-driven approach to growing credentials is succeeding, and Europe is an excellent example. From 2018 to 2020, we grew active card credentials by 10%. And looking ahead, we have line of sight to more than 25 million additional credentials across 50 clients in the next few years. Let me site a couple of recent partnerships that would show this rapid growth. Since fintech Revolut signed a global agreement in September 2019, selecting these as their lead issuing partner, they've increased the number of cards and payments volume by more than 200% through December 2020. Crypto.com has launched Visa cards in 39 markets across their 10 million user base since 2018. And just this quarter, they find a global growth agreement with us covering 12 markets with plans to expand to even more. There are so many more partners issuing credentials and building acceptance. For example, wallet providers represent the potential for another 2 billion credentials in 70 billion acceptance locations over time, and the pace of growth here is fast. YooMoney in Russia recently signed on to issue Visa credentials, and has achieved more than 1 million credentials in just five months. In fiscal Q2 last year, we announced that stc pay, Saudi Arabia's largest wireless operator with 25 million subscribers plan to embed credentials in their stc wallet \u2013 pay wallet. To-date, more than a 1 million Visa credentials have been issued. Our ongoing partnership with Paytm has enabled us to add more than 250,000 contactless enabled acceptance locations at new to card merchants, while the number of Visa credentials issued by Paytm has more than doubled since September of 2020 reaching a total of 3 million. Around the world, tap to phone has also been a significant acceptance effort. Today more than 35 markets offer it with 13 more being added this year. Wallets and tap to phone are just a couple of next-gen partners and capabilities that we believe will help us bring the $1.7 billion unbanked into the financial mainstream, growing the pie for digital payments. The growth will come from a regional approach and openness to partnering with traditional and new players and by developing new ways to engage the ecosystem all rooted in our strong brand and in technology. In new flows, our success in the United States is a real asset. While they have been impacted by the pandemic, our strategies against $120 trillion opportunity represent near, medium and longer term growth for Visa. In the near-term, we're focused on supporting businesses small and large. To-date, we've helped 12 million micro and small businesses to digitize and grow against our 50 million global goal. And we continue to focus on card-based solutions. Visa has about 20% more commercial issuers today than we did four years ago. In the medium-term, Visa B2B Connect addresses the major pain points with the current top solution in cross-border B2B. And we are continuing to add banks to reach scale. In the longer-term, we're working with key partners to solve the challenges in accounts payable and accounts receivable. For the other $65 trillion of new flows, Visa Direct has five clear competitive advantages that we believe will continue to drive growth. The first one is reach. In Visa Direct, the endpoints are card credentials and bank accounts, and we can reach $5 billion endpoints globally. This is unrivaled by anyone else. Second, operating scale; Visa Direct is built upon the operating scale of VisaNet and leverages its real-time authorization, clearing and settlement capabilities. This means we can deliver industry-leading solutions with low marginal cost. Third is commitment to network strategy. Visa Direct is truly multi-rail, which provides clients flexibility and efficiency. Just in the last year, it has utilized 16 card-based networks, 65 ACM schemes, seven RTP networks and five payment gateways. That is more connections, coverage and capability that we've seen from any other network offerings. Fourth, investments in our capabilities. We have invested in leading technology stack for both payouts and account funding capabilities. For example, our crowdfunding capabilities include unique codes to help clients manage risk, compliance and authorizations for money movement transactions with API to streamline implementation for apps, neobanks, and fintechs. To our knowledge, no one else has this capability. This is commercialization. We've now enabled over 20 use cases with more than 450 new program launches. And we will continue to expand by, one, growing existing use cases like marketplaces and cross-border P2P; two, bringing existing use cases like P2P payroll and earned wage access to other new markets; and three, developing new use cases such as tipping. Visa Direct also brings a network effect in terms of benefits to Visa. For every dollar received on a debit card through Visa Direct, about half of it is then used for debit card purchases. Furthermore card holders who receive payments through Visa Direct can spend up to 50% more than those who do not. So Visa Direct is actually not only helping new flows, but it is helping consumer payments. Lastly, let's turn to value added services, which are being utilized by our clients more and more. In fiscal year 2020, more than 60% of our clients use at least five value added services from Visa and more than 30% of our clients use 10 or more. Our toolbox is large with hands-on consulting, sophisticated and flexible technology platforms, valuable data and insight and card benefits, all which will improve with the recovery. We also have three platform businesses that scale, very profitably, CyberSource, issuer processing, and risk identity and authentication. With the recovery and the continued strength in e-commerce and debit these capabilities are well aligned with trends toward digitization. Let me just speak about CyberSource as an example, our strategy to partner with acquirers creates a leveraged opportunity for future growth, both transaction growth and cross selling value added services. We mentioned last year that Japanese acquire SMCC was going to start offering CyberSource capabilities to its merchant customers. Starting with one nationwide convenience store chain and rapidly expanding to over 30,000 merchants. SMCC is now delivering next generation acquiring solutions to Japanese merchants and CyberSource is processing over half a million e-commerce and in-person transactions per day. With all this opportunity across the three levers, we're investing heavily to drive future growth in several areas, including simple compelling user experiences examples include Tap to Pay, Tap to Phone and quick to that. Capabilities to scale new flows and value-added services examples include new needs and direct use cases and advancing fraud and identity solutions. Specific markets that can benefit from targeted resources, such as Europe and Africa. Innovations in payment \u2013 in the payments ecosystem such as crypto API for banks and digital currency settlement. To close, Visa has weathered the COVID storm, it is emerging from the pandemic even stronger. There's significant opportunity ahead and Visa's existing presence, scale and capabilities, position us well to capture more growth in the future. With that, now let me turn it over to Vasant for more colors on our financials and what we see ahead. Vasant, over to you. Well, I think as we grow out our capabilities, if you see the recovery in the pandemic. I think that these have payouts capability we just put in place, which basically brings together what was earth for. And Visa Direct is a single point of connection is going to facilitate many more use cases and make it very, very easy for, for people to spend money cross-border. And that's kind of the high volume, lower value types of transactions. I think we are continuing to make progress in connecting more banks around the world to B2B Connect. And as we complete the grow out of that network over the next few years, I see us as having great capability to drive cross-border B2B high value, lower volume types of transactions. So I think the combination of our capabilities, what has happened in terms of continued adoption of digitization and the capabilities that we have built in and the use cases that we are working with today and anticipate adding to the mix over time. I think this is going to become an increasingly important and growing part of our business. But \u2013 I will start Darrin. First of all, I think we definitely see millions of new people coming into the e-com shoppers who weren't there before, and I don't think they're going to turn backward at all. So I think that certainly remains obviously as we get out of the pandemic, the stimulus types of money will dry up and that will go away. I think the people being concerned about cash and much more comfortable shopping online, the combination of that will continue. I think that will also see structurally much more Tap to Pay as people find that to be a more helpful way to shop. I think we're seeing governments during this pandemic become bigger clients and they're increasingly interested in showing the way in terms of digitizing more of what they do as a government and I think we'll see more of that activity taking as well. I think that, in general we had before the pandemic a very little separation in growth rate between debit and credit, in any given month or quarter, they would kind of grow within a percentage point of each other. We saw incredible separation during the pandemic as much as 40 points of differential incomes of growth. We're now seeing in this quarter credit come back a bit and then start to drift into a positive territory. But I think that at least for the foreseeable future and maybe for longer, that I think you're going to see debit continue to grow above credit, although as travel comes back that should certainly help bounce back credit buyers, particularly since most of the travel co-brand cards and many of the actual travelers tend to use credit cards. Well, I think the \u2013 first of all, good to hear from you. I think that the pandemic has interrupted a little bit, a real bolstering of credentials that was driven by a combination of marketplace platforms, wallets, Neobanks et cetera. I cited a number of examples in my remarks about the fact that we think that there's upwards of 2 billion more credentials out there from a lot of those types of players and we've seen, but I do it by building partnerships with numbers of Fintechs over the course of the last year or two, a tremendous amount of opportunity to grow these credentials. Either by having these players become issuers and acquirers for us, which is a very big and important trend particularly in developing countries, but also just getting currencies and credentials into some of the existing wallets. But we believe there's an enormous opportunity to grow the number of credentials. And it's something that we're certainly focused on particularly as we talked to the FinTechs, the Wallets, and then the Neobank around the world. Thanks Tien-Tsin. Well, thanks, Dan. This is an interesting subject. So let me give a little bit of background to talk about where we see the opportunities. So first of all there's two market segments as we see it. No one is, are the Bitcoin to kind of, which are primarily assets held by people, they're not used much in a form of payments. We kind of think of them as the digital gold, and then there are digital currencies including central bank digital currencies and stable coins that are directly backed by existing fiat currencies, and they're definitely emerging as a payment option. And they're running on public blockchain, which is really an essence and additional network, much like an RTP or ACH might be. So our focus is on five different opportunities that we see in this space. And I would say that this is space that we are leaning into in a very, very big way and I think are extremely well positioned. The first opportunity is really at the core of what we do, which is enabling consumers to make a purchase of these currencies or Bitcoins, and we're working hard with Wallets and exchanges to just make sure we're facilitating acceptance of people's ability to use their Visa cards to buy. And besides referenced that in his remarks that we through our some increase, some of them by paying for people making these purchases on Visa card. Secondly, the second opportunity is enabling digital currency cash outs to fiat. So converting a digital currency to a fiat on a Visa credential, which then makes that those funds available for shopping at any one of the 70 million Visa merchants and gives immediate utility to the digital currency and we're the clear leader here. We've got over 35 digital currency platforms and wallets that have chosen to work with us. Coin based crypto.com, block five-fold BitPay are just some examples. And, so that's certainly the second big opportunity. Thirdly is enabling financial institutions and FinTech partners to be able to have a crypto option for their customers. So what we've done in this space is we created APIs that enable financial institution customers to purchase custody, or even trade digital currencies held by anchorage, which is the first federally charted digital asset bank in the U.S. and we've done our first rollout with first Boulevard, which is a digital Neobank focused on building generational wealth for the black community. So that's the third opportunity just helping FIS and FinTechs have this crypto option for their customers. Four point is settlement, which you started to reference, we've upgraded our infrastructure to allow a financial institution to settle with Visa in a digital currency with stable coin, starting with USDC. As you think, today we transact in 160 currencies every day, and we settle every evening in 25 currencies. So we're going to now be able to support digital currencies as an additional settlement currency on our network. And on our end, we're going to settling in USDC is pretty similar to settling in U.S. dollars, but the mechanics of receiving these funds is a bit different and requires just some integration work with several crypto custodian like players like anchorage. And then the fifth area of opportunities just working with central banks. Central bank digital currencies being explored in many nations and I think it could end up being proved to be quite valuable in countries where the infrastructure to distribute cash is either unavailable or limited. And it's one of the factors that hinders these 1.7 billion people I referred to on remarks that are outside the financial mainstream for being in the financial mainstream. So we're talking to central banks about the criticality though of public private partnership, and in particular the criticality of acceptance, because for these central bank digital currencies to have value they're going to have to both these secure in the minds of consumers and that's something we have a long track record with and can help. And then secondly, obviously they have to have some form of utility. So Dan, that's a bit about how we're thinking about crypto with our real focus on digital currencies and those five opportunities. Sorry, Vasant. I'd better tread a little bit lightly there in light of the DOJ case, so we feel very good about our Visa debit business. We think we've got very, very good capabilities and we believe that the innovations that we have the ability to stand behind customers in disputes and other cases makes our products something that both consumers, merchants and issuers look to true. And we will continue to invest in debit for a product that we hope people use both online and in purchases around the world. Well, Dan, we don't typically get into forecasting out that far, but obviously you hopefully got a good sense in my remarks that we feel like we have three very strong growth drivers and we think each of them has tremendous gas left in the tank. We \u2013 and our consumer payments which has been our staple for years still has huge upside, you're back to Tien-Tsin's question about credentials growth. We think there is tremendous amount of growth in credentials, we think there is tremendous amount of growth in acceptance footprint. We think there is a tremendous amount of growth when we look at various geographies, and we look at the 1.7 billion people that are outside the financial mainstream. When we look at new flows there is $185 trillion of opportunity there. So we think we've got two big efforts going in both B2B and Visa directed to take advantage of those. And value-added services is relatively new as well, but we've got to \u2013 in terms of how we talk about it, we've had many value-added services or capabilities or solutions for years and they've always contributed well to our revenue, but we were increasingly been focused on them the last two years. And we're driving a lot more revenue and higher revenue growth than we had in consumer payments through value-added services. And so we think there is still a tremendous amount of upside there, I commented about the fact that we're getting high usage from a lot of our clients, but there is still a huge amount of room to grow with existing \u2013 with clients that are already using value-added services, as well as clients that are not assuming as many of their value-added services. So I look ahead and say the future is very, very bright and adding on top of that a lot of what we've talked about in terms of digitization and the fact that we will come out of this pandemic and we'll start to see travel recover all of those are extremely good trends for us. I don't know where installments is going to end up, but we are attacking that, like we attack crypto and other things and assuming that it's going to be successful and that we want to lean in heavily and be in the middle of it and be a driver of what's going to potentially happen. As you alluded to, we have both strategy working with third-party providers as well as offering our own Visa proprietary platform that would allow issuers to offer their own buy now, pay later capability. And we see it as potentially having a very, very good effect for us. I mean, we could see \u2013 we could work with a whole bunch of options, virtual cards from Visa could be used for repayments, a Visa card on file could be used for repayment, we could explore Visa Direct as a way for installments to be paid off. And in many of those cases, if that's the case, what ends up happening is a single purchase turns into a number of installments. So that one transaction can end up being three to four or five payment transactions, which is certainly very, very good for us. We also think that this is a space where we can sell value-added services, data analytics broadband providers underwriting for example are risk products to help some of the third-party provider. So we're doing a lot in this space, we're committed to it, there are countries where it has taken off, there is other countries where it's nascent. Again, I can't predict exactly where it's going to land, but we are going to the degree that it takes off, we're going to be there to be part of it. Well, in my remarks, what I believe I referenced was that in travel, we were seeing higher spend per card versus seeing more people active. And while we haven't been able to study that, what we think is happening is that with \u2013 in places that people can travel, there tend to be also just less restrictions. And that's just opening up more options for people to actually spend. And for instance instead of doing takeout, go to a restaurant and eat a more expensive meal or a nice bottle of wine and et cetera. So I think that right now, what we're seeing is simply higher spend per card in terms of travel. We haven't commented on spend per card beyond that. One last question, Jordan. And with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. If you have additional questions, you can always reach out to myself or Jennifer and we're happy to help you. So thanks so much and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter results were stronger than we expected with net revenue down 2% largely due to improving cross model volumes and lower than expected client incentives. GAAP EPS was flat to last year and non-GAAP EPS declined 1% helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shift increased net revenue by 0.5 point, but lower EPS by 0.5 point due to currency related benefits in the second quarter last year. As Al mentioned, as we lacked the most significant COVID-19 impact, starting in March, 2020, year-over-year growth rates are not the best indicator of the underlying trend. To help you better assess what the magnitude and the trajectory of the recovery so far, they also provided growth rates for key performance metrics relative to fiscal year 2019. In constant dollars, global payments volume year-over-year growth was over 11% fueled by continued strength in debit, as well as improving credit spending. Compared to the corresponding quarter in 2019, the other payments volume was 16% higher, but 3 point acceleration from the first quarter. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 13% or 20% higher than 2019 as Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was 18% and up 24% from 2019 benefiting from economic impact payments in early January and mid-March, as well as the relaxing of COVID-related restriction in many States partially offset by bad weather lowering spending in mid-February. Even after adjusting for economic impact payments, U.S. payments volumes have bounced back to the people that trend line. Debit growth accelerated 13 points to 34%, up 44% from 2019 boosted by the two economic impact payments in this quarter. Credit growth of 2% up 6% from 2019, the credit improvement of health by increases in retail, travel, restaurant and entertainment spending mostly starting in early March as restrictions were relaxed in many States. It is important to note that credit has improved without debits volume pointing to accelerated cash displacement. Card not present volume excluding travel continued to grow over 30% in the quarter and what 55% about 2019 levels primarily driven by retail spend. The most notable sign of a domestic recovery was card presence spent growing 4%, which is up 3% over 2019 and 8 point acceleration from the first quarter led by retail and restaurant spending. Improving card presence spending did not slow e-commerce indicating that e-commerce trend is likely to continue even as card presence spent recovers. International constant dollars payments volume growth was 6% up 9% from 2019 a few regional highlights. CEMEA remains our fastest growing region, growing 26%, up 50% from 2019 levels. The easing of COVID-related restrictions, particularly in the Middle East and Russia, as well as 0:25:52 drove the robust growth. Latin America grew 23%, up 40% from 2019, but consistently strong performance across the region mostly fueled by accelerating e-commerce adoption and usage as well as client wins. Europe grew 2% up 8% from 2019, but decelerated from the last quarter, as many countries put significant COVID restrictions in place, particularly the UK, France, Italy and Germany. In Asia-Pacific, excluding China, second quarter spending grew 4% up 8% from 2019. Performance across the region vary based on the level of COVID restrictions that markets like New Zealand and Singapore growing strongly by markets like Hong Kong and Japan, which had restrictions for most of the quarter the weaker. Global profits transaction growth was 8% up 16% from 2019 lagging volume growth due to higher ticket sizes, particularly in the U.S. and significant code restrictions in Europe. Visa direct continues to perform well. The transaction is growing almost 60% globally this quarter, consistent for the first quarter. The cross model volume recovery continued despite most models remaining completely or partially closed. Constant dollars cross model volume excluding transactions within Europe declined 21% in the second quarter, another 75% of 2019 volumes. Looking at the trajectory versus 2019, this was a feed point improvement from the first quarter. We're seeing the typical seasonal uptake in March and into April, which is a positive sign as we look ahead to the summer. Card not present excluding travel volume continued to be very strong growing 28% year-over-year, up 44% from 2019 driven mostly by retail spending and some benefit from cryptocurrency purchases. Cross model travel-related spend declined 55% year-over-year and more than 39% of 2019 levels. Card presence spend as a percentage of 2019 expanded 3 points versus the first quarter. Some color on the state of cross model travel as we approach the important summer travel season. Travel to and from the U.S. and Latin America is the best performing corridor almost at 90% of 2019 levels by March. Help by U.S. travel, travel into Latin America in general has recovered to over 80% of 2019. Travel between Russia and neighboring countries, as well as travel in and out of the Gulf States has helped CEMEA cross model travel to recover two-thirds of its pre-COVID volume. Cross model travel in and out of Asian countries remains very depressed down almost 75% versus 2019 and flat lining for the past six months. Travel into the U.S. an important corridor for us, but also down 70% versus 2019 in March, but hasn't been recovering slowly. The significant U.S., Canada border restriction travel is still down about 80% relative to 2019 in this corridor. As Europe has increased COVID restrictions, travel in and out of Europe remain hard hit down over 50% versus 2019 in March. Moving now to a quick review of second quarter financial results. Net revenue declined 2% as we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, net revenue growth would have been slightly positive. Service revenues grew 8% helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 11% with strong value-added services growth continuing to be partially offset by the mixed shift away from higher using cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 19% in line with nominal cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe. Other revenues were flat, negatively impacted by low usage of travel related card benefits and client marketing projects pushed to later in the year, while advisory services continued to grow strongly. In total, value added services revenue continue to perform well growing 14% with strong growth in CyberSource security and identity solutions. This quarter, we reclassified some prior period travel related card benefits as value-added services. And as such, our previously reported first quarter revenue growth would have been similar to the second quarter on a comparable basis. Prime incentives were 25.8% of gross revenues, lower than expected due to better than cross-border volume lifting gross revenue and lower Europe and Asia Pacific volumes benefiting client incentives. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 3% in line with expectations. Recorded gain from our equity investments of $156 million. Excluding investment gains non-GAAP non-operating expense was $109 million for the fiscal second quarter, below our expectations, primarily due to benefits, one of which is offset in personnel expenses and the other is related to the completion of certain tax audits. These completed audits also benefited our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate with a non-GAAP tax rate lower than expected at 16.8%. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS was $1.38. We bought 8.3 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $208.51 for $1.7 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share returned approximately $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Turning from the past to the future, I'll start with key business driver trends through April 21. As we look at these weekly trends, keep in mind, three key factors. One, year-over-year growth is napping the 2020 lows in many cases. Two, the timing of Easter is impactful. Three, in the U.S., there are peaks in debit spending when economic impact payments are deposited in people's bank accounts. Through April 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 64% with U.S. debit growing 67% and credit up 61%. Compared to 2019, U.S. payments volume, debit and credit were up 29%, 51% and 9% respectively, all consistent with the March trend. Looking outside the U.S., trends versus 2019 are relatively stable, notable exception is included the UK improving as restrictions relaxed, while India is slowing as restrictions increase. Profits transaction growth was 58% up 16% from 2019, which is consistent with the second quarter. Cross border volume excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis grew 63% and more than 78% of 2019, which is three points above the second quarter and one point above March. As we look ahead, there are several positive cross border travel indicators to highlight. Travel bubbles were being created. Australia, New Zealand is already in place with an immediate and substantial uptick in bookings. Hong Kong, Singapore is starting in late May with more likely. So far, all indications are that some popular tourist destination in Southern Europe will be open for the summer and bookings are trending well. Just this week, it was announced that Europe's border will be open to vaccinated visitors from the U.S. this summer. As a U.S. vaccination program moves along fast, it is possible that travel to and from the U.S. will gather momentum into the summer. Airlines are adding capacity in anticipation. The trajectory of the cross-border travel recovery remains a key metric to watch. We will be monitoring all leading indicators, using a border restriction for the bookings, as well as surveys of consumer intention and we'll update you as we learn more. As the previous quarters, accurate forecasting is difficult in this fast changing environment. Assuming stable to improving trends relative to FY2019 continue, Q3 net revenue growth is expected to be in the high teens. The cross border travel recovery trajectory will be the key factor to watch. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are expected to increase 1 to 1.5 points above the second quarter level as client volumes grow significantly over the last year low. And so this fees are recognized that the quarter lag. We plan to increase operating expenses in the mid-teens in the third quarter, as we step up investments on marketing and key initiatives to capture the significant growth opportunities Al described. We expect non-operating expense to be around $130 million consistent with the second quarter, excluding the non-recurring impacts I mentioned earlier. Our tax rate expectations are 19% to 19.5%, again, consistent with last quarter's expectations before the tax audit completions in the second quarter, I mentioned earlier. In closing, we're stepping up our investments to drive accelerated growth in a post COVID world. A few points to highlight. Our net revenue on profit by the fiscal year 2019 levels, even as the rebound in travel, especially cross-border travel still remains ahead of us after the world is vaccinated and borders reopen. That a significant pent up demand for travel in particular, personal travel. Large swaths of new consumers worldwide have been introduced to the ease, convenience and security that digital payments can offer. This is evidenced by the significant global growth in debit as consumers abandoned cash at an accelerated pace. These are habits we believe will not only stick, but also continue to grow help my initiatives such as staff to pay. Consumers, merchants and governments globally have recognized the value of e-commerce through the pandemic. Governments are upgrading the digital infrastructure, merchants are significantly enhancing their e-commerce capabilities and more consumers are turning to e-commerce across more categories and also cross-border. We expect these trends will only accelerate. But in our new flows business, Visa Direct has continued to grow an extraordinary rates. The pandemic has expanded adoption of use cases in P2P, B2C and G2C, many use cases and markets are just starting to scale. B2B remains a huge opportunity and they're committed to our three-pronged approach to drive growth, card based, cross-border and large enterprise accounts receivables and payables that many capabilities scaling or launching in the near future. Our value-added services have sustained high growth, despite lower usage of travel related services. That is an e-commerce acceleration have driven growth in our debit processing, security and identity and CyberSource businesses and the recovery in travel related services lies ahead. As a result, we see acceleration across all three vectors of growth in consumer payments, new flows and value added services. As Al indicated, we're investing in the strategies and capabilities required to capture these growth opportunities. With that, I'll hand it back to Mike for the Q&A session. A couple of things to add, before we got into the pandemic two-thirds of our cross-border business was travel related, one-third was e-commerce related. Today, in the second quarter two-thirds of our business was cross-border e-commerce, one-third was travel. It says two things, one how much our cross-border e-commerce business has grown and the second, how much recovery is left in our cross-border travel business, because Al has said, most of our cross-border travel is personal travel and there's a substantial amount of personal travel that is going to come back once border is reopened. So the traditional, cross-border e-commerce is an area of significant growth we've seen that as people move online, they become somewhat less sensitive to where the product is shipped from. And there's just a lot more cross-border e-commerce. The other use case that pulls a lot of potential is to the extent that crypto related transactions become significant and they are enabling a vast number of them. One use case that is particularly useful in either stable coin or Bitcoin type of scenarios is cross-border. And that is another new use case that could have a lot of potential in the long-term. Next question please. I mean, a couple of other things to add there is, as you know, debit has become the engine for cash digitization. And what we see in this pandemic, especially as it has gone on for quite a while, is there's often a hurdle in getting people to change habits. So people are used to using cash, getting them to use digital forms of payment, not take some time. This pandemic has called a range of changes in behavior, because there was no choice, whether it's an emerging markets, where there was a greater propensity to use cash or certain cultures, you've heard of Germany and Japan as having been very cash based economies for a very long time or habits in terms of people using cash for certain categories like food and drug that's changing, more people using more cash at the physical point of sale, as Al said, with the cash dirty risk, as well as Tap to Pay are making payments easy at the physical point of sale, we're seeing a substantial shift towards cash digitization, even at the physical point of sale. And then the point you said about smaller and smaller transactions that used to be cash moving digital, again Tap to Pay is a big engine for that and the trajectory of Tap to Pay remains very significant. And we are probably within a year of coming to the point where the U.S. will be in takeoff with on Tap to Pay to which is a very big market. Well, David, I think one of the incredible stories of the pandemic was that, debit has become the cash of the e-commerce world and people are doing much more everyday shopping post the pandemic than they did pre the pandemic. The amount of food orders that are placed and takeout orders that are placed, buying normal household staples that might have been, many of them were in person or the vast majority and maybe even some of them were in cash. But we're just seeing the type of transaction that typically goes along with debit is everyday spend. And so what we're seeing as a real structural change is, everyday spend is food from in-person to e-commerce in a big way. I do think though that credit will make a rebound particularly as some of the larger discretionary spending comes back in as the affluent get back into making travel reservations as the online travel agency business starts to grow. I think that there'll be a closing of the gap between debit growth and credit growth. But again, as I said to Darrin, I'm not sure that we get back to those two different card platforms growing at the same level going forward. I think we certainly closed the gap, but I think at least as far out as I'm looking right now, debit will continue to outpace the growth of credit. Thank you. Al, I think you're on mute. On revenues \u2013 high teens is our best estimate. Service revenues as you know were recognizing with a quarter lag. So the service revenues you've seen in the third quarter remember will not reflect the revenues related to the volumes in the third quarter. So the third quarter will have a big ramp in volumes as you're seeing, because we're lapping, but the revenues in service fees will reflect the revenues from the volumes in the second quarter, it's important to remind people of that. In terms of the cross border business, I think you see what the trends are. In terms of transactions, I think the trends are fairly stable at this point quarter-over-quarter. A point to make on incentives, it's important for you to note that last year third quarter was when our incentives were really hit because volumes declined, even though we recognized and received that allowed \u2013 our incentives are recognized in the quarter based on quarter volumes. So this quarter we'll see a big ramp in volumes relative to last year, which are going to cause incentives to go up a lot and be compared to a quarter last year where they went down. The second thing is, we have these incentives tied to certain thresholds being achieved last year because of all the drops, thresholds were not achieved, this year we're resuming the ability, so you get an additional amount of incentive, because clients are going to hit certain thresholds. So you have to factor in the fact that year-over-year incentives growth is going to be quite high in the third quarter and factor in the fact that we won't have the benefit of the volumes in our service fees because of the lag. So you should make sure you have all that as you think about our third quarter revenue growth."

Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Milotich, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Michelle. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. With that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Even with vaccine proliferation on the horizon, COVID-19 infections really continue to rise causing restrictions to be implemented in many parts of the world. Amidst the pandemic Visa delivered strong financial results in our fiscal first quarter, and our strategy to enable money movement globally remains clear. Pursuing growth through core consumer payments, new flows and value added services. On our call today, let me discuss our Q1 results and that provide detail on our momentum this quarter with clients and the valuable solutions they utilize to drive money movement globally. As a review of Q1 results, recall we're growing over a quarter where no one had ever heard of COVID-19. Payment volume process transactions and cross border volume all improved from Q4. Payments volume improved half a point, processing transaction growth improved a point and cross border volume improved 8 points. Net revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $5.7 billion a year-over-year decrease of 6%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.42 a decrease of 3%. Through our dividends and buybacks we returned $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in Q1. Vasant will cover spending in great detail, so I'll only make a few high level comments on holiday spending. U.S. holiday spending was quite different this year, but had a similar overall growth for the last three years of holiday seasons, led by strong retail growth somewhat offset by travel entertainment and fuel. This year in the U.S., we generally saw a continuation of the trends that have been occurring during COVID, strong debit and e-commerce and weaker credit and card present. Outside the United States, holiday retail spending growth broadly accelerated with growth in Canada, the UK, Brazil, and Australia, all rising by five or more points over last year. Now, let me transition to our progress with clients. We continue to win and renew business as we transfer money movement globally through consumer payments, new flows and value added services. In consumer payments, we continue to focus on digitizing $18 trillion spent in cash and check globally, by working with partners to grow endpoints and deepen customer engagement with innovation. We are growing credentials with traditional issuers FinTechs and wallets. Let me start with North America. We are very pleased to have renewed our long standing partnership with Wells Fargo across consumer debit, credit, small business and commercial for the next six years. The Bank of Montreal, Canada's fourth largest bank and the only top five Canadian bank, not previously issuing with Visa announced a new partnership with us to issue two affluent lifestyle credit card products in the Canadian market. These products are digital first targeting the affluent millennial segment and offer strong rewards and value to cardholders in a differentiated and innovative way. In our Asia-Pacific region, we won the debit business of Malaysia's AmBank after winning the credit business just a quarter ago. Our relationship with LINE Pay also deepen this quarter on two fronts. First in Japan LINE Pay is now issuing a Visa virtual prepaid card, and second Visa secured an exclusive partnership with LINE BK, Thailand's first social banking platform issuance of Visa Debit cards. Within the first month LINE BK issued 180,000 Visa Debit credentials. In Russia YooMoney [ph], one of the country's largest electronic payment services with more than 120,000 merchants worldwide and 40 million endpoints, signed on to issue Visa credentials in their wallet and enable Visa Direct. In Europe, we had several notable wins as we continue to increase our business on the continent. Visa secured a business agreement with Santander Group, becoming the preferred partner in credit and commercial for Santander Bank across seven countries in continental Europe. We also want the prepaid issuance of Moody, the first proximity banking and payments company in Italy, which offers its services through both digital and retail channels with over 45,000 points of sale in rural and urban areas that can reach 20 million customers. \u0130\u015fbank, the largest private bank in Turkey, with 20 million cards have selected Visa for its consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. Last we renewed two portfolios with a leading UK issuer, one for consumer credit, and one for commercial charge card. We also continue to deepen engagement with our partners to find new ways to remove friction and enhance the client experience through innovation. Just yesterday, we announced the global partnership with TransferWise and the first use case of Visa Cloud Connect a new way to securely connect to VisaNet through the cloud. The new platform will enable the expansion of TransferWise as multicurrency debit cards in Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, UK and the U.S. and deliver a range of Financial Services via mobile app to their customers, including currency exchange, and P2P payments, all linked to a Visa card. Pay continues to expand representing almost two thirds of all face to face transactions, excluding the United States. In the United States, we have approximately 300 million contactless cards in place now and have high single digit penetration of face to face transactions. Even at this level, the U.S. is now the fourth largest country in the number of tap to pay transactions. Enablement continues to grow as all 500 of Costco field locations and Chipotle and Nordstrom Stores now accept tap to pay. I'm also pleased to report that the New York City MTA has completed their rollout to all subways and buses. Processing is also a way to bring Visa's innovations to market and we have made significant progress in Latin America this past quarter in Ecuador, Colombia and Peru and now have reached 100% processing penetration in Chile. As I close out the consumer payments section, I wanted to note some progress in India. We continue to grow credentials. The Amazon Pay, ICICI bank cobranded credit card in India has set a country record by issuing over a million cards in just 20 months. On the acceptance front, India now has 6.5 million acceptance points including over 1 million QR points, up almost 20 percentage points from a year ago and 65% of all terminals are tap to pay enabled. The Reserve Bank of India recently raised the contactless limit which will soon cover 90% plus of all transactions in India. Visa has entered into new partnerships with leading acquires such as SBI payments to large acceptance solutions, such as tap the phone and contactless, and Visa is partnering with the largest acquire in India HDFC Bank, in the largest scale up of Smart Hub and absolution bundling payments banking and value added services to help small merchants grow their businesses. We're also contributing to India's Payment Infrastructure Development Fund to encourage growth of physical and digital acceptance in underpenetrated geographies by adding 1 million points of sale and 2 million QR points per year over the next three years. All of these efforts build on our leading credit and debit market share in India. Now on to the second level, last level of growth new flows, which represents 185 trillion in opportunity. We're pursuing this opportunity with our traditional commercial card solutions as well as newer capabilities like Visa Direct and Visa B2B CONNECT. While we're making progress across all new flows, I'll highlight a few advancements from this quarter. In B2C, gig economy payouts and earned wage access continue to grow meaningfully in the wake of COVID. This quarter with DoorDash, we launched the Dasher direct business prepaid card in the U.S., offering the over 1 million dashers on the DoorDash platform access to daily deposits of earned wages and rich card benefits. In Canada, Skip The Dishes, the country's largest food delivery network rolled out their visa direct enabled courier payouts called fast cash. P2P, which represents 20 trillion of the flows was Visa Direct first use case and continues to grow substantially. A key area of future growth is cross border P2P or remittance. Four of the top five global money transfer operators were on boarded in fiscal year '20 TransferWise, Western Union, Remitly and MoneyGram, which noted a 500% increase year-over-year in real time transfers in December alone. Our efforts to expand remittance also extends to FinTechs and banks who can enable this capability. ZPay a fast growing African FinTech will use Visa Direct to allow Africans to send money across European and North American corridors, and soon will expand to all major corridors globally. TransferGo, a global money transfer company that supports migrant workers to send money back to their relatives, without paying unnecessary bank fees has enabled Visa Direct in 55 markets that has the potential to expand to a total of 178 countries in the future, with its upcoming additions such as the UK, Italy and Nigeria. Across the globe, in the first quarter Visa Direct transactions grew almost 60%. Now onto B2B, the cross-border Goldman Sachs transaction banking recently signed on to employ Visa B2B Connect for cross-border B2B money movement, offering its corporate clients the ability to transact in over 80 markets globally. We are very pleased that our partnership with Goldman continues to deepen on multiple fronts. In the virtual card based business, we've expanded our relationship with UK based Conformer Pay to launch Visa commercial pay, which has three offerings, a mobile app, enabling virtual card issuance and management for business incidentals, two, a solution to manage business travel spend with enhanced data, and three, an integrated payables platform that can seamlessly send payments to suppliers. Barclays has already launched this functionality for their commercial clients. Currently, essentially, all of these new flows are transacted in traditional Fiat currencies. But there's a growing interest in digital currencies. And I wanted to take a minute to talk about how Visa thinks about crypto in general and our approach. In this space, we see ways that we can add differentiated value to the ecosystem, and we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help make crypto currencies more safe, useful and applicable for payments through our global presence, our partnership approach and our trusted brand. We think of the crypto market in two segments. First, there are crypto currencies that represent new assets, such as Bitcoin. Secondary, digital currencies or stable coins that are directly backed by existing Fiat currencies. We see all currencies in that first segment as digital gold. They are predominantly held as assets that are not used as a form of payment in a significant way at this point. Our strategy here is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials, or to cash out onto a Visa credential to make a Fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa is accepted globally. This is similar to our approach to connect close with wallets such as, LINE Pay and Paytm. For the second segment, Fiat backed digital currencies, including stable coins and central bank digital currencies, these are an emerging payments innovation that could have the potential to be used for global commerce, much like any other fiat currency. We think of digital currencies running on public block chains as additional networks, just like RTP or ACH networks. So we see them as part of our network of network strategy. Across both of these segments, we are the clear leader in this space. Today, 35 of the leading digital currency platforms and wallets have already chosen to issue Visa, including Coinbase, crypto.com, BlockFi, Ford and Bitpanda. These wallet relationships represent the potential for more than 50 million Visa credentials. The next leading network has a fraction of that. And it goes without saying to the extent a specific digital currency becomes a recognized means of exchange, there's no reason why we cannot add it to our network, which already supports over 160 currencies today. Let me now turn to our third growth lever, value added services. Here we saw revenue grow at 19% in Q1, and let me name a few services with notable progress this quarter. As e-commerce explodes, interest in CyberSource remains strong for merchants, as well as from FinTechs and acquirers looking to leverage our capabilities to offer to their clients. This quarter, two additional leading acquirers signed on to use CyberSource, K Bank in Thailand and NAB in Australia. As one of the largest debit and prepaid issuer processes we've been looking to expand Visa DPF globally, in that vein, we are pleased to share that we're bringing our Visa debit processing system to Europe. DKB, our largest issuing bank in Germany has chosen DPF as its debit processor and recently processed Visa's inaugural European DPF transaction via their platform. DKB will also be able to take advantage of nearly 20 value added services through this connection. We have believed for years that installments represent an important opportunity in payments. To enable this capability, we offer our own network solution for issuers, merchants and FinTechs installment providers to use directly or also work with many. And we also work with many installment providers to develop new solutions. This quarter we had updates on both fronts. We signed a global deal with Afterpay, extending our U.S. relationship to an additional seven countries, where Afterpay will use Visa technology to accelerate its global expansion. In addition, Visa and Afterpay will test and collaborate on the application of new technologies, like tokenization and Visa direct. We announced in July that Commerce Bank in the United States was piloting the network solution, and it is now launched with about 300,000 customers live. Visa also signed Scotiabank as the first Canadian bank to launch a post purchase installment pilot with employees in December, with a full market rollout slated for mid-2021. All of these growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value added services are driven by our network of network strategy, which is enabling all forms of payment, utilizing all networks and providing the value added services you would expect from Visa as we enable money movement. In closing, a few points, domestic volumes driven by debit and e-commerce are really holding up well, holiday spending will different in terms of categories and timing was quite good. Q1 overall was a very solid quarter and positive momentum continued, albeit we are still impacted by COVID-19. We are continuing to work very hard to balance expense management and recognition of the short term realities and investing in an exciting set of growth opportunities, as we always manage the business for the long-term. We continue to be focused on our three growth levers, all of which are supported by our network of network. And lastly, we are hopeful that as vaccines roll out and become more readily available, lockdowns, travel restrictions and capacity constraints will be lessened or eliminated, enabling travel, entertainment and other commerce to grow. With that over to Vasant, for more color on our volumes and our financials.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. During our fiscal first quarter last year, COVID-19 was not yet a word in the English language. This will be the last quarter where our performance is compared to a quarter of with no COVID impact whatsoever. As such, our results this quarter provide a clear picture of the state of the recovery. Overall, the quarter was stronger than we expected, but net revenue down 6%, largely due to the cross-border business. EPS declined only 3% helped by lower expenses and a lower tax rate. Exchange rates shifts with the last year, increased reported net revenue growth by less than half a point and EPS growth by less than one point. As we approach the first anniversary of the pandemic, where do we stand across our key business drivers, relative to where we might have been had the pandemic never happened? Global payments volume is 4 to 5 points short of where we might have been. Debit has outperformed helped by accelerated cash displacement and credit is still a drag. In the U.S., we are actually back to our pre-pandemic growth trajectory, with debit significantly ahead of setting credit under performance. As you know, where we are well behind is in our cross-border business. In the first quarter of fiscal '21 our cross border volumes were almost 40% lower, excluding Intra-Europe volumes than they might have been had the pandemic never happened, largely due to travel. Cross border travel volume, both card present and card not present is still down almost 70% relative to where it might have been at this point. Let's start with a review of the key business drivers in the fiscal first quarter. Global payments volume and transaction growth rates were modestly better than the prior quarter. The cross model volume recovery continued even as most borders remain completely or partially closed. The trajectory of the domestic spending recovery varies across the globe. Some regions and countries are recovering fast, others are holding steady, while some have slowed in recent weeks as a result of new restrictions. What remains consistent globally is very strong debit and e-commerce spending, which is partially offset by weaker credit and in store spending. Although, constant dollar cross border volume, excluding transactions within Europe is still down 33%, there was an 8 point improvement from last quarter. Payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew 4.5%, debit was up 17%, 3 percentage points lower than last quarter, while credit declined 6%, up 3 percentage points from Q4. Growth excluding China was 7%, up almost a point, as Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual branded card conversions, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was 8%, up half a point from last quarter. Debit growth remained strong at 21%, debit growth was 3 points lower than the fourth quarter, largely driven by a step down in unemployment benefits distributed via Visa prepaid cards. Credit spending declined 3% year-over-year, a 4 point improvement versus last quarter, driven by an acceleration in retail spending and some recovery in travel and restaurants spending. Card not present volume excluding travel continued to grow over 30% in the quarter, primarily driven by retail spending. The decline in card present spending was consistent with last quarter. However, performance did deteriorate through the quarter as rising COVID cases led to further government imposed restrictions in several states and cities. Card present spending slowdowns the most significant in the restaurant segment, as well as during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend across most segments. Across spend categories, growth was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. Categories which have been growing above their pre-COVID levels have remained elevated, including food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. For categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic including travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants spending remain depressed, with year-over-year declines consistent with last quarter. International payments volume grew 2% in Q1, while 6%, excluding China, both of which are up one point versus last quarter. A few regional highlights. EMEA remains our best performing region, growing 19% in constant dollars in the quarter, and more than 4 point improvement over Q4. The easing of COVID-related restrictions particularly in the Middle East, and clients win drove the robust growth. Latin America grew 16% in constant dollars, a nearly 10-point acceleration from last quarter. This growth acceleration is fueled by limited COVID-related restrictions in most countries, elevated e-commerce spending compared to other regions, and growing our market share with client wins in a few of the larger countries. Europe grew 5% in constant dollars, but 4 point slowdown versus last quarter. This deceleration was driven partially by renewed restrictions in the second half of the quarter due to rapidly rising COVID infection rates, particularly in the UK, France, Italy and Germany. And also, as you may remember, growth in Europe last quarter benefited from a non-recurring event in the UK related to purchases of higher interest bearing savings funds. Asia Pacific declined 8% in constant dollars, excluding China, Q1 spending was flat, a 4 point improvement since last quarter. There continue to be more COVID-related restrictions in effect across Asia than other parts of the world, however, several larger markets, such as New Zealand, Australia, Korea and Japan have returned to growth. Process transactions growth was 4%, up one point from last quarter. Growth accelerated faster than payments volume as transaction sizes continue to normalize ex Europe. Increased COVID-related restrictions in Europe are driving higher average ticket sizes, causing transactions growth to slow. Latin America is benefiting from processing wins in several countries, including Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Chile. Visa Direct continues to perform very well, the transaction is growing almost 60% globally this quarter. Growth remains strong in every region as we continue to launch new use cases, further penetrate existing use cases such as earned wage access and cross-border remittance, and expand existing use cases to new geographies. Constant dollar cross border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, declined 33% in Q1, an 8 point improvement from the last quarter. Travel related spend declined 64%, but improved 6 points versus the fourth quarter. Card not present non-travel growth was 20%, up 3 points fueled by strong retail spending in November and December. Constant dollar cross-border volume, including transactions within Europe, declined 21% in the quarter. Although cross-border travel performance improved steadily through the quarter, the travel improvement was concentrated in only a few markets, where borders are open. Travel from the U.S. to several countries in Latin America remains strong, including Mexico and the Caribbean. The UAE has been open to travelers attracting people from Europe, Russia and other Gulf countries. Also, travel across countries within the former Soviet Union has been growing. Unfortunately, the majority of borders remain closed or impose significant requirements on international travelers. The World Tourism Organization reported in December that out of 217 countries, 118 countries, or 54%, still have completely or partially closed their borders to foreign visitors, of the remaining 99 countries, the majority are mandating COVID tests with quarantines. Very few countries have no COVID restrictions. Significant obstacles in crossing borders remain the single most important factor, driving the slow recovery of cross-border travel. A quick review of first quarter financial results. Net revenue declined 6% better than our expectations, primarily due to stronger than expected cross-border volumes and lower client incentives. Value added services continue to perform well, growing 19%. It's important to note that had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, it would have had minimal impact on our Q1 net revenue growth, because payment volume growth was very similar across both quarters. Service revenues grew 5%, roughly in line with nominal payments volume growth last quarter. Data processing grew 6% with high teens, value added services growth continuing to be partially offset by the mix shift away from higher yielding cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 28%, 4 points better than cross-border volumes, excluding Intra-Europe due to favorable country mix and currency volatility benefits. Other revenues grew 5%, led by value added services, but continue to be negatively impacted by declines in the usage of travel related card benefits. Client incentives were 24.6% of gross revenues, approximately one point lower than expected. This was driven by three factors; first, a few large deals expected to be signed in the first quarter were delayed to the second quarter. Second, cross-border volume was better than we expected, particularly in the month of December. As we have said in the past, client incentives are mostly tied to payments volumes. So outperformance in high yielding cross-border volume lowers our incentives as a percent of gross revenues. And third, payments volume growth only improved a half point versus last quarter, as such there was minimal impact on current quarter client incentives from current quarter volume. On the operating expense front, we continue to benefit from actions we implemented last spring. Our headcount is lower, our spending on external services has been scaled back, travel continues to be very restricted and some marketing spend has been curtailed. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses declined 10%, which is better than expected partly due to timing shifts in client co-marketing, as well as certain product and technology investments to later in the year. Non-GAAP non-operating expense was $112 million for the fiscal quarter. This was over $30 million lower than expected due to two non-recurring items. First investment income tax deferred compensation was higher, this is offset in personnel costs and therefore income neutral. And second, an interest expense reserve was released, due to the conclusion of certain tax audits. The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected at 16.6%. During the quarter, the conclusion of tax audits in certain jurisdictions resulted in an $81 million benefit. In addition to this specific benefit, our tax rate is typically lower in the first quarter due to the impact of employee equity vesting. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS was $1.42, a decrease of 3%. We bought 8.7 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $202.30 for $1.8 billion this quarter. Our board has authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program, bringing total funds available for repurchases to over $11 billion. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned approximately $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. In December, we repaid $3 billion of debt upon maturity of senior notes issued five years ago. Moving on to some perspective on the second fiscal quarter, starting with business driver trends through January 21. Through January 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 12%, with us debit growing 30% and credit declining 6%. Debit growth is 10 points higher than the November, December run rate, fueled by government stimulus payments distributed right around January 1. Weekly growth trends show a sharp step up in growth in the first week of January and a step down in week three. January credit growth has slowed 3 points since December, which is more in line with the November trend. While U.S. payments volume growth has accelerated, there are many countries where constant dollar growth is slowing due to increased restrictions as COVID infections rise. In Asia-Pacific, Japan, Australia, India and Singapore payments volume growth has slowed 4 to 5 points versus December. In Europe, countries such as the UK, Italy, Denmark, and Germany all have at least 10 points slower growth in January. So far, growth rates are relatively steady in both EMEA and Latin America. Through January 21, processed transactions growth remained at 4% with acceleration in the U.S. offset by slowing growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Cross border volume excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis declined 33% in line with the first quarter, but below the trends we saw in December. In a fast changing environment, accurate forecasting remains difficult. How long will elevated spending driven by stimulus payments last? How long will stepped up restrictions and lockdowns persist? How will these two countervailing trends balance out country by country? Will cross border travel sustain the slow recovery even if some new restrictions go into place? These are just some of the uncertainties as we look ahead to the next three months. Based on the trends to this point, our best sense is that the second quarter gross revenue growth rate will recover to be flattish with last year, with most of the improvement driven by international revenues. Growth in the other revenue lines is expected to have a small uptick due to easier year-over-year comparisons in the second half of March. First quarter client incentives were a point below our expectations. Second quarter client incentives could be a point above the high end of the 25.5% to 26.5% range, we expect for the year. This would put first half incentives right in the middle of the range. There are several reasons for this type of client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the second quarter, even with continued improvement in cross border. First, as I mentioned earlier, a few large deals moved from the first to the second quarter one of which was Wells Fargo was signed in January as Al noted. Second, as we told you in October, many clients did not need certain volume thresholds in calendar year 2020, and as such did not earn corresponding incentives. As volume recovers in 2021, we expect clients will hit growth thresholds and earn these incentives. We accrue incentives accordingly, starting with the first quarter of the new calendar year. This causes a larger increase unique to the year of the recovery. And third, the impact of renewals we had already expected in the second quarter. Due to the step up in client incentives as a percent of gross revenue, the net revenue decline in the second quarter is expected to be comparable to the decline we reported in the first quarter, even as the growth, revenue growth rate continues to recover. Exchange rate shifts could benefit second quarter net revenue growth by less than a point. We expect operating expenses to grow in the low to mid-single digits in the second quarter, as we begin to lap the expense reductions implemented last year. We still plan to grow expenses in the double digits in the second half as we step up investments on three key growth initiatives in anticipation of a return to normal fee by the end of fiscal 2021. Non-operating expense should be $145 million, approximately, which is similar to the first quarter, if you exclude the two nonrecurring items I mentioned earlier. There is no change in our prior tax rate expectations. It is still too early to predict what impact the U.S. elections will have on our taxes. As always, we will provide updates as the year progresses. In summary, as you can see, our business remains resilient. Both debit and e-commerce growth are sustaining well above pre-COVID levels, as the accelerated shift to digital payments becomes a habit. Cross border growth is poised to recover sharply, once vaccines facilitate reopening of borders, and we lap last year steep declines. Our new flows and value added services businesses have continued to grow robustly through the worst of the pandemic. As Al indicated, we have stayed focused on our long-term growth initiatives, and will be stepping up the level of investment in the second half in anticipation of a post-COVID world with accelerating growth. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: We're now ready to take questions, Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead, sir.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask, strategically, how you're thinking about going forward post the Plaid deal that you decided to turn away from. And I guess, I'm looking for just comments of how you feel your relationships are with regulators and what makes sense in the future for future technology acquisitions, et cetera? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Well, thanks, James. Well, first of all, I mean, that's the last part of the question. This was a single lawsuit brought by a single regulator about one specific M&A transaction. So I don't believe that this portends anything about the future and our ability to continue to try to acquire companies. As we said a couple weeks ago, we ended up making the decision that this was just going to go on for too long. And we all know that the payments marketplace is moving with great speed on so many fronts. And the idea that we would tie ourselves up on this transaction, and frankly, the plan would tie themselves up through a long-term litigation that could go all the way through and appeal in and of itself which is not appealing to us, in terms of all the other things that we thought, we could be investing in and spending management time on and spending our dollars on. We're continuing to forge down a path of making sure that we are a real player in this space of open banking, and believe that we have a lot of the assets already. What Plaid was going to do was going to get us into specifically into the data extraction type of business, which would have added to our network of networks, but it doesn't in and of itself prevent us from doing more going forward. We also still have the ability in that space to partner with Plaid, we have the ability to partner with other players around the world. In many cases, that might give us the ability to partner with players that understand the nuances of specific markets in which they do work.  We'll continue to look to make sure that we to the degree that any use cases are going to form via the most -- the use case that probably would have the most chance of stepping out and being something that takes has some legs behind it would be account to account. And I think we're very well positioned there, we're positioned well to make sure that we can provide payments capabilities for the various FinTechs that we are doing business with today. And we have the ability to continue to sell value added services to all those players. So I think that ultimately, as we have in the past, we will invest to grow internally, we will look to partner and we will look to buy. And it will be a combination of capabilities and approaches that will allow us to continue to be a player in this space.\nJames Faucette: That's great context, Al. And just quick operational follow up. Obviously, you've taken expenses out of the cost base in the last year as a result of the pandemic. How should we think about what components of that cost base are likely to flow back in as things return to normal versus what could be more permanent changes?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think when you look at our cost base, the big parts of our cost base are people marketing and technology. And we think we have the Tokyo Olympics coming up in the summer months. I mean, there's some people that might be in some peril at the moment is going forward. We have marketing to really relatively modest levels in this past quarter. But I would certainly expect us to be driving marketing up. Basically, when we go to market, in our business it's a combination of putting people resources, our technology resources and our marketing muscle behind whatever we're doing. And so those are the areas that I would expect to see us grow going forward. And then of course, I mean, we really have dramatically curtailed TD and professional services. And I think that to the degree that later in the year, we begin to get some people back to offices, and we begin to see some people get back on airplanes, we'll see some modest increases in those expenses, those expense areas. So we've been really careful about both our people level spending in our technology level spending and our marketing level spending. And I think as conditions warrant, we'll be dialing those up. Vasant gave you some insight into where we think expenses are going to be in the second half. And we think there's some really good opportunities. And I want to make sure that if, in fact as we believe that will be in some form or normalcy by the end of this fiscal year, we want to make sure that we have good momentum going into fiscal '22.\nJames Faucette: Great color. Al, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks so much. I appreciate all the color on the volume trends. I want to ask about value added services that was up in the high teens. Curious how sustainable that is. And if that growth could actually step up with the eventual recovery in volume, just trying to understand how procyclical or not that business is?\nAl Kelly: Tien-Tsin, thank you. I guess a little bit of color for everybody, about two-thirds of our value added services are in data processing and they basically are transaction based revenue streams. And, that CyberSource that our risk and identity products that DPS and all of those will tend to continue to produce very good volumes and they'll move with transactions as transactions move. About a third of our value added services is split between our services revenue, which tends to be card benefits that are offered as a package. And then in other revenue, we have volumes that are -- I'm sorry, we have services not tied to volumes, things like consulting or practice and travel related card benefits that obviously have been down. So I think as travel would be to come back at some point that obviously would help that volume. So with that color we saw our, obviously in a world where e-commerce and omni commerce are becoming a big deal, cyber volume was very, very good and good revenue. We continue to have more and more customers engage with us on risk and identity services. And as I said earlier, now we're excited about the fact that we're going to take our debit processing system beyond the United States, and we've now got it, starting to use it in Europe. I think that that gives us a good platform for growth going forward as well.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Very good. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thanks, Tien-Tsin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Good evening. Al and Vasant, in terms of the cross border improvement, I thought that was actually pretty decent Q-over-Q improvement on the growth rate. Did the U.S. to lock in, instead of remain strong, but did it improve without a factor in the overall improve year-over-year?\nAl Kelly: Don, in Latin America, it was really U.S. to Mexico and U.S. to the Caribbean, that drove Dubai and North America. Beyond that, Dubai opened a bit, now Dubai is having a little bit of resurgence and just went back into some restrictions in earlier this week. But Dubai has been open, and there's been a decent amount of travel into the Middle East. There's been a fair little bit of an opening amongst the countries in the former Soviet Union, and then there's been some improvement or some movement in intra-travel within South America. So those are kind of the spots where we've seen the improvements in cross border. Most of the rest of the corridors around the world continue to be as Vasant mentioned in his remarks, either closed or subject to like, really tough restrictions that make it very difficult for company to take on traveling.\nDon Fandetti: And Al, as you look at these numbers, are you still feeling like the data point suggests there's a fair amount of pent up demand when things do open up?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think, Don, as it relates to consumer travel, which is the vast majority of our payment volume in the travel sector over the years, I do think we're going to see some opening for sure. I think there's a lot of pent up demand. I mean, there's a lot of people who haven't seen family, parents who haven't seen grandchildren, children who haven't seen parents, and are going to want to jump on planes. I also think a lot of people are stir crazy and want to get out. And then you've got people who are true global citizens who\u2019re knocking things off their to-do list and in terms of places they want to go and things in places they want to see. So I think consumer travel at the right time, but we need to see these restrictions be mitigated or lessened in pretty big way. I think it's going to come back quite strongly. I think it's going to take more time to see business travel come back. And frankly, it might take years for business travel to return to what it is. I mean, we've all gotten accustomed to talking on video conferences, et cetera. And I think we all probably realize that there are trips that we took are authorized in the past that when we look back on it today, in the light of talking on video, we say why did we send somebody to that meeting for 1.5 hour presentation that they could have just as well done on video. So that's the way I think about it going forward, Don.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Good afternoon. Thank you. A follow-up question from me on Visa Direct, which will highlight it again grew almost 60% in the quarter. At your Investor Day last February, you had sized to the B2C, G2C and P2P markets about 60 trillion in total payment volume. And I believe Visa Direct did about 350 billion last year, so about 0.5% of that. Can you talk about over time, as you're seeing Visa Direct develop, how much of those markets do you think is potentially addressable by Visa Direct? And any hint of the monetization level that we should be thinking about something similar to domestic debit or different from that. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Lisa, thank you for the question. Visa Direct has the ability to grow on a number of vectors. The two that, I think are the most obvious is, in terms of, well, three, I'd say; continued penetration of current use cases, new use cases that had developed, and then thirdly, geographic expansion. And this is a business that we're still building out. There's still lot to do in all three of those categories. And to an earlier question, I think Don asked, we're going to continue to invest in that area and look at these markets where we haven't even really laid any track for Visa Direct is use cases where we haven't laid any track. And our plan is to continue to do that. If we look at the very first Visa Direct use case, which continues to grow substantially P2P payments, there's still lots to do, both in domestic P2P payments, but we think a key future growth area is in cross-border P2P and remittance and we're beginning to take steps there to enable that. And I mentioned in my remarks the fact that we've got relationships with four of the five top global money transfer operators. And that's helping us quite a bit. I think earn ways to access, really continues to be a real opportunity, I touched a little bit on a few of those cases, but there's still lots of geographies and lots of organizations that we have the ability to penetrate, to grow that. And then you've got all these, B2C use cases, things like food and grocery delivery and online gaming and insurance claim payouts. So, all of those are, I would say in the early innings of a baseball game in terms of our ability to continue to make progress and drive those. So I continue to believe that this platform off which we can generate dozens and dozens of use cases, both will for quite some time be really important to us from a growth perspective.\nLisa Ellis: Very exciting. Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Thank you, Lisa.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Chris Brendler with Seaport Global. You may go ahead.\nChris Brendler: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Al, it sounds -- I'd love to hear your thoughts on the buy now pay later phenomenon that seems to be gathering steam. And I know you have a solution there. And how big do you think that solution could become and a very competitive threat from consumers choosing a different payment option at checkout when they're checking online?\nAl Kelly: Well, Chris, this is a pretty interesting space, and I think we're in the early days in most markets. There's a number of different models. I think I said before, I think Vasant said before, we're not in the business of picking winners and losers. We see our job as enablement, no matter what the model is. But, in some cases, the player is the actual lender, in some cases, they're sourcing a lender, in some cases, the installments are very short term, weeks at a time, in some cases they're long-term. Some providers only do installment, some allow multiple payment options, pay now, pay on delivery, pay off on various numbers of installments. And then obviously where it gets exciting for us, multiple ways to pay off installments, virtual cards, debit cards, ACH. And, it's also a payment model today that's heavily funded by the merchant. Our strategy, Chris, is to be brought to play with multiple third party providers and offer our Visa platform to enable issuers to offer pay now, buy now, pay now, pay later capability. And we seek to work with all these options. And obviously, what we want to do is get virtual cards from Visa in place as one option for repayment. We also want to put Visa cards on file as another option. And I would remind you that these installments do break at its core, these installments break a transaction or a purchase into three or four or five payment transactions, which is good for us, because it gives us more transactions on which to earn fees.\nChris Brendler: That's great. One quick follow if I may. In places like Sweden, where it's become the dominant tender share, did it actually -- do you actually see an impact on volume or enough people choosing your cards that this will actually impact the volume and given how much growth in buy now pay later is taking place in that area?\nAl Kelly: So there is a few countries you mentioned, Sweden, another one is Australia. There's not many, there's two countries where this has really taken off. And I think it certainly has had some impact on banks in those markets. But in many cases, because of the kind of pay off capabilities, I talked about card on file, virtual cards and et cetera, a lot of that buys coming back to us in the form of repayments.\nChris Brendler: That's awesome. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe. You may go ahead, sir.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. Just one quick one for Vasant and then Al, just a more structural. And so I'll just if I can just do them all, both at once. So when we looked at the incentive side, I know you guys said that it was timing related, it came in below the range this quarter, but it'll come in high that you said higher than the range or potentially could be for the next quarter. When we think about when you first guided to the 25, 25.5 range, it was embedding cross border activity similar to the September quarter, which was ended up being better. So I guess I just want to know, you're assuming now some deterioration or more conservatism in cross border before maybe gets better later in the year. And then I guess Al, maybe I could just squeeze in structurally again, things like debit are better seeming to be somewhat sustainable. It's not all just people using more non-discretionary. I'm curious what you would identify now after having seen about a year of the pandemic, where are the top two or three items, you think structurally are impacting your business longer term and here to stay potentially?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, just taking the incentives question, we try to give you a best sense of a range. And at this point, the visibility is greatest in the first half, since we're halfway through it and we think we'll be right in the middle of the range. There are many variables here that go into it and a time like this, when things are moving around quite a bit, certainly cross border doing better helps. Renewals will have an impact sometimes they happen when we expect sometimes they don't. There's also the year-over-year improvement that our clients have. As you know, last year, many clients because of the pandemic didn't hit certain thresholds, this year things are recovering faster. There could be, they will be thing they'll all make that threshold and more; that has a year-over-year impact, and it varies by client. So there's a bunch of these things moving around at the same time. And the good news is, you know, we think we're right in the middle of the range, and we'll give you more as we go through the year.\nAl Kelly: Darrin on your second question, first of all, there's many reasons why debit has been a star here, not that you've got the stimulus payments that are on prepaid cards, we count prepaid in our debit business. As e-commerce is moved into more everyday categories, people are using debit, people are more comfortable in tough situations, tough times to use money they have versus borrow money that they don't have. But I think when I looked ahead structurally, to answer your question, look I think e-commerce adaption is probably accelerated three to five years in the last year. And I don't think that's going backward. I think that people who have gotten used to shopping on the phone or their tablet or their computer are going to continue to do that. I think the other thing that I look at structurally that's really exciting is there's great opportunity to continue to grow both sides of this two sided market of buyers and sellers. Wallet proliferation is continuing and we're working really hard to get credentials in wallets, which adds to these wallets in essence are becoming issuers and that helps on generate more buyers. And the cost of acceptance is going down around the world, as more and more players are getting into it. And that's going to grow the number of sellers on our network and that network grows, I think that's going to be a really positive thing for us. Obviously, e-commerce comes with the issue of no cash. But I think that people are getting increasingly concerned about cash and the combination of tap to pay in the physical world where the card doesn't need to leave your hands to go to anybody else in order to transact. And the fact that e-commerce doesn't free cash is not an option. Those are all of those things I think structurally are very positive for us. The thing on the flip side, I also I mentioned that while business travel is a small piece of our overall travel, that will be one of the things that will be a little bit slower to come back and maybe never back at the level it was pre-COVID-19.\nDarrin Peller: That\u2019s really helpful, guys. Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Vasant, I wanted to ask about cross-border as that comes back especially likely in this second half of this calendar year. How do we think about the higher yields and profitability? How that will flow to the bottom line versus additional investments you talk about? What would necessarily be those investments where they offset completely the benefit we'll see from that cross border?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, I mean, there's no question cross-border coming back has a meaningful impact on our revenue line. You saw that already in the first quarter, our cross-border was better than we expected. And as a result, our revenues were also quite a bit better than we expected. We're saying that we will step up our investment in the second half and expect our expenses to grow double digits. But, if the cross-border business comes back in a meaningful way, I mean, that's clearly going to be much better growth on the top-line than that double digit increase in expenses that we're planning. Also, you should remember that we start lapping the declines in our expenses from last year. Our expenses last year declined by 5% or so in the second half. So when we grow them double digits this fiscal year, in the second half, over a two year period we\u2019re only growing them about 5%. So net, net, I mean, cross-border coming back is going to have a very positive impact on our business, especially if it comes back faster than we might be expecting. In any case, the comparisons get better, so you will begin to see growth in the cross-border business just because of what happened last year.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. You may go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on your volume metrics. If I compare your metrics relative to your closest peers, over the last two quarters, we've seen the reversal of Europe and U.S. volume growth rate has been faster than your peers. How should we think about that? Is it some deal flow coming in, your partnerships with FinTechs, the Visa Direct in the numbers? Any color there that would be helpful. Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Well, it's always a variety of reasons, depending on what the components of the business you're looking at. I mean, clearly the mix of the business between debit and credit has an impact. You all know that debit has clearly outperformed as the primary driver of cash conversion globally. And then in those parts of the world like the U.S., where debit has been a mechanism for distribution of stimulus payments, it's also benefited from that. So mix of business makes a big difference. We're not seeing any reason why debit will not continue to outperform and credit is recovering and that's a positive trend. If you look at places around the world, I mean, in Europe, the bulk of the slowdown from Q1 to Q2 was the fact that we had that benefit in the first quarter. We've had some small impact from restrictions. But unless restrictions are becoming more significant, this trend seems to be improving almost everywhere. You saw that in Latin America and EMEA, we saw meaningful acceleration. And we're not seeing much impact on those trends from additional cases. So overall, the U.S., as I said in my comments, it's almost as if the pandemic didn't happen. Like we grew around 8% first quarter last year. We grew 8% again first quarter this year where if you believe our growth rate is 8% or 9%, we're almost back on the growth rate. Internationally, we're getting there and we think that trend is meaningfully improving, as you saw. Where we are lagging, certainly where the trend is still soft as Asia, where restrictions remain still significant. And in Europe, there\u2019s some increasing restrictions now and we\u2019ll see how they play out.\nAl Kelly: Thank you. Mitchell, we\u2019ll take one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. You may go ahead, sir.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Al, hi, Vasant. So questions on pricing. Wondering if -- and I know you price for value, but kind of wondering as the economy hopefully gets better how you think of pricing? Is there perhaps a catch up in pricing? Do you revert to normalize long-term pattern? Or do you just see a tougher environment for pricing within the interchange model? And then so the addendum to that is, is there a natural benefit from Brexit? Its news flow couple days back about that, and how do you account for that?\nAl Kelly: Well, I'll make a couple of comments and Vasant can certainly add. On answer on your last point, I'm not going to make any comments on the Brexit situation, we've not announced anything, and therefore I don't think it's prudent to comment. I think that we made some decisions to delay pricing out of this past year, because of the realities of COVID. But we plan to move ahead with previously delayed pricing increases in April of this year. We also have a small number of minor pricing changes. The impact won't be very big. And I think going forward, I think we continue to deliver the value that we want to deliver, I think that there's opportunity across all three of our growth strategies, core payments, new flows and value added services to look at pricing. Vasant, you add or add anything.\nVasant Prabhu: No. Nothing more to add.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Great. Thank you, guys.\nMike Milotich: Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again and have a great evening.\nOperator: And thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Al Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Even with vaccine proliferation on the horizon, COVID-19 infections really continue to rise causing restrictions to be implemented in many parts of the world. Amidst the pandemic Visa delivered strong financial results in our fiscal first quarter, and our strategy to enable money movement globally remains clear. Pursuing growth through core consumer payments, new flows and value added services. On our call today, let me discuss our Q1 results and that provide detail on our momentum this quarter with clients and the valuable solutions they utilize to drive money movement globally. As a review of Q1 results, recall we're growing over a quarter where no one had ever heard of COVID-19. Payment volume process transactions and cross border volume all improved from Q4. Payments volume improved half a point, processing transaction growth improved a point and cross border volume improved 8 points. Net revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $5.7 billion a year-over-year decrease of 6%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.42 a decrease of 3%. Through our dividends and buybacks we returned $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in Q1. Vasant will cover spending in great detail, so I'll only make a few high level comments on holiday spending. U.S. holiday spending was quite different this year, but had a similar overall growth for the last three years of holiday seasons, led by strong retail growth somewhat offset by travel entertainment and fuel. This year in the U.S., we generally saw a continuation of the trends that have been occurring during COVID, strong debit and e-commerce and weaker credit and card present. Outside the United States, holiday retail spending growth broadly accelerated with growth in Canada, the UK, Brazil, and Australia, all rising by five or more points over last year. Now, let me transition to our progress with clients. We continue to win and renew business as we transfer money movement globally through consumer payments, new flows and value added services. In consumer payments, we continue to focus on digitizing $18 trillion spent in cash and check globally, by working with partners to grow endpoints and deepen customer engagement with innovation. We are growing credentials with traditional issuers FinTechs and wallets. Let me start with North America. We are very pleased to have renewed our long standing partnership with Wells Fargo across consumer debit, credit, small business and commercial for the next six years. The Bank of Montreal, Canada's fourth largest bank and the only top five Canadian bank, not previously issuing with Visa announced a new partnership with us to issue two affluent lifestyle credit card products in the Canadian market. These products are digital first targeting the affluent millennial segment and offer strong rewards and value to cardholders in a differentiated and innovative way. In our Asia-Pacific region, we won the debit business of Malaysia's AmBank after winning the credit business just a quarter ago. Our relationship with LINE Pay also deepen this quarter on two fronts. First in Japan LINE Pay is now issuing a Visa virtual prepaid card, and second Visa secured an exclusive partnership with LINE BK, Thailand's first social banking platform issuance of Visa Debit cards. Within the first month LINE BK issued 180,000 Visa Debit credentials. In Russia YooMoney [ph], one of the country's largest electronic payment services with more than 120,000 merchants worldwide and 40 million endpoints, signed on to issue Visa credentials in their wallet and enable Visa Direct. In Europe, we had several notable wins as we continue to increase our business on the continent. Visa secured a business agreement with Santander Group, becoming the preferred partner in credit and commercial for Santander Bank across seven countries in continental Europe. We also want the prepaid issuance of Moody, the first proximity banking and payments company in Italy, which offers its services through both digital and retail channels with over 45,000 points of sale in rural and urban areas that can reach 20 million customers. I\u0307s\u0327bank, the largest private bank in Turkey, with 20 million cards have selected Visa for its consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. Last we renewed two portfolios with a leading UK issuer, one for consumer credit, and one for commercial charge card. We also continue to deepen engagement with our partners to find new ways to remove friction and enhance the client experience through innovation. Just yesterday, we announced the global partnership with TransferWise and the first use case of Visa Cloud Connect a new way to securely connect to VisaNet through the cloud. The new platform will enable the expansion of TransferWise as multicurrency debit cards in Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, UK and the U.S. and deliver a range of Financial Services via mobile app to their customers, including currency exchange, and P2P payments, all linked to a Visa card. Pay continues to expand representing almost two thirds of all face to face transactions, excluding the United States. In the United States, we have approximately 300 million contactless cards in place now and have high single digit penetration of face to face transactions. Even at this level, the U.S. is now the fourth largest country in the number of tap to pay transactions. Enablement continues to grow as all 500 of Costco field locations and Chipotle and Nordstrom Stores now accept tap to pay. I'm also pleased to report that the New York City MTA has completed their rollout to all subways and buses. Processing is also a way to bring Visa's innovations to market and we have made significant progress in Latin America this past quarter in Ecuador, Colombia and Peru and now have reached 100% processing penetration in Chile. As I close out the consumer payments section, I wanted to note some progress in India. We continue to grow credentials. The Amazon Pay, ICICI bank cobranded credit card in India has set a country record by issuing over a million cards in just 20 months. On the acceptance front, India now has 6.5 million acceptance points including over 1 million QR points, up almost 20 percentage points from a year ago and 65% of all terminals are tap to pay enabled. The Reserve Bank of India recently raised the contactless limit which will soon cover 90% plus of all transactions in India. Visa has entered into new partnerships with leading acquires such as SBI payments to large acceptance solutions, such as tap the phone and contactless, and Visa is partnering with the largest acquire in India HDFC Bank, in the largest scale up of Smart Hub and absolution bundling payments banking and value added services to help small merchants grow their businesses. We're also contributing to India's Payment Infrastructure Development Fund to encourage growth of physical and digital acceptance in underpenetrated geographies by adding 1 million points of sale and 2 million QR points per year over the next three years. All of these efforts build on our leading credit and debit market share in India. Now on to the second level, last level of growth new flows, which represents 185 trillion in opportunity. We're pursuing this opportunity with our traditional commercial card solutions as well as newer capabilities like Visa Direct and Visa B2B CONNECT. While we're making progress across all new flows, I'll highlight a few advancements from this quarter. In B2C, gig economy payouts and earned wage access continue to grow meaningfully in the wake of COVID. This quarter with DoorDash, we launched the Dasher direct business prepaid card in the U.S., offering the over 1 million dashers on the DoorDash platform access to daily deposits of earned wages and rich card benefits. In Canada, Skip The Dishes, the country's largest food delivery network rolled out their visa direct enabled courier payouts called fast cash. P2P, which represents 20 trillion of the flows was Visa Direct first use case and continues to grow substantially. A key area of future growth is cross border P2P or remittance. Four of the top five global money transfer operators were on boarded in fiscal year '20 TransferWise, Western Union, Remitly and MoneyGram, which noted a 500% increase year-over-year in real time transfers in December alone. Our efforts to expand remittance also extends to FinTechs and banks who can enable this capability. ZPay a fast growing African FinTech will use Visa Direct to allow Africans to send money across European and North American corridors, and soon will expand to all major corridors globally. TransferGo, a global money transfer company that supports migrant workers to send money back to their relatives, without paying unnecessary bank fees has enabled Visa Direct in 55 markets that has the potential to expand to a total of 178 countries in the future, with its upcoming additions such as the UK, Italy and Nigeria. Across the globe, in the first quarter Visa Direct transactions grew almost 60%. Now onto B2B, the cross-border Goldman Sachs transaction banking recently signed on to employ Visa B2B Connect for cross-border B2B money movement, offering its corporate clients the ability to transact in over 80 markets globally. We are very pleased that our partnership with Goldman continues to deepen on multiple fronts. In the virtual card based business, we've expanded our relationship with UK based Conformer Pay to launch Visa commercial pay, which has three offerings, a mobile app, enabling virtual card issuance and management for business incidentals, two, a solution to manage business travel spend with enhanced data, and three, an integrated payables platform that can seamlessly send payments to suppliers. Barclays has already launched this functionality for their commercial clients. Currently, essentially, all of these new flows are transacted in traditional Fiat currencies. But there's a growing interest in digital currencies. And I wanted to take a minute to talk about how Visa thinks about crypto in general and our approach. In this space, we see ways that we can add differentiated value to the ecosystem, and we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help make crypto currencies more safe, useful and applicable for payments through our global presence, our partnership approach and our trusted brand. We think of the crypto market in two segments. First, there are crypto currencies that represent new assets, such as Bitcoin. Secondary, digital currencies or stable coins that are directly backed by existing Fiat currencies. We see all currencies in that first segment as digital gold. They are predominantly held as assets that are not used as a form of payment in a significant way at this point. Our strategy here is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials, or to cash out onto a Visa credential to make a Fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa is accepted globally. This is similar to our approach to connect close with wallets such as, LINE Pay and Paytm. For the second segment, Fiat backed digital currencies, including stable coins and central bank digital currencies, these are an emerging payments innovation that could have the potential to be used for global commerce, much like any other fiat currency. We think of digital currencies running on public block chains as additional networks, just like RTP or ACH networks. So we see them as part of our network of network strategy. Across both of these segments, we are the clear leader in this space. Today, 35 of the leading digital currency platforms and wallets have already chosen to issue Visa, including Coinbase, crypto.com, BlockFi, Ford and Bitpanda. These wallet relationships represent the potential for more than 50 million Visa credentials. The next leading network has a fraction of that. And it goes without saying to the extent a specific digital currency becomes a recognized means of exchange, there's no reason why we cannot add it to our network, which already supports over 160 currencies today. Let me now turn to our third growth lever, value added services. Here we saw revenue grow at 19% in Q1, and let me name a few services with notable progress this quarter. As e-commerce explodes, interest in CyberSource remains strong for merchants, as well as from FinTechs and acquirers looking to leverage our capabilities to offer to their clients. This quarter, two additional leading acquirers signed on to use CyberSource, K Bank in Thailand and NAB in Australia. As one of the largest debit and prepaid issuer processes we've been looking to expand Visa DPF globally, in that vein, we are pleased to share that we're bringing our Visa debit processing system to Europe. DKB, our largest issuing bank in Germany has chosen DPF as its debit processor and recently processed Visa's inaugural European DPF transaction via their platform. DKB will also be able to take advantage of nearly 20 value added services through this connection. We have believed for years that installments represent an important opportunity in payments. To enable this capability, we offer our own network solution for issuers, merchants and FinTechs installment providers to use directly or also work with many. And we also work with many installment providers to develop new solutions. This quarter we had updates on both fronts. We signed a global deal with Afterpay, extending our U.S. relationship to an additional seven countries, where Afterpay will use Visa technology to accelerate its global expansion. In addition, Visa and Afterpay will test and collaborate on the application of new technologies, like tokenization and Visa direct. We announced in July that Commerce Bank in the United States was piloting the network solution, and it is now launched with about 300,000 customers live. Visa also signed Scotiabank as the first Canadian bank to launch a post purchase installment pilot with employees in December, with a full market rollout slated for mid-2021. All of these growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value added services are driven by our network of network strategy, which is enabling all forms of payment, utilizing all networks and providing the value added services you would expect from Visa as we enable money movement. In closing, a few points, domestic volumes driven by debit and e-commerce are really holding up well, holiday spending will different in terms of categories and timing was quite good. Q1 overall was a very solid quarter and positive momentum continued, albeit we are still impacted by COVID-19. We are continuing to work very hard to balance expense management and recognition of the short term realities and investing in an exciting set of growth opportunities, as we always manage the business for the long-term. We continue to be focused on our three growth levers, all of which are supported by our network of network. And lastly, we are hopeful that as vaccines roll out and become more readily available, lockdowns, travel restrictions and capacity constraints will be lessened or eliminated, enabling travel, entertainment and other commerce to grow. With that over to Vasant, for more color on our volumes and our financials. Well, thanks, James. Well, first of all, I mean, that's the last part of the question. This was a single lawsuit brought by a single regulator about one specific M&A transaction. So I don't believe that this portends anything about the future and our ability to continue to try to acquire companies. As we said a couple weeks ago, we ended up making the decision that this was just going to go on for too long. And we all know that the payments marketplace is moving with great speed on so many fronts. And the idea that we would tie ourselves up on this transaction, and frankly, the plan would tie themselves up through a long-term litigation that could go all the way through and appeal in and of itself which is not appealing to us, in terms of all the other things that we thought, we could be investing in and spending management time on and spending our dollars on. We're continuing to forge down a path of making sure that we are a real player in this space of open banking, and believe that we have a lot of the assets already. What Plaid was going to do was going to get us into specifically into the data extraction type of business, which would have added to our network of networks, but it doesn't in and of itself prevent us from doing more going forward. We also still have the ability in that space to partner with Plaid, we have the ability to partner with other players around the world. In many cases, that might give us the ability to partner with players that understand the nuances of specific markets in which they do work.  We'll continue to look to make sure that we to the degree that any use cases are going to form via the most -- the use case that probably would have the most chance of stepping out and being something that takes has some legs behind it would be account to account. And I think we're very well positioned there, we're positioned well to make sure that we can provide payments capabilities for the various FinTechs that we are doing business with today. And we have the ability to continue to sell value added services to all those players. So I think that ultimately, as we have in the past, we will invest to grow internally, we will look to partner and we will look to buy. And it will be a combination of capabilities and approaches that will allow us to continue to be a player in this space. Well, I think when you look at our cost base, the big parts of our cost base are people marketing and technology. And we think we have the Tokyo Olympics coming up in the summer months. I mean, there's some people that might be in some peril at the moment is going forward. We have marketing to really relatively modest levels in this past quarter. But I would certainly expect us to be driving marketing up. Basically, when we go to market, in our business it's a combination of putting people resources, our technology resources and our marketing muscle behind whatever we're doing. And so those are the areas that I would expect to see us grow going forward. And then of course, I mean, we really have dramatically curtailed TD and professional services. And I think that to the degree that later in the year, we begin to get some people back to offices, and we begin to see some people get back on airplanes, we'll see some modest increases in those expenses, those expense areas. So we've been really careful about both our people level spending in our technology level spending and our marketing level spending. And I think as conditions warrant, we'll be dialing those up. Vasant gave you some insight into where we think expenses are going to be in the second half. And we think there's some really good opportunities. And I want to make sure that if, in fact as we believe that will be in some form or normalcy by the end of this fiscal year, we want to make sure that we have good momentum going into fiscal '22. Tien-Tsin, thank you. I guess a little bit of color for everybody, about two-thirds of our value added services are in data processing and they basically are transaction based revenue streams. And, that CyberSource that our risk and identity products that DPS and all of those will tend to continue to produce very good volumes and they'll move with transactions as transactions move. About a third of our value added services is split between our services revenue, which tends to be card benefits that are offered as a package. And then in other revenue, we have volumes that are -- I'm sorry, we have services not tied to volumes, things like consulting or practice and travel related card benefits that obviously have been down. So I think as travel would be to come back at some point that obviously would help that volume. So with that color we saw our, obviously in a world where e-commerce and omni commerce are becoming a big deal, cyber volume was very, very good and good revenue. We continue to have more and more customers engage with us on risk and identity services. And as I said earlier, now we're excited about the fact that we're going to take our debit processing system beyond the United States, and we've now got it, starting to use it in Europe. I think that that gives us a good platform for growth going forward as well. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Don, in Latin America, it was really U.S. to Mexico and U.S. to the Caribbean, that drove Dubai and North America. Beyond that, Dubai opened a bit, now Dubai is having a little bit of resurgence and just went back into some restrictions in earlier this week. But Dubai has been open, and there's been a decent amount of travel into the Middle East. There's been a fair little bit of an opening amongst the countries in the former Soviet Union, and then there's been some improvement or some movement in intra-travel within South America. So those are kind of the spots where we've seen the improvements in cross border. Most of the rest of the corridors around the world continue to be as Vasant mentioned in his remarks, either closed or subject to like, really tough restrictions that make it very difficult for company to take on traveling. Well, I think, Don, as it relates to consumer travel, which is the vast majority of our payment volume in the travel sector over the years, I do think we're going to see some opening for sure. I think there's a lot of pent up demand. I mean, there's a lot of people who haven't seen family, parents who haven't seen grandchildren, children who haven't seen parents, and are going to want to jump on planes. I also think a lot of people are stir crazy and want to get out. And then you've got people who are true global citizens who're knocking things off their to-do list and in terms of places they want to go and things in places they want to see. So I think consumer travel at the right time, but we need to see these restrictions be mitigated or lessened in pretty big way. I think it's going to come back quite strongly. I think it's going to take more time to see business travel come back. And frankly, it might take years for business travel to return to what it is. I mean, we've all gotten accustomed to talking on video conferences, et cetera. And I think we all probably realize that there are trips that we took are authorized in the past that when we look back on it today, in the light of talking on video, we say why did we send somebody to that meeting for 1.5 hour presentation that they could have just as well done on video. So that's the way I think about it going forward, Don. Lisa, thank you for the question. Visa Direct has the ability to grow on a number of vectors. The two that, I think are the most obvious is, in terms of, well, three, I'd say; continued penetration of current use cases, new use cases that had developed, and then thirdly, geographic expansion. And this is a business that we're still building out. There's still lot to do in all three of those categories. And to an earlier question, I think Don asked, we're going to continue to invest in that area and look at these markets where we haven't even really laid any track for Visa Direct is use cases where we haven't laid any track. And our plan is to continue to do that. If we look at the very first Visa Direct use case, which continues to grow substantially P2P payments, there's still lots to do, both in domestic P2P payments, but we think a key future growth area is in cross-border P2P and remittance and we're beginning to take steps there to enable that. And I mentioned in my remarks the fact that we've got relationships with four of the five top global money transfer operators. And that's helping us quite a bit. I think earn ways to access, really continues to be a real opportunity, I touched a little bit on a few of those cases, but there's still lots of geographies and lots of organizations that we have the ability to penetrate, to grow that. And then you've got all these, B2C use cases, things like food and grocery delivery and online gaming and insurance claim payouts. So, all of those are, I would say in the early innings of a baseball game in terms of our ability to continue to make progress and drive those. So I continue to believe that this platform off which we can generate dozens and dozens of use cases, both will for quite some time be really important to us from a growth perspective. Thank you, Lisa. Well, Chris, this is a pretty interesting space, and I think we're in the early days in most markets. There's a number of different models. I think I said before, I think Vasant said before, we're not in the business of picking winners and losers. We see our job as enablement, no matter what the model is. But, in some cases, the player is the actual lender, in some cases, they're sourcing a lender, in some cases, the installments are very short term, weeks at a time, in some cases they're long-term. Some providers only do installment, some allow multiple payment options, pay now, pay on delivery, pay off on various numbers of installments. And then obviously where it gets exciting for us, multiple ways to pay off installments, virtual cards, debit cards, ACH. And, it's also a payment model today that's heavily funded by the merchant. Our strategy, Chris, is to be brought to play with multiple third party providers and offer our Visa platform to enable issuers to offer pay now, buy now, pay now, pay later capability. And we seek to work with all these options. And obviously, what we want to do is get virtual cards from Visa in place as one option for repayment. We also want to put Visa cards on file as another option. And I would remind you that these installments do break at its core, these installments break a transaction or a purchase into three or four or five payment transactions, which is good for us, because it gives us more transactions on which to earn fees. So there is a few countries you mentioned, Sweden, another one is Australia. There's not many, there's two countries where this has really taken off. And I think it certainly has had some impact on banks in those markets. But in many cases, because of the kind of pay off capabilities, I talked about card on file, virtual cards and et cetera, a lot of that buys coming back to us in the form of repayments. Darrin on your second question, first of all, there's many reasons why debit has been a star here, not that you've got the stimulus payments that are on prepaid cards, we count prepaid in our debit business. As e-commerce is moved into more everyday categories, people are using debit, people are more comfortable in tough situations, tough times to use money they have versus borrow money that they don't have. But I think when I looked ahead structurally, to answer your question, look I think e-commerce adaption is probably accelerated three to five years in the last year. And I don't think that's going backward. I think that people who have gotten used to shopping on the phone or their tablet or their computer are going to continue to do that. I think the other thing that I look at structurally that's really exciting is there's great opportunity to continue to grow both sides of this two sided market of buyers and sellers. Wallet proliferation is continuing and we're working really hard to get credentials in wallets, which adds to these wallets in essence are becoming issuers and that helps on generate more buyers. And the cost of acceptance is going down around the world, as more and more players are getting into it. And that's going to grow the number of sellers on our network and that network grows, I think that's going to be a really positive thing for us. Obviously, e-commerce comes with the issue of no cash. But I think that people are getting increasingly concerned about cash and the combination of tap to pay in the physical world where the card doesn't need to leave your hands to go to anybody else in order to transact. And the fact that e-commerce doesn't free cash is not an option. Those are all of those things I think structurally are very positive for us. The thing on the flip side, I also I mentioned that while business travel is a small piece of our overall travel, that will be one of the things that will be a little bit slower to come back and maybe never back at the level it was pre-COVID-19. Thank you. Mitchell, we'll take one last question. Well, I'll make a couple of comments and Vasant can certainly add. On answer on your last point, I'm not going to make any comments on the Brexit situation, we've not announced anything, and therefore I don't think it's prudent to comment. I think that we made some decisions to delay pricing out of this past year, because of the realities of COVID. But we plan to move ahead with previously delayed pricing increases in April of this year. We also have a small number of minor pricing changes. The impact won't be very big. And I think going forward, I think we continue to deliver the value that we want to deliver, I think that there's opportunity across all three of our growth strategies, core payments, new flows and value added services to look at pricing. Vasant, you add or add anything."

            "content": "Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. During our fiscal first quarter last year, COVID-19 was not yet a word in the English language. This will be the last quarter where our performance is compared to a quarter of with no COVID impact whatsoever. As such, our results this quarter provide a clear picture of the state of the recovery. Overall, the quarter was stronger than we expected, but net revenue down 6%, largely due to the cross-border business. EPS declined only 3% helped by lower expenses and a lower tax rate. Exchange rates shifts with the last year, increased reported net revenue growth by less than half a point and EPS growth by less than one point. As we approach the first anniversary of the pandemic, where do we stand across our key business drivers, relative to where we might have been had the pandemic never happened? Global payments volume is 4 to 5 points short of where we might have been. Debit has outperformed helped by accelerated cash displacement and credit is still a drag. In the U.S., we are actually back to our pre-pandemic growth trajectory, with debit significantly ahead of setting credit under performance. As you know, where we are well behind is in our cross-border business. In the first quarter of fiscal '21 our cross border volumes were almost 40% lower, excluding Intra-Europe volumes than they might have been had the pandemic never happened, largely due to travel. Cross border travel volume, both card present and card not present is still down almost 70% relative to where it might have been at this point. Let's start with a review of the key business drivers in the fiscal first quarter. Global payments volume and transaction growth rates were modestly better than the prior quarter. The cross model volume recovery continued even as most borders remain completely or partially closed. The trajectory of the domestic spending recovery varies across the globe. Some regions and countries are recovering fast, others are holding steady, while some have slowed in recent weeks as a result of new restrictions. What remains consistent globally is very strong debit and e-commerce spending, which is partially offset by weaker credit and in store spending. Although, constant dollar cross border volume, excluding transactions within Europe is still down 33%, there was an 8 point improvement from last quarter. Payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew 4.5%, debit was up 17%, 3 percentage points lower than last quarter, while credit declined 6%, up 3 percentage points from Q4. Growth excluding China was 7%, up almost a point, as Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual branded card conversions, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was 8%, up half a point from last quarter. Debit growth remained strong at 21%, debit growth was 3 points lower than the fourth quarter, largely driven by a step down in unemployment benefits distributed via Visa prepaid cards. Credit spending declined 3% year-over-year, a 4 point improvement versus last quarter, driven by an acceleration in retail spending and some recovery in travel and restaurants spending. Card not present volume excluding travel continued to grow over 30% in the quarter, primarily driven by retail spending. The decline in card present spending was consistent with last quarter. However, performance did deteriorate through the quarter as rising COVID cases led to further government imposed restrictions in several states and cities. Card present spending slowdowns the most significant in the restaurant segment, as well as during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend across most segments. Across spend categories, growth was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. Categories which have been growing above their pre-COVID levels have remained elevated, including food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. For categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic including travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants spending remain depressed, with year-over-year declines consistent with last quarter. International payments volume grew 2% in Q1, while 6%, excluding China, both of which are up one point versus last quarter. A few regional highlights. EMEA remains our best performing region, growing 19% in constant dollars in the quarter, and more than 4 point improvement over Q4. The easing of COVID-related restrictions particularly in the Middle East, and clients win drove the robust growth. Latin America grew 16% in constant dollars, a nearly 10-point acceleration from last quarter. This growth acceleration is fueled by limited COVID-related restrictions in most countries, elevated e-commerce spending compared to other regions, and growing our market share with client wins in a few of the larger countries. Europe grew 5% in constant dollars, but 4 point slowdown versus last quarter. This deceleration was driven partially by renewed restrictions in the second half of the quarter due to rapidly rising COVID infection rates, particularly in the UK, France, Italy and Germany. And also, as you may remember, growth in Europe last quarter benefited from a non-recurring event in the UK related to purchases of higher interest bearing savings funds. Asia Pacific declined 8% in constant dollars, excluding China, Q1 spending was flat, a 4 point improvement since last quarter. There continue to be more COVID-related restrictions in effect across Asia than other parts of the world, however, several larger markets, such as New Zealand, Australia, Korea and Japan have returned to growth. Process transactions growth was 4%, up one point from last quarter. Growth accelerated faster than payments volume as transaction sizes continue to normalize ex Europe. Increased COVID-related restrictions in Europe are driving higher average ticket sizes, causing transactions growth to slow. Latin America is benefiting from processing wins in several countries, including Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Chile. Visa Direct continues to perform very well, the transaction is growing almost 60% globally this quarter. Growth remains strong in every region as we continue to launch new use cases, further penetrate existing use cases such as earned wage access and cross-border remittance, and expand existing use cases to new geographies. Constant dollar cross border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, declined 33% in Q1, an 8 point improvement from the last quarter. Travel related spend declined 64%, but improved 6 points versus the fourth quarter. Card not present non-travel growth was 20%, up 3 points fueled by strong retail spending in November and December. Constant dollar cross-border volume, including transactions within Europe, declined 21% in the quarter. Although cross-border travel performance improved steadily through the quarter, the travel improvement was concentrated in only a few markets, where borders are open. Travel from the U.S. to several countries in Latin America remains strong, including Mexico and the Caribbean. The UAE has been open to travelers attracting people from Europe, Russia and other Gulf countries. Also, travel across countries within the former Soviet Union has been growing. Unfortunately, the majority of borders remain closed or impose significant requirements on international travelers. The World Tourism Organization reported in December that out of 217 countries, 118 countries, or 54%, still have completely or partially closed their borders to foreign visitors, of the remaining 99 countries, the majority are mandating COVID tests with quarantines. Very few countries have no COVID restrictions. Significant obstacles in crossing borders remain the single most important factor, driving the slow recovery of cross-border travel. A quick review of first quarter financial results. Net revenue declined 6% better than our expectations, primarily due to stronger than expected cross-border volumes and lower client incentives. Value added services continue to perform well, growing 19%. It's important to note that had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, it would have had minimal impact on our Q1 net revenue growth, because payment volume growth was very similar across both quarters. Service revenues grew 5%, roughly in line with nominal payments volume growth last quarter. Data processing grew 6% with high teens, value added services growth continuing to be partially offset by the mix shift away from higher yielding cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 28%, 4 points better than cross-border volumes, excluding Intra-Europe due to favorable country mix and currency volatility benefits. Other revenues grew 5%, led by value added services, but continue to be negatively impacted by declines in the usage of travel related card benefits. Client incentives were 24.6% of gross revenues, approximately one point lower than expected. This was driven by three factors; first, a few large deals expected to be signed in the first quarter were delayed to the second quarter. Second, cross-border volume was better than we expected, particularly in the month of December. As we have said in the past, client incentives are mostly tied to payments volumes. So outperformance in high yielding cross-border volume lowers our incentives as a percent of gross revenues. And third, payments volume growth only improved a half point versus last quarter, as such there was minimal impact on current quarter client incentives from current quarter volume. On the operating expense front, we continue to benefit from actions we implemented last spring. Our headcount is lower, our spending on external services has been scaled back, travel continues to be very restricted and some marketing spend has been curtailed. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses declined 10%, which is better than expected partly due to timing shifts in client co-marketing, as well as certain product and technology investments to later in the year. Non-GAAP non-operating expense was $112 million for the fiscal quarter. This was over $30 million lower than expected due to two non-recurring items. First investment income tax deferred compensation was higher, this is offset in personnel costs and therefore income neutral. And second, an interest expense reserve was released, due to the conclusion of certain tax audits. The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected at 16.6%. During the quarter, the conclusion of tax audits in certain jurisdictions resulted in an $81 million benefit. In addition to this specific benefit, our tax rate is typically lower in the first quarter due to the impact of employee equity vesting. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS was $1.42, a decrease of 3%. We bought 8.7 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $202.30 for $1.8 billion this quarter. Our board has authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program, bringing total funds available for repurchases to over $11 billion. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned approximately $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. In December, we repaid $3 billion of debt upon maturity of senior notes issued five years ago. Moving on to some perspective on the second fiscal quarter, starting with business driver trends through January 21. Through January 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 12%, with us debit growing 30% and credit declining 6%. Debit growth is 10 points higher than the November, December run rate, fueled by government stimulus payments distributed right around January 1. Weekly growth trends show a sharp step up in growth in the first week of January and a step down in week three. January credit growth has slowed 3 points since December, which is more in line with the November trend. While U.S. payments volume growth has accelerated, there are many countries where constant dollar growth is slowing due to increased restrictions as COVID infections rise. In Asia-Pacific, Japan, Australia, India and Singapore payments volume growth has slowed 4 to 5 points versus December. In Europe, countries such as the UK, Italy, Denmark, and Germany all have at least 10 points slower growth in January. So far, growth rates are relatively steady in both EMEA and Latin America. Through January 21, processed transactions growth remained at 4% with acceleration in the U.S. offset by slowing growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Cross border volume excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis declined 33% in line with the first quarter, but below the trends we saw in December. In a fast changing environment, accurate forecasting remains difficult. How long will elevated spending driven by stimulus payments last? How long will stepped up restrictions and lockdowns persist? How will these two countervailing trends balance out country by country? Will cross border travel sustain the slow recovery even if some new restrictions go into place? These are just some of the uncertainties as we look ahead to the next three months. Based on the trends to this point, our best sense is that the second quarter gross revenue growth rate will recover to be flattish with last year, with most of the improvement driven by international revenues. Growth in the other revenue lines is expected to have a small uptick due to easier year-over-year comparisons in the second half of March. First quarter client incentives were a point below our expectations. Second quarter client incentives could be a point above the high end of the 25.5% to 26.5% range, we expect for the year. This would put first half incentives right in the middle of the range. There are several reasons for this type of client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the second quarter, even with continued improvement in cross border. First, as I mentioned earlier, a few large deals moved from the first to the second quarter one of which was Wells Fargo was signed in January as Al noted. Second, as we told you in October, many clients did not need certain volume thresholds in calendar year 2020, and as such did not earn corresponding incentives. As volume recovers in 2021, we expect clients will hit growth thresholds and earn these incentives. We accrue incentives accordingly, starting with the first quarter of the new calendar year. This causes a larger increase unique to the year of the recovery. And third, the impact of renewals we had already expected in the second quarter. Due to the step up in client incentives as a percent of gross revenue, the net revenue decline in the second quarter is expected to be comparable to the decline we reported in the first quarter, even as the growth, revenue growth rate continues to recover. Exchange rate shifts could benefit second quarter net revenue growth by less than a point. We expect operating expenses to grow in the low to mid-single digits in the second quarter, as we begin to lap the expense reductions implemented last year. We still plan to grow expenses in the double digits in the second half as we step up investments on three key growth initiatives in anticipation of a return to normal fee by the end of fiscal 2021. Non-operating expense should be $145 million, approximately, which is similar to the first quarter, if you exclude the two nonrecurring items I mentioned earlier. There is no change in our prior tax rate expectations. It is still too early to predict what impact the U.S. elections will have on our taxes. As always, we will provide updates as the year progresses. In summary, as you can see, our business remains resilient. Both debit and e-commerce growth are sustaining well above pre-COVID levels, as the accelerated shift to digital payments becomes a habit. Cross border growth is poised to recover sharply, once vaccines facilitate reopening of borders, and we lap last year steep declines. Our new flows and value added services businesses have continued to grow robustly through the worst of the pandemic. As Al indicated, we have stayed focused on our long-term growth initiatives, and will be stepping up the level of investment in the second half in anticipation of a post-COVID world with accelerating growth. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike. Yes, just taking the incentives question, we try to give you a best sense of a range. And at this point, the visibility is greatest in the first half, since we're halfway through it and we think we'll be right in the middle of the range. There are many variables here that go into it and a time like this, when things are moving around quite a bit, certainly cross border doing better helps. Renewals will have an impact sometimes they happen when we expect sometimes they don't. There's also the year-over-year improvement that our clients have. As you know, last year, many clients because of the pandemic didn't hit certain thresholds, this year things are recovering faster. There could be, they will be thing they'll all make that threshold and more; that has a year-over-year impact, and it varies by client. So there's a bunch of these things moving around at the same time. And the good news is, you know, we think we're right in the middle of the range, and we'll give you more as we go through the year. Next question, please? Well, I mean, there's no question cross-border coming back has a meaningful impact on our revenue line. You saw that already in the first quarter, our cross-border was better than we expected. And as a result, our revenues were also quite a bit better than we expected. We're saying that we will step up our investment in the second half and expect our expenses to grow double digits. But, if the cross-border business comes back in a meaningful way, I mean, that's clearly going to be much better growth on the top-line than that double digit increase in expenses that we're planning. Also, you should remember that we start lapping the declines in our expenses from last year. Our expenses last year declined by 5% or so in the second half. So when we grow them double digits this fiscal year, in the second half, over a two year period we're only growing them about 5%. So net, net, I mean, cross-border coming back is going to have a very positive impact on our business, especially if it comes back faster than we might be expecting. In any case, the comparisons get better, so you will begin to see growth in the cross-border business just because of what happened last year. Well, it's always a variety of reasons, depending on what the components of the business you're looking at. I mean, clearly the mix of the business between debit and credit has an impact. You all know that debit has clearly outperformed as the primary driver of cash conversion globally. And then in those parts of the world like the U.S., where debit has been a mechanism for distribution of stimulus payments, it's also benefited from that. So mix of business makes a big difference. We're not seeing any reason why debit will not continue to outperform and credit is recovering and that's a positive trend. If you look at places around the world, I mean, in Europe, the bulk of the slowdown from Q1 to Q2 was the fact that we had that benefit in the first quarter. We've had some small impact from restrictions. But unless restrictions are becoming more significant, this trend seems to be improving almost everywhere. You saw that in Latin America and EMEA, we saw meaningful acceleration. And we're not seeing much impact on those trends from additional cases. So overall, the U.S., as I said in my comments, it's almost as if the pandemic didn't happen. Like we grew around 8% first quarter last year. We grew 8% again first quarter this year where if you believe our growth rate is 8% or 9%, we're almost back on the growth rate. Internationally, we're getting there and we think that trend is meaningfully improving, as you saw. Where we are lagging, certainly where the trend is still soft as Asia, where restrictions remain still significant. And in Europe, there's some increasing restrictions now and we'll see how they play out. No. Nothing more to add."

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Visa\u2019s performance in 2022 was very strong even with the uncertainty created by inflation, the war in Ukraine, COVID, the timing of cross-border travel recovery and a potential recession. On a full year basis, credentials increased 9% year-over-year and are up 13% excluding Russia. We crossed 4.8 billion tokens surpassing the number of card credentials and almost doubling from last year. Merchant locations, including locations from payment facilitators grew 11%. Global Tap to Pay penetration grew 10% -- 10 points to 54% of face-to-face transactions excluding Russia and this was helped by 20 additional countries crossing over the 50% penetration mark. Excluding the U.S. and Russia, global Tap to Pay penetration was 71%. Visa\u2019s network processed 70% more Tap to Ride transactions on global transit systems in FY 2022, surpassing 1 billion transactions for the first time ever. In FY 2022, we signed over 400 commercial partnerships with fintechs globally from early-stage companies to growing and mature players. Visa Direct had 5.9 billion transactions excluding Russia, across 60 plus use cases and over 2,000 programs helped by more than 500 enablers. Over half of our clients utilized five or more value-added services in 2022 and a third used 10 or more. All of this helped to drive fiscal full year net revenues up 22% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $7.50, up 27%. Now let me transition to our fourth quarter performance and key highlights and then make a few comments about 2023. Fourth quarter net revenues grew 19% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, up 19%. Total Q4 payments volume was up 10% year-over-year or 135% versus three years ago, down 1 point from Q3. Excluding Russia and China, payments volume was up 16% or 145% of 2019. U.S. Q4 payments volume was up 12% year-over-year or 145% of 2019, down 1 point. International volume was up 9% year-over-year or 126% of 2019, down 1 point versus Q3. Excluding Russia and China, International volume was up 20% or 146% of 2019, flat to Q3. Q4 cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe were up 49% year-over-year and 130% versus three years ago, up 7 points from Q3. Excluding Russia, cross-border year-over-year growth was higher by about 5 points. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 12 points from 104% of 2019 in Q3 to 116% in Q4 as travel continued to recover. Processed transactions were up 12% year-over-year or 140% versus 2019 and we processed 553 million transactions a day during the quarter. Now I will provide an update on the drivers that propel this growth in consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Our consumer payment strategy has three components to it, growing credentials, increasing acceptance and deepening engagement. Total consumer payments revenue for the fourth quarter and the year were both up more than 20% in constant dollars. On the credential side, we signed several significant deals with financial institution clients, co-brands and fintechs in the fourth quarter. Starting with financial institution clients in our Asia-Pacific region, we signed with China Construction Bank, Bank of Communications and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, leading banks in China. Throughout fiscal year 2022, we have renewed with eight of our top China issuers. In our CEMEA region, we signed with National Bank of Kuwait, the largest bank in Kuwait, and ADIB, the largest Islamic issuer in the UAE. In Latin America, we renewed and expanded our partnership relationship with the second largest bank in Colombia, Banco Davivienda, including credit, debit, commercial and Visa Direct. Another key renewal in Latin America this quarter was with Dock, one of the Visa\u2019s a few full stock enablers providing BINs [ph] sponsorship, issuer processing, acquiring as a service and program management via a single connection, already servicing more than 100 fintechs in Brazil, Dock will expand across new markets, including Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, the Dominican Republic and Ecuador. In Europe, we renewed and expanded our relationship with UBS, the largest issuer in Switzerland. We made excellent progress in Germany with our share growing significantly since 2018, adding more than 12 million debit credentials in the market. Visa Debit is now offered by three of the most significant banks in the market, ING, DKB and comdirect. And we are also pleased to announce that Santander Germany will begin issuance in 2023, making Visa the single scheme of choice for Santander in that country across debit and credit. Altogether, across the European continent, our quarterly active credentials were up 18% year-over-year. In the co-brand space, we continue to expand our position in several countries with two recent wins and an extension. First, in India with the Samsung co-brand card targeting existing and prospective Samsung users. Second, in the U.S., Visa and Kohl\u2019s with Capital One as the issuer recently entered into an agreement to launch at Kohl\u2019s co-branded Visa credit card. And also in the U.S., we are excited to share that Visa signed a multiyear co-brand agreement extension with Disney for cards issued by JPMorgan Chase. Now moving to fintech and wallet clients. In Egypt, mobile network operated Etisalat Egypt with more than 28 million customers has signed a deal for virtual and physical card issuance. The first digital bank in Iraq, Visa Iraq Islamic banks seeking to digitize payments and drive a cashless society through Visa credit, debit and prepaid card issuance across their 400,000 customers. And large cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, with over 5 million registered users has signed on to expand issuance of Visa credentials beyond the U.S. to over 40 countries, bringing our total number of issuing partnerships with crypto platforms to more than 70. Finally, GoHenry Group is the U.S., U.K. and Europe-based fintech that provides prepaid cards and financial education app for children age six to 18 to over 2 million members. They will be expanding their U.K. Visa issuance to Continental Europe and the U.S. On the acceptance front, we signed an agreement with Flywire, a global payments enabler and software company that supports the higher education industry to grow card acceptance in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Korea. In Mexico, we renewed our relationship with Clip, an important payment facilitator, which will aid in the expansion of acceptance to micro, small and medium merchants. In Mexico, we have more than doubled acceptance since 2019 to nearly 3 million merchant locations. Our efforts across Latin America to grow acceptance and win processing share has paid off. Outside of Brazil, we have expanded our processing penetration by more than 20 points since 2019, with the migrations of domestic transactions in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and, most recently, Uruguay. Customer engagement is very important, and Tap to Pay is one of the best ways to pay in the face-to-face environment. In Q4, the U.S. reached 28% penetration and saw more than 1 billion tap monthly transactions for the first time ever in July, surpassing the U.K. as the largest country for Tap to Pay transactions and this is nearly double the number of transactions from last year and more than 5 times the number of transactions from two years ago. Now moving on to new flows, which grew fourth quarter and full year revenue over 20% in constant dollars. Our B2B business had nearly $1.5 trillion in payments volume for the full year, growing 30% in constant dollars. In the fourth quarter, B2B payments volume was almost $400 billion, growing 21% year-over-year in constant dollars. Within B2B, our strategy is focused on card-based payments, cross-border payments and accounts receivable and accounts payable payments, and we have made progress across all three this quarter. Visa has signed a long-term agreement with European payments as a service provider, Modulr, to issue Visa virtual cards to support B2B travel clients issuing out of Europe. Also in Europe, Visa won the credit card portfolio, Cr\u00e9dit du Nord, encompassing Societe Generale in addition to renewing consumer credit and debit portfolios in both industries. We also recently reached a new fleet product partnership agreement with Edenred, I am sorry, which is making their Edenred essentials product available to commercial and public sector organizations with vehicles in the United States. In cross-border flows, we signed an agreement with Visa B2B Connect with TD Bank, our first bank in Canada. We also signed banks for the first time in Switzerland and Korea. And recently, our CEMEA region signed five banks across Kazakhstan, Qatar and Azerbaijan. In the accounts receivable and payable space, MineralTree, a U.S. automated invoice-to-payment solution provider for the middle market and enterprise businesses, recently enhanced their relationship with Visa to support cards for their payables customers. For other new flows, Visa Direct grew transactions 36% this year excluding Russia, reaching 5.9 billion transactions. In the fourth quarter, Visa Direct had 1.7 billion transactions and grew 42%, up 7 points from Q3. In addition to growing the existing Visa Direct business, our strategy for growth includes; one, scaling new use cases with a particular focus on cross-border; two, expanding existing use cases to new geographies; and three, accelerating through enablers. In terms of scaling new use cases, I am pleased that eBay, one of the largest third-party marketplaces in the world has enabled faster payouts for its sellers via Visa Direct in the U.S. We recently signed a deal in the U.S. with Gopuff, a consumer goods and food delivery service with millions of customers across hundreds of U.S. cities, to provide their delivery partners the ability to cash out their earnings balance in real-time. In terms of bringing existing use cases to new geographies, in addition to some of the issuing deals I mentioned earlier, we have also signed Visa Direct deals with China Construction Bank and Etisalat Egypt. Other new geographies also include Norway, Norwegian mobile payment application, Vipps, will offer users access to Visa Direct for all domestic payments. This will improve the card-based experience for Vipps, roughly 4.3 million users covering over 80% of Norway\u2019s population. On the enabler strategy, Square has expanded their instant transfers to Canada, offering their business as a way to have faster merchant settlement opportunities. U.S. money movement automation platform, Astra, is using Visa Direct to let developers add real-time transfer functionality to their applications. So millions of its end users can fund cards, wallets and demand deposit accounts with their eligible debit cards. Visa Direct has extensive reach, including more than 3 billion cards and over 2 billion accounts. Recently, Visa Direct has signed with Singapore-based payments infrastructure platform, Thunes, with a network of mobile wallets across 44 countries and territories. Our partnership will add a send-to-wallet capability with either direct through Thunes\u2019 B2B payment platform and provide access to 78 already integrated digital wallet providers, representing over 1.5 billion digital wallets globally. So with this partnership, we will expand our total reach to nearly 7 billion end points covering cards, accounts and wallets. As part of new flows, aligned with our global network of network strategy, we are focused on building the infrastructure that enables our clients to deliver cross-border products and services for their customers. One of our newest capabilities in this space, Currencycloud, signed 35 new partnerships this quarter, including Paycent, a global end-to-end payment platform with over 7 million customers and 17,000 SMEs. Paycent intends to expand capabilities of its Paycent business platform for clients to collect and hold up to 34 currencies and seamlessly convert funds back to the required currency at competitive FX rates. Now moving to value-added services, which had $6 billion in revenue for 2022, up 20% in constant dollars. For the fourth quarter, revenues were up $1.7 billion and grew 20% in cost dollars as well. Our strategy here is also three-fold; one, to deepen client penetration of existing products; two, to build new products and launch new solutions; and three, to extend geographically. On the first, deepen client penetration of existing products, let\u2019s explore two of our largest value-added services businesses, DPS, debit processing services and CyberSource. DPS, our issuer processing business, hit a major milestone, exceeding $2 trillion in annual authorization volume in FY 2022. DPS has also renewed with nearly 30 clients, representing over $600 billion in annual DPS processed authorization volume. CyberSource remains a compelling gateway solution for merchants and most recently signed McDonald\u2019s, Little Caesars and JetBlue. We also continue to expand CyberSource relationships with acquirers, first with the Bank of New Zealand, New Zealand\u2019s largest acquirer. Together with Japanese acquired SMCC, CyberSource continues to provide payment processing solutions for more than 100,000 terminals in both card-present and card-not-present environment. SMCC is also leveraging CyberSource\u2019s capabilities for value-added services such as fraud management. Most recently, CyberSource is powering SMCC\u2019s expansion of the EMV transit acceptance and supporting commercial and pilot launches with 24 different transit operators across Japan. Deutsche Bank will offer CyberSource\u2019s Decision Manager to its merchants so that they can receive a risk value for each e-commerce transaction using rules and AI to help prevent online retail fraud. On the second strategy, build new products and launch great new solutions, our recently acquired capability, Tink, is a real example. Tink recently signed Adyen to offer a white-label pay-by-bank open banking solution on its single platform. Adyen will utilize Tink\u2019s payment initiation technology, so businesses can enable account-to-account payments. Adyen\u2019s open banking integration will launch first in the U.K. with plan to expand to multiple markets during 2023. Last quarter, I mentioned our newly developed risk-as-a-service capabilities powered by our network level data, AI capabilities and our risk experts. Recently, Navy Federal in the U.S. and several banks in CEMEA signed engagements for the service, which aims to deliver enhanced fraud prevention and management. On our third strategy is to extend geographically, in many cases, through tailored solutions. Since our acquisition of Visa Europe, we have made significant effort to bring value-added services to clients. Across Europe, clients enrolling onto Visa advance through authentication and Visa risk management products tripled between October 2019 and September 2022. And these clients span across 14 different European countries. In CEMEA, Visa Risk Manager launched a network-agnostic pilot with Emirates NBD, a leading issuer in the UAE. As part of Visa\u2019s network of network strategy, network-agnostic VRM will allow clients to manage card payment risk across their entire portfolio. We recently brought our Buy Now, Pay Later solution to Canada and have continued to make progress adding some of Canada\u2019s largest merchants, including Simon\u2019s and Canada Computers. And RBC and Visa have entered into an agreement to launch the Visa Installment solution on eligible RBC consumer credit cards. In conclusion, our 2022 performance was very strong and demonstrated that our strategy for each of our growth levers are delivering. We see new flows as a way to drive additional volumes and transactions and value-added services as a way to drive additional yield on existing volumes and transactions. Vasant is going to go into a lot more detail, but let me make four points about 2023. One, in the year ahead, I see significant opportunity for the business across all three of our growth areas, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Two, we faced some headwinds, in particular, lapping Visa and a challenging FX environment. Three, we did not factor a steep economic downturn or a recession into our numbers. To the one -- to the extent one occurs, it will have some impact. Four, we will continue to manage our business for the medium- and long-term, and we will invest in initiatives that are compelling and will provide future growth. That said, we recognize that some economies around the world could face increased pressure. So we will be monitoring things very closely. We will, as we have in past periods, be flexible and prudent in the management of our expenses. As a leadership team, we have demonstrated Visa\u2019s ability to manage through many different environments, and I remain confident that our strategy will continue to position Visa at the center of money movement for years to come. With that, over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal fourth quarter results reflect sustained strength in domestic spending and continued recovery in cross-border travel. Net revenues were up 19% and GAAP EPS was up 13%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 19%. The strong dollar was a stiff headwind, dragging down reported net revenue growth by 4 points and non-GAAP EPS growth also by 4 points. Discontinuation of operations in Russia reduced net revenue growth by about 5 points. A few key highlights, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 10% year-over-year and 35% above 2019. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 16% year-over-year and 45% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 45% above 2019. In constant dollars, international payments volume, excluding China and Russia, was up 20% year-over-year and 46% above 2019. The cross-border travel recovery continues. However, the pace of recovery has moderated as most borders are now open, except China. Index to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe rose 12 points in the fourth quarter versus a 22-point gain in the third quarter. Our three growth engines, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues in excess of 20% in constant dollars. In fiscal year 2022, we bought back $11.6 billion of stock at an average price of $205.97. Contributions to the litigation escrow account, which have the same effect as a stock buyback, added another $850 million. We also paid out $3.2 billion in dividends. At the end of September, we had $5.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. In October, our Board authorized a new $12 billion stock buyback program and increased our dividend by 20%. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 17% year-over-year to 36% over 2019, helped by travel and entertainment spending. U.S. debit grew 7%. Relative to 2019, debit was up 54%, sustaining significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. U.S. cost present spend grew 11% year-over-year and was 27% above 2019. Card-not-present volume excluding travel grew 10% year-over-year and was 68% higher than 2019. E-commerce spending remained well above the pre-COVID trend line even as card-present spend continue to recover. On the International front, Latin America was up 33% year-over-year and 109% higher than 2019. Our CEMEA region excluding Russia grew 32% year-over-year and was 105% higher than 2019. Growth in both regions was fueled by client wins, cash digitization and acceptance expansion. Europe was up 12% year-over-year and 34% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion underway in the U.K. Ex-U.K., Europe volumes grew 30% year-over-year and was 67% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Asia-Pacific excluding China continues to recover, up 26% year-over-year and 32% above 2019. Global process transactions were up 12% year-over-year and 40% over 2019 levels. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, but including Russia in prior periods were up 49% year-over-year and 30% over 2019. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by approximately 5 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe grew 12% year-over-year and was 60% above 2019. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe grew 101% year-over-year and is now 16% above 2019. The cross-border travel index to 2019 went from 112 in June to 115 in July to 118 in September. While the recovery continues, the rate of improvement from month-to-month has slowed as borders ex-China are now open. Travel in and out of Asia recovered sharply in the quarter, up 16 points from the high 15 to the mid-70s index to 2019. There is more recovery to come in Asia, especially when China starts to lift restrictions. Summer travel in and out of Europe was also very strong, with a travel index to 2019 in the 130s, up 13 points from the third quarter. European travel appears to have benefited most from the strong dollar. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continued to pick up steam, rising to the mid-130s index to 2019, up 10 points from the third quarter. However, the inbound travel recovery was sluggish, still indexing in the low 90s and up only 4 points. The strong dollar and delays in Visa issuance from some countries appear to be impacting travel into the U.S. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean remained very strong and stable, indexing around 150 to 2019 levels. Finally, travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the mid-1 20s relative to 2019, up 10 points in the quarter. Moving now to a quick review of fourth quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 11% versus the 12% growth in Q3 constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag more than offset growth from utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 10% versus the 12% of this transaction growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia. However, our transactions growth is not. Adjusted for Russia, data processing revenues were up 15%. International transaction revenues were up 52% versus the 49% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and pricing actions more than offsetting the impact of the strong dollar. Other revenues grew 13% led by travel related programs and pricing actions. Client incentives were 26.9% of gross revenues in line with expectations. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines, each growing more than 20% on a constant dollar basis. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by carded B2B recovery. Commercial card volumes grew 21% year-over-year and are up 43% versus 2019, and excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 42%. Value-added services growth was driven by higher volume, increased client penetration and select pricing actions. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. GAAP operating expenses grew 20%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 18%. The inclusion of Currencycloud and Tink added about 3 points. Exchange rates were about a 4.5 point benefit. We stepped up investment in our business in the second half of the year as the recovery trajectory accelerated. Personnel costs were also higher due to annual salary increases granted a quarter earlier than our normal cycle and higher incentive compensation accruals. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $122 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $99 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates. GAAP EPS was $1.86. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, up 19% over last year, inclusive of a 4-point drag from the strong dollar. For the full year, net revenues increased 22%, and non-GAAP EPS of $7.50 was up 27%, with exchange rates reducing reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth by over 2 points each. We are now in fiscal year 2023 and through the first three weeks of October, business trends have remained strong and stable. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 11%, with debit up 9% and credit up 14%. U.S. spend growth versus 2019 was up 47%, with debit up 57% and credit up 39%. These trends are consistent with the fourth quarter and with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 12% year-over-year, up 40% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe grew 42% year-over-year and was 33% over 2019. Card-not-present non-travel growth were 61% above 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 18% above 2019. Moving now to our perspectives for the coming year. Forecasting four quarters ahead has been difficult through the COVID years. While COVID impact is now largely behind us, as you all know, we are in a very uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. As we have said before, we are not economic forecasters. Clearly, there\u2019s a high risk of a global recession, but we do not have a specific point of view on if, when or the kind of recession we might have. For internal planning purposes, we are assuming no recession. Of course, we will stay very vigilant, closely monitoring our trends day-by-day. We will stay very flexible. We will have contingency plans in place should we have an economic or geopolitical shock that impacts our business. And we will be prepared to act fast should we need to. So that is the context for our planning assumptions, which I will walk through now, starting with revenue drivers. Payments volume and processed transaction indexed to 2019 have been very stable in the U.S. and globally for the past three quarters. In other words, we believe the recovery from COVID is behind us when it comes to domestic spending. We are assuming this stability sustains through fiscal year 2023 with normal year-over-year growth rates in the low-double digits for both business drivers. On payments volumes, Russia will impact growth rates in the first half. Russia will not impact reported processed transactions growth. Cross-border e-commerce trends have also been stable, especially when you adjust for Russia and crypto-related volatility. We are assuming cross-border e-commerce growth rate sustain in the mid-teens, excluding Russia and crypto, and in the low-double digits with Russia and crypto impact included. Cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe, has continued to recover but at a slower pace, up 6 points from 112 to 118 index to 2019 between June and September. For planning purposes, we are assuming that this recent month-to-month pace of recovery sustains through fiscal year 2023. As was the case last year, there will be periods of deceleration and acceleration. Hopefully, China starts easing restrictions as we enter calendar year 2023. Two variables will have a significant impact on our reported revenue growth in fiscal year 2023, Russia and the dollar, which has strengthened to extraordinary levels through fiscal year 2022. Since we discontinued operations in late March, Russia will reduce first half fiscal year 2023 revenue growth by over 4 points, with 4 points in the first quarter and as much as 5 points in the second quarter. But as you might recall, we recorded two quarters worth of service fees in fiscal year 2022. Russia will obviously have no impact in the second half. Russia will reduce full year net revenue growth by 5 points. We faced very stiff exchange rate headwinds as we enter fiscal year 2023. Based on where the dollar is today and the forward curve, exchange rates will reduce reported net revenue growth in fiscal year 2023 by around 4 points. Since the dollar strengthened through fiscal year 2022, the impact is greater in the first quarter at around 5 points, around 4.5 points in the second quarter and moderate through the year. When you pull all this together, our planning assumptions get us to mid-teens constant dollar net revenue growth on a run rate basis, i.e., adjusted for Russia. With a 2-point Russia impact and a 4-point exchange rate headwind, reported nominal dollar fiscal year 2023 net revenue growth would be in the high-single digits. Client incentives are expected to be in the 26.5% to 27.5% range as a percent of gross revenues. With a 4-point Russia drag and a stiffer exchange rate headwind, first half reported nominal dollar net revenue growth is expected to be lower than the second half, lowest growth in the second quarter, which has the largest Russia impact and stepping up in the third and fourth quarters with no Russia drag and hopefully a moderating exchange rate headwind. Moving on to operating expenses. We are managing expense growth in line with our revenue growth expectations, rigorously prioritizing investment plans. As you know, this is a long cycle business. Investments we make today will have revenue growth two year to three years out. It is important for us to continue to fund key growth initiatives across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. As Al said, we have extraordinary growth opportunities and need to ensure we are investing to realize their potential. Our current plans are for low double-digit non-GAAP operating expense growth in constant dollars, high single digits in nominal dollars, Tink and Currencycloud, which closed during fiscal year 2022 at about 1 point to expense growth, offset by the discontinuation of Russia operations and exchange rate changes, which are expected to be about a 1.5 point benefit each. Non-GAAP operating expense growth will be higher in the first half for two reasons. First, Tink and Currencycloud add 2 points to expense growth in the first half. Also in the first half, we lapped a lower expense base last year since we stepped up investment spending through the year as the cross-border recovery accelerated. As such, non-GAAP expense growth in nominal dollars is expected to be in the low-double digits in the first half and at the high end of mid-single digits in the second half, highest in the first quarter, which is also impacted by the FIFA World Cup and moderating through the year. Should there be a recession or a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our planning assumptions, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel and other controllable categories. In a business like ours, this always requires a careful balance between short- and long-term considerations. As interest rates have risen, non-operating expense will benefit from higher interest income from our cash balances. We currently expect non-operating expense to be in the $200 million, $250 million range for fiscal year 2023. We will provide quarterly updates through the year. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in FY 2023. Honing in on the first quarter, based on everything I just walked through, we expect reported nominal dollar net revenue growth in the high single-digit range, with client incentives on par with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. Nominal dollar non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to be in the low teens. The tax rate could be lower than the 19% to 19.5% range in the first quarter, depending on the resolution of some items. Second quarter net revenue growth is expected to be lower than the first quarter because of the Russia impact, which is higher. Second quarter operating expense growth is also expected to moderate to the low end of double digits. In summary, we assume stable conditions through fiscal year 2023. We are prepared to act fast should circumstances change. Regardless of near-term uncertainties, we remain as certain as we have ever been about our extraordinary long-term growth opportunity. There is still plenty of cash to digitize in core consumer payments. We are accelerating volume growth by vastly expanding the use cases we can serve through our new flows business, while enhancing the yield on transactions in our network by layering on value-added services. With that, I will turn this back to Jennifer.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Vasant. And with that, we are ready to take questions, Holly.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Al. I wanted to follow up on your comment in the prepared remarks about Visa now having 4.3 billion tokens, up doubling more than 2x year-on-year. Can you elaborate a bit on a couple of aspects of tokenization? First, have you made any progress or what level of progress have you made on selling your tokenization services as a value-added service into other networks -- alternative networks? And then also on some of -- given that you don\u2019t monetize tokens directly, what -- how should we think about the indirect benefits of tokenization to Visa now that the number of tokens exceeds card credentials out there? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Yeah. It\u2019s 4 point -- I think you said 4.3 billion, Lisa. It\u2019s 4.8 billion. We have had some but not a tremendous amount of success yet in terms of selling tokens into other networks. We view it as a -- we play a critical role in the ecosystem and we view tokenization as critical to the security of the ecosystem and then, ultimately, the trust of the ecosystem as it relates to card transactions that convert get -- their cards converted to token. So over time, we expect this to have very positive impacts on our issuers and merchants in terms of fraud. There are a few cases, the clearinghouse being one, global payments being another where I know that we are getting revenue today from the tokenization capability that we are building for them.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much. Could you gauge the impact on processed transaction growth for FY 2023 from U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s enforcement of two unaffiliated networks to process every online U.S. debit transaction beginning July 1, 2023? And related to that, do you have any mitigation strategies to offset the impact, for example, potentially adjusting prices?\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. I will answer the first part of the question. I am sure Al will have more to add on the second part. Obviously, we have to wait and see the pace at which the second network is enabled on cards on e-commerce transactions. Our current expectation, given that our fiscal year, as you know, goes through September is that the effect in 2023 will be minimal, if any. But we will keep you posted. More broadly, just in terms of our views about the impact longer term, people come to us because of the value we create and that value comes in the form of having a dual message network and everything that goes with it, the security and the reliability we offer that is unmatched, as well as the dispute resolution and other sets of services, tokenization, all our risk management services that we layer on. We have competed for business in the past and merchants have chosen us based on the value we provide, and I am sure, Al, you have more to add on this front.\nAl Kelly: Yeah. I think that our capabilities are just terrific and in an e-commerce world, David, the liability for fraud sits with the merchant. So they are going to be very, very careful about who they do business with and they have done business with us for years and know that we have very, very strong risk capabilities, very, very strong fraud prevention capabilities. And those are the types of things that in our experience since Durbin in 2010 that have a good amount of merchants who solely stick with us, they never route to the unaffiliated network because of those security and fraud capabilities we have, plus as Vasant alluded to the fact that we have the ability to be dual message, which makes a big difference in car rental, hotel. And in the online world, we will make a big difference when people order multiple items from a merchant. It will allow the merchant to ship in different shipments as opposed to waiting until all the products are gathered and they can ship it and they are forced to ship at onetime if you are using a single messaging capability. So I think we have a lot of history and a lot of important capability differences and a lot of our merchants in the United States are very familiar with the strengths that they get from doing business with us.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: And our next question is from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Hey, guys. Thanks. Your outlook and your budget you gave us was obviously helpful and I clearly underscores the resilient of the consumer so far. But just to touch on the water for a minute. And I think you have about a third of your revenues now coming from new flows, services, many of which had are early stages of growth. So putting that together with higher inflation, Al, would you expect any type of difference and set of outcomes on the topline if we were to see a notable downturn? And then, Vasant, just maybe you could touch on the flexibility you think you have on the expense side to help manage through any type of change?\nAl Kelly: So, Darrin, just to be clear, your one-third is about right for that [ph] plus new flows, not just\u2026\nDarrin Peller: Right.\nAl Kelly: Not just new flows.\nDarrin Peller: Yeah.\nAl Kelly: As you alluded to, I mean, right now, we are seeing nothing but stability and it\u2019s been true over the last numbers of quarters. And our business is very different than it was the last time there was a downturn. We are much more into everyday spend categories. E-commerce has evolved tremendously. There\u2019s been a lot more cash digitization. We have a very heavy debit portfolio, which tends to perform better during these downturns. And frankly, I don\u2019t think any of us know what the impact is going to be coming off of the pandemic where there still seems to be a lot of pent-up demand for travel, for example, which is a highly discretionary purchase and we are in an unusual time where employment has really held up. So we will certainly watch if payment volumes are impacted in any kind of significant way. Back to the core of your question, obviously, we will have some hit on our revenue line, but we will continue to manage on the expense side and I will let Vasant take that half of the question.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. I mean and continuing on revenue for a minute, I mean, clearly, we now have new flows and value-added services, which are businesses, which are in new use cases that are very different than we have had in past times when we had recessions. So and they are also ramping in many cases and value-added services clearly is a whole range of new services that are not necessarily all tied to economic ups and downs. So clearly, there\u2019s a lot of differences from the past. But as Al said, recessions can come in all forms and shapes and sizes, and they could be global or regional. They could be deep or shallow. They could be recessions that have lesser impact on consumer spending and so on. As it relates to expenses, as I said in my comments on planning assumptions, I\u2019d say three things. One, we are moderating expense growth as we go into the year. So expense growth is clearly coming down from the levels you have seen. For the year, our going-in planning assumption is nominal growth of about 9%. But I would just note that in the second half of the year -- the fiscal year, the growth is actually at the high end of mid-single digits. So it is moderating through the year and we don\u2019t know when there will be a recession or if there will be a recession. But if you look at what all the various prognosticators are saying, it appears that most people think if there\u2019s going to be a recession, it\u2019s sometime next year, probably, six months from now. Now that would put us in the second half of our fiscal year. So we already have expense growth moderating to the sort of the high end of mid-single digits. Clearly, we will look to reprioritize, scale back, postpone, et cetera. And depending on the nature of the recession and the impact it\u2019s having on our revenue, we would seek to manage our expenses to be even better than what our planning assumptions might be and bring the rate -- growth rate down. So we will calibrate as we go along.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. You may go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Appreciate it. Al, I was wondering maybe just if you could give some thoughts on what are you most excited about as we head into 2023 and 2024, and what has surprised you and -- if anything? And Vasant, can you give us a little bit of color on goods versus services, have you seen the -- what the trend on growth rates have you seen on those two items?\nAl Kelly: So in terms of what we are excited about, look, I think in all three businesses, we are seeing some really terrific green shoots and in the consumer payments, certainly excited about the realities of cash digitization getting more and more pronounced around the world. We are certainly excited about the continued progress we are seeing in Tap to Pay. The fact that our business in e-commerce has grown so much, really like what we are seeing in the continent in Europe in terms of the growth that we are seeing there, which is really strong. If we look at India, Brazil, Germany, Canada, Japan, all are growing at very, very good levels. There\u2019s very different dynamics in each of those markets, but they are all growing very well. I just recently took a trip to Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Africa is a place that\u2019s not going to help us in 2023 or 2024 necessarily, Bob. But the last -- we now have offices, I think, in 13 countries there in the last five or six offices we have opened there, opened around the world in Africa. In new flows, as we have organized that business as a single business, Oliver Jenkyn is bringing a great focus to it and making sure that we are driving new use cases around the globe, getting more and more enablers who help us drive those use cases and we are putting a particular focus there on B2 -- cross-border where previously, a lot of the early transact \u2013 early use cases in new flows have been in the area of things like domestic like P2P and B2B. And then in VAS [ph], certainly, we are excited about the two recent acquisitions we made of Tink and Currencycloud. I think they are both going to bring some very interesting and good capabilities to us. And we are -- in both cases, we have spent a lot of time and planning sessions between the folks who are running those businesses and our folks, and I think, there\u2019s a great opportunity ahead. Vasant, do you want to tackle the goods versus services question?\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. A few things on goods versus services, as you know, we tend to look at how various segments are performing versus the pre-pandemic level in 2019. It\u2019s a clean way to look at things. And while there\u2019s been a lot of talk about how goods are underperforming, most of the goods categories index for 2019 actually have done quite well and they are holding quite stable. What it means is that they grew a lot faster in the early parts of the recovery and then haven\u2019t grown as fast as people shifted from goods to services. But overall, if you compare to 2019, the goods business has done very well, indexing very well to where it was and very much either on or above the pre-COVID trend line. More recently, even as services and restaurants, travel, entertainment, have continued to grow, we are starting to see goods do better. So they went through a period where they had very high growth, especially through the stimulus period and so on, recovered much faster than services, then services to come back. We are starting to see some recovery on the goods side, too now. But overall, goods is doing quite well on a three-year index, too.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Harshita Rawat. You may go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Thank you for taking my question. Vasant, can you talk about actually [ph] on cross-border revenues in 2023? I know there\u2019s still recovery to be had if you just look at, like, trend line on travel versus 2019 and also if you look at, like, metrics beyond spend, which is inflation in that. But on the flip side, this has very high beta to macro. U.S. dollar has strengthened a lot, which can impact cross-border inflows into the U.S. and FX volatility was a big benefit in revenue this year, but you are kind of against kind of tough comps next year. So lots of moving pieces, can you -- how are you thinking about it? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. Clearly, lots of moving pieces, as you pointed out. So I will just go through them one by one. Yes, we did benefit from very high currency volatility in the second half of this year and that does help us, as you know. It\u2019s in our international fees line, international revenue line and what volatility is going to be is anybody\u2019s guess. For planning purposes, we assume that it starts to moderate through the year. It\u2019s still high and we are assuming that it will be maybe higher than normal in the first quarter and then moderates as we go through the year to what we have seen in the past to levels that are normal over a long period of time. So that\u2019s the impact of volatility. As it relates to the dollar and its impact on cross-border travel, we have told you that we have seen about a 2-point monthly improvement in that index in the last few months. And again, I mean, it\u2019s very hard to predict these things. You know we got it wrong last year. The recovery was a hell of a lot faster than we expected. We will probably get it wrong again, but we have been very clear about our assumption, which is that the recovery we have seen for the past several months, we think is probably the new rate of recovery. There will be accelerations and decelerations and maybe if China opens up and lift restrictions, there could be some acceleration. So that\u2019s sort of what we are assuming for travel. What impact of recession might have on it remains to be seen. As Al say, there\u2019s pent-up demand and how much will that offset it, we will wait and see. The main message is there\u2019s still recovery in cross-border happening, but we are also lapping much stronger cross-border levels from last year. As you know, cross-border travel really started to recover last September and so we are now beginning to lap some really stronger periods last quarter. So the rate of growth inevitably has slowed, and it will continue to slow through the year, but it\u2019s still above the long-term trend line, because we still are in recovery mode. So, hopefully, that helps a bit.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. You may go ahead.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. From a headline perspective, I guess, if you are seeing nothing but stability that has been the situation for a few months, as you mentioned, are there things to highlight on a more granular basis if there are particular areas of strength or weakness? So that\u2019s part one. But then it also seems that you are implying that the business as a whole is more resilient, because you have new flows and value-added services in addition to consumer pay and kind of agree with that. But could you maybe talk about the new flows and value-added, what you might see in a downturn?\nAl Kelly: First of all, Ashwin, we -- I\u2019d say, we have seen stable for more than a few months, but probably pretty close to the last 12 months, certainly in the last nine months. Look, there\u2019s -- as I said, while there\u2019s stability, the reality is we do know that there\u2019s some changes in consumer behavior going on, but they are still spending the same amount of money and they are still paying in the same way, which are critical to us. So we know there\u2019s some substitution going on, where people are buying generics versus buying brands. We know that people are spending a certain amount on that\u2019s -- an increased amount on food and drug products, and that\u2019s causing them to have less money available for discretionary spending. But and we are still seeing -- as I highlighted, I think, last quarter, the affluent customer is still jumping back in the market and that\u2019s a very, very good thing because of the amount of spend they do and we are still seeing employment levels at a very healthy level. So we know this stuff that is going on, but the reality is that all consumers might be altering a bit what they buy in different categories. The realities are that -- as I said, they are still spending the same amount of money and using the same ways to pay as they did before. In terms of value-added services and new flows, obviously, value-added services is somewhat dependent on transactions. So we provide additional value on transactions. If those were transactions were to go down, that obviously impacts the value-added services business. The net flows business really took a bit of a hit, because of the amount of business that we had in Russia. But as I reported it, it was up 42% in the fourth quarter, excluding Russia, which was up 7 points in the third quarter. So the momentum is very, very good there. And I think that, that has a lot to do with the fact that over the last 15 months, we have done a really good job of further diversifying that business in terms of use cases, enablers and geographies and all of that\u2019s helped us a lot.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I want to talk about the Visa Direct decision. So by businesses, platforms, governments that are deciding to use Visa Direct relative to other alternatives like RTP systems around the world. And I fully appreciate that Visa Direct leverages, many of these RTP and other ACH systems around the world, but what is it that is causing them to choose Visa Direct? And as a follow-up, you have often talked about the pricing for Visa Direct, it\u2019s very use case-based. Maybe you could just give directional examples of what a higher priced use case might be and what a lower price use case might be?\nAl Kelly: On the -- let me first tackle the -- why Visa Direct. First of all, Visa Direct biggest advantage is that it uses the VisaNet platform, and therefore, comes along with all the capabilities of the VisaNet platform. Second, we have incredible reach with Visa Direct, as I talked about, almost 7 billion endpoints, including accounts cards and wallets. And as you alluded to, we have become a bit agnostic of exactly how that flow happens, if the first or last mile is on an RTP network or an ACH network or a payment gateway, that\u2019s fine by us. And we are continuing to invest in capabilities as it relates to Visa Direct, and then you get a lot of the protections that you get 0 liability, charge-backs, dispute manage -- good solid dispute management, the fact that you get the security and the monies that we spend on protecting consumer data, as well as battling cyber security. And all of those capabilities offer an awful lot of peace of mind to a consumer versus a transaction where the money is immediately moved from your bank account across an RTP network to pay somebody. And all of a sudden, if there\u2019s an issue, there\u2019s nobody to turn to. There\u2019s no rules governing what happens. There\u2019s nobody to help mediate what\u2019s happening. All those things are things that our network does that makes Visa Direct a really, really strong alternative to an RTP network.\nVasant Prabhu: In regarding to your second question, maybe we will give you two examples. At one end is a high value use case and that will be cross-border remittances. The use of Visa Direct gives you extraordinary flexibility. You can do it account-to-account, account-to-account, account-to-account, sitting at home, you don\u2019t have to go to someone to give them cash. It\u2019s also tremendous flexibility at the other end in terms of how someone receives the money. It\u2019s real time. It has all the other benefits Al mentioned. As you know, cross-border remittances have a very high cost right now. We can do all that for a lot less and still have a yield that is quite attractive relative to our traditional yield. At the other end of the spectrum, P2P, very much a preferred way to do it is to have your debit credentials in there, because it makes it a lot more secure and has all the value we can add. It\u2019s a high volume but lower yielding use case and very often it\u2019s the way we get going in most markets. So those are two examples, and in between, you have insurance disbursements, earn wage access, marketplace payouts and so on, all of which are different.\nJennifer Como: Last question please, Holly.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang. You may go ahead. With JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you. Thank you so much. I know you have gone beyond the hour. Thanks for the time. Just two quick ones, if you don\u2019t mind. Just on the other revenue line. I know services, you had mentioned there is some transactional element to it, but you did 20% growth at scale in fiscal 2022. So any thoughts on how 2023 might come together, assuming relative stability? And then I just wanted to clarify the base case on operating leverage, it looks like on a nominal basis, we should assume minimal operating leverage. I just want to make sure we are hearing that correctly and how that might flex if things change? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. On operating leverage, as we said, we are trying to balance the short-term and the long-term. As you have heard, we think there are extraordinary opportunities in new flows and value-added services. These are long-cycle businesses. You have to invest now for the future. So, yes, we are choosing to invest in the business and that reflects the expenses that we plan -- our expense growth plan relative to the revenue growth. And the other part of the question was other revenues\u2026\nTien-Tsin Huang: Other revenue.\nVasant Prabhu: Right. On other revenues, yeah, there are some things there that will also have some sequential slowdown, because there are things like car-related benefits and so on in the other revenue line that are linked to travel. And as you lap a stronger recovery of travel from last year, there will be some sequential slowdown. There are also a few other value-added services there. So just like the overall business where there is a sequential slowdown because of the lapping effects and some currency impacts in Russia and so on, you will see that in the other revenue line, too.\nJennifer Como: Great. And with that, we would like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our Investor Relations team. Thanks again and have a great day.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Al Kelly",
            "content": "Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Visa's performance in 2022 was very strong even with the uncertainty created by inflation, the war in Ukraine, COVID, the timing of cross-border travel recovery and a potential recession. On a full year basis, credentials increased 9% year-over-year and are up 13% excluding Russia. We crossed 4.8 billion tokens surpassing the number of card credentials and almost doubling from last year. Merchant locations, including locations from payment facilitators grew 11%. Global Tap to Pay penetration grew 10% -- 10 points to 54% of face-to-face transactions excluding Russia and this was helped by 20 additional countries crossing over the 50% penetration mark. Excluding the U.S. and Russia, global Tap to Pay penetration was 71%. Visa's network processed 70% more Tap to Ride transactions on global transit systems in FY 2022, surpassing 1 billion transactions for the first time ever. In FY 2022, we signed over 400 commercial partnerships with fintechs globally from early-stage companies to growing and mature players. Visa Direct had 5.9 billion transactions excluding Russia, across 60 plus use cases and over 2,000 programs helped by more than 500 enablers. Over half of our clients utilized five or more value-added services in 2022 and a third used 10 or more. All of this helped to drive fiscal full year net revenues up 22% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $7.50, up 27%. Now let me transition to our fourth quarter performance and key highlights and then make a few comments about 2023. Fourth quarter net revenues grew 19% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, up 19%. Total Q4 payments volume was up 10% year-over-year or 135% versus three years ago, down 1 point from Q3. Excluding Russia and China, payments volume was up 16% or 145% of 2019. U.S. Q4 payments volume was up 12% year-over-year or 145% of 2019, down 1 point. International volume was up 9% year-over-year or 126% of 2019, down 1 point versus Q3. Excluding Russia and China, International volume was up 20% or 146% of 2019, flat to Q3. Q4 cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe were up 49% year-over-year and 130% versus three years ago, up 7 points from Q3. Excluding Russia, cross-border year-over-year growth was higher by about 5 points. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 12 points from 104% of 2019 in Q3 to 116% in Q4 as travel continued to recover. Processed transactions were up 12% year-over-year or 140% versus 2019 and we processed 553 million transactions a day during the quarter. Now I will provide an update on the drivers that propel this growth in consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Our consumer payment strategy has three components to it, growing credentials, increasing acceptance and deepening engagement. Total consumer payments revenue for the fourth quarter and the year were both up more than 20% in constant dollars. On the credential side, we signed several significant deals with financial institution clients, co-brands and fintechs in the fourth quarter. Starting with financial institution clients in our Asia-Pacific region, we signed with China Construction Bank, Bank of Communications and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, leading banks in China. Throughout fiscal year 2022, we have renewed with eight of our top China issuers. In our CEMEA region, we signed with National Bank of Kuwait, the largest bank in Kuwait, and ADIB, the largest Islamic issuer in the UAE. In Latin America, we renewed and expanded our partnership relationship with the second largest bank in Colombia, Banco Davivienda, including credit, debit, commercial and Visa Direct. Another key renewal in Latin America this quarter was with Dock, one of the Visa's a few full stock enablers providing BINs [ph] sponsorship, issuer processing, acquiring as a service and program management via a single connection, already servicing more than 100 fintechs in Brazil, Dock will expand across new markets, including Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, the Dominican Republic and Ecuador. In Europe, we renewed and expanded our relationship with UBS, the largest issuer in Switzerland. We made excellent progress in Germany with our share growing significantly since 2018, adding more than 12 million debit credentials in the market. Visa Debit is now offered by three of the most significant banks in the market, ING, DKB and comdirect. And we are also pleased to announce that Santander Germany will begin issuance in 2023, making Visa the single scheme of choice for Santander in that country across debit and credit. Altogether, across the European continent, our quarterly active credentials were up 18% year-over-year. In the co-brand space, we continue to expand our position in several countries with two recent wins and an extension. First, in India with the Samsung co-brand card targeting existing and prospective Samsung users. Second, in the U.S., Visa and Kohl's with Capital One as the issuer recently entered into an agreement to launch at Kohl's co-branded Visa credit card. And also in the U.S., we are excited to share that Visa signed a multiyear co-brand agreement extension with Disney for cards issued by JPMorgan Chase. Now moving to fintech and wallet clients. In Egypt, mobile network operated Etisalat Egypt with more than 28 million customers has signed a deal for virtual and physical card issuance. The first digital bank in Iraq, Visa Iraq Islamic banks seeking to digitize payments and drive a cashless society through Visa credit, debit and prepaid card issuance across their 400,000 customers. And large cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, with over 5 million registered users has signed on to expand issuance of Visa credentials beyond the U.S. to over 40 countries, bringing our total number of issuing partnerships with crypto platforms to more than 70. Finally, GoHenry Group is the U.S., U.K. and Europe-based fintech that provides prepaid cards and financial education app for children age six to 18 to over 2 million members. They will be expanding their U.K. Visa issuance to Continental Europe and the U.S. On the acceptance front, we signed an agreement with Flywire, a global payments enabler and software company that supports the higher education industry to grow card acceptance in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Korea. In Mexico, we renewed our relationship with Clip, an important payment facilitator, which will aid in the expansion of acceptance to micro, small and medium merchants. In Mexico, we have more than doubled acceptance since 2019 to nearly 3 million merchant locations. Our efforts across Latin America to grow acceptance and win processing share has paid off. Outside of Brazil, we have expanded our processing penetration by more than 20 points since 2019, with the migrations of domestic transactions in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and, most recently, Uruguay. Customer engagement is very important, and Tap to Pay is one of the best ways to pay in the face-to-face environment. In Q4, the U.S. reached 28% penetration and saw more than 1 billion tap monthly transactions for the first time ever in July, surpassing the U.K. as the largest country for Tap to Pay transactions and this is nearly double the number of transactions from last year and more than 5 times the number of transactions from two years ago. Now moving on to new flows, which grew fourth quarter and full year revenue over 20% in constant dollars. Our B2B business had nearly $1.5 trillion in payments volume for the full year, growing 30% in constant dollars. In the fourth quarter, B2B payments volume was almost $400 billion, growing 21% year-over-year in constant dollars. Within B2B, our strategy is focused on card-based payments, cross-border payments and accounts receivable and accounts payable payments, and we have made progress across all three this quarter. Visa has signed a long-term agreement with European payments as a service provider, Modulr, to issue Visa virtual cards to support B2B travel clients issuing out of Europe. Also in Europe, Visa won the credit card portfolio, Cre\u0301dit du Nord, encompassing Societe Generale in addition to renewing consumer credit and debit portfolios in both industries. We also recently reached a new fleet product partnership agreement with Edenred, I am sorry, which is making their Edenred essentials product available to commercial and public sector organizations with vehicles in the United States. In cross-border flows, we signed an agreement with Visa B2B Connect with TD Bank, our first bank in Canada. We also signed banks for the first time in Switzerland and Korea. And recently, our CEMEA region signed five banks across Kazakhstan, Qatar and Azerbaijan. In the accounts receivable and payable space, MineralTree, a U.S. automated invoice-to-payment solution provider for the middle market and enterprise businesses, recently enhanced their relationship with Visa to support cards for their payables customers. For other new flows, Visa Direct grew transactions 36% this year excluding Russia, reaching 5.9 billion transactions. In the fourth quarter, Visa Direct had 1.7 billion transactions and grew 42%, up 7 points from Q3. In addition to growing the existing Visa Direct business, our strategy for growth includes; one, scaling new use cases with a particular focus on cross-border; two, expanding existing use cases to new geographies; and three, accelerating through enablers. In terms of scaling new use cases, I am pleased that eBay, one of the largest third-party marketplaces in the world has enabled faster payouts for its sellers via Visa Direct in the U.S. We recently signed a deal in the U.S. with Gopuff, a consumer goods and food delivery service with millions of customers across hundreds of U.S. cities, to provide their delivery partners the ability to cash out their earnings balance in real-time. In terms of bringing existing use cases to new geographies, in addition to some of the issuing deals I mentioned earlier, we have also signed Visa Direct deals with China Construction Bank and Etisalat Egypt. Other new geographies also include Norway, Norwegian mobile payment application, Vipps, will offer users access to Visa Direct for all domestic payments. This will improve the card-based experience for Vipps, roughly 4.3 million users covering over 80% of Norway's population. On the enabler strategy, Square has expanded their instant transfers to Canada, offering their business as a way to have faster merchant settlement opportunities. U.S. money movement automation platform, Astra, is using Visa Direct to let developers add real-time transfer functionality to their applications. So millions of its end users can fund cards, wallets and demand deposit accounts with their eligible debit cards. Visa Direct has extensive reach, including more than 3 billion cards and over 2 billion accounts. Recently, Visa Direct has signed with Singapore-based payments infrastructure platform, Thunes, with a network of mobile wallets across 44 countries and territories. Our partnership will add a send-to-wallet capability with either direct through Thunes' B2B payment platform and provide access to 78 already integrated digital wallet providers, representing over 1.5 billion digital wallets globally. So with this partnership, we will expand our total reach to nearly 7 billion end points covering cards, accounts and wallets. As part of new flows, aligned with our global network of network strategy, we are focused on building the infrastructure that enables our clients to deliver cross-border products and services for their customers. One of our newest capabilities in this space, Currencycloud, signed 35 new partnerships this quarter, including Paycent, a global end-to-end payment platform with over 7 million customers and 17,000 SMEs. Paycent intends to expand capabilities of its Paycent business platform for clients to collect and hold up to 34 currencies and seamlessly convert funds back to the required currency at competitive FX rates. Now moving to value-added services, which had $6 billion in revenue for 2022, up 20% in constant dollars. For the fourth quarter, revenues were up $1.7 billion and grew 20% in cost dollars as well. Our strategy here is also three-fold; one, to deepen client penetration of existing products; two, to build new products and launch new solutions; and three, to extend geographically. On the first, deepen client penetration of existing products, let's explore two of our largest value-added services businesses, DPS, debit processing services and CyberSource. DPS, our issuer processing business, hit a major milestone, exceeding $2 trillion in annual authorization volume in FY 2022. DPS has also renewed with nearly 30 clients, representing over $600 billion in annual DPS processed authorization volume. CyberSource remains a compelling gateway solution for merchants and most recently signed McDonald's, Little Caesars and JetBlue. We also continue to expand CyberSource relationships with acquirers, first with the Bank of New Zealand, New Zealand's largest acquirer. Together with Japanese acquired SMCC, CyberSource continues to provide payment processing solutions for more than 100,000 terminals in both card-present and card-not-present environment. SMCC is also leveraging CyberSource's capabilities for value-added services such as fraud management. Most recently, CyberSource is powering SMCC's expansion of the EMV transit acceptance and supporting commercial and pilot launches with 24 different transit operators across Japan. Deutsche Bank will offer CyberSource's Decision Manager to its merchants so that they can receive a risk value for each e-commerce transaction using rules and AI to help prevent online retail fraud. On the second strategy, build new products and launch great new solutions, our recently acquired capability, Tink, is a real example. Tink recently signed Adyen to offer a white-label pay-by-bank open banking solution on its single platform. Adyen will utilize Tink's payment initiation technology, so businesses can enable account-to-account payments. Adyen's open banking integration will launch first in the U.K. with plan to expand to multiple markets during 2023. Last quarter, I mentioned our newly developed risk-as-a-service capabilities powered by our network level data, AI capabilities and our risk experts. Recently, Navy Federal in the U.S. and several banks in CEMEA signed engagements for the service, which aims to deliver enhanced fraud prevention and management. On our third strategy is to extend geographically, in many cases, through tailored solutions. Since our acquisition of Visa Europe, we have made significant effort to bring value-added services to clients. Across Europe, clients enrolling onto Visa advance through authentication and Visa risk management products tripled between October 2019 and September 2022. And these clients span across 14 different European countries. In CEMEA, Visa Risk Manager launched a network-agnostic pilot with Emirates NBD, a leading issuer in the UAE. As part of Visa's network of network strategy, network-agnostic VRM will allow clients to manage card payment risk across their entire portfolio. We recently brought our Buy Now, Pay Later solution to Canada and have continued to make progress adding some of Canada's largest merchants, including Simon's and Canada Computers. And RBC and Visa have entered into an agreement to launch the Visa Installment solution on eligible RBC consumer credit cards. In conclusion, our 2022 performance was very strong and demonstrated that our strategy for each of our growth levers are delivering. We see new flows as a way to drive additional volumes and transactions and value-added services as a way to drive additional yield on existing volumes and transactions. Vasant is going to go into a lot more detail, but let me make four points about 2023. One, in the year ahead, I see significant opportunity for the business across all three of our growth areas, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Two, we faced some headwinds, in particular, lapping Visa and a challenging FX environment. Three, we did not factor a steep economic downturn or a recession into our numbers. To the one -- to the extent one occurs, it will have some impact. Four, we will continue to manage our business for the medium- and long-term, and we will invest in initiatives that are compelling and will provide future growth. That said, we recognize that some economies around the world could face increased pressure. So we will be monitoring things very closely. We will, as we have in past periods, be flexible and prudent in the management of our expenses. As a leadership team, we have demonstrated Visa's ability to manage through many different environments, and I remain confident that our strategy will continue to position Visa at the center of money movement for years to come. With that, over to Vasant. Yeah. It's 4 point -- I think you said 4.3 billion, Lisa. It's 4.8 billion. We have had some but not a tremendous amount of success yet in terms of selling tokens into other networks. We view it as a -- we play a critical role in the ecosystem and we view tokenization as critical to the security of the ecosystem and then, ultimately, the trust of the ecosystem as it relates to card transactions that convert get -- their cards converted to token. So over time, we expect this to have very positive impacts on our issuers and merchants in terms of fraud. There are a few cases, the clearinghouse being one, global payments being another where I know that we are getting revenue today from the tokenization capability that we are building for them. Yeah. I think that our capabilities are just terrific and in an e-commerce world, David, the liability for fraud sits with the merchant. So they are going to be very, very careful about who they do business with and they have done business with us for years and know that we have very, very strong risk capabilities, very, very strong fraud prevention capabilities. And those are the types of things that in our experience since Durbin in 2010 that have a good amount of merchants who solely stick with us, they never route to the unaffiliated network because of those security and fraud capabilities we have, plus as Vasant alluded to the fact that we have the ability to be dual message, which makes a big difference in car rental, hotel. And in the online world, we will make a big difference when people order multiple items from a merchant. It will allow the merchant to ship in different shipments as opposed to waiting until all the products are gathered and they can ship it and they are forced to ship at onetime if you are using a single messaging capability. So I think we have a lot of history and a lot of important capability differences and a lot of our merchants in the United States are very familiar with the strengths that they get from doing business with us. So, Darrin, just to be clear, your one-third is about right for that [ph] plus new flows, not just... Not just new flows. As you alluded to, I mean, right now, we are seeing nothing but stability and it's been true over the last numbers of quarters. And our business is very different than it was the last time there was a downturn. We are much more into everyday spend categories. E-commerce has evolved tremendously. There's been a lot more cash digitization. We have a very heavy debit portfolio, which tends to perform better during these downturns. And frankly, I don't think any of us know what the impact is going to be coming off of the pandemic where there still seems to be a lot of pent-up demand for travel, for example, which is a highly discretionary purchase and we are in an unusual time where employment has really held up. So we will certainly watch if payment volumes are impacted in any kind of significant way. Back to the core of your question, obviously, we will have some hit on our revenue line, but we will continue to manage on the expense side and I will let Vasant take that half of the question. So in terms of what we are excited about, look, I think in all three businesses, we are seeing some really terrific green shoots and in the consumer payments, certainly excited about the realities of cash digitization getting more and more pronounced around the world. We are certainly excited about the continued progress we are seeing in Tap to Pay. The fact that our business in e-commerce has grown so much, really like what we are seeing in the continent in Europe in terms of the growth that we are seeing there, which is really strong. If we look at India, Brazil, Germany, Canada, Japan, all are growing at very, very good levels. There's very different dynamics in each of those markets, but they are all growing very well. I just recently took a trip to Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Africa is a place that's not going to help us in 2023 or 2024 necessarily, Bob. But the last -- we now have offices, I think, in 13 countries there in the last five or six offices we have opened there, opened around the world in Africa. In new flows, as we have organized that business as a single business, Oliver Jenkyn is bringing a great focus to it and making sure that we are driving new use cases around the globe, getting more and more enablers who help us drive those use cases and we are putting a particular focus there on B2 -- cross-border where previously, a lot of the early transact \u2013 early use cases in new flows have been in the area of things like domestic like P2P and B2B. And then in VAS [ph], certainly, we are excited about the two recent acquisitions we made of Tink and Currencycloud. I think they are both going to bring some very interesting and good capabilities to us. And we are -- in both cases, we have spent a lot of time and planning sessions between the folks who are running those businesses and our folks, and I think, there's a great opportunity ahead. Vasant, do you want to tackle the goods versus services question? First of all, Ashwin, we -- I'd say, we have seen stable for more than a few months, but probably pretty close to the last 12 months, certainly in the last nine months. Look, there's -- as I said, while there's stability, the reality is we do know that there's some changes in consumer behavior going on, but they are still spending the same amount of money and they are still paying in the same way, which are critical to us. So we know there's some substitution going on, where people are buying generics versus buying brands. We know that people are spending a certain amount on that's -- an increased amount on food and drug products, and that's causing them to have less money available for discretionary spending. But and we are still seeing -- as I highlighted, I think, last quarter, the affluent customer is still jumping back in the market and that's a very, very good thing because of the amount of spend they do and we are still seeing employment levels at a very healthy level. So we know this stuff that is going on, but the reality is that all consumers might be altering a bit what they buy in different categories. The realities are that -- as I said, they are still spending the same amount of money and using the same ways to pay as they did before. In terms of value-added services and new flows, obviously, value-added services is somewhat dependent on transactions. So we provide additional value on transactions. If those were transactions were to go down, that obviously impacts the value-added services business. The net flows business really took a bit of a hit, because of the amount of business that we had in Russia. But as I reported it, it was up 42% in the fourth quarter, excluding Russia, which was up 7 points in the third quarter. So the momentum is very, very good there. And I think that, that has a lot to do with the fact that over the last 15 months, we have done a really good job of further diversifying that business in terms of use cases, enablers and geographies and all of that's helped us a lot. On the -- let me first tackle the -- why Visa Direct. First of all, Visa Direct biggest advantage is that it uses the VisaNet platform, and therefore, comes along with all the capabilities of the VisaNet platform. Second, we have incredible reach with Visa Direct, as I talked about, almost 7 billion endpoints, including accounts cards and wallets. And as you alluded to, we have become a bit agnostic of exactly how that flow happens, if the first or last mile is on an RTP network or an ACH network or a payment gateway, that's fine by us. And we are continuing to invest in capabilities as it relates to Visa Direct, and then you get a lot of the protections that you get 0 liability, charge-backs, dispute manage -- good solid dispute management, the fact that you get the security and the monies that we spend on protecting consumer data, as well as battling cyber security. And all of those capabilities offer an awful lot of peace of mind to a consumer versus a transaction where the money is immediately moved from your bank account across an RTP network to pay somebody. And all of a sudden, if there's an issue, there's nobody to turn to. There's no rules governing what happens. There's nobody to help mediate what's happening. All those things are things that our network does that makes Visa Direct a really, really strong alternative to an RTP network."

            "content": "Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal fourth quarter results reflect sustained strength in domestic spending and continued recovery in cross-border travel. Net revenues were up 19% and GAAP EPS was up 13%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 19%. The strong dollar was a stiff headwind, dragging down reported net revenue growth by 4 points and non-GAAP EPS growth also by 4 points. Discontinuation of operations in Russia reduced net revenue growth by about 5 points. A few key highlights, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 10% year-over-year and 35% above 2019. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 16% year-over-year and 45% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 45% above 2019. In constant dollars, international payments volume, excluding China and Russia, was up 20% year-over-year and 46% above 2019. The cross-border travel recovery continues. However, the pace of recovery has moderated as most borders are now open, except China. Index to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe rose 12 points in the fourth quarter versus a 22-point gain in the third quarter. Our three growth engines, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues in excess of 20% in constant dollars. In fiscal year 2022, we bought back $11.6 billion of stock at an average price of $205.97. Contributions to the litigation escrow account, which have the same effect as a stock buyback, added another $850 million. We also paid out $3.2 billion in dividends. At the end of September, we had $5.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. In October, our Board authorized a new $12 billion stock buyback program and increased our dividend by 20%. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 17% year-over-year to 36% over 2019, helped by travel and entertainment spending. U.S. debit grew 7%. Relative to 2019, debit was up 54%, sustaining significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. U.S. cost present spend grew 11% year-over-year and was 27% above 2019. Card-not-present volume excluding travel grew 10% year-over-year and was 68% higher than 2019. E-commerce spending remained well above the pre-COVID trend line even as card-present spend continue to recover. On the International front, Latin America was up 33% year-over-year and 109% higher than 2019. Our CEMEA region excluding Russia grew 32% year-over-year and was 105% higher than 2019. Growth in both regions was fueled by client wins, cash digitization and acceptance expansion. Europe was up 12% year-over-year and 34% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion underway in the U.K. Ex-U.K., Europe volumes grew 30% year-over-year and was 67% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Asia-Pacific excluding China continues to recover, up 26% year-over-year and 32% above 2019. Global process transactions were up 12% year-over-year and 40% over 2019 levels. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, but including Russia in prior periods were up 49% year-over-year and 30% over 2019. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by approximately 5 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe grew 12% year-over-year and was 60% above 2019. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe grew 101% year-over-year and is now 16% above 2019. The cross-border travel index to 2019 went from 112 in June to 115 in July to 118 in September. While the recovery continues, the rate of improvement from month-to-month has slowed as borders ex-China are now open. Travel in and out of Asia recovered sharply in the quarter, up 16 points from the high 15 to the mid-70s index to 2019. There is more recovery to come in Asia, especially when China starts to lift restrictions. Summer travel in and out of Europe was also very strong, with a travel index to 2019 in the 130s, up 13 points from the third quarter. European travel appears to have benefited most from the strong dollar. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continued to pick up steam, rising to the mid-130s index to 2019, up 10 points from the third quarter. However, the inbound travel recovery was sluggish, still indexing in the low 90s and up only 4 points. The strong dollar and delays in Visa issuance from some countries appear to be impacting travel into the U.S. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean remained very strong and stable, indexing around 150 to 2019 levels. Finally, travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the mid-1 20s relative to 2019, up 10 points in the quarter. Moving now to a quick review of fourth quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 11% versus the 12% growth in Q3 constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag more than offset growth from utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 10% versus the 12% of this transaction growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia. However, our transactions growth is not. Adjusted for Russia, data processing revenues were up 15%. International transaction revenues were up 52% versus the 49% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and pricing actions more than offsetting the impact of the strong dollar. Other revenues grew 13% led by travel related programs and pricing actions. Client incentives were 26.9% of gross revenues in line with expectations. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines, each growing more than 20% on a constant dollar basis. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by carded B2B recovery. Commercial card volumes grew 21% year-over-year and are up 43% versus 2019, and excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 42%. Value-added services growth was driven by higher volume, increased client penetration and select pricing actions. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. GAAP operating expenses grew 20%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 18%. The inclusion of Currencycloud and Tink added about 3 points. Exchange rates were about a 4.5 point benefit. We stepped up investment in our business in the second half of the year as the recovery trajectory accelerated. Personnel costs were also higher due to annual salary increases granted a quarter earlier than our normal cycle and higher incentive compensation accruals. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $122 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $99 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates. GAAP EPS was $1.86. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, up 19% over last year, inclusive of a 4-point drag from the strong dollar. For the full year, net revenues increased 22%, and non-GAAP EPS of $7.50 was up 27%, with exchange rates reducing reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth by over 2 points each. We are now in fiscal year 2023 and through the first three weeks of October, business trends have remained strong and stable. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 11%, with debit up 9% and credit up 14%. U.S. spend growth versus 2019 was up 47%, with debit up 57% and credit up 39%. These trends are consistent with the fourth quarter and with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 12% year-over-year, up 40% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe grew 42% year-over-year and was 33% over 2019. Card-not-present non-travel growth were 61% above 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 18% above 2019. Moving now to our perspectives for the coming year. Forecasting four quarters ahead has been difficult through the COVID years. While COVID impact is now largely behind us, as you all know, we are in a very uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. As we have said before, we are not economic forecasters. Clearly, there's a high risk of a global recession, but we do not have a specific point of view on if, when or the kind of recession we might have. For internal planning purposes, we are assuming no recession. Of course, we will stay very vigilant, closely monitoring our trends day-by-day. We will stay very flexible. We will have contingency plans in place should we have an economic or geopolitical shock that impacts our business. And we will be prepared to act fast should we need to. So that is the context for our planning assumptions, which I will walk through now, starting with revenue drivers. Payments volume and processed transaction indexed to 2019 have been very stable in the U.S. and globally for the past three quarters. In other words, we believe the recovery from COVID is behind us when it comes to domestic spending. We are assuming this stability sustains through fiscal year 2023 with normal year-over-year growth rates in the low-double digits for both business drivers. On payments volumes, Russia will impact growth rates in the first half. Russia will not impact reported processed transactions growth. Cross-border e-commerce trends have also been stable, especially when you adjust for Russia and crypto-related volatility. We are assuming cross-border e-commerce growth rate sustain in the mid-teens, excluding Russia and crypto, and in the low-double digits with Russia and crypto impact included. Cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe, has continued to recover but at a slower pace, up 6 points from 112 to 118 index to 2019 between June and September. For planning purposes, we are assuming that this recent month-to-month pace of recovery sustains through fiscal year 2023. As was the case last year, there will be periods of deceleration and acceleration. Hopefully, China starts easing restrictions as we enter calendar year 2023. Two variables will have a significant impact on our reported revenue growth in fiscal year 2023, Russia and the dollar, which has strengthened to extraordinary levels through fiscal year 2022. Since we discontinued operations in late March, Russia will reduce first half fiscal year 2023 revenue growth by over 4 points, with 4 points in the first quarter and as much as 5 points in the second quarter. But as you might recall, we recorded two quarters worth of service fees in fiscal year 2022. Russia will obviously have no impact in the second half. Russia will reduce full year net revenue growth by 5 points. We faced very stiff exchange rate headwinds as we enter fiscal year 2023. Based on where the dollar is today and the forward curve, exchange rates will reduce reported net revenue growth in fiscal year 2023 by around 4 points. Since the dollar strengthened through fiscal year 2022, the impact is greater in the first quarter at around 5 points, around 4.5 points in the second quarter and moderate through the year. When you pull all this together, our planning assumptions get us to mid-teens constant dollar net revenue growth on a run rate basis, i.e., adjusted for Russia. With a 2-point Russia impact and a 4-point exchange rate headwind, reported nominal dollar fiscal year 2023 net revenue growth would be in the high-single digits. Client incentives are expected to be in the 26.5% to 27.5% range as a percent of gross revenues. With a 4-point Russia drag and a stiffer exchange rate headwind, first half reported nominal dollar net revenue growth is expected to be lower than the second half, lowest growth in the second quarter, which has the largest Russia impact and stepping up in the third and fourth quarters with no Russia drag and hopefully a moderating exchange rate headwind. Moving on to operating expenses. We are managing expense growth in line with our revenue growth expectations, rigorously prioritizing investment plans. As you know, this is a long cycle business. Investments we make today will have revenue growth two year to three years out. It is important for us to continue to fund key growth initiatives across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. As Al said, we have extraordinary growth opportunities and need to ensure we are investing to realize their potential. Our current plans are for low double-digit non-GAAP operating expense growth in constant dollars, high single digits in nominal dollars, Tink and Currencycloud, which closed during fiscal year 2022 at about 1 point to expense growth, offset by the discontinuation of Russia operations and exchange rate changes, which are expected to be about a 1.5 point benefit each. Non-GAAP operating expense growth will be higher in the first half for two reasons. First, Tink and Currencycloud add 2 points to expense growth in the first half. Also in the first half, we lapped a lower expense base last year since we stepped up investment spending through the year as the cross-border recovery accelerated. As such, non-GAAP expense growth in nominal dollars is expected to be in the low-double digits in the first half and at the high end of mid-single digits in the second half, highest in the first quarter, which is also impacted by the FIFA World Cup and moderating through the year. Should there be a recession or a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our planning assumptions, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel and other controllable categories. In a business like ours, this always requires a careful balance between short- and long-term considerations. As interest rates have risen, non-operating expense will benefit from higher interest income from our cash balances. We currently expect non-operating expense to be in the $200 million, $250 million range for fiscal year 2023. We will provide quarterly updates through the year. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in FY 2023. Honing in on the first quarter, based on everything I just walked through, we expect reported nominal dollar net revenue growth in the high single-digit range, with client incentives on par with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. Nominal dollar non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to be in the low teens. The tax rate could be lower than the 19% to 19.5% range in the first quarter, depending on the resolution of some items. Second quarter net revenue growth is expected to be lower than the first quarter because of the Russia impact, which is higher. Second quarter operating expense growth is also expected to moderate to the low end of double digits. In summary, we assume stable conditions through fiscal year 2023. We are prepared to act fast should circumstances change. Regardless of near-term uncertainties, we remain as certain as we have ever been about our extraordinary long-term growth opportunity. There is still plenty of cash to digitize in core consumer payments. We are accelerating volume growth by vastly expanding the use cases we can serve through our new flows business, while enhancing the yield on transactions in our network by layering on value-added services. With that, I will turn this back to Jennifer. Yeah. I will answer the first part of the question. I am sure Al will have more to add on the second part. Obviously, we have to wait and see the pace at which the second network is enabled on cards on e-commerce transactions. Our current expectation, given that our fiscal year, as you know, goes through September is that the effect in 2023 will be minimal, if any. But we will keep you posted. More broadly, just in terms of our views about the impact longer term, people come to us because of the value we create and that value comes in the form of having a dual message network and everything that goes with it, the security and the reliability we offer that is unmatched, as well as the dispute resolution and other sets of services, tokenization, all our risk management services that we layer on. We have competed for business in the past and merchants have chosen us based on the value we provide, and I am sure, Al, you have more to add on this front. Yeah. I mean and continuing on revenue for a minute, I mean, clearly, we now have new flows and value-added services, which are businesses, which are in new use cases that are very different than we have had in past times when we had recessions. So and they are also ramping in many cases and value-added services clearly is a whole range of new services that are not necessarily all tied to economic ups and downs. So clearly, there's a lot of differences from the past. But as Al said, recessions can come in all forms and shapes and sizes, and they could be global or regional. They could be deep or shallow. They could be recessions that have lesser impact on consumer spending and so on. As it relates to expenses, as I said in my comments on planning assumptions, I'd say three things. One, we are moderating expense growth as we go into the year. So expense growth is clearly coming down from the levels you have seen. For the year, our going-in planning assumption is nominal growth of about 9%. But I would just note that in the second half of the year -- the fiscal year, the growth is actually at the high end of mid-single digits. So it is moderating through the year and we don't know when there will be a recession or if there will be a recession. But if you look at what all the various prognosticators are saying, it appears that most people think if there's going to be a recession, it's sometime next year, probably, six months from now. Now that would put us in the second half of our fiscal year. So we already have expense growth moderating to the sort of the high end of mid-single digits. Clearly, we will look to reprioritize, scale back, postpone, et cetera. And depending on the nature of the recession and the impact it's having on our revenue, we would seek to manage our expenses to be even better than what our planning assumptions might be and bring the rate -- growth rate down. So we will calibrate as we go along. Yeah. A few things on goods versus services, as you know, we tend to look at how various segments are performing versus the pre-pandemic level in 2019. It's a clean way to look at things. And while there's been a lot of talk about how goods are underperforming, most of the goods categories index for 2019 actually have done quite well and they are holding quite stable. What it means is that they grew a lot faster in the early parts of the recovery and then haven't grown as fast as people shifted from goods to services. But overall, if you compare to 2019, the goods business has done very well, indexing very well to where it was and very much either on or above the pre-COVID trend line. More recently, even as services and restaurants, travel, entertainment, have continued to grow, we are starting to see goods do better. So they went through a period where they had very high growth, especially through the stimulus period and so on, recovered much faster than services, then services to come back. We are starting to see some recovery on the goods side, too now. But overall, goods is doing quite well on a three-year index, too. Yeah. Clearly, lots of moving pieces, as you pointed out. So I will just go through them one by one. Yes, we did benefit from very high currency volatility in the second half of this year and that does help us, as you know. It's in our international fees line, international revenue line and what volatility is going to be is anybody's guess. For planning purposes, we assume that it starts to moderate through the year. It's still high and we are assuming that it will be maybe higher than normal in the first quarter and then moderates as we go through the year to what we have seen in the past to levels that are normal over a long period of time. So that's the impact of volatility. As it relates to the dollar and its impact on cross-border travel, we have told you that we have seen about a 2-point monthly improvement in that index in the last few months. And again, I mean, it's very hard to predict these things. You know we got it wrong last year. The recovery was a hell of a lot faster than we expected. We will probably get it wrong again, but we have been very clear about our assumption, which is that the recovery we have seen for the past several months, we think is probably the new rate of recovery. There will be accelerations and decelerations and maybe if China opens up and lift restrictions, there could be some acceleration. So that's sort of what we are assuming for travel. What impact of recession might have on it remains to be seen. As Al say, there's pent-up demand and how much will that offset it, we will wait and see. The main message is there's still recovery in cross-border happening, but we are also lapping much stronger cross-border levels from last year. As you know, cross-border travel really started to recover last September and so we are now beginning to lap some really stronger periods last quarter. So the rate of growth inevitably has slowed, and it will continue to slow through the year, but it's still above the long-term trend line, because we still are in recovery mode. So, hopefully, that helps a bit. In regarding to your second question, maybe we will give you two examples. At one end is a high value use case and that will be cross-border remittances. The use of Visa Direct gives you extraordinary flexibility. You can do it account-to-account, account-to-account, account-to-account, sitting at home, you don't have to go to someone to give them cash. It's also tremendous flexibility at the other end in terms of how someone receives the money. It's real time. It has all the other benefits Al mentioned. As you know, cross-border remittances have a very high cost right now. We can do all that for a lot less and still have a yield that is quite attractive relative to our traditional yield. At the other end of the spectrum, P2P, very much a preferred way to do it is to have your debit credentials in there, because it makes it a lot more secure and has all the value we can add. It's a high volume but lower yielding use case and very often it's the way we get going in most markets. So those are two examples, and in between, you have insurance disbursements, earn wage access, marketplace payouts and so on, all of which are different. Yeah. On operating leverage, as we said, we are trying to balance the short-term and the long-term. As you have heard, we think there are extraordinary opportunities in new flows and value-added services. These are long-cycle businesses. You have to invest now for the future. So, yes, we are choosing to invest in the business and that reflects the expenses that we plan -- our expense growth plan relative to the revenue growth. And the other part of the question was other revenues... Right. On other revenues, yeah, there are some things there that will also have some sequential slowdown, because there are things like car-related benefits and so on in the other revenue line that are linked to travel. And as you lap a stronger recovery of travel from last year, there will be some sequential slowdown. There are also a few other value-added services there. So just like the overall business where there is a sequential slowdown because of the lapping effects and some currency impacts in Russia and so on, you will see that in the other revenue line, too."

For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Before I talk about the quarter, I wanted to acknowledge the passing of Dee Hock, Visa's Founder and Chief Executive Officer Emeritus. The whole Visa family deeply mourns the loss of a true visionary and a great man. Even with several global and macro events from the war in Ukraine to inflation, to concerns over a broader recession, Visa's business model has proven to be very resilient, with strong financial performance. Net revenues grew 19% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.98, up 33%. Total Q3 payment volume was 136% versus three years ago, up 1 point from Q2. In the U.S., payments volume index to 2019 was 146% in the quarter. U.S. debit volumes were 155% and credit 138% of 2019, both up modestly from Q2. Card-not-present, excluding travel volumes in the U.S., remained significantly ahead of prepandemic levels at 170% of 2019, consistent with Q2. International volume was 120% of 2019, down 1 point from Q2. Excluding China and Russia, it was 146% of 2019, up 6 points. Q3 Cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, were 123% versus three years ago, up 11 points from Q2, and this includes Russia in prior period numbers. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 22 points from 82% of 2019 in Q2 to 104% in Q3, as we continue to see strong recovery in consumer and commercial travel. Process transactions were 139% versus 2019, 1 point above Q2. Credentials increased 8% year-over-year and are up 11%, excluding Russia. Before I dive into the client wins and progress towards our strategy, I wanted to take a moment to discuss two topics: recession and inflation. On the first, we're not economic forecasters, so I'm not going to predict the future or a potential likelihood of a recession. Instead, let's focus on the facts. From the numbers I just reviewed relative to 2019 levels, growth has been stable or improving in overall domestic payment volume, credit, debit, card present and card-not-present volume. And this indicates the most of 2022 with no indication of any slowdown, including in more recent weeks. In cross-border, of course, the recovery has continued to strengthen, while growth has been stable in aggregate, there are big shifts under the surface that continue to demonstrate the momentum of the recovery. First, from goods to services. Early in the pandemic, goods surpassed services. We were seeing the historic trend. Even as services have rebounded in the last six months, the percentage spending on goods in our payments volumes still remained high, higher than the pre-pandemic levels. For example, while U.S. home improvement and retail good spending during the third quarter grew only low single-digit year-over-year, it remains well ahead of pre-pandemic trendline. Second, many discussionary segments have further strengthened. If you look at U.S. travel spend, it is not backed to the pre-COVID trendline, but grew more than 40% versus last year. Third, the affluent spend continue to recover, particularly in the areas of restaurants, travel and entertainment. At the same time, non-affluent spend remained relatively resilient. We mentioned the affluent spend returning to restaurants last quarter. That trend continued this quarter with affluent restaurant spend indexing in the 160% to 180% range versus 2019. Similarly, in Europe in the last six months, luxury hotel payments volume and average ticket size outpaced growth in the overall hotel category versus 2019. At the same time, budget and mid-priced hotels saw modest improvements. Based on our numbers, we haven't seen any evidence of consumer pulling back spending in our markets. Now, a few words on inflation. It's just too early to draw any definitive conclusions. A few observations though on inflation. One, keep in mind that the headline CPI inflation number does not necessarily apply to Visa as our basket of goods isn't the same. Consumers just don't buy homes or use cards with their Visa cards, for example. So, we see a several point gap between headline inflation and inflation in card-related spend categories. Two, thus far, U.S. transaction growth relative to 2019 is strong and stable. Ticket sizes remain around 15 points above 2019 levels as they had for much of the pandemic due to several factors. Three, historically, in the U.S., we have seen PCE growth, which is the most important metric that drives our growth, remains strong even during inflationary periods. That said, lastly, excessive and long-term inflation is not good for consumers or the overall economy. Looking ahead, we'll continue to monitor the potential impact of inflation to ticket sizes, transaction counts, as well as volumes across spend categories. With all of that as backdrop, I'll now provide an update on progress with clients. Traditional issuers remain a key component of our consumer payments growth. And this quarter, we had several important partnership renewals globally. First, in China, we renewed our partnership with ICBC, the largest bank in the world, in terms of assets and the biggest credit card issuer in China in terms of the number of cards. In Japan, we renewed one of the country's largest credit issuers, Credit Saison, and expanded our issuing relationship with Toyota Finance. In Australia, we extended our credit and debit issuing agreements with NAV and CDA, two of the largest banks in the country. And in the U.S., we recently renewed our relationship with Green Dot, a top 20 issuer in debit and a top 10 issuer in prepaid. Fintechs are also key to our consumer payments growth. In Europe alone, we have more than 100 fintech programs that continue to deepen our relationship with these partners. Revolut is a great example. They already utilized a number of our capabilities, including Visa Direct and Currencycloud, and we just renewed our global issuing partnership. They also recently selected Tink for payment initiation services, which will allow users across Europe to seamlessly move money into their Revolut accounts. In many countries, the mobile operators are particularly important partners. We previously mentioned our partnerships with M-Pesa Africa and Safaricom, and I'm happy to report that we have begun issuance with these partners who are part of the Vodacom Group that cover 130 million customers in Sub-Saharan Africa. In a similar light, we also recently signed partnerships to issue Visa credentials, and in some cases, also enable Visa Direct with other mobile operators around the world. Mobily in Saudi Arabia with 10 million customers, Ooredoo in Qatar with around 2 million customers, Azercell in Azerbaijan with 5 million customers, and Orange Egypt with 27 million customers. I now want to dive a little deeper on two important markets, Brazil and India. Starting in Brazil, over the past two years, we have grown our business through issuing agreements with Ita\u00fa, Mercado, Pago, Pataday and Caixa, with a 70% increase in credentials. In addition to traditional credit card issuance partners like Banco do Brasil have been growing their credit base by utilizing Visa's digital acquisition platform that allows them to instantly issue cards in a digital environment. Further, our fintech partners in Brazil, including Banco XP and Neon Pagamentos, have issued more than 20 million credentials over the past two years. On the acceptance side, we've doubled acceptance points since 2020, reaching more than 10 million merchant locations in Brazil. The results of our efforts over the past 8 to 10 quarters is evident in Brazil's payment volume, which in the third quarter was more than 200% of 2019, with e-commerce nearing 300%. In India, our efforts over the last few years are paying off and Q3 payments volume was 184% of 2019, with e-commerce above 300%. Building on that momentum, we had co-brand wins with two of the largest multibillion-dollar revenue Indian conglomerates that collectively represent millions of potential credentials. One with TataNeu, a super app for e-commerce financial services and loyalty programs across the Tata Group; two, with Aditya Birla Finance and SBI Cards, provide rewards for spending across all of their group companies. We also signed a co-brand with IndiGo, India's largest airline by number of passengers. And let me briefly touch on the US, where there's still great opportunity for cash digitization. We're excited about Tap to Pay, which has now reached 24% of face-to-face transactions in Q3. We're seeing positive trends in terms of additional spend and transaction lift in the US. In 2021, the average contactless active debit cardholder had two more transactions and $65 in additional spend each month. We expect this trend to continue, driving incremental payment volumes and transactions for contactless card issuers through faster, simpler POS experiences. Now moving to new flows, which in Q3 had over 20% revenue growth. In B2B, our Q3 commercial payments volume was 145% of 2019, up 6 points from Q2, driven by the return of travel. Q3 was the first quarter in which spend on business travel surpassed 2019 levels. This quarter, we're excited to have reached a significant multiyear agreement with WEX to enable their travel, health and corporate clients to make payments using Visa virtual card capabilities. WES is a global leader in financial technology solutions for commercial payments, and we are proud to partner with them. In the fleet space, we reached an agreement with M-PESA, a fintech based out of Kenya. Their fleet and expense management digital platform will address the problem of paying cash in the African trucking business through Visa prepaid reloadable credentials. Visa Direct is a powerful capability for many of our new flows. In this quarter, transactions grew 35%, excluding Russia.  On the remittance side, Western Union has enabled Visa Direct for their US customers to send money to select countries globally, expanding upon their initial rollout across Europe in 2021. We also expanded our agreement with Remitly, one of the world's premier digital service remittance companies to offer Visa Direct cross-border payments originating from Canada to bank accounts globally.  Another Visa Direct P2P expansion is with LINE Pay in Japan. Already a large wallet issuer, 6 million Visa credentials, LINE Pay is now enabling Visa Direct for cross-border and domestic use cases such as remittances and cash outs. On wage disbursement, GrubHub, a leading food ordering and delivery marketplace available in over 4,000 US cities, will enable drivers to quickly send their earnings to their eligible debit cards using Visa Direct. We are excited for them to join our other food delivery platforms, including DoorDash and SkipTheDishes. We also reached an agreement with the US tip enabler, TipSend [ph] to enable millions of tips disbursements to be pushed to employees' accounts through eligible debit cards at thousands of restaurant locations they serve. For TipSend, 90% of tips in the United States are still dispersed with cash today. In Canada, we reached an agreement with a large fintech, Wealthsimple, for accounts funds in and funds out for their over 2 million clients. Finally, enablers are key to our success in Visa Direct, and we recently signed a deal with Finastra, one of the world's largest financial services software companies and open banking platforms with 8,600 customers and serving 90 of the world's top 100 banks. Together, we will offer Finastra's clients access to cross-border business, the small business at B2C payouts to eligible accounts in multiple currencies and countries.  While the US was one of our first markets to achieve scale for Visa Direct, we have many other countries and regions that are growing and scaling. For example, in Latin America, third quarter transactions quadrupled versus last year. We have over 20 domestic and cross-border P2P programs commercially launched or in pilot, such as PLIN and Yape in Peru, WhatsApp in Brazil and Cash across Central America, in addition to many other programs for other use cases.  Now let me move to value-added services, which had Q3 revenue growth of almost 20%. Evaluated services grow through new and existing clients, existing services, expanding geographically and adding new services both organically and through acquisitions. Today, I'll provide an update on recent wins with some of our acquired entities. First, one of our earlier acquisitions, CyberSource, recently added NCR and Global Payments as partners, both intend to offer CyberSource capabilities to their merchant clients. This is an important strategy as our merchant base utilizing CyberSource through acquirers is growing payments volume twice as fast as the rest of our CyberSource business. Cardinal Commerce, our network-agnostic authentication capability, has grown transactions 30% globally year-to-date, with more than double that in Europe, where the secure customer authentication requirement has driven faster adoption of 3D Secure. VERIFI, our network agnostic dispute resolution solution, recently extended its agreement with PNC for VERIFI's cardholder dispute resolution network product. YellowPepper, the network agnostic connectivity platform, just signed Vex [ph], the Brazilian bank that offers its $50 million corporate and individual clients worldwide trade, e-commerce, staff solutions and most recently an FX API platform. Vex will use YellowPepper's payment initiation services to enable cross-border money movement starting with Visa Direct to send payouts to eligible cards. I mentioned Tink's recent win earlier. Our other acquisition from this fiscal year, Currencycloud, has signed more than 100 Fintech clients since December to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments. And finally, the tokenization capabilities we acquired now called Token ID have been selected by several partners. First, Global Payments will use Visa's Token ID as their strategic go-forward solution for multiple EMV network tokenization services to reduce card-not-present fraud and realize operational efficiencies for their clients. Second, the Clearinghouse, the first US real-time payment network in one of two US ACH networks, chose Visa's Token ID solution to power the secure token exchange. This industry-first account tokenization solution in the United States is utilizing Visa's Token ID payment account tokenization technology to replace sensitive customer account data with unique tokens and reduce the amount of exposed payment data. Our internally developed value-added services are just as important. One very compelling solution is from Visa consulting and analytics. Together with FIS, we recently launched a risk-as-a-service solution powered by data and risk experts. Key components of progress over the past 12 months include our real-time monitoring through our AI-enabled platform has blocked over $2 billion in fraudulent payments volume. Our analysis of potential fraud for a proactive testing identified a $15 million exposure to clients. Our capabilities to proactively detect and mitigate cyber criminals attempts to inject payment skimming malware onto online merchant checkout pages has prevented over $10 million in e-commerce-related losses. And our ability to detect terminal cloning has successfully blocked $3 million in fraud from attempted downloads. In sum, we had a very strong quarter and our results showed it. We made progress continuing to build relationships and solutions across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services that will fuel future growth around the globe. We remain vigilant in monitoring the trends in our business and the economy and confident on our strategy as we enable the movement of money globally. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon everyone. Our fiscal third quarter results reflected continued strength in domestic spend and a robust recovery in travel with net revenues up 19% and GAAP EPS up 36%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 33%. The ever strengthening dollar dragged down reported net revenue growth by almost three points and non-GAAP EPS growth by nearly three and a half points. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was over 21%, and non-GAAP EPS growth was 36%. Adjusting for Russia, constant dollar net revenue growth was 26%. A few key highlights. Global payments volume growth has remained strong and stable relative to pre-COVID levels. In constant dollars, the US index was 2 points higher than the second quarter, up 46% versus 2019. The international index, ex-China and Russia, was up 6 points from the second quarter, also 46% above 2019. The robust cross-border travel recovery continued. Index to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, jumped from 94 in March to 112 in June. This was helped by much of Asia opening up at the beginning of the quarter. The US inbound corridor picking up steam, as well as strong growth in and out of Europe, as we head into the peak summer travel season. Our three growth engines, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues around 20%. During the quarter, we bought back almost $2.5 billion in stock at an average price of $202.16. We also added $600 million to the MDL litigation escrow account. This had the same effect as a stock buyback at $200.25. We issued EUR 3 billion in debt, with maturities ranging from 4 to 12 years. We obtained attractive coupons on our inaugural eurobond issuance, ranging from 1.5% to 2.375%, well below rates achievable on the equivalent dollar-denominated debt. We have now prefunded debt maturities coming up in September and December. Finally, as a reminder, we suspended operations in Russia late in the second quarter. As such, there are no volumes, transactions or revenues from Russia in our third quarter numbers. Any comparisons to prior periods include Russia, unless otherwise noted. Now on to the details. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 36% above 2019. Excluding China and Russia, total payments volume growth was 17% and 46% higher than 2019. In the US, credit grew 21% and improved 3 points to 38% over 2019, helped by travel and fuel spend. Debit grew 4% year-over-year, lapping the big spike from the stimulus last year. Relative to 2019, debit was up 55%, sustaining significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. Debit has benefited from accelerated cash digitization through the pandemic. US card present spend grew 13% and was 27% above 2019, up 6 points. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 7% and was 70% higher than 2019. Relative to three years ago, e-commerce levels remain well above the pre-COVID trend line, even as card-present spend continues to recover. International constant dollar payments volumes, excluding China and Russia, grew 24% and was 46% above 2019. A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 40% year-over-year and 107% higher than 2019, with robust performance across the region fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 34% year-over-year and 102% higher than 2019, led by client wins and cash digitalization. Europe was up 17% year-over-year and 37% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion underway in the UK, ex-UK, Europe was 66% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Excluding migrations, UK payment volumes have been stable in the third quarter, while Germany improved more than 15 points from the second quarter. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region but has improved significantly from the second quarter, up 24% year-over-year and 30% above 2019, up five points in the second quarter. Across Asia, most borders are open and domestic restrictions lifted. Only China remains mostly closed off, and Japan is gradually normalizing. Global process transactions were up 16% year-over-year and 39% over 2019 levels. Since we did not process domestic transactions in Russia, our reported process transactions are not materially impacted by the suspension of Russia operations. Now on to cross-border. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe were up 48% year-over-year and 23% over 2019. Cross-border card not present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 4% year-over-year and 62% above 2019. Cross-border travel related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 129% year-over-year and exceeded pre-COVID levels for the first time, indexing at 104 of 2019. The cross-border travel index went from the low 90s in March and April to 108% in May and 112% in June. We continue to see a rapid ramp-up in travel as soon as borders reopen or restrictions are lifted. A few highlights. Canada removed testing requirements for vaccinated travelers in April. Travel inbound to the US jumped 16 points in the third quarter to 86% of 2019 levels, helped by Canada, Europe and Asia. The lifting of testing requirements in June will hopefully help sustain the recovery of travel into the US. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean has been very strong through the COVID years, especially to Mexico. With more countries, including Costa Rica and Jamaica, lifting COVID protocols in April, inbound travel to the region climbed nearly 20 points in the third quarter to 50% of our 2019 levels. European Union member states removed previous testing and vaccination requirements for non-European citizens in April and May, resulting in travel to Europe recovering a sizable 30 points in the third quarter with more than half of that from North America. Inbound travel to Europe was 21% about 2019. Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, CEMEA region, outbound travel increased six points in the third quarter despite the loss of Russia, driven by Ukraine and travel for religious holidays from the Middle East and was 13% above 2019. In Asia, borders continue to open and travel restrictions eased for international travelers, resulting in inbound travel recovering 22 points in the third quarter to 58% of 2019 levels. Japan opened to tourists and increased the entry limit from 10,000 to 20,000 people per day. Australia dropped pre-arrival testing requirements in April. Several countries, including Malaysia and Vietnam, dropped testing requirements in May. The pace of travel recovery to and from Asia will be a key driver of the future trajectory of cross-border travel. Most Asian borders are now open, except for Mainland China and some restrictions in Taiwan and Japan. In the third quarter, travel into China indexed below 25% of 2019 and outbound from China below 40%. Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 13%, slower than the 14% nominal growth in Q2 payments volume. Reported Q2 payments volumes include Russia, whereas revenues in Q3 do not since we recognized second quarter service revenues for Russia before we suspended operations last year -- last quarter. Data processing revenues grew 8%, below the 16% process transaction growth. Revenue growth lags transaction growth, primarily due to the suspension of Russia operations. As I mentioned earlier, Russia domestic transactions were not included in our reported process transactions, and as such, the loss of Russia does not materially impact transactions growth. However, we did have data processing revenue from Russia transactions in prior periods, which we do not anymore. This negatively impacted data processing revenue growth by over four points. There was also about a two-plus point exchange rate drag. International transaction revenues were up 51% versus the 38% increase in nominal cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and select pricing actions. Other revenues grew 26%, led by consulting services and travel benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines, each growing around 20%. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by carded B2B recovery. Commercial or B2B volumes grew 27% year-over-year and are up 45% versus 2019. Growth was driven, in part, by increased travel and was broad-based globally across small and large businesses. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 35% due to strong growth outside the US. Value-added services growth was led by consulting services as well as risk and identity solutions. Revenue growth drivers include higher volumes from existing clients, greater clients and attrition and select pricing actions. Client incentives were 26.1% of gross revenues below our expectations. This was primarily driven by the faster-than-expected recovery of higher-yielding cross-border volumes, which improved revenue mix. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. Exchange rates were an approximately 3-point drag on reported revenue growth. The suspension of Russia operations reduced revenues by approximately 5 points. GAAP operating expenses grew 51%, inclusive of a $716 million provision associated with the interchange multi-restrict litigation. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 15%. The inclusion of Currencycloud and Tink added about 3 points. The suspension of Russia operations reduced expenses by about 3 points. Exchange rates were about a 2-point benefit. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $246 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $73 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 13.3%. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates benefited by 6 points from the resolution of certain US state and foreign tax matters related primarily through prior years.  Our recurring tax rate remains in the 19% to 19. 5% range. GAAP EPS was $1.60. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.98, up 33% over last year, inclusive of nearly 3.5 point drag from the stronger dollar. With a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buybacks, we returned $3.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Through the first three weeks of July, business trends have remained strong and stable.  On a year-over-year basis, US payments volume was up 12% with debit up 6% and credit up 18%. US spend growth versus 2019 was up 46% with debit up 55% and credit up 38%. These trends are consistent with the third quarter and with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 14% year-over-year, up 40% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 60% year-over-year and 29% over 2019. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 57% above 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 16% above 2019. Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. As Al indicated, we're seeing no evidence of a pullback in consumer spending. US payments volumes have indexed in the mid-140 range versus 2019 since January through July 21. Excluding Russia and China, international payments volumes have also indexed about 140 since January. Process transactions have been stable at around 140 versus 2019. As such, we are assuming that the trends we have seen in payments volume and processed transactions will continue through the fourth quarter. We will, of course, stay vigilant and on the lookout for any changes caused by rising interest rates, high inflation and declining consumer confidence. Through July, the cross-border recovery has progressed faster and further than we had expected last October. For the fourth quarter, we're assuming stable growth versus 2019 in cross-border e-commerce and some improvement from travel in and out of Europe and into the US, especially from Asia. The next and perhaps the last leg of the cross-border travel recovery will have to await a full reopening in China, which we do not expect in the near future.  With these assumptions, fourth quarter net revenues could grow at the high teens to 20% range in constant dollars. This includes Tink and Currencycloud, which add approximately 0.5 point to net revenues, and the suspension of operations in Russia, which subtracts approximately 5 points.  The dollar has continued to strengthen, significantly increasing the exchange rate drag, which we expect will reduce reported net revenue growth by 4 to 5 points. Q4 client incentives are expected to range between 26% and 27% of gross revenues, driven primarily by anticipated strong volume performance across all regions. For the year, we now expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the middle of the 25.5% to 26.5% range. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in constant dollars to grow at the low end or high teens. This includes 2 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink, offset by 3 points from reduced costs due to Russia. Personnel costs will be higher since we are granting annual salary increases a quarter earlier than normal to all employees below the SVP level. This will add three points to Q4 operating expense growth. Exchange rates could reduce reported operating expense growth by about two points. Our tax rate is expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range. While there's uncertainty, consumer spending remains strong. Growth has been stable across payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions globally. We have demonstrated our ability to adjust to different environments and are prepared to do so again if warranted. We will stay vigilant, flexible and agile. We are fortunate to have a resilient business with great momentum and extraordinary longer term growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\nJennifer Como: Thanks Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I know we're indexing well below where we normally would be if the pandemic didn't occur for cross-border travel. However, I guess there's a fear that we're seeing the strength partly because it's pent-up demand and then inflation. Could you help us think about how you feel about the risks associated with the drop-off in cross-border? And then Vasant, you talked about Asia being the key. How much more strength can we see out of the non-China region? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: So, I'll start, Sanjay. I actually think cross-border travel has come back very, very strongly and quicker than what we thought and that still with as you suggested, Asia being quite low. You heard the numbers, both inbound and outbound, in Vasant's remarks. Plus inbound to the U.S., somewhat up until recently because of the COVID -- required COVID test and now the strength of the U.S. dollar still has upside as well. So, yes, for sure, there is some element of pent-up demand, but I think that, that demand is going to remain strong for some time. And I don't see people being deterred even by higher cost of airline tickets that people are experiencing. If anything, probably the experiential element of waiting in airports for a longer period of time because of understaffing that exists in a number of places around the world is probably the thing that weighs more on my mind, but I expect that to normalize at some point here soon. Vasant, do you want to add anything?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Clearly, I mean, there's a variety of factors at play here. First, there has been a general shift in consumer preferences. You've heard this from other people, to move away from goods to experiences, and travel is very much a beneficiary of that. It's not just cross-border travel. As Al said in his remarks, it's all travel, including domestic travel. So, it's a pretty broad-based desire to travel. The second is people are keen to travel. So, as soon as restrictions are lifted, you see the reactions right away. In terms of where the strength is, clearly, the recovery in Asia has been quite strong. You saw how much it improved this quarter, almost 20 points, if I remember right. And it is continuing. It's happening all across Asia, except for places like China, and they're still -- it's not that easy to get in and out of Japan and Taiwan. But elsewhere, it's very strong across Asia. There's a huge amount of interest in traveling to Europe and significant interest in European traveling out of Europe. So Europe has been also recovering very fast and is indexing at pretty high levels relative to pre-COVID volumes. The other area that continues to surprise is Latin America. We told you that it was always quite high, because Latin America stayed fairly open. But in the last quarter it jumped another 20 points and is indexing in the 150 range for people traveling into Latin America. So as you look across it, this looks pretty durable. There's still recovery left to come, as you can see. Asia still was indexing well below 2019 levels. The U.S. is still below 2019 levels. So we don\u2019t think this ends anytime soon.\nJennifer Como: Great. Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Al, you had a number of callouts in the prepared remarks related to Visa Direct. I was hoping to get your perspective on the news that the CFPB is investigating the levels of fraud in Zelle and other domestic P2P services. Can you just comment a bit or give us a little bit of color on how the fraud protections associated with Visa Direct are different or similar to those services and sort of how that type of investigation might impact Visa Direct's role in P2P over the long-term? Thank you.\nAl Kelly: Well, thanks, Lisa. One of the terrific things about Visa Direct is that, it isn't running on a different new platform. It runs on VisaNet and, therefore, has the ability to utilize all of the same capabilities that we have on VisaNet, including those related to KYC and those related to fraud prevention. So, certainly, this is something that we're well aware of and we'll continue to watch closely. I do think that consumers value this P2P capability in very, very big ways, not just in the United States, but around the world, and I certainly expect it to be a use case that continues to grow around the world, and we'll just have to make sure that we're working closely with Zelle and other partners to make sure that we're contributing as much as we can to make sure that, that service is secure as can be, because as you know, trust is a basic underpinning of money movement in every single use case around the world.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hey, guys. Thanks. I really want to touch on your willingness and ability to manage expenses and margins going forward in different outcomes, different scenarios. You pulled forward, it looks like salary increases. So does that pull forward some of the OpEx growth we normally see in fiscal 2023? And then just thinking through, if we were to see downturns economically, what kind of willingness and an ability do you have to really manage margins going forward?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. The pull forward of salary increases means that when we get to the fourth quarter of next year, we'll lap the increase that we have. So in that sense, yes, it moderates a little bit the impact on next year since some of it comes into this year. You've seen us in the past adjust based on external circumstances, and we will be monitoring trends and will stay flexible and move fast if we have to, again. That said, this is a business with tremendous long-term growth opportunities. We think the new use cases that are being developed in the new flows business and the opportunities we have across value-added services for global expansion, for deeper penetration of existing clients as well as adding new services are very significant. So we have to be keeping an eye on the long-term opportunity and not under-investing. Having said that, if times get tough, we -- as we did during the pandemic, you prioritize, you sequence things, you pace things. You don't pull back on all the investment. You just try to do it based on a new reality. So during the pandemic, for example, we scale back in certain areas like cross-border where spending on marketing or things like that wouldn't have made any difference because borders were closed. And we'll try and do things like that if we have to again.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks so much. Great results. Very clear. The consumer is strong here. And I know, Al, you said you don't want to predict the macro, but I figured I'd ask if you can comment here on how resilient Visa might be now versus past recessions, because on the one hand, I'm thinking of this product credentials, acceptance, contactless or that would suggest more resilience. But on the other side, you have more value-added services revenue that might be more cyclical. So I know aside from shocks like the financial crisis and pandemic, your growth premium to PC has been clear. But what about now? Do you feel differently? Any new thinking on how Visa might be different versus past recessions? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Well, thanks, Tien-Tsin. I think we're a very different company from any past recession, I guess, going back to 2008-2009 time frame. First of all, we're strong -- much stronger in debit, which tends to be the vehicle, the card of choice for people in a slowdown period. We're stronger in everyday spend categories. We're stronger in e-commerce. We benefited from this acceleration in cash utilization that happened during the pandemic. Since the last recession, we've added Europe, which is a very important part of the company today and contributes to our growth. And then as you alluded to, we've added an emphasis on value-added services and new flows. Some of those value-added services are tied to volume. So the degree that some volumes might go down, those might go down as well. But on the other hand, for volumes that we will have today that we -- that will have the opportunity to sell more value-added services than we would have in the prior recession. The last thing I would say is that it is very possible that today, people are changing what they're buying, but they're not changing how they're paying. And we fall into the latter category. And we see overall spending levels, as we talked about remaining high, and we continue to see people choosing to pay with Visa not depending on any change that they might be making in what they're buying or the baskets that they have.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon. So Al, I want to follow up on your comments on the banking. So now that you closed the Tink acquisition earlier this year, can you elaborate on your efforts in open banking and what role can just play? And just taking a step back, how excited are you about the opportunity that in open banking for Visa? Thanks.\nAl Kelly: Well, I think open banking is in its early days, but I think that we're quite well positioned. As you well know, that the ground zero for open banking happens to be Europe. We have a very good business there. And obviously, Tink has a footprint in 18 markets in Europe. It has a single API that allows customers, primarily developers that access financial data. It has connectivity to 3,400 banks and financial institutions and greater than 10,000 developers. And we believe the thesis for us is that takes capabilities with our capabilities and our relationships will allow Tink to be stronger where it already is, and will -- with our help, we'll be able to broaden their footprint in which Tink operates. And that's certainly one of the things that we're in discussions internally with Tink, as to where we go next in the world. We also think that our infrastructure and our cyber and fraud capabilities and our capabilities related to protecting the customers' transaction at all the steps along the way is going to just help accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe. So we're excited about the prospects of it. We think we're really well positioned. It's just going to be a matter of how quickly it takes off, but we're in good shape to the degree that it does.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. I wanted to ask about the three key drivers, all growing over 20% in consumer payments, the new flows and value-added services. As we think about going forward and how this is likely to normalize some, I assume consumer payments growth will slow as cross-border eventually lap some tougher comps. But maybe new flows and value-added services still has some extra juice for growth. Just hoping maybe you could parse through some of the pluses and minuses for the three segments.\nAl Kelly: Well, Bryan, that's been the thesis from the beginning that we want to make sure that we generate on a sustained ongoing basis attractive revenue growth. And you're certainly correct that at some point in time, depending upon the pace at which Asia cross-border comes back and US inbound cross-border continues to come back, that will settle back into some more normal level growth rate for consumer payments. I'm not going to predict when that will be, whether that's in two quarters or six quarters or seven quarters, but it will happen at some point in time. And our expectation and aspiration has been that value-added services and new flows will grow at numbers of percentage points higher than consumer payments that will, therefore, allow us to get to sustained revenue growth rate that we think, over time, will be attractive to the investors in the company.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDon Fandetti: I just want to confirm, so just given all the weakness of some of the retailers, you're not seeing any signs on the low-end consumer weakness. And then does your data historically show any correlation around a wealth effect for the more affluent US consumers at Visa?\nAl Kelly: Don, you're touching on -- there's a number of elements that impact our volumes. And we'll touch on a few of them. Affluent spenders are returning to the economy and their higher spending in restaurants and travel, among other categories. And this isn't necessarily inflation, but a mix shift. The impact of people working from home and hybrid work definitely continue to have impact on smaller tickets that are things that people buy in the mornings and at lunch time, when they're actually commuting and working in an office environment.  Certainly, small tickets, as a percentage of overall tickets, are still below pre-pandemic levels as a result. Last year, stimulus clearly drove ticket sizes up, particularly in discretionary categories, and we're kind of lapping that now. What we don't know are what level of substitutions are taking place, where people might be buying more staples and less discretionary items, but they're spending at the same level they did, or whether as some retailers have said, people are trading down from brands to private labels. But it's also difficult for us to understand consumption reduction. So, for example, consumers could be buying less fuel, but spending at the same amount or buying smaller package sizes of things like snacks and yet spending the same amount. So, I think, Don, clearly, inflation is in our numbers. And people are likely to change, making some changes on what they're buying. But as I said earlier, I think in response to Tien-Tsin's question, they're not changing how they're paying.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I mean going back to your question on whether we're seeing any slowdown in spending by lower income consumers. No, we're not. We keep looking for it because we've heard some other people say it, and we're not seeing any evidence of that. Your second question, I presume was the wealth effect on affluent consumers of what's happening in the stock market and things like that?  As Al said, I mean we're not seeing that. If anything, affluent spending has been on the rise and is one of the reasons why we've seen some of the robust growth we saw this quarter. Remember, we're lapping a very significant growth quarter last year that included sizable stimulus payments. And despite that, we had some very good growth this quarter. And a lot of that is driven by affluent consumers, by discretionary spending coming back and no evidence of a wealth effect that people are holding back.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good afternoon. You've clearly been continuing to be very aggressive on share repurchase. But could you update us on your capital allocation priorities in this particular environment? We've seen obviously a pretty big pullback in valuations and payments. How is your acquisition appetite and pipeline changed today versus, let's say, a year ago?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Capital allocation has -- approach has not changed. As we've said before, our first priority is investing in our core business. We generate a lot of free cash flow. Our first priority is to invest in what is a fabulous business we have, which has tremendous growth opportunities as we've discussed around some of the new use cases and new flows around value-added services and of course, in our core consumer payments business. After that, clearly, it's how can M&A enhance what we do, and we can do that by buying something that expands our capabilities like we've done in the past, or something that gives us new capabilities like Tink does with open banking or like Currencycloud does with the capabilities they have that are geared towards real-time FX and serving the needs of newer enterprises, the Fintechs rather than traditional companies. So, we will continue to look for things that can enhance what we have. In terms of timing and opportunities, clearly, as valuations have come back in, we've stayed disciplined when things are bubbly. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have tremendous capacity. We are definitely interested in acquisitions where the value is justified. Time will tell where the valuations in private markets get to levels that are attractive and companies have to be for sale. But clearly, M&A is an important component of our future. We have clear ideas on where we want to expand M&A-wise. And as they come up, we'll talk about it.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Your line is open.\nRayna Kumar: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In your remarks, you mentioned pricing actions helped your cross-border revenue. As you look across the breadth of your products and services, do you think there's still more opportunity to improve pricing in certain areas?\nAl Kelly: Yes. Something that we will watch and be very thoughtful about over time. But we have -- we've got years and years of experience in pricing in the consumer payments business and we're building our sophistication in terms of pricing in our newer lines of business in new flows and value-added services. As we said many times, our philosophy is that we want to make sure that we're pricing in a way that balances all the various parties within the ecosystem and ideally stimulates more and more cash digitization and more and more money movement across our network. So, in short, we think there definitely is still more opportunity in the pricing lever.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hey Al, hi Vasant. Great quarter here. It's pretty clear based on your results and comments that the consumer seems unaffected so far. My question was, are you seeing an impact in your conversations with enterprises, so basically banks, merchants and fintechs, given what's going on in terms of either the pace of decision-making or the types of products or services that they're seeking out now? If you could comment on that.\nAl Kelly: I have not heard that from any clients or partners that I have talked to. Look, I think everybody is out there wondering whether we're going to or not going to face a recession. We're certainly undeniably in a high inflation environment right now. But given that, that was really driven by a shortage of workers leading to a shortage of production of goods and services and then, you throw the Ukrainian war on top of it, which had some impacts along the way, and all of this coming off of a pandemic, there really isn't a history that provides any kind of insight into exactly what might happen here. We're continuing to do two things. One is to make sure that we're smartly investing in the future to drive our three growth levers. And as Vasant alluded to in response to a question earlier, we're being very vigilant in looking into the numbers and seeing if we see anything that requires us to be proactive in any action that we might take. But at this point, as I think we've said a few times now, the level of consumer spending up through July 21, which reported on in Vasant's remarks, have the consumer spending has remained very resilient. And for how long that will be, one, it remains to be seen. But again, I'd remind everybody that we don't have the same input costs and COGS as other businesses. And we're a company that facilitates payments. So regardless of whether people are consuming differently or substituting one good for another good, they still need to pay for it and they're utilizing our services to do that.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. Thanks for all the color and commentary, Al and Vasant. Obviously, you can track quite well how the consumer is tracking now across all the different metrics, as we've talked a lot about. When you look at forward, can you talk a little bit about what you look at as potential indicators? And I guess, especially since as Sanjay started off the questions around travel, what are you seeing in things around forward bookings and any changes or indications there or elsewhere? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. As Al said, I mean, we don't view ourselves as economic forecasters and don't want to get into that. And we've said before that we are not leading indicators. We probably coincident indicators. If there's a change in spending, we'll see it as it happens. The only area of our business where we see a little bit ahead is, as you said, in travel bookings, and those are holding up well. Whether it's cross-border bookings or domestic travel bookings, if you look at the card-not-present element of travel which is where those bookings happen; there is really no change in trend. So at least looking out 30, 60 days, which is what the lead time is on those kinds of things, there is no change in trend. Other than that, a lot of what we see is quite intuitive. There's -- as Al said, there's a shift towards discretionary purchases. There's a shift towards things people couldn't do before, during the pandemic, experiences around restaurants, entertainment and travel. As we said, while goods may not be growing as much as they were year-over-year, they're still well above the COVID -- pre-COVID trend line. So there's nothing there that is out of the ordinary at this point.\nJennifer Como: Last question Jordan.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks guys. I just wanted to come back to cross-border travel. Now that you were at, I think, 116% of 2019 levels in July, I know your prior target was to be at 100% by the end of the fiscal year. So what would be your new target there? And then can you just comment on inbound versus outbound US, kind of where that's tracking versus 2019 levels and your thoughts going forward there just given the strength of the dollar? Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. I mean outbound from the US is very strong. It's been about 2019 levels now for a few, if not weeks, a couple of months. Inbound to the US, we told you was indexing in the high 80s. So it's still below 2019 levels. And we think that there's room for recovery there. What we've seen on the cross-border side is a little bit of a stair step where you have periods where there's rapid growth like you saw in April and May and we saw in October and November, when a variety of countries remove restrictions, you see a huge amount of travel happening fairly quickly. And then you see a certain amount of stabilization after that, like we saw partly because of Omicron in December and January, and we saw in March and April. As you look at the fourth quarter, most of the world is open. And so we are assuming steady improvement in travel out of Asia, steady improvement of travel into and out of Europe, improvement of travel into the US. But there are no big openings left, which is why we don't think there'll be a big stair step up in the fourth quarter. We'll wait and see. The big openings left would be China, of course, which we gave you the index. It's still very low. And there's recovery left in Japan, because letting in 20, 000 people is one-fifth of what the normal amount of people who go into Japan were. It's more like 100,000 people. So there's a few left. So the short answer is a modest recovery in the fourth quarter, and we'll see what happens.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Al Kelly",
            "content": "Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Before I talk about the quarter, I wanted to acknowledge the passing of Dee Hock, Visa's Founder and Chief Executive Officer Emeritus. The whole Visa family deeply mourns the loss of a true visionary and a great man. Even with several global and macro events from the war in Ukraine to inflation, to concerns over a broader recession, Visa's business model has proven to be very resilient, with strong financial performance. Net revenues grew 19% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.98, up 33%. Total Q3 payment volume was 136% versus three years ago, up 1 point from Q2. In the U.S., payments volume index to 2019 was 146% in the quarter. U.S. debit volumes were 155% and credit 138% of 2019, both up modestly from Q2. Card-not-present, excluding travel volumes in the U.S., remained significantly ahead of prepandemic levels at 170% of 2019, consistent with Q2. International volume was 120% of 2019, down 1 point from Q2. Excluding China and Russia, it was 146% of 2019, up 6 points. Q3 Cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, were 123% versus three years ago, up 11 points from Q2, and this includes Russia in prior period numbers. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 22 points from 82% of 2019 in Q2 to 104% in Q3, as we continue to see strong recovery in consumer and commercial travel. Process transactions were 139% versus 2019, 1 point above Q2. Credentials increased 8% year-over-year and are up 11%, excluding Russia. Before I dive into the client wins and progress towards our strategy, I wanted to take a moment to discuss two topics: recession and inflation. On the first, we're not economic forecasters, so I'm not going to predict the future or a potential likelihood of a recession. Instead, let's focus on the facts. From the numbers I just reviewed relative to 2019 levels, growth has been stable or improving in overall domestic payment volume, credit, debit, card present and card-not-present volume. And this indicates the most of 2022 with no indication of any slowdown, including in more recent weeks. In cross-border, of course, the recovery has continued to strengthen, while growth has been stable in aggregate, there are big shifts under the surface that continue to demonstrate the momentum of the recovery. First, from goods to services. Early in the pandemic, goods surpassed services. We were seeing the historic trend. Even as services have rebounded in the last six months, the percentage spending on goods in our payments volumes still remained high, higher than the pre-pandemic levels. For example, while U.S. home improvement and retail good spending during the third quarter grew only low single-digit year-over-year, it remains well ahead of pre-pandemic trendline. Second, many discussionary segments have further strengthened. If you look at U.S. travel spend, it is not backed to the pre-COVID trendline, but grew more than 40% versus last year. Third, the affluent spend continue to recover, particularly in the areas of restaurants, travel and entertainment. At the same time, non-affluent spend remained relatively resilient. We mentioned the affluent spend returning to restaurants last quarter. That trend continued this quarter with affluent restaurant spend indexing in the 160% to 180% range versus 2019. Similarly, in Europe in the last six months, luxury hotel payments volume and average ticket size outpaced growth in the overall hotel category versus 2019. At the same time, budget and mid-priced hotels saw modest improvements. Based on our numbers, we haven't seen any evidence of consumer pulling back spending in our markets. Now, a few words on inflation. It's just too early to draw any definitive conclusions. A few observations though on inflation. One, keep in mind that the headline CPI inflation number does not necessarily apply to Visa as our basket of goods isn't the same. Consumers just don't buy homes or use cards with their Visa cards, for example. So, we see a several point gap between headline inflation and inflation in card-related spend categories. Two, thus far, U.S. transaction growth relative to 2019 is strong and stable. Ticket sizes remain around 15 points above 2019 levels as they had for much of the pandemic due to several factors. Three, historically, in the U.S., we have seen PCE growth, which is the most important metric that drives our growth, remains strong even during inflationary periods. That said, lastly, excessive and long-term inflation is not good for consumers or the overall economy. Looking ahead, we'll continue to monitor the potential impact of inflation to ticket sizes, transaction counts, as well as volumes across spend categories. With all of that as backdrop, I'll now provide an update on progress with clients. Traditional issuers remain a key component of our consumer payments growth. And this quarter, we had several important partnership renewals globally. First, in China, we renewed our partnership with ICBC, the largest bank in the world, in terms of assets and the biggest credit card issuer in China in terms of the number of cards. In Japan, we renewed one of the country's largest credit issuers, Credit Saison, and expanded our issuing relationship with Toyota Finance. In Australia, we extended our credit and debit issuing agreements with NAV and CDA, two of the largest banks in the country. And in the U.S., we recently renewed our relationship with Green Dot, a top 20 issuer in debit and a top 10 issuer in prepaid. Fintechs are also key to our consumer payments growth. In Europe alone, we have more than 100 fintech programs that continue to deepen our relationship with these partners. Revolut is a great example. They already utilized a number of our capabilities, including Visa Direct and Currencycloud, and we just renewed our global issuing partnership. They also recently selected Tink for payment initiation services, which will allow users across Europe to seamlessly move money into their Revolut accounts. In many countries, the mobile operators are particularly important partners. We previously mentioned our partnerships with M-Pesa Africa and Safaricom, and I'm happy to report that we have begun issuance with these partners who are part of the Vodacom Group that cover 130 million customers in Sub-Saharan Africa. In a similar light, we also recently signed partnerships to issue Visa credentials, and in some cases, also enable Visa Direct with other mobile operators around the world. Mobily in Saudi Arabia with 10 million customers, Ooredoo in Qatar with around 2 million customers, Azercell in Azerbaijan with 5 million customers, and Orange Egypt with 27 million customers. I now want to dive a little deeper on two important markets, Brazil and India. Starting in Brazil, over the past two years, we have grown our business through issuing agreements with Itau\u0301, Mercado, Pago, Pataday and Caixa, with a 70% increase in credentials. In addition to traditional credit card issuance partners like Banco do Brasil have been growing their credit base by utilizing Visa's digital acquisition platform that allows them to instantly issue cards in a digital environment. Further, our fintech partners in Brazil, including Banco XP and Neon Pagamentos, have issued more than 20 million credentials over the past two years. On the acceptance side, we've doubled acceptance points since 2020, reaching more than 10 million merchant locations in Brazil. The results of our efforts over the past 8 to 10 quarters is evident in Brazil's payment volume, which in the third quarter was more than 200% of 2019, with e-commerce nearing 300%. In India, our efforts over the last few years are paying off and Q3 payments volume was 184% of 2019, with e-commerce above 300%. Building on that momentum, we had co-brand wins with two of the largest multibillion-dollar revenue Indian conglomerates that collectively represent millions of potential credentials. One with TataNeu, a super app for e-commerce financial services and loyalty programs across the Tata Group; two, with Aditya Birla Finance and SBI Cards, provide rewards for spending across all of their group companies. We also signed a co-brand with IndiGo, India's largest airline by number of passengers. And let me briefly touch on the US, where there's still great opportunity for cash digitization. We're excited about Tap to Pay, which has now reached 24% of face-to-face transactions in Q3. We're seeing positive trends in terms of additional spend and transaction lift in the US. In 2021, the average contactless active debit cardholder had two more transactions and $65 in additional spend each month. We expect this trend to continue, driving incremental payment volumes and transactions for contactless card issuers through faster, simpler POS experiences. Now moving to new flows, which in Q3 had over 20% revenue growth. In B2B, our Q3 commercial payments volume was 145% of 2019, up 6 points from Q2, driven by the return of travel. Q3 was the first quarter in which spend on business travel surpassed 2019 levels. This quarter, we're excited to have reached a significant multiyear agreement with WEX to enable their travel, health and corporate clients to make payments using Visa virtual card capabilities. WES is a global leader in financial technology solutions for commercial payments, and we are proud to partner with them. In the fleet space, we reached an agreement with M-PESA, a fintech based out of Kenya. Their fleet and expense management digital platform will address the problem of paying cash in the African trucking business through Visa prepaid reloadable credentials. Visa Direct is a powerful capability for many of our new flows. In this quarter, transactions grew 35%, excluding Russia.  On the remittance side, Western Union has enabled Visa Direct for their US customers to send money to select countries globally, expanding upon their initial rollout across Europe in 2021. We also expanded our agreement with Remitly, one of the world's premier digital service remittance companies to offer Visa Direct cross-border payments originating from Canada to bank accounts globally.  Another Visa Direct P2P expansion is with LINE Pay in Japan. Already a large wallet issuer, 6 million Visa credentials, LINE Pay is now enabling Visa Direct for cross-border and domestic use cases such as remittances and cash outs. On wage disbursement, GrubHub, a leading food ordering and delivery marketplace available in over 4,000 US cities, will enable drivers to quickly send their earnings to their eligible debit cards using Visa Direct. We are excited for them to join our other food delivery platforms, including DoorDash and SkipTheDishes. We also reached an agreement with the US tip enabler, TipSend [ph] to enable millions of tips disbursements to be pushed to employees' accounts through eligible debit cards at thousands of restaurant locations they serve. For TipSend, 90% of tips in the United States are still dispersed with cash today. In Canada, we reached an agreement with a large fintech, Wealthsimple, for accounts funds in and funds out for their over 2 million clients. Finally, enablers are key to our success in Visa Direct, and we recently signed a deal with Finastra, one of the world's largest financial services software companies and open banking platforms with 8,600 customers and serving 90 of the world's top 100 banks. Together, we will offer Finastra's clients access to cross-border business, the small business at B2C payouts to eligible accounts in multiple currencies and countries.  While the US was one of our first markets to achieve scale for Visa Direct, we have many other countries and regions that are growing and scaling. For example, in Latin America, third quarter transactions quadrupled versus last year. We have over 20 domestic and cross-border P2P programs commercially launched or in pilot, such as PLIN and Yape in Peru, WhatsApp in Brazil and Cash across Central America, in addition to many other programs for other use cases.  Now let me move to value-added services, which had Q3 revenue growth of almost 20%. Evaluated services grow through new and existing clients, existing services, expanding geographically and adding new services both organically and through acquisitions. Today, I'll provide an update on recent wins with some of our acquired entities. First, one of our earlier acquisitions, CyberSource, recently added NCR and Global Payments as partners, both intend to offer CyberSource capabilities to their merchant clients. This is an important strategy as our merchant base utilizing CyberSource through acquirers is growing payments volume twice as fast as the rest of our CyberSource business. Cardinal Commerce, our network-agnostic authentication capability, has grown transactions 30% globally year-to-date, with more than double that in Europe, where the secure customer authentication requirement has driven faster adoption of 3D Secure. VERIFI, our network agnostic dispute resolution solution, recently extended its agreement with PNC for VERIFI's cardholder dispute resolution network product. YellowPepper, the network agnostic connectivity platform, just signed Vex [ph], the Brazilian bank that offers its $50 million corporate and individual clients worldwide trade, e-commerce, staff solutions and most recently an FX API platform. Vex will use YellowPepper's payment initiation services to enable cross-border money movement starting with Visa Direct to send payouts to eligible cards. I mentioned Tink's recent win earlier. Our other acquisition from this fiscal year, Currencycloud, has signed more than 100 Fintech clients since December to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments. And finally, the tokenization capabilities we acquired now called Token ID have been selected by several partners. First, Global Payments will use Visa's Token ID as their strategic go-forward solution for multiple EMV network tokenization services to reduce card-not-present fraud and realize operational efficiencies for their clients. Second, the Clearinghouse, the first US real-time payment network in one of two US ACH networks, chose Visa's Token ID solution to power the secure token exchange. This industry-first account tokenization solution in the United States is utilizing Visa's Token ID payment account tokenization technology to replace sensitive customer account data with unique tokens and reduce the amount of exposed payment data. Our internally developed value-added services are just as important. One very compelling solution is from Visa consulting and analytics. Together with FIS, we recently launched a risk-as-a-service solution powered by data and risk experts. Key components of progress over the past 12 months include our real-time monitoring through our AI-enabled platform has blocked over $2 billion in fraudulent payments volume. Our analysis of potential fraud for a proactive testing identified a $15 million exposure to clients. Our capabilities to proactively detect and mitigate cyber criminals attempts to inject payment skimming malware onto online merchant checkout pages has prevented over $10 million in e-commerce-related losses. And our ability to detect terminal cloning has successfully blocked $3 million in fraud from attempted downloads. In sum, we had a very strong quarter and our results showed it. We made progress continuing to build relationships and solutions across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services that will fuel future growth around the globe. We remain vigilant in monitoring the trends in our business and the economy and confident on our strategy as we enable the movement of money globally. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant. So, I'll start, Sanjay. I actually think cross-border travel has come back very, very strongly and quicker than what we thought and that still with as you suggested, Asia being quite low. You heard the numbers, both inbound and outbound, in Vasant's remarks. Plus inbound to the U.S., somewhat up until recently because of the COVID -- required COVID test and now the strength of the U.S. dollar still has upside as well. So, yes, for sure, there is some element of pent-up demand, but I think that, that demand is going to remain strong for some time. And I don't see people being deterred even by higher cost of airline tickets that people are experiencing. If anything, probably the experiential element of waiting in airports for a longer period of time because of understaffing that exists in a number of places around the world is probably the thing that weighs more on my mind, but I expect that to normalize at some point here soon. Vasant, do you want to add anything? Well, thanks, Lisa. One of the terrific things about Visa Direct is that, it isn't running on a different new platform. It runs on VisaNet and, therefore, has the ability to utilize all of the same capabilities that we have on VisaNet, including those related to KYC and those related to fraud prevention. So, certainly, this is something that we're well aware of and we'll continue to watch closely. I do think that consumers value this P2P capability in very, very big ways, not just in the United States, but around the world, and I certainly expect it to be a use case that continues to grow around the world, and we'll just have to make sure that we're working closely with Zelle and other partners to make sure that we're contributing as much as we can to make sure that, that service is secure as can be, because as you know, trust is a basic underpinning of money movement in every single use case around the world. Well, thanks, Tien-Tsin. I think we're a very different company from any past recession, I guess, going back to 2008-2009 time frame. First of all, we're strong -- much stronger in debit, which tends to be the vehicle, the card of choice for people in a slowdown period. We're stronger in everyday spend categories. We're stronger in e-commerce. We benefited from this acceleration in cash utilization that happened during the pandemic. Since the last recession, we've added Europe, which is a very important part of the company today and contributes to our growth. And then as you alluded to, we've added an emphasis on value-added services and new flows. Some of those value-added services are tied to volume. So the degree that some volumes might go down, those might go down as well. But on the other hand, for volumes that we will have today that we -- that will have the opportunity to sell more value-added services than we would have in the prior recession. The last thing I would say is that it is very possible that today, people are changing what they're buying, but they're not changing how they're paying. And we fall into the latter category. And we see overall spending levels, as we talked about remaining high, and we continue to see people choosing to pay with Visa not depending on any change that they might be making in what they're buying or the baskets that they have. Well, I think open banking is in its early days, but I think that we're quite well positioned. As you well know, that the ground zero for open banking happens to be Europe. We have a very good business there. And obviously, Tink has a footprint in 18 markets in Europe. It has a single API that allows customers, primarily developers that access financial data. It has connectivity to 3,400 banks and financial institutions and greater than 10,000 developers. And we believe the thesis for us is that takes capabilities with our capabilities and our relationships will allow Tink to be stronger where it already is, and will -- with our help, we'll be able to broaden their footprint in which Tink operates. And that's certainly one of the things that we're in discussions internally with Tink, as to where we go next in the world. We also think that our infrastructure and our cyber and fraud capabilities and our capabilities related to protecting the customers' transaction at all the steps along the way is going to just help accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe. So we're excited about the prospects of it. We think we're really well positioned. It's just going to be a matter of how quickly it takes off, but we're in good shape to the degree that it does. Well, Bryan, that's been the thesis from the beginning that we want to make sure that we generate on a sustained ongoing basis attractive revenue growth. And you're certainly correct that at some point in time, depending upon the pace at which Asia cross-border comes back and US inbound cross-border continues to come back, that will settle back into some more normal level growth rate for consumer payments. I'm not going to predict when that will be, whether that's in two quarters or six quarters or seven quarters, but it will happen at some point in time. And our expectation and aspiration has been that value-added services and new flows will grow at numbers of percentage points higher than consumer payments that will, therefore, allow us to get to sustained revenue growth rate that we think, over time, will be attractive to the investors in the company. Don, you're touching on -- there's a number of elements that impact our volumes. And we'll touch on a few of them. Affluent spenders are returning to the economy and their higher spending in restaurants and travel, among other categories. And this isn't necessarily inflation, but a mix shift. The impact of people working from home and hybrid work definitely continue to have impact on smaller tickets that are things that people buy in the mornings and at lunch time, when they're actually commuting and working in an office environment.  Certainly, small tickets, as a percentage of overall tickets, are still below pre-pandemic levels as a result. Last year, stimulus clearly drove ticket sizes up, particularly in discretionary categories, and we're kind of lapping that now. What we don't know are what level of substitutions are taking place, where people might be buying more staples and less discretionary items, but they're spending at the same level they did, or whether as some retailers have said, people are trading down from brands to private labels. But it's also difficult for us to understand consumption reduction. So, for example, consumers could be buying less fuel, but spending at the same amount or buying smaller package sizes of things like snacks and yet spending the same amount. So, I think, Don, clearly, inflation is in our numbers. And people are likely to change, making some changes on what they're buying. But as I said earlier, I think in response to Tien-Tsin's question, they're not changing how they're paying. Yes. Something that we will watch and be very thoughtful about over time. But we have -- we've got years and years of experience in pricing in the consumer payments business and we're building our sophistication in terms of pricing in our newer lines of business in new flows and value-added services. As we said many times, our philosophy is that we want to make sure that we're pricing in a way that balances all the various parties within the ecosystem and ideally stimulates more and more cash digitization and more and more money movement across our network. So, in short, we think there definitely is still more opportunity in the pricing lever. I have not heard that from any clients or partners that I have talked to. Look, I think everybody is out there wondering whether we're going to or not going to face a recession. We're certainly undeniably in a high inflation environment right now. But given that, that was really driven by a shortage of workers leading to a shortage of production of goods and services and then, you throw the Ukrainian war on top of it, which had some impacts along the way, and all of this coming off of a pandemic, there really isn't a history that provides any kind of insight into exactly what might happen here. We're continuing to do two things. One is to make sure that we're smartly investing in the future to drive our three growth levers. And as Vasant alluded to in response to a question earlier, we're being very vigilant in looking into the numbers and seeing if we see anything that requires us to be proactive in any action that we might take. But at this point, as I think we've said a few times now, the level of consumer spending up through July 21, which reported on in Vasant's remarks, have the consumer spending has remained very resilient. And for how long that will be, one, it remains to be seen. But again, I'd remind everybody that we don't have the same input costs and COGS as other businesses. And we're a company that facilitates payments. So regardless of whether people are consuming differently or substituting one good for another good, they still need to pay for it and they're utilizing our services to do that."

            "content": "Thank you, Al. Good afternoon everyone. Our fiscal third quarter results reflected continued strength in domestic spend and a robust recovery in travel with net revenues up 19% and GAAP EPS up 36%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 33%. The ever strengthening dollar dragged down reported net revenue growth by almost three points and non-GAAP EPS growth by nearly three and a half points. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was over 21%, and non-GAAP EPS growth was 36%. Adjusting for Russia, constant dollar net revenue growth was 26%. A few key highlights. Global payments volume growth has remained strong and stable relative to pre-COVID levels. In constant dollars, the US index was 2 points higher than the second quarter, up 46% versus 2019. The international index, ex-China and Russia, was up 6 points from the second quarter, also 46% above 2019. The robust cross-border travel recovery continued. Index to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, jumped from 94 in March to 112 in June. This was helped by much of Asia opening up at the beginning of the quarter. The US inbound corridor picking up steam, as well as strong growth in and out of Europe, as we head into the peak summer travel season. Our three growth engines, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues around 20%. During the quarter, we bought back almost $2.5 billion in stock at an average price of $202.16. We also added $600 million to the MDL litigation escrow account. This had the same effect as a stock buyback at $200.25. We issued EUR 3 billion in debt, with maturities ranging from 4 to 12 years. We obtained attractive coupons on our inaugural eurobond issuance, ranging from 1.5% to 2.375%, well below rates achievable on the equivalent dollar-denominated debt. We have now prefunded debt maturities coming up in September and December. Finally, as a reminder, we suspended operations in Russia late in the second quarter. As such, there are no volumes, transactions or revenues from Russia in our third quarter numbers. Any comparisons to prior periods include Russia, unless otherwise noted. Now on to the details. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 36% above 2019. Excluding China and Russia, total payments volume growth was 17% and 46% higher than 2019. In the US, credit grew 21% and improved 3 points to 38% over 2019, helped by travel and fuel spend. Debit grew 4% year-over-year, lapping the big spike from the stimulus last year. Relative to 2019, debit was up 55%, sustaining significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. Debit has benefited from accelerated cash digitization through the pandemic. US card present spend grew 13% and was 27% above 2019, up 6 points. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 7% and was 70% higher than 2019. Relative to three years ago, e-commerce levels remain well above the pre-COVID trend line, even as card-present spend continues to recover. International constant dollar payments volumes, excluding China and Russia, grew 24% and was 46% above 2019. A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 40% year-over-year and 107% higher than 2019, with robust performance across the region fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 34% year-over-year and 102% higher than 2019, led by client wins and cash digitalization. Europe was up 17% year-over-year and 37% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion underway in the UK, ex-UK, Europe was 66% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Excluding migrations, UK payment volumes have been stable in the third quarter, while Germany improved more than 15 points from the second quarter. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region but has improved significantly from the second quarter, up 24% year-over-year and 30% above 2019, up five points in the second quarter. Across Asia, most borders are open and domestic restrictions lifted. Only China remains mostly closed off, and Japan is gradually normalizing. Global process transactions were up 16% year-over-year and 39% over 2019 levels. Since we did not process domestic transactions in Russia, our reported process transactions are not materially impacted by the suspension of Russia operations. Now on to cross-border. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe were up 48% year-over-year and 23% over 2019. Cross-border card not present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 4% year-over-year and 62% above 2019. Cross-border travel related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 129% year-over-year and exceeded pre-COVID levels for the first time, indexing at 104 of 2019. The cross-border travel index went from the low 90s in March and April to 108% in May and 112% in June. We continue to see a rapid ramp-up in travel as soon as borders reopen or restrictions are lifted. A few highlights. Canada removed testing requirements for vaccinated travelers in April. Travel inbound to the US jumped 16 points in the third quarter to 86% of 2019 levels, helped by Canada, Europe and Asia. The lifting of testing requirements in June will hopefully help sustain the recovery of travel into the US. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean has been very strong through the COVID years, especially to Mexico. With more countries, including Costa Rica and Jamaica, lifting COVID protocols in April, inbound travel to the region climbed nearly 20 points in the third quarter to 50% of our 2019 levels. European Union member states removed previous testing and vaccination requirements for non-European citizens in April and May, resulting in travel to Europe recovering a sizable 30 points in the third quarter with more than half of that from North America. Inbound travel to Europe was 21% about 2019. Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, CEMEA region, outbound travel increased six points in the third quarter despite the loss of Russia, driven by Ukraine and travel for religious holidays from the Middle East and was 13% above 2019. In Asia, borders continue to open and travel restrictions eased for international travelers, resulting in inbound travel recovering 22 points in the third quarter to 58% of 2019 levels. Japan opened to tourists and increased the entry limit from 10,000 to 20,000 people per day. Australia dropped pre-arrival testing requirements in April. Several countries, including Malaysia and Vietnam, dropped testing requirements in May. The pace of travel recovery to and from Asia will be a key driver of the future trajectory of cross-border travel. Most Asian borders are now open, except for Mainland China and some restrictions in Taiwan and Japan. In the third quarter, travel into China indexed below 25% of 2019 and outbound from China below 40%. Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 13%, slower than the 14% nominal growth in Q2 payments volume. Reported Q2 payments volumes include Russia, whereas revenues in Q3 do not since we recognized second quarter service revenues for Russia before we suspended operations last year -- last quarter. Data processing revenues grew 8%, below the 16% process transaction growth. Revenue growth lags transaction growth, primarily due to the suspension of Russia operations. As I mentioned earlier, Russia domestic transactions were not included in our reported process transactions, and as such, the loss of Russia does not materially impact transactions growth. However, we did have data processing revenue from Russia transactions in prior periods, which we do not anymore. This negatively impacted data processing revenue growth by over four points. There was also about a two-plus point exchange rate drag. International transaction revenues were up 51% versus the 38% increase in nominal cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and select pricing actions. Other revenues grew 26%, led by consulting services and travel benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines, each growing around 20%. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by carded B2B recovery. Commercial or B2B volumes grew 27% year-over-year and are up 45% versus 2019. Growth was driven, in part, by increased travel and was broad-based globally across small and large businesses. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 35% due to strong growth outside the US. Value-added services growth was led by consulting services as well as risk and identity solutions. Revenue growth drivers include higher volumes from existing clients, greater clients and attrition and select pricing actions. Client incentives were 26.1% of gross revenues below our expectations. This was primarily driven by the faster-than-expected recovery of higher-yielding cross-border volumes, which improved revenue mix. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. Exchange rates were an approximately 3-point drag on reported revenue growth. The suspension of Russia operations reduced revenues by approximately 5 points. GAAP operating expenses grew 51%, inclusive of a $716 million provision associated with the interchange multi-restrict litigation. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 15%. The inclusion of Currencycloud and Tink added about 3 points. The suspension of Russia operations reduced expenses by about 3 points. Exchange rates were about a 2-point benefit. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $246 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $73 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 13.3%. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates benefited by 6 points from the resolution of certain US state and foreign tax matters related primarily through prior years.  Our recurring tax rate remains in the 19% to 19. 5% range. GAAP EPS was $1.60. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.98, up 33% over last year, inclusive of nearly 3.5 point drag from the stronger dollar. With a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buybacks, we returned $3.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Through the first three weeks of July, business trends have remained strong and stable.  On a year-over-year basis, US payments volume was up 12% with debit up 6% and credit up 18%. US spend growth versus 2019 was up 46% with debit up 55% and credit up 38%. These trends are consistent with the third quarter and with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 14% year-over-year, up 40% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 60% year-over-year and 29% over 2019. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 57% above 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 16% above 2019. Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. As Al indicated, we're seeing no evidence of a pullback in consumer spending. US payments volumes have indexed in the mid-140 range versus 2019 since January through July 21. Excluding Russia and China, international payments volumes have also indexed about 140 since January. Process transactions have been stable at around 140 versus 2019. As such, we are assuming that the trends we have seen in payments volume and processed transactions will continue through the fourth quarter. We will, of course, stay vigilant and on the lookout for any changes caused by rising interest rates, high inflation and declining consumer confidence. Through July, the cross-border recovery has progressed faster and further than we had expected last October. For the fourth quarter, we're assuming stable growth versus 2019 in cross-border e-commerce and some improvement from travel in and out of Europe and into the US, especially from Asia. The next and perhaps the last leg of the cross-border travel recovery will have to await a full reopening in China, which we do not expect in the near future.  With these assumptions, fourth quarter net revenues could grow at the high teens to 20% range in constant dollars. This includes Tink and Currencycloud, which add approximately 0.5 point to net revenues, and the suspension of operations in Russia, which subtracts approximately 5 points.  The dollar has continued to strengthen, significantly increasing the exchange rate drag, which we expect will reduce reported net revenue growth by 4 to 5 points. Q4 client incentives are expected to range between 26% and 27% of gross revenues, driven primarily by anticipated strong volume performance across all regions. For the year, we now expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the middle of the 25.5% to 26.5% range. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in constant dollars to grow at the low end or high teens. This includes 2 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink, offset by 3 points from reduced costs due to Russia. Personnel costs will be higher since we are granting annual salary increases a quarter earlier than normal to all employees below the SVP level. This will add three points to Q4 operating expense growth. Exchange rates could reduce reported operating expense growth by about two points. Our tax rate is expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range. While there's uncertainty, consumer spending remains strong. Growth has been stable across payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions globally. We have demonstrated our ability to adjust to different environments and are prepared to do so again if warranted. We will stay vigilant, flexible and agile. We are fortunate to have a resilient business with great momentum and extraordinary longer term growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer. Yes. Clearly, I mean, there's a variety of factors at play here. First, there has been a general shift in consumer preferences. You've heard this from other people, to move away from goods to experiences, and travel is very much a beneficiary of that. It's not just cross-border travel. As Al said in his remarks, it's all travel, including domestic travel. So, it's a pretty broad-based desire to travel. The second is people are keen to travel. So, as soon as restrictions are lifted, you see the reactions right away. In terms of where the strength is, clearly, the recovery in Asia has been quite strong. You saw how much it improved this quarter, almost 20 points, if I remember right. And it is continuing. It's happening all across Asia, except for places like China, and they're still -- it's not that easy to get in and out of Japan and Taiwan. But elsewhere, it's very strong across Asia. There's a huge amount of interest in traveling to Europe and significant interest in European traveling out of Europe. So Europe has been also recovering very fast and is indexing at pretty high levels relative to pre-COVID volumes. The other area that continues to surprise is Latin America. We told you that it was always quite high, because Latin America stayed fairly open. But in the last quarter it jumped another 20 points and is indexing in the 150 range for people traveling into Latin America. So as you look across it, this looks pretty durable. There's still recovery left to come, as you can see. Asia still was indexing well below 2019 levels. The U.S. is still below 2019 levels. So we don't think this ends anytime soon. Yes. The pull forward of salary increases means that when we get to the fourth quarter of next year, we'll lap the increase that we have. So in that sense, yes, it moderates a little bit the impact on next year since some of it comes into this year. You've seen us in the past adjust based on external circumstances, and we will be monitoring trends and will stay flexible and move fast if we have to, again. That said, this is a business with tremendous long-term growth opportunities. We think the new use cases that are being developed in the new flows business and the opportunities we have across value-added services for global expansion, for deeper penetration of existing clients as well as adding new services are very significant. So we have to be keeping an eye on the long-term opportunity and not under-investing. Having said that, if times get tough, we -- as we did during the pandemic, you prioritize, you sequence things, you pace things. You don't pull back on all the investment. You just try to do it based on a new reality. So during the pandemic, for example, we scale back in certain areas like cross-border where spending on marketing or things like that wouldn't have made any difference because borders were closed. And we'll try and do things like that if we have to again. Yes. I mean going back to your question on whether we're seeing any slowdown in spending by lower income consumers. No, we're not. We keep looking for it because we've heard some other people say it, and we're not seeing any evidence of that. Your second question, I presume was the wealth effect on affluent consumers of what's happening in the stock market and things like that?  As Al said, I mean we're not seeing that. If anything, affluent spending has been on the rise and is one of the reasons why we've seen some of the robust growth we saw this quarter. Remember, we're lapping a very significant growth quarter last year that included sizable stimulus payments. And despite that, we had some very good growth this quarter. And a lot of that is driven by affluent consumers, by discretionary spending coming back and no evidence of a wealth effect that people are holding back. Yes. Capital allocation has -- approach has not changed. As we've said before, our first priority is investing in our core business. We generate a lot of free cash flow. Our first priority is to invest in what is a fabulous business we have, which has tremendous growth opportunities as we've discussed around some of the new use cases and new flows around value-added services and of course, in our core consumer payments business. After that, clearly, it's how can M&A enhance what we do, and we can do that by buying something that expands our capabilities like we've done in the past, or something that gives us new capabilities like Tink does with open banking or like Currencycloud does with the capabilities they have that are geared towards real-time FX and serving the needs of newer enterprises, the Fintechs rather than traditional companies. So, we will continue to look for things that can enhance what we have. In terms of timing and opportunities, clearly, as valuations have come back in, we've stayed disciplined when things are bubbly. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have tremendous capacity. We are definitely interested in acquisitions where the value is justified. Time will tell where the valuations in private markets get to levels that are attractive and companies have to be for sale. But clearly, M&A is an important component of our future. We have clear ideas on where we want to expand M&A-wise. And as they come up, we'll talk about it. Yes. As Al said, I mean, we don't view ourselves as economic forecasters and don't want to get into that. And we've said before that we are not leading indicators. We probably coincident indicators. If there's a change in spending, we'll see it as it happens. The only area of our business where we see a little bit ahead is, as you said, in travel bookings, and those are holding up well. Whether it's cross-border bookings or domestic travel bookings, if you look at the card-not-present element of travel which is where those bookings happen; there is really no change in trend. So at least looking out 30, 60 days, which is what the lead time is on those kinds of things, there is no change in trend. Other than that, a lot of what we see is quite intuitive. There's -- as Al said, there's a shift towards discretionary purchases. There's a shift towards things people couldn't do before, during the pandemic, experiences around restaurants, entertainment and travel. As we said, while goods may not be growing as much as they were year-over-year, they're still well above the COVID -- pre-COVID trend line. So there's nothing there that is out of the ordinary at this point. Yeah. I mean outbound from the US is very strong. It's been about 2019 levels now for a few, if not weeks, a couple of months. Inbound to the US, we told you was indexing in the high 80s. So it's still below 2019 levels. And we think that there's room for recovery there. What we've seen on the cross-border side is a little bit of a stair step where you have periods where there's rapid growth like you saw in April and May and we saw in October and November, when a variety of countries remove restrictions, you see a huge amount of travel happening fairly quickly. And then you see a certain amount of stabilization after that, like we saw partly because of Omicron in December and January, and we saw in March and April. As you look at the fourth quarter, most of the world is open. And so we are assuming steady improvement in travel out of Asia, steady improvement of travel into and out of Europe, improvement of travel into the US. But there are no big openings left, which is why we don't think there'll be a big stair step up in the fourth quarter. We'll wait and see. The big openings left would be China, of course, which we gave you the index. It's still very low. And there's recovery left in Japan, because letting in 20, 000 people is one-fifth of what the normal amount of people who go into Japan were. It's more like 100,000 people. So there's a few left. So the short answer is a modest recovery in the fourth quarter, and we'll see what happens."

Before jumping in, I want to acknowledge that this is Jennifer Como's first earnings call in her new position. About 2 months ago, Jennifer was promoted to Head of Investor Relations, which was a very well-deserved recognition of her work over the last 3 years with us. I want to start by briefly addressing the situation in Russia and Ukraine. I have seen firsthand the pain brought about by Russia's attack on Ukraine and its people, including our colleagues in both Ukraine and Russia. We are very focused on supporting them. The bravery, strength and resilience of our colleagues is incredibly inspiring, as is the grit of the Ukrainian military. Even with the invasion of Ukraine and lingering impacts of Omicron, volumes, transactions and credentials drove strong second quarter performance. Overall, PB was up 135% versus 3 years ago. Cross-border volumes, excluding inter-Europe, were 112% versus 3 years ago. And it's important to note that travel-related cross-border rose to 82% versus 3 years ago, up 5 points from Q1. Processed transactions were 138% versus 3 years ago. In terms of the big picture, after the short 4- to 5-week impact of Omnicon in December and January in the United States and many other parts of the world, the recovery continues to be robust. At this stage, in terms of volumes, we have seen no noticeable impact due to inflation, supply chain issues or the war in Ukraine. In the U.S., payments volume index to 2019 was 144 in the quarter. Volume growth relative to 3 years ago has been stable and strong now for 4 quarters in a row. When looking at specific spend categories for credit cards, we saw greater than a 10 percentage point improvement in the 3-year index from Q1 to 2Q -- Q2 in travel, retail goods, food and drug, restaurant, QSR and fuel. As a reminder, debit is growing over a quarter in fiscal '21, where there were 2 stimulus distributions. Even as credit continues to recover, debit remains 20% above the prepandemic trend line. Across all products, spend categories representing 88% of PB are over 120% indexed -- over 120 indexed to 3 years ago, and nearly 2/3 are between 1 40 and 1 60. Against this backdrop, Visa's performance was very strong. Net revenues grew 25% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $1.79, up 30%. As we look ahead, our business will have a reset due to Russia, but we still expect accelerated revenue growth versus pre-COVID over the coming years. This is because there's still ample opportunity around the world across our 3 growth levers of consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, and our strategy is yielding excellent results. First, in consumer payments, we continue to displace cash at a strong rate. In Q2, we saw debit cash volumes at Visa grow 2%, while debit payments volumes grew 12%. Cash displacement continued around the world. Year-over-year, across debit and credit, there were 7.9 billion more payments transactions and 16 million less cash transactions. Last quarter, I highlighted the shift from cash to payments volume in Latin America, and that trend continued in this quarter. Additionally, CEMEA is experiencing a similar shift. In full year 2019, cash was 59% of total volume. Last year in Q2, it was 50%. And this quarter, it was 46%. Growth in consumer payments is driven by adding credentials and acceptance and deepening engagement. Our card credentials recently increased to over 3.9 billion, up 9% in 1 year, including 10% growth in the United States. On the acceptance side, we have 80 million merchant locations, including small businesses behind players like Stripe and Square, the number is actually over $100 million. We have seen very strong performance location growth recently in our Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, up 30% and 20%, respectively. Let me just highlight a few regional examples of progress in consumer payments. In Europe, overall credentials grew 6%, which is nearly double the historic rate for each of the past 8 quarters, helped by previously announced deals with BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium contributing more than 4 million credentials since their announcement to issue with Visa. Across Europe, we continue to strengthen our debit business. We recently announced the [indiscernible] bank, representing a multimillion credential opportunity. We also renewed our business with one of the largest banks in the Nordics, Nordea. On the acceptance front, we continue to pioneer new areas of acceptance even in mature digital markets. One recent in example in Europe is with electronic -- electric vehicle charging. We were the first payments and financial services company that joined the charging interface initiative and are working with manufacturers to open up what is estimated to represent 3 million potential acceptance points in Europe by 2030. In Latin America, we saw strong credential growth, up 21% year-over-year. Two renewals to highlight this quarter: Porto Seguro, Brazil's third largest issuer for credit portfolio and digital bank, Neon Pagamentos, one of Brazil's fastest-growing fintechs with over 15 million clients for their credit and prepaid portfolios. In Africa, Visa has signed a partnership with Vodacom South Africa. This deal, together with previously announced partnerships with M-PESA Africa and Safaricom covers 130 million customers in the entire Vodacom Group in Sub-Saharan Africa. Through this partnership, Vodacom will exclusively issue Visa payment credentials, deploy new payment flows through Visa Direct and utilize cyber source. In the United States, we renewed and won several partnerships this quarter. First, Visa and USAA have recently renewed our long-standing issuing partnership. Second, we extended our existing relationship agreement with M&T Bank as their issuance partner, including migrating the business resulting from their recently completed acquisition of People's United. Over the past 2 years, merger activity of regional banks has increased, and this is another example of Visa successfully partnering to grow with our clients. Finally, supporting the U.S. government is an important priority for us, and we retained our business with the financial agent that manages the U.S. debit card program. This Visa-branded program is a key component of Treasury's goal to deliver 99% of federal payments digitally by 2030. A key vector of growth in consumer payments are cobrand cards, which are particularly attractive to the affluent customer. In Q2, affluent credit card spending was well above 2019 levels in several markets, including the U.S. and the U.K. Our U.S. cobrand active cards were up nearly 30% from 2019 to 2022. And we have 7 of the top 10 cobrands in the United States and 8 of the top 10 cobrands globally. This past quarter, we renewed our cobrand relationship with AAA, Visa's longest-standing cobrand partner, an over 40-year relationship. In India, we're pleased to have signed a long-term cobrand agreement with Airtel, one of the largest mobile operators in the world with nearly 356 million subscribers. In CEMEA, Emirates NBD, a leading banking group has expanded its long-standing partnership with Visa by introducing the premium cobrand program with Etihad Guest, the loyalty program of Etihad Airlines with 8 million members. In Uganda, we partnered with the Uganda National Social Security Fund to issue cobrand cards to 2 million beneficiaries. And just a few weeks ago, it was announced that the U.S. Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card has been renewed with Chase and Visa. Visa is also pleased to have reached a broad global agreement with Amazon. This agreement includes the acceptance of Visa at all Amazon stores and sites today, as well as a joint commitment to collaboration on new product and technology initiatives to ensure innovative payment experiences for our customers into the future. In Q2, we also continued to enable new ways to pay from installments to crypto. In the installment space, we previously announced a global deal with Klarna. They have now issued their cobranded card in Europe and recently opened a waitlist in the United States, where they have 25 million customers. In the crypto space, we continue to work with governments globally on potential CBDCs. This quarter, we were selected as the finalist in Brazil's CBDC lift challenge. The concept is a B2B solution that seeks to leverage CBDC to help small businesses access global investors and drive financial inclusion. On the engagement front, Tap to Pay continues to accelerate growth. In the United States, we are over 20% tap to pay penetration, marking the second largest market by number of tasks. And Target has become the first U.S. retail merchant to pay us 50% tap to pay penetration of face-to-face payments. Transit is one of the best ways to habituate tapping and the first half of fiscal '22 has set records. We enabled 50 cities around the world, including Thailand, Japan, Turkey, Italy, Switzerland, Norway and Canada, bringing our Tap to Ride footprint to over 500 travel transit authorities. We processed over 500 million Visa tap to ride transactions globally versus 700 million for all of last year. To summarize, there is significant opportunity in consumer payments, Visa continues to grow credentials and acceptance with deepening engagement and Visa enables innovation and scale for players across the ecosystem from installments to crypto to merchants. Now moving to new flows, which in Q2 had over 20% revenue growth. In Q2, our commercial payments volume was 138% of 2019. What's more of this recovery is relatively broad-based across segments and spend types. On the B2B carded front, in the U.S., Umpqua Bank announced two commercial solutions for middle market businesses. One, Visa Commercial Preferred, a commercial rewards card designed to help manage daily business spend; and two, Visa Commercial Pay, which will help improve cash flow management, reconciliation and reporting. In Latin America, we saw a carded progress with B2B fintech, Tribal, which has chosen Visa for card issuance, including virtual cards on its modern corporate card and spend management platform tailored for startups in 9 countries. Airwallex, a global platform, enabling digital businesses to manage payments and money movement across borders, previously launched programs with Visa in Australia, Hong Kong and the U.K. Recently, they introduced virtual Visa cards in the United States, Netherlands and Singapore to enable businesses to easily make digital card payments around the world. In our cross-border B2B business, Visa B2B Connect continues to expand its global footprint. And in the first half of 2022, we added banks for the first time in Tanzania, Uganda, Angola, Thailand and Poland. Now turning to Visa Direct. Transactions in the second quarter grew 20%. Vasant will speak more about this, but Russia was our second largest market for Visa Direct and represented about 17% of our transactions in fiscal 2021. So in short, Visa Direct will -- be impacted by the suspension of Russian operations. But even with the Russia business -- without the Russia business, we will see growth ahead driven by many use cases and countries. For example, domestic P2P, which accounted for the majority of our Russian business is still a large opportunity, and we continue to expand to new markets. We will soon launch our inaugural Visa Direct use case in Israel for P2P in partnership with Bit, the largest P2P app in the market. I'll focus on 2 other use cases today, payouts and remittances. First, with payouts, we see -- we're seeing momentum in a number of industries and transactions are up 35% year-over-year. In travel, we launched Visa Direct with Booking.com to enable customer refunds and loyalty payouts. In the gig economy, Payfare, a leading fintech that has partners such as Uber, Lyft and DoorDash, has added Visa Direct to its platform to help facilitate real-time payment experiences for over 0.5 million gig workers they serve. And digital commerce partner, Payoneer, we use Visa Direct to enable cross-border payments for their 5 million customers, including marketplaces and gig economy players. Second, cross-border P2P or global remittances, which are higher yielding Visa Direct transactions represent a significant opportunity. While we are just getting started this quarter, transactions grew nearly 50% year-over-year. After announcing our relationship in fiscal fourth quarter with Paysend, an international card-to-card payments platform, which serves over 6 million customers and 17,000 SMEs, they have now launched their cross-border service with Visa Direct from the U.K. and U.S. to over 100 corridors. While the U.S. is the top source for remittances, the UAE is the second largest source for country remittances followed by Saudi Arabia according to the World Bank. Altogether, the Gulf Cooperation Council countries account for more than $100 billion in outbound remittances. This past quarter, we added several partnerships to help digitize remittances in the region. First, AL Muzaini Exchange, the largest exchange house in Kuwait. Second, Enjaz, the remittance and payment arm of Bank Albilad, and market leader for ongoing remittances in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And third, in the UAE with LuLu Money powered by Lulu International Exchange and Network International to enable the 5 million users of Lulu app to send money to cross-border. [Audion] and Stripe, key Visa Direct enablement partners have both signed agreements to deepen relationships in existing geographies and to expand to net new markets globally across numerous use cases. In sum, we've made excellent early progress against the $185 trillion new flows opportunity, but there is tremendous room for accelerated growth ahead. Now let me move to value-added services, which had Q2 revenue growth of over 20% as well. First, we recently closed our acquisition of Tink. Tink is a European open banking platform that connects to more than 3,400 banks that reach over 250 million bank customers across Europe. Through a single API, Tink enables its customers to move money, access aggregated financial data and use smart financial services such as risk insights and account verification. Visa brings proven infrastructure and sustained investment in resilience, cybersecurity and fraud, which will help accelerate the adoption of open banking and create a secure, reliable platform for innovation. Let me highlight some other progress in value-added services. First, Visa consulting and analytics. Last quarter, I announced the launch of our specialized global crypto advisory practice. We've seen interest from hundreds of clients globally and have committed engagements with 30 already covering their digital currency strategy, product development and their go-to-market plans. Second, risk identity and authentication. In tokenization, we have now crossed the 3.5 billion token mark across more than 8,600 issuers in over 150 markets at 1.2 million merchants. Tokens have led to a 2.5 point increase in approval rates and a 28% reduction in fraud rates this past quarter in card net payment -- card net present payments. Our key risk solutions, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, screened about 30% more transactions in the first half of 2022 versus 2021. Third, CyberSource, our gateway capability has seeing considerable progress, just crossing the milestone of the 1 millionth merchant account onboarded. I spoke about transit before in CyberSource, which could play a key role in transit acceptance, added nearly 15 projects in the first half in Thailand, Italy and Japan, among others. So to summarize, our value-added services represent a compelling way to diversify our revenue streams while helping our clients bring in -- in bringing innovation to the payments ecosystem. Our global infrastructure is providing connectivity through our network of networks to power more traditional payment types and newer ways to pay and move money. Our brand is strong. Our network of networks is expanding. Our business is performing well and our people are motivated and passionate. We expect all our efforts will help power accelerated growth in the years to come. And with that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Despite Omicron, Russia and Ukraine, our fiscal second quarter results were very strong with net revenues up 25% and GAAP EPS up 23%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 30%. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was approximately 27% and non-GAAP EPS growth was 30%. A few key highlights. Global payments volume growth has remained strong and stable relative to pre-COVID levels. In constant dollars, the U.S. index was 2 points higher than the first quarter at 1.44 versus 3 years ago. The international index, ex China, was down 2 points at 1.40 versus 2019 due to the impact of Omicron in early January. Omicron impact on most domestic volumes was short-lived as we hoped it would be. The robust cross-border travel recovery that started in the fall as borders reopened, resumed in February as Omicron impact faded. Border restrictions were lifted quickly and pent-up demand for travel remains very high. Index to 2019, cross-border travel, excluding transactions within Europe, jumped from a low of 71 in January to 94 in March. The first 2 weeks of March saw a spike in cross-border volumes from Russia and Ukraine due to displacement caused by the invasion. After we suspended operations in Russia in mid-March, there were no more cross-border transactions in or out of Russia. Adjusted for Russia and the spike from Ukraine, the March cross-border travel index relative to 2019 was around 90. So far, we are not seeing any material impact on cross-border travel in other corridors as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Our 3 growth engines: consumer payments; new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues well over 20%. During the quarter, we bought back $2.9 billion in stock at an average price of around $2.10 -- $210. On March 10, we closed on the Tink acquisition. Finally, our second quarter P&L and balance sheet reflect our best estimates for the impact of suspending operations in Russia. This includes revenues and expenses from terminating all client and supplier contracts, resolution of settlement balances and the deconsolidation of our Russian business. We have adjusted 2 items from our GAAP earnings, expenses to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine and a charge related to net assets in our Russian legal entity. Now on to the details. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 17% year-over-year and 35% versus 2019. Debit spend remained resilient as credit spend continued to improve. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 18% or 42% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume grew 16%, up 44% versus 2019, which was 2 points better than the first quarter. Credit grew 27% and improved 4 points to 35% over 2019, helped by the affluent consumer. Debit grew only 6% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of stimulus last year, but growth remained very strong versus 2019 at 53%. As Al indicated, debit is indexing well above the pre-COVID trend line, benefiting from accelerated cash digitization. U.S. card presence spend grew 17% and was 21% above 2019 at its highest quarterly level since the pandemic. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 10% and was 70% above 2019. Relative to 3 years ago, e-commerce levels remain well above the pre COVID trend line even as card-present spend continues to recover. International constant dollar payments volume, excluding China, grew 22% and was 40% above 2019. A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 44% year-over-year and 99% higher than 2019 with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region grew 18% year-over-year and 76% higher than 2019, led by client wins and cash digitization. Excluding Russia, the CEMEA region was up 100% over 2019. The Europe was up 21% year-over-year and 31% higher than 2019. Following an Omicron dip in January, we saw a rapid recovery in most European markets. Ex U.K., Europe volumes grew 36% year-over-year and were 54% about 2019. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region, up 16% year-over-year and 25% versus 2019. Due to COVID restrictions, recovery across most of Asia has stalled Hong Kong declined relative to 2019. India recovered strongly, up almost 20 points from December. India has been our fastest-growing market in Asia, up almost 80% since 2019, fueled by a tripling of e-commerce volumes. Global process transactions were up 19% year-over-year and 38% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, were up 47% year-over-year and 12% over 2019. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, remained strong, up 16% year-over-year and well above the pre-COVID trend line at 67% above 2019. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 111% year-over-year and indexed at 82% of 2019 levels. As I mentioned earlier, after an Omicron driven dip to 71 in January, the cross-border travel index to 2019 rose sharply to 94 in March. Many corridors are now indexing about 90 relative to 2019. Inbound travel to Latin America, the Caribbean and parts of the Middle East has been above 2019 levels for some time now. There's plenty of recovery to come in one important corridor inbound to the U.S., which indexed only at 70 in Q2. Asia indexed in the high 30s, both inbound and outbound in Q2. The pace of travel recovery to and from Asia will be a key driver of the future trajectory. Most Asian borders are now opened, except for China and restrictions remain in place in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Moving now to a quick review of second quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 24%, faster than the 20% nominal growth in Q1 payments volume. We were able to bill and collect service revenues in Russia through early March. As such, in the second quarter, we recorded almost 2 quarters of service revenues related to Russia. Service revenues were also helped by increasing utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 16%, below the 19% processed transactions growth mostly due to exchange rate changes. International transaction revenues were up 48% versus the 42% increase in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and select pricing modifications, partially offset by business mix. Other revenues grew 21%, led by consulting, data and marketing services as well as travel benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our 3 growth engines, each growing well over 20%. Consumer payments growth was led by improving cross-border volumes and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by Visa Direct and carded B2B recovery. Visa Direct transactions grew by 20% impacted by lapping a strong quarter in the U.S. last year and a suspension of Russian operations. As Al indicated, Russia was the second largest market for Visa Direct, accounting for 17% of transactions. This is an unfortunate setback but the Visa Direct business is ramping fast in other international markets as well as in use cases such as cross-border remittances, earned wage access and other B2C payouts. Commercial or B2B volumes grew 29% year-over-year, and up 38% versus 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength of small business and the recovery of large businesses across the portfolio of diverse spend categories. Value-added service growth was led by consulting and marketing services, card benefits as well as risk and identity solutions. Revenue growth drivers include the acceleration of e-commerce, client growth in international markets and select pricing actions. Client incentives were 25.8% of gross revenues at the lower end of expectations. This was driven by a better revenue mix due to the faster-than-expected recovery of our cross-border business and by deal timing, with some Q2 deals being pushed into Q3. GAAP operating expenses grew 11%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 16%. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $127 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $133 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19.6%, GAAP EPS was $1.70, non-GAAP EPS $1.79, up 30% from last year. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buybacks, we returned $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. A few comments on our trends through the first 3 weeks of April. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 12%, with debit up 2% and credit up 26%. Debit volumes are lapping the impact of stimulus payments in 2021. U.S. April spend growth versus 3 years ago was up 45%, with debit up a robust 54% and credit up, 37%. These trends are relatively consistent with performance in major markets around the world with the exception of CEMEA where we now have no payments volume from Russia. Processed transactions grew 17% year-over-year, up 36% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 47% year-over-year, and were 15% over 2019. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 62% about 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were at a 92 index to 2019. The small decline in this index relative to March is mostly due to the loss of Russia. Total cross-border volume was up 28% over 2019. Moving now to our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2022. Just as 2021 was a year of 2 distinct halves, due to the recovery, 2022 will be a year of 2 halves due to Russia. The suspension of our business in Russia will reduce second half revenues by about 4%. Russia will also negatively impact the payments volume and cross-border volume index to 2019, each by 4 points. The impact on process transactions index to 2019 will be under 1 point since we did not process domestic transactions in Russia. Ex-Russia and Ukraine, our domestic volume growth has stayed robust and stable for the past 4 quarters relative to 2019. Our outlook for the second half assumes that these trends are sustained. While there are uncertainties created by high inflation, supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and the invasion of Ukraine, there is no evident impact on our global payments volumes. E-commerce spend, both domestic and cross-border has remained strong and stable relative to 2019 at well above the pre-COVID trend line, even as pandemic effects fade, and we are assuming this will continue. In line with payments volumes, we expect processed transactions growth relative to 2019 to remain strong and stable with the variability largely driven by the extent to which small ticket card-present everyday spend comes back. It is important to note that year-over-year growth rates will moderate as we lap the strong second half recovery in fiscal year '21. Ex Russia and Ukraine we're assuming no spillover effects on other corridors in our cross-border business. Given where we ended the second quarter, we now expect cross-border travel ex intra-Europe to fully recover to 2019 levels by the end of our fiscal year despite the loss of Russian business. Including intra-Europe, that would put cross-border travel above 2019 levels.  With these assumptions, third quarter net revenues are expected to grow at the upper end of the mid-teens range in constant dollars. This includes Tink & Currencycloud, which add approximately 0.5 point to net revenues. The dollar has strengthened and the exchange rate drag will likely reduce nominal rate revenue growth by around 2.5 points. Due to some deals moving into the third quarter from the first half and the expectation that certain milestones will be achieved on some key contracts, incentives will run higher in the third quarter, between 26.5% to 27.5% of gross revenues. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in constant dollars to grow in the mid-teens, including expense savings from Russia and almost 3 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink. Exchange rates will likely reduce nominal operating expense growth by about 1.5 points. Our tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range. At this point, we expect fourth quarter trends to be generally in line with the third quarter. As always, we will update our fourth quarter outlook in July. Based on results to date and our outlook for the second half, we expect full year net revenue growth in constant dollars in the high teens to 20% range, including approximately 0.5 point of contribution from Tink and Currencycloud. Exchange rates will likely drag nominal growth rates down by around 2 points. There is no change in our expectation for full year incentives. Incentives as a percent of gross revenues are expected to range between 25.5% to 26.5%. We expect constant dollar non-GAAP operating expense growth at the upper end of mid-teens. This includes savings from the suspension of Russian operations and almost 2 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink. Nominal operating expense growth will be around 1.5 points lower due to the stronger dollar. Our full year tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range. Despite the uncertainties caused by inflation, interest rates, the invasion of Ukraine and our exit from Russia, we expect fiscal year '22 will be a very strong year of above-trend top and bottom line growth. As we enter the post-COVID era, we remain confident we can sustain a rate of growth about pre-COVID levels for all the reasons Al outlined, which I will summarize again. First, an acceleration away from cash and check for merchant payments, both domestic and cross-border as digitization becomes pervasive across consumers and businesses globally. Second, acceleration of cash, check and wire transfer displacement as our new flows initiatives penetrate a broad range of new use cases with very large total addressable markets. Third, sustainable high-teens growth across value-added services, both from existing services and new offerings. As new flows and value-added services become a larger part of our revenue mix, growing faster than consumer payments, the sustainable growth rate will continue to rise. We are and will continue to invest in the capabilities required to capture the extraordinary growth opportunity ahead of us. With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat: Vasant, I want to ask about cross-border. So had the pandemic not happened, your cross-border volumes would have been at least 20% to 30% of the 2019 levels, if you just kind of go with historical run rates. Now clearly, the travel probably has been solid these past few months. My question is how important is it that Asia, specifically China, comes back for you to have cross-border travel, not just going to 2019 levels, but eventually kind of returning to the pre-pandemic rate of growth?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, Harshita, that is a great question. As you know, 2 things we told you on the last call have remained true. One that, generally, countries around the world want to keep borders open, China being 1 exception, and some restrictions in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. And I include Hong Kong also in that list. Other than that, you can travel pretty freely anywhere else in the world. Some of them need tests, some don't even need tests. So that's true. The second is the pent-up demand for travel remains very high. And early indications on summer bookings, et cetera, as you heard from other people have been very good. So in our sort of calculations, certainly, we've been surprised so far even though we were bullish with how fast things have recovered. As you saw, after January, the recovery has been very robust. At this point, we're pretty optimistic that inbound to the U.S., which is still indexing only at 70 as of the end of March -- as of the end of the second quarter is on a good recovery track. There's still some recovery left in and out of Europe. So those things will certainly help us get back to 2019 levels. And you're absolutely right, I think the how fast and how far we get to, where we should have been prepandemic will depend on Asia coming back. Asia indexed at under 40 in the second quarter. China is an important part of Asia, it is still incredibly depressed. Japan, Korea and Taiwan are also important parts of Asian cross-border travel. Asia is recovering. We're seeing some good trends in Asia. Certainly travel into parts of Asia, like India, Thailand, Indonesia, et cetera, Australia and New Zealand are picking up fast. But you're right. I mean, getting all the way to 130 will depend on the remaining big travel components in Asia, which would be China, Japan and Korea, really coming back. And we'll have to wait and see on that, and we'll update you on the next call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: I had a follow-up call -- a question on commercial cards. I think you called out that your commercial card volumes are running at 138% of 2019 levels, so pretty healthy growth there. Can you talk more broadly, I feel like this is maybe a piece of the business that doesn't get the attention it should, given how much cash and checks and wire and other forms of payment there still are in commercial, can you maybe talk a little bit about the initiatives you've got underway to accelerate the digitization or the converting more of these B2B payments into cards.\nAl Kelly: Well, thank you, Lisa. This B2B segment is about $122 trillion opportunity, of which $20 trillion is in the carded space and then a $10 trillion in the cross-border space. So in the carded space, we already are the largest provider of commercial card volume. And our focus has continued to be on growing the number of issuers that are issuing commercial cards because it's a lot less than the number of people issue consumer cards. And we're also very focused on the travel and fuel use cases in addition to obviously purchasing cards and corporate cards, which are a more traditional element of this carded B2B space. We're also trying to continue to grow acceptance. There are acceptance gaps in the commercial space that hold us back from getting all the volume that we could potentially get. We are making strides, but there's still a ways to go in terms of having an acceptance footprint that mirrors the type of broad-based acceptance footprint that we have on the commercial side. It's a very important part of the business. It has attractive yields. It's -- generally has the ability to -- it was growing faster than consumer prior to COVID, and we believe that it can grow faster than consumer when we get back to a more normal time post the pandemic and obviously, one big factor there will be the pace at which business travel returns.  In the cross-border space, obviously, our major thrust there is B2B Connect. And our major focus on B2B Connect continues to be to grow out the network by having more and more banks in more and more countries involved in the network, and that has been and continues to be our focus more so than driving transactions at this point. And our belief is that once we get the network to a level where it is quite robust that transaction flow will happen fairly quickly. So those are some of the things that we're focused on to try to drive this very, very important space, which I continue to believe is an enormous opportunity for us going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you so much. Very strong broad-based results, which is what I want to ask about. With you far exceeding your revenue outlook, it looks like the client incentive planned is at the very low end of your expectations. So I just want to make sure I understand the relative performance there between the 2. Is it something that the upside and revenue brings with it very little incentive pressure? Or is it more complicated than that?\nVasant Prabhu: No, it's 2 things, Tien-Tsin, as I said in the comments. Number one, you saw that our cross-border recovery in the quarter was stronger than we expected. We'd had expect a good recovery, but this was stronger than we expected. That improves our mix, but even with the strong recovery, our mix of cross-border is still lower than it was prepandemic. So the mix affects the percentage. As you know, the percentage is numerator and denominator. When cross-border grows disproportionately, the denominator grows without a commensurate increase in the numerator, just given the nature of how many of our incentives work. And that helps that percentage, and that's why the percentage came at the lower end of the range. The second reason is there are always timing factors, timing factors in terms of renewals, timing as in when we recognize incentives linked to achieving certain milestones that contracts have, and that has pushed some of those incentives into the third quarter. So we expected third quarter to run above the upper end of the range, so to speak. For the full year, we still expect to be in the range we gave you. So it's all driven by a combination of mix and timing.\nAl Kelly: The only thing I would add, Tien-Tsin, you followed us for a while. I mean there's art and science to this, in forecasting. And a lot of times, just dealing with the timing point that Vasant was talking about, we make assumptions about when deals will get done. We then make assumptions about how long it will take to get a deal launched or get a migration going and then we make assumptions about the performance of that deal. And the odds of us getting all of that right across hundreds of deals that happened during the course of the year. make this not the easiest thing to always forecast. But I think we do a largely good job, but the explanation that Vasant gave about why we came in at the low end this quarter is those main 2 factors of timing and mix, driven by outperformance across the border.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Vasant, you spoke to the 4 percentage point impact in the second half from Russia. And obviously, it seems like you're able to overcome some of that with the stronger cross-border trends. Maybe you could just parse through a little bit of the impact to EPS and the flow through for us? I know there's some expenses that you mentioned that can offset Russia, maybe just help us through that.\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. So it is a 4-point revenue impact from Russia. So that's pretty much what the revenue impact would be. We gave you a sense of what our revenue expectations are for the quarter in constant dollars, upper end to mid-teens. If it hadn't been for Russia, you'd have added 4 points to that. So it's still strong despite that. And as you said, it's because the loss of Russia is offset to some degree by the cross-border business being stronger. We have a similar issue or similar impact on the expense side, mid-teens expense growth helped by Russian expenses going away and there are 2 main Russian expenses that go away. We used to pay the processor in Russia for processing transactions. We no longer have to pay them. Obviously, when you're in business, you do marketing and provide a bunch of other services. Some of our personnel-related costs in Russia will remain. We've made some commitments to our employees in Russia about other roles. So those don't all go away. So that does reduce our expenses in the second half. Probably, in the range of about 2 to 3 points. On the other hand, we do have Tink and Currencycloud now that are coming in, which were not there last year, and that's about 3 points. So it sort of washes and goes in the other direction. And then finally, exchange rates will help expenses to the tune of about 1.5 points. So those are all the moving parts. Our expenses would have been probably 2 or 3 points higher if Russia had not been -- if operations in Russia had not been suspended.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Great. And you probably get more flow-through from the cross-border outperformance, correct?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, partially. Mainly, because the incentives would go with it tend to be lower and it's a higher-yielding business. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: Listen, it's great to see your constant currency guidance increase for the full year despite what's obviously happening in Russia, Ukraine in organic and to some degree with a small help from acquisitions. Just to be clear, we're still getting a follow-up from a couple of investors asking to make sure that includes the impact for the full year of Russia as well, right? And then I just want to double check. I mean, you guys continuously highlight the potential to exit the pandemic at an accelerated growth rate, and I'm sure it has a lot to do with the new flows and some of the new services opportunities you're seeing grow so well. Can you just reiterate on that and just go into a little more detail on what gives you the confidence there? And what kind of growth rates you should be able to achieve?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think the biggest thing, Darren, for me is we didn't take the last couple of years off in terms of going out and trying to convert business, sign fintechs, increase our business with traditional partners. We also have phenomenally grown our acceptance footprint in certain parts of the world.  So there's actions that we have taken that -- you haven't seen the flow through because of the fact that the pandemic has, in many cases, suppressed spending. But as I think we come out of the pendent you'll see the flow-through of the various actions that we took. And then I think the pandemic itself has accelerated people's usage of card-not-present in e-commerce, and I think that's a sustaining model that's going to help drive growth on a going-forward basis as well. So I think we're going to see ourselves taking advantage of that. And then, certainly, we have continued to add use cases to things like Visa Direct. We've continued to build out our risk and identity tools. We've continued to grow our Visa consulting service. So I think that my view is that the market hasn't seen the flow-through of a lot of the investments -- the full flow through of a lot of the investments that we've made over the last 27 months-or-so when we've been operating in this kind of odd world driven by the pandemic. And I think that as we start to come into a more normal environment, I think you're going to see it. So that's the biggest factor. Vasant, do you want to address Darren's first question on I guess it was Russia?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Yes, Darren. Our full year outlook incorporates the impacts of Russia in the second half. It reflects the fact that the second quarter was as strong as it was. So when you look at the first half and what growth we had in the first half, despite the impact of Russia on the second half, in constant dollars, we still expect to be in the high teens to 20%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar : I wanted to just shift gears away from cross-border and ask about Tink and how you intend to use Tink to grow it, including both geographical growth and functional proliferation as it relates to debit -- Visa Direct broad payments functionality, things like that.\nAl Kelly: Well, thank you. Just as a reminder for everybody, I highlighted Tink in my remarks, but I didn't talk about the fact that it's got thousands of developers on the other side of the 3,400 banks that I did cite. And today, it operates in 18 markets across Europe. Its revenue model is largely a per API call, although there are some subscription basis on some of its value-added services. Our goal is to position ourselves in the middle of open banking in a place -- in a world where it's most advanced, which is Europe. And we believe that our complementary capabilities will help drive adoption of Tink's capabilities and provide incremental value to clients. Clearly, our -- maybe not clearly, but I'll make it clear. Our focus initially is going to be on Europe. That's where Tink is strong, that's where it's got a large presence, and that's where we could -- we think that we could be additive in terms of driving their business forward. But certainly, we will -- we anticipate and anticipated when we looked at Tink and made the decision to buy it, that we will leverage its capabilities and extended their capabilities to other markets. But we want to make sure that our investment is focused. We never like to kind of peanut our investment across too many places at one time. So it's better, we think, to perfect our partnership together in the place where we both have strength, which is Europe, and we'll go from there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: So I was just curious, for the quarter itself here in Q2, I think you would expected net revenue growth to be at the high end of high teens. Obviously, that was before the war started. You ended up in the mid-20s. So I'm just curious in terms of order of magnitude, like which revenue lines really surprised you the most to the upside? To what extent was inflation a meaningful contributor? And then it sounded like maybe you pulled forward some Russia service revenue, I think Vasant you made a comment there. I was hoping you could maybe quantify that piece as well.\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. So the primary factors that allowed the quarter to be stronger than we expected was clearly international revenues. And international revenues were not only stronger in terms of cross-border volumes being stronger than we expected. The recovery was from 71 to about 94 index to '19 between the end of January and March, which was clearly very, very strong. So that definitely was 1 of the outperformers. Because of the war in Ukraine, currency volatility was also high, and the fact that the cross-border business helps volumes add-in currency volatility and our treasury revenues were also higher than we expected. So those were 2 major contributors. And on the service line, as you know, we recognize service fees with a lag. In the case of Russia, because operations were being suspended, we were able to bill and collect revenues for the second quarter through when we suspended operations, and that added probably -- it would be less than 1 point to revenues, maybe a little over 0.5 point. So that did help. But other than that, it was all driven by just strength across the board. Value-added services performed very well, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nBob Napoli: I mean, Visa has obviously been consistently active on the M&A front and on venture investing. With valuations down, would we -- should we expect to see Visa being more active in both areas? And if so, what areas, products, geographies, I guess, verticals would be most attractive for Visa incrementally to add to invest?\nAl Kelly: Well, Bob, I'll start and Vasant can add any color he wants. We still have a stated preference for whatever we could do ourselves to do it ourselves. That said, we have a very robust and qualified corporate development function that looks at all kinds of various possibilities. And we're in constant review of various lists to determine what might be of interest and what might not be of interest. Will we can do it faster and get people who have unique skills that we might not have, and we could build that -- it's just much faster than building the capability ourselves, we'll certainly look to buy. And without getting too specific, I think that continuing to grow our toolbox as it relates to new flows and value-added services and things that would help us do that would be certainly areas that would be attractive to us. I probably wouldn't want to say more than that at this point. The only other thing I'd say is that we're really not -- we don't really look to be an active venture investor. Many of our -- and most of our investments or things where we're following on a commercial agreement, and often, when we do a commercial agreement with a smaller player, they ask us for us to endorse them a bit by making a small investment so they can add up to the roster of players that are investors in their company. But we're not out there speculating and looking for just venture investments where the vast majority of them, and Vasant can add or delete, almost 100% of them are because we've got a commercial deal in place first, that's the most important aspect to us.  Vasant, anything you want to add?\nVasant Prabhu: No. I think what you will see in the future is more of what you've seen in the past. Acquisitions that can add to our capabilities like Tink did, like Currencycloud did expand the suite of services we can offer, which is what both Tink and Currencycloud do. Acquisitions where we decide it's faster or cheaper to buy than to build. In some cases, it could be acquisitions that expand the scope of an existing service like Earthport did with our payouts business around the world. And yes, to the extent that the correction we're seeing in public markets carries over to private markets over a period of time, certainly, we expect to be more active. And we have no specific objectives in terms of we're going to do X amount in acquisitions every year. It's going to be based on what makes sense to do and where we can create value.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse.\nTimothy Chiodo: I want to touch on Visa Direct. Clearly, it's a much bigger but still fast-growing portion of your business. You talked a little bit about the growth this quarter and the Russia impact. And you also mentioned it as the second largest geographic market. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that geographic mix? And less on maybe the other large markets, but more importantly, maybe the markets where there's a big opportunity? And the brief follow-up would be if you could just recap the mechanic around, your ability to, of course, send to Visa Credentials, but also how does it work when you want to send to a Mastercard credential and that capability.\nAl Kelly: The -- for competitive reasons, I'd be reluctant to get too into the weeds on this. But obviously, our biggest market is the United States. Russia was our second largest market. And then there's a number of markets across the world that are maybe a half dozen to 10 that are somewhat together in terms of size that they represent. And our focus at this stage is to: A, build greater penetration of the use cases that we have today; secondly, to develop new use cases; and thirdly, to grow the geographic footprint of all of our use cases. And we have built up a team completely focused on Visa Direct. We do utilize our account executives around the world as our frontline sales agents. And then from there, we'll bring in solution experts who know much more about the specifics of Visa Direct. But we're -- so basically, I talked about payouts and remittances. We're continuing to look at the ability to pay gig economy workers, which is a growing and hugely growing segment around the world. We're looking at global money movement use cases beyond the ones that I've talked about in P2P, which we've talked about before. We're looking at digitizing disbursements by replacing checks and slow ACH wherever we can around the world. The reality is that I think there are applications everywhere and one of our challenges, especially as we look to replace some of the volume from Russia is going to be determined where to invest versus having to find places to invest. There are plenty of places to invest, which is the great news. We're just going to have some work to do to figure out exactly where the hottest opportunities are to drive transaction growth for us as we look forward at various use cases.\nTimothy Chiodo: Excellent. And were you able to help on that mechanical one around maybe the difference in terms of mechanics or economics when you send to a Mastercard credential?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. It's part of our network or network's approach. So we're network agnostic and acquisitions like YellowPepper and what we did with Earthport are the kinds of capabilities that allow us to send to any credential, including a bank account as part of -- we'll get your money there and part of the way maybe on the rail that's not ours.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: I appreciate all the details and color. Wanted to -- gotten a few questions from investors, just around the impact that inflation may be having. And A, can you help quantify it? Maybe how that's benefiting Visa? But also and maybe more importantly, can you talk about if you're seeing any shift in spending behavior by consumers and that mix between discretionary and nondiscretionary spend. And if that has any impact at all on how you're formulating your outlook.\nAl Kelly: So there are -- inflation has some puts and takes on our business. Service fees and international fees are basis points on volume. So inflation typically lifts transaction size, but we\u2019re offsetting that and incentives are also tied to volume, so there's some offset to that lift.  Fuel prices go up, but then on the other hand, sometimes consumers tend to moderate their buying in times of large increases in gas to the degree that, over time, if it was to happen, the dollar was to weaken, that increases inbound cross-border flows and the U.S. inbound corridor is one of our largest and higher-yielding corridors. Expenses for personnel and marketing, professional fees could go up. But I'd say 2 things and then ask Vasant to add anything he wants. So far, we're not -- as I said and I think what Vasant said in his remarks, we're really not seeing much impact that's causing us any concern in our numbers. And then the last thing I'd say, net-net, historically, inflation has been positive for us.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Just to add to what Al said, I mean we clearly have seen -- we've seen ticket sizes go up in the U.S., in particular, in Europe, but it's not all inflation. Some of it is mix. It's mix driven by the fact that the card-present transactions, which often tend to be smaller transactions, have not yet fully come back. It's mix also because e-commerce transactions, even when you do everyday purchases, can be larger ticket sizes. We could even see ticket sizes go down in inflationary times as card-present comes back. So as Al said, there's multiple impacts from inflation. Net-net, it's a positive for us. We have not seen any impact on discretionary spending that we can discern. If anything, discretionary spending, especially from affluent consumers and credit cardholders has been going up quite healthily. So in general, there isn't any evidence impact -- evident impact on inflation, but obviously, we'll keep looking for it.\nAl Kelly: James, I'll just share 1 quick data point with you. We recently looked at restaurant spending by various strata and the highest-performing strata in terms of growth is the $100 to $300 ticket price, and the second best performing strata was over $300. So that just gives you some sense. That's very recent data of the Affluent being back in the market and not afraid to spend in an important spend category.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.\nJamie Friedman: Vasant, I may be misremembering this, but my recollection was that you had contemplated returning to 90% travel index by September. I apologize if I got that wrong, you had -- you were going kind of quick with the updated assumptions. Can you repeat what you were contemplating now in terms of where travel would end the fiscal year?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. So we talk about cross-border travel ex intra-Europe, and we are now expecting, given where it ended the second quarter to be at or about likely 2019 by the end of our fiscal year. And you\u2019re absolutely right, the last time we talked to you, we said we'd probably be around 90%. We're running better than we expected so far, so we've definitely raised our view of that. Now inclusive of intra-Europe, that would put us above 2019 levels by the end of our fiscal year. So yes, I think you got it right.\nJennifer Como: Great. And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thanks for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Al Kelly",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining. Before jumping in, I want to acknowledge that this is Jennifer Como's first earnings call in her new position. About 2 months ago, Jennifer was promoted to Head of Investor Relations, which was a very well-deserved recognition of her work over the last 3 years with us. I want to start by briefly addressing the situation in Russia and Ukraine. I have seen firsthand the pain brought about by Russia's attack on Ukraine and its people, including our colleagues in both Ukraine and Russia. We are very focused on supporting them. The bravery, strength and resilience of our colleagues is incredibly inspiring, as is the grit of the Ukrainian military. Even with the invasion of Ukraine and lingering impacts of Omicron, volumes, transactions and credentials drove strong second quarter performance. Overall, PB was up 135% versus 3 years ago. Cross-border volumes, excluding inter-Europe, were 112% versus 3 years ago. And it's important to note that travel-related cross-border rose to 82% versus 3 years ago, up 5 points from Q1. Processed transactions were 138% versus 3 years ago. In terms of the big picture, after the short 4- to 5-week impact of Omnicon in December and January in the United States and many other parts of the world, the recovery continues to be robust. At this stage, in terms of volumes, we have seen no noticeable impact due to inflation, supply chain issues or the war in Ukraine. In the U.S., payments volume index to 2019 was 144 in the quarter. Volume growth relative to 3 years ago has been stable and strong now for 4 quarters in a row. When looking at specific spend categories for credit cards, we saw greater than a 10 percentage point improvement in the 3-year index from Q1 to 2Q -- Q2 in travel, retail goods, food and drug, restaurant, QSR and fuel. As a reminder, debit is growing over a quarter in fiscal '21, where there were 2 stimulus distributions. Even as credit continues to recover, debit remains 20% above the prepandemic trend line. Across all products, spend categories representing 88% of PB are over 120% indexed -- over 120 indexed to 3 years ago, and nearly 2/3 are between 1 40 and 1 60. Against this backdrop, Visa's performance was very strong. Net revenues grew 25% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $1.79, up 30%. As we look ahead, our business will have a reset due to Russia, but we still expect accelerated revenue growth versus pre-COVID over the coming years. This is because there's still ample opportunity around the world across our 3 growth levers of consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, and our strategy is yielding excellent results. First, in consumer payments, we continue to displace cash at a strong rate. In Q2, we saw debit cash volumes at Visa grow 2%, while debit payments volumes grew 12%. Cash displacement continued around the world. Year-over-year, across debit and credit, there were 7.9 billion more payments transactions and 16 million less cash transactions. Last quarter, I highlighted the shift from cash to payments volume in Latin America, and that trend continued in this quarter. Additionally, CEMEA is experiencing a similar shift. In full year 2019, cash was 59% of total volume. Last year in Q2, it was 50%. And this quarter, it was 46%. Growth in consumer payments is driven by adding credentials and acceptance and deepening engagement. Our card credentials recently increased to over 3.9 billion, up 9% in 1 year, including 10% growth in the United States. On the acceptance side, we have 80 million merchant locations, including small businesses behind players like Stripe and Square, the number is actually over $100 million. We have seen very strong performance location growth recently in our Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, up 30% and 20%, respectively. Let me just highlight a few regional examples of progress in consumer payments. In Europe, overall credentials grew 6%, which is nearly double the historic rate for each of the past 8 quarters, helped by previously announced deals with BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium contributing more than 4 million credentials since their announcement to issue with Visa. Across Europe, we continue to strengthen our debit business. We recently announced the [indiscernible] bank, representing a multimillion credential opportunity. We also renewed our business with one of the largest banks in the Nordics, Nordea. On the acceptance front, we continue to pioneer new areas of acceptance even in mature digital markets. One recent in example in Europe is with electronic -- electric vehicle charging. We were the first payments and financial services company that joined the charging interface initiative and are working with manufacturers to open up what is estimated to represent 3 million potential acceptance points in Europe by 2030. In Latin America, we saw strong credential growth, up 21% year-over-year. Two renewals to highlight this quarter: Porto Seguro, Brazil's third largest issuer for credit portfolio and digital bank, Neon Pagamentos, one of Brazil's fastest-growing fintechs with over 15 million clients for their credit and prepaid portfolios. In Africa, Visa has signed a partnership with Vodacom South Africa. This deal, together with previously announced partnerships with M-PESA Africa and Safaricom covers 130 million customers in the entire Vodacom Group in Sub-Saharan Africa. Through this partnership, Vodacom will exclusively issue Visa payment credentials, deploy new payment flows through Visa Direct and utilize cyber source. In the United States, we renewed and won several partnerships this quarter. First, Visa and USAA have recently renewed our long-standing issuing partnership. Second, we extended our existing relationship agreement with M&T Bank as their issuance partner, including migrating the business resulting from their recently completed acquisition of People's United. Over the past 2 years, merger activity of regional banks has increased, and this is another example of Visa successfully partnering to grow with our clients. Finally, supporting the U.S. government is an important priority for us, and we retained our business with the financial agent that manages the U.S. debit card program. This Visa-branded program is a key component of Treasury's goal to deliver 99% of federal payments digitally by 2030. A key vector of growth in consumer payments are cobrand cards, which are particularly attractive to the affluent customer. In Q2, affluent credit card spending was well above 2019 levels in several markets, including the U.S. and the U.K. Our U.S. cobrand active cards were up nearly 30% from 2019 to 2022. And we have 7 of the top 10 cobrands in the United States and 8 of the top 10 cobrands globally. This past quarter, we renewed our cobrand relationship with AAA, Visa's longest-standing cobrand partner, an over 40-year relationship. In India, we're pleased to have signed a long-term cobrand agreement with Airtel, one of the largest mobile operators in the world with nearly 356 million subscribers. In CEMEA, Emirates NBD, a leading banking group has expanded its long-standing partnership with Visa by introducing the premium cobrand program with Etihad Guest, the loyalty program of Etihad Airlines with 8 million members. In Uganda, we partnered with the Uganda National Social Security Fund to issue cobrand cards to 2 million beneficiaries. And just a few weeks ago, it was announced that the U.S. Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card has been renewed with Chase and Visa. Visa is also pleased to have reached a broad global agreement with Amazon. This agreement includes the acceptance of Visa at all Amazon stores and sites today, as well as a joint commitment to collaboration on new product and technology initiatives to ensure innovative payment experiences for our customers into the future. In Q2, we also continued to enable new ways to pay from installments to crypto. In the installment space, we previously announced a global deal with Klarna. They have now issued their cobranded card in Europe and recently opened a waitlist in the United States, where they have 25 million customers. In the crypto space, we continue to work with governments globally on potential CBDCs. This quarter, we were selected as the finalist in Brazil's CBDC lift challenge. The concept is a B2B solution that seeks to leverage CBDC to help small businesses access global investors and drive financial inclusion. On the engagement front, Tap to Pay continues to accelerate growth. In the United States, we are over 20% tap to pay penetration, marking the second largest market by number of tasks. And Target has become the first U.S. retail merchant to pay us 50% tap to pay penetration of face-to-face payments. Transit is one of the best ways to habituate tapping and the first half of fiscal '22 has set records. We enabled 50 cities around the world, including Thailand, Japan, Turkey, Italy, Switzerland, Norway and Canada, bringing our Tap to Ride footprint to over 500 travel transit authorities. We processed over 500 million Visa tap to ride transactions globally versus 700 million for all of last year. To summarize, there is significant opportunity in consumer payments, Visa continues to grow credentials and acceptance with deepening engagement and Visa enables innovation and scale for players across the ecosystem from installments to crypto to merchants. Now moving to new flows, which in Q2 had over 20% revenue growth. In Q2, our commercial payments volume was 138% of 2019. What's more of this recovery is relatively broad-based across segments and spend types. On the B2B carded front, in the U.S., Umpqua Bank announced two commercial solutions for middle market businesses. One, Visa Commercial Preferred, a commercial rewards card designed to help manage daily business spend; and two, Visa Commercial Pay, which will help improve cash flow management, reconciliation and reporting. In Latin America, we saw a carded progress with B2B fintech, Tribal, which has chosen Visa for card issuance, including virtual cards on its modern corporate card and spend management platform tailored for startups in 9 countries. Airwallex, a global platform, enabling digital businesses to manage payments and money movement across borders, previously launched programs with Visa in Australia, Hong Kong and the U.K. Recently, they introduced virtual Visa cards in the United States, Netherlands and Singapore to enable businesses to easily make digital card payments around the world. In our cross-border B2B business, Visa B2B Connect continues to expand its global footprint. And in the first half of 2022, we added banks for the first time in Tanzania, Uganda, Angola, Thailand and Poland. Now turning to Visa Direct. Transactions in the second quarter grew 20%. Vasant will speak more about this, but Russia was our second largest market for Visa Direct and represented about 17% of our transactions in fiscal 2021. So in short, Visa Direct will -- be impacted by the suspension of Russian operations. But even with the Russia business -- without the Russia business, we will see growth ahead driven by many use cases and countries. For example, domestic P2P, which accounted for the majority of our Russian business is still a large opportunity, and we continue to expand to new markets. We will soon launch our inaugural Visa Direct use case in Israel for P2P in partnership with Bit, the largest P2P app in the market. I'll focus on 2 other use cases today, payouts and remittances. First, with payouts, we see -- we're seeing momentum in a number of industries and transactions are up 35% year-over-year. In travel, we launched Visa Direct with Booking.com to enable customer refunds and loyalty payouts. In the gig economy, Payfare, a leading fintech that has partners such as Uber, Lyft and DoorDash, has added Visa Direct to its platform to help facilitate real-time payment experiences for over 0.5 million gig workers they serve. And digital commerce partner, Payoneer, we use Visa Direct to enable cross-border payments for their 5 million customers, including marketplaces and gig economy players. Second, cross-border P2P or global remittances, which are higher yielding Visa Direct transactions represent a significant opportunity. While we are just getting started this quarter, transactions grew nearly 50% year-over-year. After announcing our relationship in fiscal fourth quarter with Paysend, an international card-to-card payments platform, which serves over 6 million customers and 17,000 SMEs, they have now launched their cross-border service with Visa Direct from the U.K. and U.S. to over 100 corridors. While the U.S. is the top source for remittances, the UAE is the second largest source for country remittances followed by Saudi Arabia according to the World Bank. Altogether, the Gulf Cooperation Council countries account for more than $100 billion in outbound remittances. This past quarter, we added several partnerships to help digitize remittances in the region. First, AL Muzaini Exchange, the largest exchange house in Kuwait. Second, Enjaz, the remittance and payment arm of Bank Albilad, and market leader for ongoing remittances in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And third, in the UAE with LuLu Money powered by Lulu International Exchange and Network International to enable the 5 million users of Lulu app to send money to cross-border. [Audion] and Stripe, key Visa Direct enablement partners have both signed agreements to deepen relationships in existing geographies and to expand to net new markets globally across numerous use cases. In sum, we've made excellent early progress against the $185 trillion new flows opportunity, but there is tremendous room for accelerated growth ahead. Now let me move to value-added services, which had Q2 revenue growth of over 20% as well. First, we recently closed our acquisition of Tink. Tink is a European open banking platform that connects to more than 3,400 banks that reach over 250 million bank customers across Europe. Through a single API, Tink enables its customers to move money, access aggregated financial data and use smart financial services such as risk insights and account verification. Visa brings proven infrastructure and sustained investment in resilience, cybersecurity and fraud, which will help accelerate the adoption of open banking and create a secure, reliable platform for innovation. Let me highlight some other progress in value-added services. First, Visa consulting and analytics. Last quarter, I announced the launch of our specialized global crypto advisory practice. We've seen interest from hundreds of clients globally and have committed engagements with 30 already covering their digital currency strategy, product development and their go-to-market plans. Second, risk identity and authentication. In tokenization, we have now crossed the 3.5 billion token mark across more than 8,600 issuers in over 150 markets at 1.2 million merchants. Tokens have led to a 2.5 point increase in approval rates and a 28% reduction in fraud rates this past quarter in card net payment -- card net present payments. Our key risk solutions, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, screened about 30% more transactions in the first half of 2022 versus 2021. Third, CyberSource, our gateway capability has seeing considerable progress, just crossing the milestone of the 1 millionth merchant account onboarded. I spoke about transit before in CyberSource, which could play a key role in transit acceptance, added nearly 15 projects in the first half in Thailand, Italy and Japan, among others. So to summarize, our value-added services represent a compelling way to diversify our revenue streams while helping our clients bring in -- in bringing innovation to the payments ecosystem. Our global infrastructure is providing connectivity through our network of networks to power more traditional payment types and newer ways to pay and move money. Our brand is strong. Our network of networks is expanding. Our business is performing well and our people are motivated and passionate. We expect all our efforts will help power accelerated growth in the years to come. And with that, let me turn it over to Vasant. Well, thank you, Lisa. This B2B segment is about $122 trillion opportunity, of which $20 trillion is in the carded space and then a $10 trillion in the cross-border space. So in the carded space, we already are the largest provider of commercial card volume. And our focus has continued to be on growing the number of issuers that are issuing commercial cards because it's a lot less than the number of people issue consumer cards. And we're also very focused on the travel and fuel use cases in addition to obviously purchasing cards and corporate cards, which are a more traditional element of this carded B2B space. We're also trying to continue to grow acceptance. There are acceptance gaps in the commercial space that hold us back from getting all the volume that we could potentially get. We are making strides, but there's still a ways to go in terms of having an acceptance footprint that mirrors the type of broad-based acceptance footprint that we have on the commercial side. It's a very important part of the business. It has attractive yields. It's -- generally has the ability to -- it was growing faster than consumer prior to COVID, and we believe that it can grow faster than consumer when we get back to a more normal time post the pandemic and obviously, one big factor there will be the pace at which business travel returns.  In the cross-border space, obviously, our major thrust there is B2B Connect. And our major focus on B2B Connect continues to be to grow out the network by having more and more banks in more and more countries involved in the network, and that has been and continues to be our focus more so than driving transactions at this point. And our belief is that once we get the network to a level where it is quite robust that transaction flow will happen fairly quickly. So those are some of the things that we're focused on to try to drive this very, very important space, which I continue to believe is an enormous opportunity for us going forward. The only thing I would add, Tien-Tsin, you followed us for a while. I mean there's art and science to this, in forecasting. And a lot of times, just dealing with the timing point that Vasant was talking about, we make assumptions about when deals will get done. We then make assumptions about how long it will take to get a deal launched or get a migration going and then we make assumptions about the performance of that deal. And the odds of us getting all of that right across hundreds of deals that happened during the course of the year. make this not the easiest thing to always forecast. But I think we do a largely good job, but the explanation that Vasant gave about why we came in at the low end this quarter is those main 2 factors of timing and mix, driven by outperformance across the border. Well, I think the biggest thing, Darren, for me is we didn't take the last couple of years off in terms of going out and trying to convert business, sign fintechs, increase our business with traditional partners. We also have phenomenally grown our acceptance footprint in certain parts of the world.  So there's actions that we have taken that -- you haven't seen the flow through because of the fact that the pandemic has, in many cases, suppressed spending. But as I think we come out of the pendent you'll see the flow-through of the various actions that we took. And then I think the pandemic itself has accelerated people's usage of card-not-present in e-commerce, and I think that's a sustaining model that's going to help drive growth on a going-forward basis as well. So I think we're going to see ourselves taking advantage of that. And then, certainly, we have continued to add use cases to things like Visa Direct. We've continued to build out our risk and identity tools. We've continued to grow our Visa consulting service. So I think that my view is that the market hasn't seen the flow-through of a lot of the investments -- the full flow through of a lot of the investments that we've made over the last 27 months-or-so when we've been operating in this kind of odd world driven by the pandemic. And I think that as we start to come into a more normal environment, I think you're going to see it. So that's the biggest factor. Vasant, do you want to address Darren's first question on I guess it was Russia? Well, thank you. Just as a reminder for everybody, I highlighted Tink in my remarks, but I didn't talk about the fact that it's got thousands of developers on the other side of the 3,400 banks that I did cite. And today, it operates in 18 markets across Europe. Its revenue model is largely a per API call, although there are some subscription basis on some of its value-added services. Our goal is to position ourselves in the middle of open banking in a place -- in a world where it's most advanced, which is Europe. And we believe that our complementary capabilities will help drive adoption of Tink's capabilities and provide incremental value to clients. Clearly, our -- maybe not clearly, but I'll make it clear. Our focus initially is going to be on Europe. That's where Tink is strong, that's where it's got a large presence, and that's where we could -- we think that we could be additive in terms of driving their business forward. But certainly, we will -- we anticipate and anticipated when we looked at Tink and made the decision to buy it, that we will leverage its capabilities and extended their capabilities to other markets. But we want to make sure that our investment is focused. We never like to kind of peanut our investment across too many places at one time. So it's better, we think, to perfect our partnership together in the place where we both have strength, which is Europe, and we'll go from there. Well, Bob, I'll start and Vasant can add any color he wants. We still have a stated preference for whatever we could do ourselves to do it ourselves. That said, we have a very robust and qualified corporate development function that looks at all kinds of various possibilities. And we're in constant review of various lists to determine what might be of interest and what might not be of interest. Will we can do it faster and get people who have unique skills that we might not have, and we could build that -- it's just much faster than building the capability ourselves, we'll certainly look to buy. And without getting too specific, I think that continuing to grow our toolbox as it relates to new flows and value-added services and things that would help us do that would be certainly areas that would be attractive to us. I probably wouldn't want to say more than that at this point. The only other thing I'd say is that we're really not -- we don't really look to be an active venture investor. Many of our -- and most of our investments or things where we're following on a commercial agreement, and often, when we do a commercial agreement with a smaller player, they ask us for us to endorse them a bit by making a small investment so they can add up to the roster of players that are investors in their company. But we're not out there speculating and looking for just venture investments where the vast majority of them, and Vasant can add or delete, almost 100% of them are because we've got a commercial deal in place first, that's the most important aspect to us.  Vasant, anything you want to add? The -- for competitive reasons, I'd be reluctant to get too into the weeds on this. But obviously, our biggest market is the United States. Russia was our second largest market. And then there's a number of markets across the world that are maybe a half dozen to 10 that are somewhat together in terms of size that they represent. And our focus at this stage is to: A, build greater penetration of the use cases that we have today; secondly, to develop new use cases; and thirdly, to grow the geographic footprint of all of our use cases. And we have built up a team completely focused on Visa Direct. We do utilize our account executives around the world as our frontline sales agents. And then from there, we'll bring in solution experts who know much more about the specifics of Visa Direct. But we're -- so basically, I talked about payouts and remittances. We're continuing to look at the ability to pay gig economy workers, which is a growing and hugely growing segment around the world. We're looking at global money movement use cases beyond the ones that I've talked about in P2P, which we've talked about before. We're looking at digitizing disbursements by replacing checks and slow ACH wherever we can around the world. The reality is that I think there are applications everywhere and one of our challenges, especially as we look to replace some of the volume from Russia is going to be determined where to invest versus having to find places to invest. There are plenty of places to invest, which is the great news. We're just going to have some work to do to figure out exactly where the hottest opportunities are to drive transaction growth for us as we look forward at various use cases. So there are -- inflation has some puts and takes on our business. Service fees and international fees are basis points on volume. So inflation typically lifts transaction size, but we're offsetting that and incentives are also tied to volume, so there's some offset to that lift.  Fuel prices go up, but then on the other hand, sometimes consumers tend to moderate their buying in times of large increases in gas to the degree that, over time, if it was to happen, the dollar was to weaken, that increases inbound cross-border flows and the U.S. inbound corridor is one of our largest and higher-yielding corridors. Expenses for personnel and marketing, professional fees could go up. But I'd say 2 things and then ask Vasant to add anything he wants. So far, we're not -- as I said and I think what Vasant said in his remarks, we're really not seeing much impact that's causing us any concern in our numbers. And then the last thing I'd say, net-net, historically, inflation has been positive for us. James, I'll just share 1 quick data point with you. We recently looked at restaurant spending by various strata and the highest-performing strata in terms of growth is the $100 to $300 ticket price, and the second best performing strata was over $300. So that just gives you some sense. That's very recent data of the Affluent being back in the market and not afraid to spend in an important spend category."

            "name": "Vasant Prabhu",
            "content": "Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Despite Omicron, Russia and Ukraine, our fiscal second quarter results were very strong with net revenues up 25% and GAAP EPS up 23%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 30%. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was approximately 27% and non-GAAP EPS growth was 30%. A few key highlights. Global payments volume growth has remained strong and stable relative to pre-COVID levels. In constant dollars, the U.S. index was 2 points higher than the first quarter at 1.44 versus 3 years ago. The international index, ex China, was down 2 points at 1.40 versus 2019 due to the impact of Omicron in early January. Omicron impact on most domestic volumes was short-lived as we hoped it would be. The robust cross-border travel recovery that started in the fall as borders reopened, resumed in February as Omicron impact faded. Border restrictions were lifted quickly and pent-up demand for travel remains very high. Index to 2019, cross-border travel, excluding transactions within Europe, jumped from a low of 71 in January to 94 in March. The first 2 weeks of March saw a spike in cross-border volumes from Russia and Ukraine due to displacement caused by the invasion. After we suspended operations in Russia in mid-March, there were no more cross-border transactions in or out of Russia. Adjusted for Russia and the spike from Ukraine, the March cross-border travel index relative to 2019 was around 90. So far, we are not seeing any material impact on cross-border travel in other corridors as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Our 3 growth engines: consumer payments; new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues well over 20%. During the quarter, we bought back $2.9 billion in stock at an average price of around $2.10 -- $210. On March 10, we closed on the Tink acquisition. Finally, our second quarter P&L and balance sheet reflect our best estimates for the impact of suspending operations in Russia. This includes revenues and expenses from terminating all client and supplier contracts, resolution of settlement balances and the deconsolidation of our Russian business. We have adjusted 2 items from our GAAP earnings, expenses to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine and a charge related to net assets in our Russian legal entity. Now on to the details. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 17% year-over-year and 35% versus 2019. Debit spend remained resilient as credit spend continued to improve. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 18% or 42% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume grew 16%, up 44% versus 2019, which was 2 points better than the first quarter. Credit grew 27% and improved 4 points to 35% over 2019, helped by the affluent consumer. Debit grew only 6% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of stimulus last year, but growth remained very strong versus 2019 at 53%. As Al indicated, debit is indexing well above the pre-COVID trend line, benefiting from accelerated cash digitization. U.S. card presence spend grew 17% and was 21% above 2019 at its highest quarterly level since the pandemic. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 10% and was 70% above 2019. Relative to 3 years ago, e-commerce levels remain well above the pre COVID trend line even as card-present spend continues to recover. International constant dollar payments volume, excluding China, grew 22% and was 40% above 2019. A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 44% year-over-year and 99% higher than 2019 with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region grew 18% year-over-year and 76% higher than 2019, led by client wins and cash digitization. Excluding Russia, the CEMEA region was up 100% over 2019. The Europe was up 21% year-over-year and 31% higher than 2019. Following an Omicron dip in January, we saw a rapid recovery in most European markets. Ex U.K., Europe volumes grew 36% year-over-year and were 54% about 2019. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region, up 16% year-over-year and 25% versus 2019. Due to COVID restrictions, recovery across most of Asia has stalled Hong Kong declined relative to 2019. India recovered strongly, up almost 20 points from December. India has been our fastest-growing market in Asia, up almost 80% since 2019, fueled by a tripling of e-commerce volumes. Global process transactions were up 19% year-over-year and 38% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, were up 47% year-over-year and 12% over 2019. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, remained strong, up 16% year-over-year and well above the pre-COVID trend line at 67% above 2019. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 111% year-over-year and indexed at 82% of 2019 levels. As I mentioned earlier, after an Omicron driven dip to 71 in January, the cross-border travel index to 2019 rose sharply to 94 in March. Many corridors are now indexing about 90 relative to 2019. Inbound travel to Latin America, the Caribbean and parts of the Middle East has been above 2019 levels for some time now. There's plenty of recovery to come in one important corridor inbound to the U.S., which indexed only at 70 in Q2. Asia indexed in the high 30s, both inbound and outbound in Q2. The pace of travel recovery to and from Asia will be a key driver of the future trajectory. Most Asian borders are now opened, except for China and restrictions remain in place in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Moving now to a quick review of second quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 24%, faster than the 20% nominal growth in Q1 payments volume. We were able to bill and collect service revenues in Russia through early March. As such, in the second quarter, we recorded almost 2 quarters of service revenues related to Russia. Service revenues were also helped by increasing utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 16%, below the 19% processed transactions growth mostly due to exchange rate changes. International transaction revenues were up 48% versus the 42% increase in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and select pricing modifications, partially offset by business mix. Other revenues grew 21%, led by consulting, data and marketing services as well as travel benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our 3 growth engines, each growing well over 20%. Consumer payments growth was led by improving cross-border volumes and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by Visa Direct and carded B2B recovery. Visa Direct transactions grew by 20% impacted by lapping a strong quarter in the U.S. last year and a suspension of Russian operations. As Al indicated, Russia was the second largest market for Visa Direct, accounting for 17% of transactions. This is an unfortunate setback but the Visa Direct business is ramping fast in other international markets as well as in use cases such as cross-border remittances, earned wage access and other B2C payouts. Commercial or B2B volumes grew 29% year-over-year, and up 38% versus 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength of small business and the recovery of large businesses across the portfolio of diverse spend categories. Value-added service growth was led by consulting and marketing services, card benefits as well as risk and identity solutions. Revenue growth drivers include the acceleration of e-commerce, client growth in international markets and select pricing actions. Client incentives were 25.8% of gross revenues at the lower end of expectations. This was driven by a better revenue mix due to the faster-than-expected recovery of our cross-border business and by deal timing, with some Q2 deals being pushed into Q3. GAAP operating expenses grew 11%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 16%. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $127 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $133 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19.6%, GAAP EPS was $1.70, non-GAAP EPS $1.79, up 30% from last year. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buybacks, we returned $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. A few comments on our trends through the first 3 weeks of April. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 12%, with debit up 2% and credit up 26%. Debit volumes are lapping the impact of stimulus payments in 2021. U.S. April spend growth versus 3 years ago was up 45%, with debit up a robust 54% and credit up, 37%. These trends are relatively consistent with performance in major markets around the world with the exception of CEMEA where we now have no payments volume from Russia. Processed transactions grew 17% year-over-year, up 36% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 47% year-over-year, and were 15% over 2019. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 62% about 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were at a 92 index to 2019. The small decline in this index relative to March is mostly due to the loss of Russia. Total cross-border volume was up 28% over 2019. Moving now to our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2022. Just as 2021 was a year of 2 distinct halves, due to the recovery, 2022 will be a year of 2 halves due to Russia. The suspension of our business in Russia will reduce second half revenues by about 4%. Russia will also negatively impact the payments volume and cross-border volume index to 2019, each by 4 points. The impact on process transactions index to 2019 will be under 1 point since we did not process domestic transactions in Russia. Ex-Russia and Ukraine, our domestic volume growth has stayed robust and stable for the past 4 quarters relative to 2019. Our outlook for the second half assumes that these trends are sustained. While there are uncertainties created by high inflation, supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and the invasion of Ukraine, there is no evident impact on our global payments volumes. E-commerce spend, both domestic and cross-border has remained strong and stable relative to 2019 at well above the pre-COVID trend line, even as pandemic effects fade, and we are assuming this will continue. In line with payments volumes, we expect processed transactions growth relative to 2019 to remain strong and stable with the variability largely driven by the extent to which small ticket card-present everyday spend comes back. It is important to note that year-over-year growth rates will moderate as we lap the strong second half recovery in fiscal year '21. Ex Russia and Ukraine we're assuming no spillover effects on other corridors in our cross-border business. Given where we ended the second quarter, we now expect cross-border travel ex intra-Europe to fully recover to 2019 levels by the end of our fiscal year despite the loss of Russian business. Including intra-Europe, that would put cross-border travel above 2019 levels.  With these assumptions, third quarter net revenues are expected to grow at the upper end of the mid-teens range in constant dollars. This includes Tink & Currencycloud, which add approximately 0.5 point to net revenues. The dollar has strengthened and the exchange rate drag will likely reduce nominal rate revenue growth by around 2.5 points. Due to some deals moving into the third quarter from the first half and the expectation that certain milestones will be achieved on some key contracts, incentives will run higher in the third quarter, between 26.5% to 27.5% of gross revenues. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in constant dollars to grow in the mid-teens, including expense savings from Russia and almost 3 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink. Exchange rates will likely reduce nominal operating expense growth by about 1.5 points. Our tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range. At this point, we expect fourth quarter trends to be generally in line with the third quarter. As always, we will update our fourth quarter outlook in July. Based on results to date and our outlook for the second half, we expect full year net revenue growth in constant dollars in the high teens to 20% range, including approximately 0.5 point of contribution from Tink and Currencycloud. Exchange rates will likely drag nominal growth rates down by around 2 points. There is no change in our expectation for full year incentives. Incentives as a percent of gross revenues are expected to range between 25.5% to 26.5%. We expect constant dollar non-GAAP operating expense growth at the upper end of mid-teens. This includes savings from the suspension of Russian operations and almost 2 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink. Nominal operating expense growth will be around 1.5 points lower due to the stronger dollar. Our full year tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range. Despite the uncertainties caused by inflation, interest rates, the invasion of Ukraine and our exit from Russia, we expect fiscal year '22 will be a very strong year of above-trend top and bottom line growth. As we enter the post-COVID era, we remain confident we can sustain a rate of growth about pre-COVID levels for all the reasons Al outlined, which I will summarize again. First, an acceleration away from cash and check for merchant payments, both domestic and cross-border as digitization becomes pervasive across consumers and businesses globally. Second, acceleration of cash, check and wire transfer displacement as our new flows initiatives penetrate a broad range of new use cases with very large total addressable markets. Third, sustainable high-teens growth across value-added services, both from existing services and new offerings. As new flows and value-added services become a larger part of our revenue mix, growing faster than consumer payments, the sustainable growth rate will continue to rise. We are and will continue to invest in the capabilities required to capture the extraordinary growth opportunity ahead of us. With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer. Yes, Harshita, that is a great question. As you know, 2 things we told you on the last call have remained true. One that, generally, countries around the world want to keep borders open, China being 1 exception, and some restrictions in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. And I include Hong Kong also in that list. Other than that, you can travel pretty freely anywhere else in the world. Some of them need tests, some don't even need tests. So that's true. The second is the pent-up demand for travel remains very high. And early indications on summer bookings, et cetera, as you heard from other people have been very good. So in our sort of calculations, certainly, we've been surprised so far even though we were bullish with how fast things have recovered. As you saw, after January, the recovery has been very robust. At this point, we're pretty optimistic that inbound to the U.S., which is still indexing only at 70 as of the end of March -- as of the end of the second quarter is on a good recovery track. There's still some recovery left in and out of Europe. So those things will certainly help us get back to 2019 levels. And you're absolutely right, I think the how fast and how far we get to, where we should have been prepandemic will depend on Asia coming back. Asia indexed at under 40 in the second quarter. China is an important part of Asia, it is still incredibly depressed. Japan, Korea and Taiwan are also important parts of Asian cross-border travel. Asia is recovering. We're seeing some good trends in Asia. Certainly travel into parts of Asia, like India, Thailand, Indonesia, et cetera, Australia and New Zealand are picking up fast. But you're right. I mean, getting all the way to 130 will depend on the remaining big travel components in Asia, which would be China, Japan and Korea, really coming back. And we'll have to wait and see on that, and we'll update you on the next call. No, it's 2 things, Tien-Tsin, as I said in the comments. Number one, you saw that our cross-border recovery in the quarter was stronger than we expected. We'd had expect a good recovery, but this was stronger than we expected. That improves our mix, but even with the strong recovery, our mix of cross-border is still lower than it was prepandemic. So the mix affects the percentage. As you know, the percentage is numerator and denominator. When cross-border grows disproportionately, the denominator grows without a commensurate increase in the numerator, just given the nature of how many of our incentives work. And that helps that percentage, and that's why the percentage came at the lower end of the range. The second reason is there are always timing factors, timing factors in terms of renewals, timing as in when we recognize incentives linked to achieving certain milestones that contracts have, and that has pushed some of those incentives into the third quarter. So we expected third quarter to run above the upper end of the range, so to speak. For the full year, we still expect to be in the range we gave you. So it's all driven by a combination of mix and timing. Sure. So it is a 4-point revenue impact from Russia. So that's pretty much what the revenue impact would be. We gave you a sense of what our revenue expectations are for the quarter in constant dollars, upper end to mid-teens. If it hadn't been for Russia, you'd have added 4 points to that. So it's still strong despite that. And as you said, it's because the loss of Russia is offset to some degree by the cross-border business being stronger. We have a similar issue or similar impact on the expense side, mid-teens expense growth helped by Russian expenses going away and there are 2 main Russian expenses that go away. We used to pay the processor in Russia for processing transactions. We no longer have to pay them. Obviously, when you're in business, you do marketing and provide a bunch of other services. Some of our personnel-related costs in Russia will remain. We've made some commitments to our employees in Russia about other roles. So those don't all go away. So that does reduce our expenses in the second half. Probably, in the range of about 2 to 3 points. On the other hand, we do have Tink and Currencycloud now that are coming in, which were not there last year, and that's about 3 points. So it sort of washes and goes in the other direction. And then finally, exchange rates will help expenses to the tune of about 1.5 points. So those are all the moving parts. Our expenses would have been probably 2 or 3 points higher if Russia had not been -- if operations in Russia had not been suspended. Well, partially. Mainly, because the incentives would go with it tend to be lower and it's a higher-yielding business. Yes. Yes. Yes, Darren. Our full year outlook incorporates the impacts of Russia in the second half. It reflects the fact that the second quarter was as strong as it was. So when you look at the first half and what growth we had in the first half, despite the impact of Russia on the second half, in constant dollars, we still expect to be in the high teens to 20%. Sure. So the primary factors that allowed the quarter to be stronger than we expected was clearly international revenues. And international revenues were not only stronger in terms of cross-border volumes being stronger than we expected. The recovery was from 71 to about 94 index to '19 between the end of January and March, which was clearly very, very strong. So that definitely was 1 of the outperformers. Because of the war in Ukraine, currency volatility was also high, and the fact that the cross-border business helps volumes add-in currency volatility and our treasury revenues were also higher than we expected. So those were 2 major contributors. And on the service line, as you know, we recognize service fees with a lag. In the case of Russia, because operations were being suspended, we were able to bill and collect revenues for the second quarter through when we suspended operations, and that added probably -- it would be less than 1 point to revenues, maybe a little over 0.5 point. So that did help. But other than that, it was all driven by just strength across the board. Value-added services performed very well, too. No. I think what you will see in the future is more of what you've seen in the past. Acquisitions that can add to our capabilities like Tink did, like Currencycloud did expand the suite of services we can offer, which is what both Tink and Currencycloud do. Acquisitions where we decide it's faster or cheaper to buy than to build. In some cases, it could be acquisitions that expand the scope of an existing service like Earthport did with our payouts business around the world. And yes, to the extent that the correction we're seeing in public markets carries over to private markets over a period of time, certainly, we expect to be more active. And we have no specific objectives in terms of we're going to do X amount in acquisitions every year. It's going to be based on what makes sense to do and where we can create value. Yes. It's part of our network or network's approach. So we're network agnostic and acquisitions like YellowPepper and what we did with Earthport are the kinds of capabilities that allow us to send to any credential, including a bank account as part of -- we'll get your money there and part of the way maybe on the rail that's not ours. Yes. Just to add to what Al said, I mean we clearly have seen -- we've seen ticket sizes go up in the U.S., in particular, in Europe, but it's not all inflation. Some of it is mix. It's mix driven by the fact that the card-present transactions, which often tend to be smaller transactions, have not yet fully come back. It's mix also because e-commerce transactions, even when you do everyday purchases, can be larger ticket sizes. We could even see ticket sizes go down in inflationary times as card-present comes back. So as Al said, there's multiple impacts from inflation. Net-net, it's a positive for us. We have not seen any impact on discretionary spending that we can discern. If anything, discretionary spending, especially from affluent consumers and credit cardholders has been going up quite healthily. So in general, there isn't any evidence impact -- evident impact on inflation, but obviously, we'll keep looking for it. Yes. So we talk about cross-border travel ex intra-Europe, and we are now expecting, given where it ended the second quarter to be at or about likely 2019 by the end of our fiscal year. And you're absolutely right, the last time we talked to you, we said we'd probably be around 90%. We're running better than we expected so far, so we've definitely raised our view of that. Now inclusive of intra-Europe, that would put us above 2019 levels by the end of our fiscal year. So yes, I think you got it right."

A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\nAl Kelly: Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon to everybody, and thanks for joining us. Amidst much uncertainty this quarter resulting from the ongoing COVID pandemic. Visa's financial performance was very strong. Our net revenues grew 24% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, up 27%. And our financial performance was driven by record volumes, transactions and credentials. In Q1, we crossed the $60 billion payment transaction mark for the first time in history, up 26% from two years ago. Visa cards were used 28 million times per hour in the last quarter. And we also increased our card credentials to over $3.8 billion, up 10% in one year. I'm going to leave the rest of the details to Vasant as I want to focus on the future. As we look ahead, we expect accelerated revenue growth versus pre-COVID over the coming years, driven by our three strategic levers of consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Many current trends in payments, including A2A, RTP, Buy Now, Pay Later, crypto and wallets are enabling new ways to pay. These represent opportunities for Visa, where we are extraordinarily well positioned to utilize our unique strength and global network to help them grow and scale. Let me start by talking about consumer payments. The opportunity to displace cash and check is enormous. At our last Investor Day, we said it was $18 trillion. In Q1, we saw our debit cash volumes at Visa growth 6% while debit payment volumes grew 19%. While cash displacement is certainly a reality, global personal consumption expenditure of cash and check grew at a CAGR of 2% over the 10 years ending in 2019. When we look at the opportunity ahead, if you assume global cash grows at 1% annually, industry-wide digital penetration of personal consumption expenditure when it reached 90% for several decades. For example, in Latin America, until a few quarters ago, there was more cash volume than payments volume on Visa credentials. In fact, in the past year, there has been a nearly 6.5 point shift and payments volume is now 55% of the total volume, even with cash in Latin America growing 10% this past quarter. We have expanded acceptance locations in Latin America by almost 30% in the past year to 18.5 million locations, and we've grown credentials over 20%. This quarter, we signed an eight-year agreement with Santander Chile, one of the largest issuers in the country. And in Brazil, we recently signed a deal with Banco XP, one of the country's largest digital banks with over 3 million customers. Brazil remains a growth market with payments volume growth up more than 1.5x historic levels in recent quarters. The key to digitizing cash is that the on-ramps to our network have never been easier to access. Wallet providers have been rapidly issuing Visa credentials as they see value in an open-loop ecosystem. Naranja X is a rapidly growing Argentinian wallet using Visa cards with 2 million credentials issued between prepaid and debit over the last two years. This quarter, we renewed our partnership with PayPay Bank, which enables accounts to PayPay wallet users. PayPay is one of the fastest-growing digital wallets in Japan with 42 million users and the bank already has 4 million Visa debit users. We recently extended our partnership with Safaricom, the operator of M-PESA to cover African markets outside of Kenya, where M-PESA has 50 million customers. We're also providing on-ramps for crypto players creating connectivity with fiat economies. There are over 65 crypto platforms and exchanges that have partnered to issue Visa credentials. This quarter, Visa credentials and crypto wallets had more than $2.5 billion in payments volume, which is already 70% of the payments volume for all of fiscal 2021. In addition to embedding credentials and crypto platforms, we continue to innovate around our settlement and crypto API capabilities, which have been key differentiators for us for fintechs and financial institutions that are looking to extend crypto capabilities to their customers. We will continue to lean into the crypto space. And our strategy is to be a key partner to provide the connectivity, scale, consumer value propositions, reliability and security that is needed for crypto offerings to grow. Earlier this month, we previewed CBDC payment APIs currently in development, which would enable central banks to connect their Ethereum-based CBDCs with Visa rails through a wallet with digital issuance capabilities, enabling consumers to spend with CBDCs at any Visa merchant. We partnered with Consensus to develop this concept, which was selected as one of the winning entries out of 300 ideas from 50 countries at the global CBDC challenge as part of the Singapore FinTech Festival judged by representatives from the IMF, the World Bank, the Bank of International Settlements and the central banks of Brazil, India, Kenya and Indonesia. In the face-to-face world, tap to pay continues to accelerate growth. Let me highlight progress in a few larger markets. In Brazil, the tap to pay penetration has increased from 5% to 24% in the past year. In India, where we have increased merchant locations 30% since fiscal year 2019 to $6 million at the end of fiscal year '21, the tap to pay penetration has nearly doubled to 16% in the same period. And all of these efforts have helped to fuel our 40%-plus year-over-year growth rate in payments volume in India this past quarter. In the United States, we're nearing 20% tap to pay penetration with key metro cities showing even stronger growth: L.A., Seattle, Detroit, Orange County, Miami and Salt Lake City have all surpassed 25%. San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland are up over 30%, and New York has reached 45%. E-commerce is also key to digitizing payments and e-commerce merchants are certainly growing as our relationships with them. We successfully closed a U.S. co-brand deal with Shopify, a key e-commerce platform with millions of global merchants and entrepreneurs. The Shopify Balance Card will allow Shopify's U.S. merchants to access funds from sales by the next business day and receive cash back on everyday business expenses like shipping and marketing. Buy Now Pay Later, our BNPL continues to grow, and we're seeing more and more BNPL fintechs issuing Visa credentials. Visa is enabling their shift to open loop so that their value proposition to consumers can scale through Visa's broad acceptance. Last quarter, I mentioned Corner. And this quarter, I'm pleased to announce that a firm has chosen Visa as their network partner for the Affirm debit card as well as renewing the virtual card business. We look forward to supporting Affirm's continued growth through Visa's wide acceptance and reach. BNPL fintechs are increasingly using Visa virtual cards to settle with merchants, driving triple-digit payments volume growth year-over-year in the United States. BNPL fintech consumers also continue to use their cards to pay off their installments with active cards growing 50% in the same period. For traditional issuers, we have a network installment solution called, Visa Installments, which enables our financial institution clients to seamlessly offer BNPL capabilities through an existing credit credential on any Visa transaction. In Canada, one of the countries where we are launching the capability, we now have commitments from issuers and acquirers representing the majority of payments volume. Credentials on our network of networks through BNPL, crypto, other fintechs and our traditional issuers bring compelling value propositions like identity protection, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, security, loyalty and more to consumers. This tremendous value motivates consumers to use their Visa credential online or in face-to-face versus cash, A2A RTP or even blockchains. So to summarize, the opportunity in consumer payments is huge and has an incredible long-term runway on ramp to our network of networks have ever been easier. We provide a compelling consumer value proposition and the advances in new ways to pay are good for Visa and these payment providers. Visa is enabling utility and scale for BNPL, crypto and wallets and all other nuance entrants. Now let me move to progress with use cases and new flows, which represents a $185 trillion opportunity, 10x that of consumer payments. We are seeing a large appetite from our partners and experiencing significant growth. A key driver is Visa Direct, which targets a $65 trillion opportunity across P2P, small B, B2C and G2C. These are all use cases that Visa didn't really serve just five years ago. By aggressively pursuing these flows with our more compelling solution, Visa is seemingly displacing alternatives that rely on fragmented and dated technology, not the other way around. Visa transaction growth was 35% this quarter. In the U.S., domestic P2P is currently our largest use case and also our lowest yielding one. As we scale and grow other geographies and use cases, especially those that are cross border, we expect the revenue yield to increase. Regardless of the yield, Visa Direct is accretive given it mostly leverages our existing platforms and capabilities. Usage is growing with banks signing on for global remittances using cards or accounts among them, the Qatar Islamic Bank, one of the largest banks in Qatar, and CIBC and Simply Financial in Canada. Visa Direct is also enabling fintech Chime and neobank Barra in the U.S. for account-to-account money movement. Usage has also expanded across several other use cases this quarter, such as payouts to DoorDashers in Canada. We also recently signed an agreement with Toast to leverage Visa Direct on several fronts. First, near instant cash flow access to daily sales and loan disbursements for their 48,000 -plus restaurant customers. And second, for fast tip payoff and earned wage access for their restaurant client employees. Visa Direct is a compelling capability because we offer incredible reach to more than 5 billion cards and accounts, global scale, a leading technology stack, world-class security and 24/7/365 reliability. All of which is easy to access through hundreds of partners across our global network of networks, reaching bank accounts through a combination of card, ACH and RTP systems in more than 175 countries. In the B2B new flows opportunity, we expect future growth to have several vectors. Let me just highlight a couple. First, B2B carded issuance in both physical and virtual cards where we have a leading share. This quarter in India, after partnering with leading B2B neobank Open for several years, we signed a deal for credit and debit issuance as well as the implementation of Visa Direct. In virtual card, we're expanding to new verticals. One recent example is health care. And this quarter, we signed an agreement with a direct health care company NoMe Health, a health care provider that serves 30,000 people per day across 10 U.S. states for its claims payment solution. A second vector of B2B growth is large ticket account based cross-border payments through Visa B2B Connect, which links our global payments infrastructure with best-in-class capabilities to address the primary pain points of existing solutions. In Latin America, Visa B2B Connect is available in nearly 30 countries, and we've enrolled partners in more than 1/3 of those countries already. One partner is Banco, a leading bank in Mexico since enabling the solution in March of 2021, the bank has grown Visa B2B Connect volumes double digits every quarter and has processed thousands of payments and hundreds of millions of payments volume. We also recently added Sberbank, the largest bank in Russia, Eastern and Central Europe, which will be live and processing transactions later this year. So to summarize new flows, the opportunity is 10x consumer payments. Our capabilities and value proposition are strong versus the competition, and we expect revenue yield to continue to improve as we scale and grow Visa Direct, especially in cross-border use cases. Now let's move to value-added services. In Q1, revenue grew over 20%, and we expect strong growth to continue. One example is with Visa Consulting and Analytics. In addition to our crypto offerings that I mentioned earlier, we recently launched a specialized global crypto advisory practice to help financial institutions eager to offer customers a crypto solution, retailers who are looking to delve into NFPs or central banks exploring digital currencies. Another example is with the authentication. In Europe, we have tripled the use of Visa's new authentication technology, EMV 3DS since the start of 2021, and this is coincided with a reduction in card present fraud by 28%, and it has also positively impacted the transaction authorization rates. And we are launching new capabilities to build for the future. Visa Acceptance Cloud enables clients to move embedded payment processing software from individual devices to the cloud, eliminating the need for expensive terminals as well as the cost and time to certify the processing software. In addition, clients can access value-added services from fraud management to BNPL. We also recently closed our acquisition of Currency Cloud. We believe the combination of Currency Cloud's APIs on the front end, which provide real-time foreign exchange capabilities and our settlement capabilities across our network of networks. We will have a very compelling value proposition. Together, we can enable new use cases and payment flows particularly as we expand the cross-border use cases, we provide our clients, including B2B Connect and Visa Direct. We can extend our FX platform for easy connect easier connectivity for fintechs and non-financial institution partners, and we can offer real-time FX rates and improve transparency for our partner customers. So to summarize value-added services, we will continue to bring Visa innovation to the payments ecosystem. We are diversifying our revenue mix, and this will help us retain and win business and grow revenue well into the future. In conclusion, as I think about Visa's future, I'm extremely optimistic and energized. While much has been written about new payment types being potentially disruptive to Visa, we see a lot more opportunity than disruption. Our global infrastructure is providing connectivity through our network of networks to power more traditional payment types and newer ways to pay and move money. Our interconnectivity, security, reliability, consumer and fraud protections, risk management and other value-added services offer a superior experience. We expect to attract more and more transactions, which will continue to fuel our growth at an accelerated rate. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2022 is off to an excellent start with net revenues up 24% and GAAP EPS up 29%. Non-GAAP EPS adjusted for items, including investment gains and the litigation accrual was up 27%. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was approximately 1 point higher at 25% and non-GAAP EPS approximately 1.5 points higher at over 28%. A few key highlights. We had a very sharp recovery in cross-border travel in October and November as much of the globe ex-China moved to reopen borders or announced timetables to open borders and listed restrictions such as quarantines. As a result, card present and card not present travel, which exited September at an index of 61 to 2019 rose. steeply to hit an index of 72 for the first quarter. Border reopening came sooner than we had anticipated and as we've seen throughout 2021, consumers are very quick to actually. As Omicron hits some border shut and some restrictions were reinstated. However, as we speak, moreover, being reopened, and restrictions lifted, and we expect the travel recovery to resume as we head into February. Payments volumes remained robust through the quarter globally with index for 2019 stepping up relative to the prior quarter by 2 points in the U.S. and 6 points internationally. The credit recovery continued and debit growth remained strong and stable. U.S. holiday retail spending was specifically strong more than 40% over 2019. E-commerce continued to gain share retail spending up 5 point since 2019. The impact of Omicron on domestic volume has been modest. As the Omicron wave affects globally, we expect the impact to ease as it has in market such South Africa and the UK weaker among the first to be helped. Revenue growth was very strong across our three growth engines. Consumer payments and new flows net revenues grew in the mid 20% range and value added services revenues grew over 20%. We significantly stepped up the pace of our stock buybacks during the quarter. We acquired 19.4 million shares for $4.1 billion at an average price of $210. And our Board authorized a new $12 billion stock buyback program in December. Also in late December, we closed the currency cloud transaction. Now on to the details. In constant dollars, Global Payments volume was up 20% year-over-year and 26% versus 2019, each accelerating 3 to 5 points versus the last quarter, led by continued strength in debit as well as improving credit spending. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 22% or 31% higher than 2019 and a 4 to 5-point acceleration from the fourth quarter. U.S. payments volume grew 22%, up 32% over 2019, both higher than Q4. Credit grew 27% and improved 6 points to 23% above 2019, helped by affluent consumer and small business spending. Debit grew 18% year-over-year and remained very strong at 43% about 2019 similar to the last quarter. As you can see, debit spend has remained resilient even as credit recovered. U.S. card presence spend grew 25% and was 17% above 2019, improving 2 points at its highest level yet in the pandemic, driven by fuel, retail and entertainment spending. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 16% and about 2019, similar to last quarter. E-commerce growth remains robust even as card presence spend continues to recover. U.S. retail spending during the holiday season grew double digits and more than 40% of our 2019 levels, both of which are very strong by historical standards. The share of holiday card present retail spending improved a few points from last year, but was still 5 points lower than 2019 as the shift towards e-commerce over the past decade continues. Retail shopping is happening earlier in the holiday season than it used to, which is a trend that started last year. As a result, relative to 2019, November volumes were stronger than December. U.S. holiday spending trends are fairly consistent with other major markets around the world. International constant dollar payments volume, excluding China, grew 22% and was 29% about 2019, improving 7 points from the fourth quarter. A few regional highlights: Latin America was up 44% year-over-year and 66% about 2019, accelerating 8 points from the fourth quarter with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region remained strong, up 31% and 58% from 2019 levels, accelerating 10 points from the fourth quarter, also fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Europe was up 17% and 23% from 2019, improving 3 points from the last quarter due to strong performance across Continental Europe. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region, up 16% both year-over-year and versus 2019, but the recovery is finally underway with an 11-point improvement from Q4, mostly due to relaxed restrictions. The largest improvements were in Australia, India, Southeast Asia and Japan. Global process transactions were up 21% year-over-year and 26% over 2019, 2 points better than the fourth quarter, accelerating less than overall volume growth due to higher ticket sizes. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was up 51% year-over-year and was 1% above 2019 volumes, a 15-point improvement from the fourth quarter. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, continued to strengthen, up 26% year-over-year and 50% above 2019, 7 points higher than the fourth quarter as consumer engagement continues to grow. Cross-border travel-related spending, excluding intra-Europe, grew 102% year-over-year and was 72% of 2019 levels, improving an extraordinary 14 points from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. The recovery in the first two months of the quarter versus 2019 was very fast and broad-based with outbound travel from each of our regions improving more than 10 points relative to 2019 from September to November. Inbound travel to the U.S., Canada, EMEA and Europe, all improved about 20 points during that time, while Latin America and Asia each improved at least 5 points. This recovery was driven by a combination of border openings, the relaxing restrictions and pent-up demand. Countries such as the U.S., Singapore, Thailand, Australia, Chile, Argentina and many more reduced friction for inbound travelers. The U.S. to Europe corridor remained open. This deep travel recovery started to lose momentum in the last week of December as Omicron spread around the globe. We expect this to be short-lived. Moving now to a quick review of first quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 19%, slightly better than the 18% nominal growth in Q4 payments volume, helped by increased utilization of card benefits and small pricing modifications. Data processing revenues grew 19%, slightly below the 21% processed transaction growth, mostly due to exchange rate changes. International transaction revenues were up 50% consistent with nominal cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Other revenues grew 17%, led by consulting, data and marketing services as well as travel-related benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer Payments grew in the mid-20s led by improving cross-border volumes and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows also grew in the mid-20s driven by Visa Direct and the carded B2B recovery. Visa Direct transactions grew 35%. We're lapping very strong quarters from last year, which is moderating U.S. growth rates. Meanwhile, the international business is ramping fast as is growth from use cases such as cross-border remittances earned wage access and marketplace payouts. Commercial or B2B volumes grew 28% year-over-year and up 26% over 2019, a 5-point improvement from the prior quarter, mostly in credit. The growth is helped by share gains and a portfolio of diverse spend categories that is not overly dependent on T&E. Value-added services revenue grew over 20%, led by risk and identity as well as consulting and data services. Growth was driven by new client adoption, increased usage among existing clients and international expansion. Client incentives were 25.1% of gross revenues, about 1 point below our expectations. This was a result of a significantly better revenue mix due to the faster-than-expected recovery of our cross-border business. As our revenue mix continues to normalize with the cross-border recovery, it will help this ratio. GAAP operating expenses grew 24% inclusive of $145 million litigation provision associated with U.S. interchange multi-district litigation case. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 16%, in line with our expectations. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $231 million. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $110 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 19.3% was in line with expectations. Our first quarter tax rate is typically a little lower than the full year rate. GAAP EPS was $1.83. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, up 27% over last year. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buyback, we returned $4.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. A few comments on our trends through the first three weeks of January. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 13%, with debit up 4% and credit up 25%. As you assess these numbers, it is important to remember that there was a government stimulus disbursement, which caused the surge in debit spending in early January 2021. January spend growth versus 2019 was up 40% with debit up a robust 52% and credit up 29%. These trends are relatively consistent with performance in our major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 17% year-over-year, up 37% versus 2019, lagging volume growth due to larger ticket sizes. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis grew 44% year-over-year and was 4% above 2019. Card-not-present non-travel growth remained strong at 67% above 2019, up 17 points from the first quarter. The cross-border travel recovery has stalled since late December due to Omicron, indexing at 72 to 2019, in line with the first quarter. Border reopening, and we expect the recovery to resume in February. Total cross-border volume was 14% above 2019. Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter. Domestic volume growth has stayed robust and stable for the past three quarters. While Omicron has had some recent impact, it has been modest and will ease as the way of crest. This is also the case with e-commerce growth both domestic and cross-border. We are assuming that these trends continue. The swing factor is cross-border travel. As discussed, the cross-border travel recovery was very rapid in October and November as the U.S. border reopened and many countries ease restrictions or announced plans to do so. With Omicron surging, some restrictions were put back in place and some reopening plans were put on hold. However, restrictions are being eased and border reopening. We're assuming the cross-border travel recovery resumes in February. As such, we expect net revenues to grow at the high end of high teens in the second quarter, including over 1 point of exchange rate drag. Incentives should grow at a similar rate as the first quarter, which as a percent of gross revenues will likely be in the 25.5% to 26.5% range based on volumes, renewal activity and cross-border performance. We expect organic non-GAAP operating expenses growth at the high end of mid-teens with some additional investment spend. The inclusion of currency cloud will add another 1.5 points to non-GAAP operating expense growth. Tax rate is expected to come in at the high end of the 19% to 19.5% range. We can also update some of the planning assumptions for the full year we had shared with you in October. Domestic payments volumes and cross-border e-commerce volume as well as the associated transactions are largely in line with expectations. At the end of December, we were running significantly ahead on cross-border travel indexed to 2019 relative to our assumptions in the fall. As such, we are now assuming that the cross-border travel index for 2019, excluding intra-Europe, end the fiscal year 10 points ahead of our prior assumptions are at 90%. Inclusive of intra-Europe travel, this would be back at 2019 levels. With these updated assumptions, net revenue for the full year would grow at the high end of high teens including 1 point of exchange rate drag. Obviously, revenue growth would be higher if the cross-border recovery is more robust in the second half and more akin to what we saw in October and November. With revenue mix improving from higher cross-border volumes, incentives as a percent of gross revenues would range between 25.5% to 26.5% for the year. We expect organic non-GAAP operating expenses growth at the high end of mid-teens. The inclusion of Currencycloud will add another point to non-GAAP operating expense growth. Tax rate is expected to be at the upper end of the 19% to 19.5% range. On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, the impact of Currencycloud is not material for the year. As a reminder, in our non-GAAP numbers, we make adjustments to exclude amortization of intangibles and nonrecurring acquisition-related costs. In summary, FY '22 is off to an excellent start. We expect our growth this year will be well above the pre-COVID rate as cross-border recovers. This will likely continue into fiscal year '23. Beyond that, we are confident the business can sustain a revenue growth rate above pre-COVID levels for three reasons. First, an acceleration away from cash and check for merchant payments both domestic and cross-border as digitization becomes pervasive across consumers and businesses globally; second, acceleration of cash, check and wire transfer displacement as our new flows initiatives penetrate a broad range of new use cases with very large total addressable markets; third, sustainable high-teens growth across our value-added services, both from existing services and new offerings. As new flows and value-added services become a larger part of our revenue mix, growing faster than consumer payments, the sustainable growth rate will continue to rise. We are and will continue to invest in the capabilities required to capture the extraordinary growth opportunity ahead of us. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\nMike Milotich: Thank you, Vasant. We're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Nice job. Al, can you start off by revisiting what you see as the key sustainable factors that's probably accelerated somewhat as the pandemic progressed? Whether that's services or it's just volume generally having shifted over faster? And then I guess on that note, as we get cross-border improving, you should get a pretty big pass-through to the bottom line. I'm just curious, your thought process around the potential for reinvestment versus rewarding shareholders?\nAl Kelly: Well, Darrin, I think, first in the near term, I think the upside is going to come from continued recovery of travel and the affluent customer getting back in the mix of spending at the levels they were pre the pandemic. In terms of sustained longer-term opportunities, I think they come in a number of places. First, e-commerce adoption is going to be very sticky and millions and millions of people around the world went to e-com and for the first time during the pandemic. Continued cash displacement is without question, going to continue. There's just simply more ways to pay, which is going to drive volume. Geographic expansion for us is another area where we're going to get sustained growth over time. And then I think continuing to penetrate both in new flows and the opportunities that we have with Visa Direct, B2B Connect and other areas within B2B, plus our ability as we capture more transactions to be able to sell our value-added services. So I think there's a a good number of levers that we can push that provide terrific growth for us going forward. In terms of your second question, I'll let Vasant weigh in as well. Look, Vasant talked about our updated planning assumption on cross-border where we think we're going to be about 10 points better than our original planning assumption. And certainly, that is going to be helpful for us. As we look ahead, we're going to continue to, I think, be very balanced in our thinking. We're conscious about making sure that our level of investment is at the appropriate levels against the right initiatives to make sure that we are managing the business and being able to fund growth initiatives into the future. But we're also conscious of making sure that we're careful about our expenses as we go forward as well, Darrin.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I mean going back to your question about shareholders and returning cash to shareholders, we did step up our dividend. It's $1.50 per quarter now. We did that last quarter. And then as you saw, we accelerated our stock buybacks. Our stock buyback is programmatic, but when we see opportunities, we step it up. And clearly, our cash flows are better. We felt there was an opportunity and we stepped up. As Al said, I mean our first priority is investing in our core business. There's plenty of opportunity here for growth. Second would be acquisitions that enhance our capabilities like Currencycloud and hopefully soon we close on Tink. And then, of course, we've always been returning cash to shareholders, most of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and buybacks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rayna Kumar from UBS. Your line is open.\nRayna Kumar: So as you both highlighted your debit volume remains very strong. Can you discuss how much of that strength is coming from Visa Direct and how sustainable that growth is in '22, of course, excluding the second quarter comp issue with the government stimulus?\nAl Kelly: Rayna, it's a couple of points, and it's been consistently that through the entire run of the pandemic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: I want to ask about inflation. Vasant, can you remind us how does inflation impact you? You obviously get benefits in purchase volumes, but how does it impact ticket sizes, consumer behavior in your view? And can you also talk about the cost and personnel expense aspect of it?\nVasant Prabhu: Sure. In terms of inflation as it relates to our revenues, as you know, our service fees, cross-border, et cetera, are denominated primarily in basis points on ticket size. So to the extent that there's inflation, driving up ticket size, clearly, it's beneficial to us. When it comes to transactions processing, our fees are generally tried to number of transactions. Right now, of course, the size of the basket has gone up. Some of it is because of inflation. Some of it is because it's just gone up through the pandemic. Some of it has to do with the fact that some of the smaller transactions, you've got in a normal world like people going and buying themselves lunch at work or a cup of coffee. We're losing some of those transits. And so that causes ticket size on a mix basis to go up, which will recover, and that will be good for our transactions business. And in general, when people are ordering in through e-commerce, basket sizes have tended to go up. So the basket size increase we see now it's partially inflation, partially it's some elements like the ones I just went through. So net-net, I mean we are a beneficiary of inflation. And in terms of wage inflation, generally speaking, I mean, we expect some everybody is seeing it. But overall, I mean, it's reasonable at this point, and we'll update you as time goes by, if it's more than we expected. Al, I'm sure you have things to add.\nAl Kelly: No, I think it was a very complete answer of Visa. The only other factor that you didn't mention relative to ticket sizes is something I said in answering, I think Darrin's question that as the affluent segment, which is the segment that -- who spending went down the most during the that comes back in, obviously, they tend to have higher ticket sizes as well. So, there's a number of factors that drive ticket sizes actually getting to precision on causality and what the different weighting of those different factors are is virtually impossible.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: So Al, you talked about the many reasons in your opening that you expect the growth to be a significant tailwind with many of the partners and products that you cited. It's interesting because many of the doubters sort of speak to that as the reasons to be concerned about the outlook. I'm just curious what you think they're missing. And I just had a follow-up for Vasant. In terms of the updated cross-border guidance, does that assume that there's a gradual improvement after February or that people go back to traveling like you saw in November and December?\nAl Kelly: Sanjay, I'd say a couple of things. One is that much of the innovation that we have seen is coming in ways to pay. And we're a network that is agnostic to the different ways people want to pay. We're truly a global open network that is willing to embrace fintechs and bigger players who want to introduce new ways for consumers to pay. We're not going to decide who's a winner or a loser. I'm not here to predict how big PNPL will get or crypto will get. I don't know. But I think that our job is to lean in and support them and give them a chance to have their capabilities or there are ways to pay run on our network. Ultimately, the consumer will decide who wins and losses based on the value that they believe that they're seeing as well as the user experience. I also think that the fact of the matter is if you look out over time, open networks win over closed networks. And Visa is a truly open global network with incredible reach and scale. And what ends up happening in any kind of closed situation is that after the initial excitement, initial pop, people run into a wall where it gets much more difficult to scale their businesses. And when somebody comes in and does business with us where we can make our 80 million or really closer to 100 million merchants available to them and help bring scale instantly and prevent people from having to for instance, go merchant-by-merchant in order to scale their business, we can do it much more quickly and much more efficiently for them. So I think that this kind of distinction between how to pay and a network like ours that is enabling multiple ways to pay is a distinction, I think, that people haven't fully appreciated.\nVasant Prabhu: Going back to your second question on cross-border, I think what's become evident from multiple data points over the last six to nine months, is that when borders open, it's like a switch turning on, the reaction is almost immediate. There's massive pent-up demand and consumers are quick to act. And what we saw in October and November was really the world opening up ex-China. And if it hadn't been for Omicron, that trend was quite extraordinary. Between September and November, we saw a very steep increase in cross-border travel driven by the opening of the U.S. border, the opening up of most borders in Europe. And what we started to see in October was many Asian countries, which have been the most restrictive, excluding China, of course, either open up or announce a timetable for opening up. So that tells you that opening borders, which is something that is hard to predict because governments control it can have a sizable and immediate impact. In terms of your question as to what is our assumption, our assumption is for steady improvement through the year. But we know it won't be steady. I mean there will be periods when borders open, and we could see some sharp improvements. And there may be occasional periods where if there is another variant, there may be some flattening out just as we saw in January. But the bottom line is it is very clear that when borders are open, things will move very fast to normalize.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nKen Suchoski: I wanted to follow up on the cross-border business. I mean some really solid results there. And I'm just curious to get your thoughts. Can you talk about whether this business gets back to pre-COVID trend growth? Or do you expect the cross-border business to get back to pre-COVID trend levels? Meaning does cross-border revenue and volume eventually catch up to where it would have been had COVID not happened?\nVasant Prabhu: Well, I think the short answer is we fully expect to get back to pre-COVID trend levels, meaning whatever the trend line was, we will get back to that trend line. And at least initially, the mix will be a little different because the part of the business that is growing well above trend is the cross-border business that right now is below trend -- below the trend line is the travel business. The e-commerce business cross-border is clearly one that we think can sustain above trend growth rates relative to pre-COVID. And if the travel business returns only to the pre-COVID growth rates, which we see no reason why it wouldn't, so let's assume it grows above pre-COVID growth rates gets to the trend line and then begins to grow at pre-COVID trend rates. We see no reason why that isn't the case. There is a possibility because of the e-commerce business that the cross-border business in total can grow faster than pre-COVID growth rates after it gets back to the pre-COVID trend line. I assume that is sort of what you were asking.\nKen Suchoski: Yes. That's exactly right. I appreciate that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: I had a couple strategic questions related to the Visa Acceptance Cloud announcement. First, is it open to all types of card payments? Or is it Visa only? And then second, how are you monetizing this Acceptance Cloud? And then the last one is, how should we think about the interplay between the Visa Acceptance Cloud and your ecosystem of acquirers and payment facilitators given that many of them have their own solutions in the POS space? I mean, is this -- are they embracing it? Or is it potentially competitive with their solutions?\nAl Kelly: Well, Lisa, first of all, it's early days with this. Our approach on this is to not charge for it because we think it's extremely valuable for the ecosystem to expand acceptance. And that's really the driving strategic force for us here is to drive acceptance. And certainly, my expectation is that once we can get the transaction on our network will have more opportunity to sell things like value-added services over time. But despite the fact that our network has the 100 million merchant locations, there is still a long tail of merchants around the world that are not accepting. And it's important that we do everything we can to bolster the acceptance footprint that we have around the world.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Just wanted to take your temperature a bit on the global regulatory landscape, does it feel more or less risky than, say, where we were pre-pandemic? I mean just given the political climate in the U.S. There's still the merchant litigation in Brooklyn, the Fed is proposing some changes to the Durbin Amendment. There were some recent reports out of the U.K. from the payment system regulator there. So just wanted to see how you're thinking about that overall or any areas of risk we should be potentially mindful of?\nAl Kelly: Jason, for as long as I've been involved in payments, there's always been regulatory issues and discussions that take place around the world. So it's really part of being in the business. I do not think there has been any material change in the environment in the last quarter or for that matter in the last year. I do think that the pandemic has helped governments recognize a couple of things though. One is the incredible importance of digitization because at a time when people around the world were locked down, they were able to continue to order food and order items delivered to their house because of digital, the digital payment ecosystem that is reliable and secure around the world. I also think that during this time, governments realize that they should become more digital. And we, during this period, helped a number of governments with the issuance of stimulus money or, in some cases, there was money to recognize the first responders and health care workers and those kinds of things. So I think there's more discussions going on with governments related to digital payments and we're helping them more. I'd also say that they, subject of Central Bank digital currencies, opens up and gives us an opportunity to talk to central bankers who, in many cases, are seeking our counsel as to what they should potentially be able to do. And I think that's because it allows us to have an avenue to potentially talk about other things that they might be contemplating from a regulatory point of view. So I guess, in sum, I'd say, regulatory attention is nothing new. There hasn't been any material change, and we continue to engage thoughtfully and frequently around the world with regulators.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Good to connect with you all. Just on the strong mid-20s revenue growth this quarter. I know it was nicely ahead of the of the high teens you talked about last quarter that you expected. Was it primarily cross-border that drove the upside or surprised. I'm just curious if there's any other callouts that you would point to because I know we've fielded a lot of cross-border questions. And then just quickly on rebates and incentives, I guess, the outlook 50 bps better than prior guidance, is that also primarily the result of cross-border? Any other impacts from pricing, et cetera?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. You're right, Tien-Tsin. I mean, the cross-border outperformance in the first quarter was primarily cross-border, but we also had value-added services performing quite a bit better than we expected. So strong value-add service was also a contributor. So those would be the sort of the two main drivers. As you know, we service -- when payments volumes outperform we booked the revenue with a lag. There was outperformance on payments volumes too, but that doesn't show up in the quarter. It certainly wasn't anywhere on the order of magnitude as our cross-border performance, but there was there's definitely. There would have been higher service revenues had there been no lag. The other part of your question was...\nTien-Tsin Huang: Rebates and incentives.\nVasant Prabhu: Rebates and incentives, yes, we have been saying for a while that those numbers were going up because of the mix change away from cross-border. We thought coming into this quarter that we'd be somewhere in the region of 26% at the low end of the prior range we had. We were a whole point lower entirely because our mix improved because of cross-border and the reduction in the range for the year is also driven by the improvement in the mix since we now expect the cross-border business to be stronger than we had originally expected.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. So it's all mix. Glad to hear it.\nAl Kelly: Tien-Tsin, the only thing I would add is that I think the -- we also had a very strong holiday period. And as -- based pointed out in his remarks or in answer to one of the questions, we've seen this phenomena of the holiday season stretching, and it's no longer really Black Friday to Christmas Eve. It's really starting early in November, driven by the incredible increase in the adoption of e-commerce.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Looking at the upgrade in your cross-border travel forecast for the rest of this year, does any of that include reopening of China? And if it doesn't, what impact would a China reopening have on the impact of -- on cross-border travel payments, obviously, depending on timing?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I mean we don't sort of -- no one corridor accounts for a big chunk of our volume. So China opening or not don't have to make specific assumptions on that. We certainly expect some opening in Asia. The big surprise in October before Omicron hit was Asia was opening up faster than we expected. So for example, Thailand pretty much opened up all their resorts. Now they did pause, but they've reopened them again now that the Omicron wave seems to be passing. We saw Singapore announced a phased opening plan, and I believe they're still on track to do that. We even saw Indonesia, India ease restrictions. So more kinds of people can travel to India without -- and Indonesia without quarantines and things like that. China is completely shut and it's hard to predict when it opens. So I would say on balance, we are not counting on a big recovery of the Chinese business. But otherwise, the big swing factor at this point is how quickly Asia opens and how restrictive is it after opening.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: The question I have is, you outlined a ton of great opportunities for future growth. But in many instances, there's like just so many, it's hard to kind of pull these things together. So when you take a higher kind of elevated look and you think about it from a secular growth versus cyclical mix of your revenues, where does it sit today versus maybe in the prior pandemic? And how should we be thinking about that mix shift to get you to that accelerated growth path?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I can start, and I'm sure Al will add. I mean, look in the short run the cyclical recovery is by far the biggest driver of the growth. Having said that, I mean, underneath the cyclical recovery, which is most acute right now in cross-border, you can see that other components of the business are not only stable but also growing at an above trend level. So if you look at our payments volumes. Credit is in a recovery mode, but debit is very resilient even as credit recovers and is at a growth rate, if you do a CAGR over the time period pre-pandemic, it's a higher CAGR than it was pre-pandemic. The same is true for e-commerce growth. You could say the same about our value-added services and new flows. So while the biggest driver of short-term growth being above trend is the recovery component. If you look below it, the underlying sustainable and secular growth trends are also about trend relative to where they were pre-pandemic.\nAl Kelly: Yes, I'd agree with all of that. And if we look at our growth by certain verticals, incredible growth in home improvement and food and drug and a lot of that, I think, is because there's all kinds of new models. People are buying online and picking up or buying online and getting delivery. A lot of these new ways of shopping and paying is going to help us drive growth in new ways going forward.\nMike Milotich: And with that, thank you, all of you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, you can feel free to contact or e-mail Jennifer or I, we're happy to help you, and have a great evening. Thanks so much.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Al Kelly",
            "content": "Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon to everybody, and thanks for joining us. Amidst much uncertainty this quarter resulting from the ongoing COVID pandemic. Visa's financial performance was very strong. Our net revenues grew 24% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, up 27%. And our financial performance was driven by record volumes, transactions and credentials. In Q1, we crossed the $60 billion payment transaction mark for the first time in history, up 26% from two years ago. Visa cards were used 28 million times per hour in the last quarter. And we also increased our card credentials to over $3.8 billion, up 10% in one year. I'm going to leave the rest of the details to Vasant as I want to focus on the future. As we look ahead, we expect accelerated revenue growth versus pre-COVID over the coming years, driven by our three strategic levers of consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Many current trends in payments, including A2A, RTP, Buy Now, Pay Later, crypto and wallets are enabling new ways to pay. These represent opportunities for Visa, where we are extraordinarily well positioned to utilize our unique strength and global network to help them grow and scale. Let me start by talking about consumer payments. The opportunity to displace cash and check is enormous. At our last Investor Day, we said it was $18 trillion. In Q1, we saw our debit cash volumes at Visa growth 6% while debit payment volumes grew 19%. While cash displacement is certainly a reality, global personal consumption expenditure of cash and check grew at a CAGR of 2% over the 10 years ending in 2019. When we look at the opportunity ahead, if you assume global cash grows at 1% annually, industry-wide digital penetration of personal consumption expenditure when it reached 90% for several decades. For example, in Latin America, until a few quarters ago, there was more cash volume than payments volume on Visa credentials. In fact, in the past year, there has been a nearly 6.5 point shift and payments volume is now 55% of the total volume, even with cash in Latin America growing 10% this past quarter. We have expanded acceptance locations in Latin America by almost 30% in the past year to 18.5 million locations, and we've grown credentials over 20%. This quarter, we signed an eight-year agreement with Santander Chile, one of the largest issuers in the country. And in Brazil, we recently signed a deal with Banco XP, one of the country's largest digital banks with over 3 million customers. Brazil remains a growth market with payments volume growth up more than 1.5x historic levels in recent quarters. The key to digitizing cash is that the on-ramps to our network have never been easier to access. Wallet providers have been rapidly issuing Visa credentials as they see value in an open-loop ecosystem. Naranja X is a rapidly growing Argentinian wallet using Visa cards with 2 million credentials issued between prepaid and debit over the last two years. This quarter, we renewed our partnership with PayPay Bank, which enables accounts to PayPay wallet users. PayPay is one of the fastest-growing digital wallets in Japan with 42 million users and the bank already has 4 million Visa debit users. We recently extended our partnership with Safaricom, the operator of M-PESA to cover African markets outside of Kenya, where M-PESA has 50 million customers. We're also providing on-ramps for crypto players creating connectivity with fiat economies. There are over 65 crypto platforms and exchanges that have partnered to issue Visa credentials. This quarter, Visa credentials and crypto wallets had more than $2.5 billion in payments volume, which is already 70% of the payments volume for all of fiscal 2021. In addition to embedding credentials and crypto platforms, we continue to innovate around our settlement and crypto API capabilities, which have been key differentiators for us for fintechs and financial institutions that are looking to extend crypto capabilities to their customers. We will continue to lean into the crypto space. And our strategy is to be a key partner to provide the connectivity, scale, consumer value propositions, reliability and security that is needed for crypto offerings to grow. Earlier this month, we previewed CBDC payment APIs currently in development, which would enable central banks to connect their Ethereum-based CBDCs with Visa rails through a wallet with digital issuance capabilities, enabling consumers to spend with CBDCs at any Visa merchant. We partnered with Consensus to develop this concept, which was selected as one of the winning entries out of 300 ideas from 50 countries at the global CBDC challenge as part of the Singapore FinTech Festival judged by representatives from the IMF, the World Bank, the Bank of International Settlements and the central banks of Brazil, India, Kenya and Indonesia. In the face-to-face world, tap to pay continues to accelerate growth. Let me highlight progress in a few larger markets. In Brazil, the tap to pay penetration has increased from 5% to 24% in the past year. In India, where we have increased merchant locations 30% since fiscal year 2019 to $6 million at the end of fiscal year '21, the tap to pay penetration has nearly doubled to 16% in the same period. And all of these efforts have helped to fuel our 40%-plus year-over-year growth rate in payments volume in India this past quarter. In the United States, we're nearing 20% tap to pay penetration with key metro cities showing even stronger growth: L.A., Seattle, Detroit, Orange County, Miami and Salt Lake City have all surpassed 25%. San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland are up over 30%, and New York has reached 45%. E-commerce is also key to digitizing payments and e-commerce merchants are certainly growing as our relationships with them. We successfully closed a U.S. co-brand deal with Shopify, a key e-commerce platform with millions of global merchants and entrepreneurs. The Shopify Balance Card will allow Shopify's U.S. merchants to access funds from sales by the next business day and receive cash back on everyday business expenses like shipping and marketing. Buy Now Pay Later, our BNPL continues to grow, and we're seeing more and more BNPL fintechs issuing Visa credentials. Visa is enabling their shift to open loop so that their value proposition to consumers can scale through Visa's broad acceptance. Last quarter, I mentioned Corner. And this quarter, I'm pleased to announce that a firm has chosen Visa as their network partner for the Affirm debit card as well as renewing the virtual card business. We look forward to supporting Affirm's continued growth through Visa's wide acceptance and reach. BNPL fintechs are increasingly using Visa virtual cards to settle with merchants, driving triple-digit payments volume growth year-over-year in the United States. BNPL fintech consumers also continue to use their cards to pay off their installments with active cards growing 50% in the same period. For traditional issuers, we have a network installment solution called, Visa Installments, which enables our financial institution clients to seamlessly offer BNPL capabilities through an existing credit credential on any Visa transaction. In Canada, one of the countries where we are launching the capability, we now have commitments from issuers and acquirers representing the majority of payments volume. Credentials on our network of networks through BNPL, crypto, other fintechs and our traditional issuers bring compelling value propositions like identity protection, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, security, loyalty and more to consumers. This tremendous value motivates consumers to use their Visa credential online or in face-to-face versus cash, A2A RTP or even blockchains. So to summarize, the opportunity in consumer payments is huge and has an incredible long-term runway on ramp to our network of networks have ever been easier. We provide a compelling consumer value proposition and the advances in new ways to pay are good for Visa and these payment providers. Visa is enabling utility and scale for BNPL, crypto and wallets and all other nuance entrants. Now let me move to progress with use cases and new flows, which represents a $185 trillion opportunity, 10x that of consumer payments. We are seeing a large appetite from our partners and experiencing significant growth. A key driver is Visa Direct, which targets a $65 trillion opportunity across P2P, small B, B2C and G2C. These are all use cases that Visa didn't really serve just five years ago. By aggressively pursuing these flows with our more compelling solution, Visa is seemingly displacing alternatives that rely on fragmented and dated technology, not the other way around. Visa transaction growth was 35% this quarter. In the U.S., domestic P2P is currently our largest use case and also our lowest yielding one. As we scale and grow other geographies and use cases, especially those that are cross border, we expect the revenue yield to increase. Regardless of the yield, Visa Direct is accretive given it mostly leverages our existing platforms and capabilities. Usage is growing with banks signing on for global remittances using cards or accounts among them, the Qatar Islamic Bank, one of the largest banks in Qatar, and CIBC and Simply Financial in Canada. Visa Direct is also enabling fintech Chime and neobank Barra in the U.S. for account-to-account money movement. Usage has also expanded across several other use cases this quarter, such as payouts to DoorDashers in Canada. We also recently signed an agreement with Toast to leverage Visa Direct on several fronts. First, near instant cash flow access to daily sales and loan disbursements for their 48,000 -plus restaurant customers. And second, for fast tip payoff and earned wage access for their restaurant client employees. Visa Direct is a compelling capability because we offer incredible reach to more than 5 billion cards and accounts, global scale, a leading technology stack, world-class security and 24/7/365 reliability. All of which is easy to access through hundreds of partners across our global network of networks, reaching bank accounts through a combination of card, ACH and RTP systems in more than 175 countries. In the B2B new flows opportunity, we expect future growth to have several vectors. Let me just highlight a couple. First, B2B carded issuance in both physical and virtual cards where we have a leading share. This quarter in India, after partnering with leading B2B neobank Open for several years, we signed a deal for credit and debit issuance as well as the implementation of Visa Direct. In virtual card, we're expanding to new verticals. One recent example is health care. And this quarter, we signed an agreement with a direct health care company NoMe Health, a health care provider that serves 30,000 people per day across 10 U.S. states for its claims payment solution. A second vector of B2B growth is large ticket account based cross-border payments through Visa B2B Connect, which links our global payments infrastructure with best-in-class capabilities to address the primary pain points of existing solutions. In Latin America, Visa B2B Connect is available in nearly 30 countries, and we've enrolled partners in more than 1/3 of those countries already. One partner is Banco, a leading bank in Mexico since enabling the solution in March of 2021, the bank has grown Visa B2B Connect volumes double digits every quarter and has processed thousands of payments and hundreds of millions of payments volume. We also recently added Sberbank, the largest bank in Russia, Eastern and Central Europe, which will be live and processing transactions later this year. So to summarize new flows, the opportunity is 10x consumer payments. Our capabilities and value proposition are strong versus the competition, and we expect revenue yield to continue to improve as we scale and grow Visa Direct, especially in cross-border use cases. Now let's move to value-added services. In Q1, revenue grew over 20%, and we expect strong growth to continue. One example is with Visa Consulting and Analytics. In addition to our crypto offerings that I mentioned earlier, we recently launched a specialized global crypto advisory practice to help financial institutions eager to offer customers a crypto solution, retailers who are looking to delve into NFPs or central banks exploring digital currencies. Another example is with the authentication. In Europe, we have tripled the use of Visa's new authentication technology, EMV 3DS since the start of 2021, and this is coincided with a reduction in card present fraud by 28%, and it has also positively impacted the transaction authorization rates. And we are launching new capabilities to build for the future. Visa Acceptance Cloud enables clients to move embedded payment processing software from individual devices to the cloud, eliminating the need for expensive terminals as well as the cost and time to certify the processing software. In addition, clients can access value-added services from fraud management to BNPL. We also recently closed our acquisition of Currency Cloud. We believe the combination of Currency Cloud's APIs on the front end, which provide real-time foreign exchange capabilities and our settlement capabilities across our network of networks. We will have a very compelling value proposition. Together, we can enable new use cases and payment flows particularly as we expand the cross-border use cases, we provide our clients, including B2B Connect and Visa Direct. We can extend our FX platform for easy connect easier connectivity for fintechs and non-financial institution partners, and we can offer real-time FX rates and improve transparency for our partner customers. So to summarize value-added services, we will continue to bring Visa innovation to the payments ecosystem. We are diversifying our revenue mix, and this will help us retain and win business and grow revenue well into the future. In conclusion, as I think about Visa's future, I'm extremely optimistic and energized. While much has been written about new payment types being potentially disruptive to Visa, we see a lot more opportunity than disruption. Our global infrastructure is providing connectivity through our network of networks to power more traditional payment types and newer ways to pay and move money. Our interconnectivity, security, reliability, consumer and fraud protections, risk management and other value-added services offer a superior experience. We expect to attract more and more transactions, which will continue to fuel our growth at an accelerated rate. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant. Well, Darrin, I think, first in the near term, I think the upside is going to come from continued recovery of travel and the affluent customer getting back in the mix of spending at the levels they were pre the pandemic. In terms of sustained longer-term opportunities, I think they come in a number of places. First, e-commerce adoption is going to be very sticky and millions and millions of people around the world went to e-com and for the first time during the pandemic. Continued cash displacement is without question, going to continue. There's just simply more ways to pay, which is going to drive volume. Geographic expansion for us is another area where we're going to get sustained growth over time. And then I think continuing to penetrate both in new flows and the opportunities that we have with Visa Direct, B2B Connect and other areas within B2B, plus our ability as we capture more transactions to be able to sell our value-added services. So I think there's a a good number of levers that we can push that provide terrific growth for us going forward. In terms of your second question, I'll let Vasant weigh in as well. Look, Vasant talked about our updated planning assumption on cross-border where we think we're going to be about 10 points better than our original planning assumption. And certainly, that is going to be helpful for us. As we look ahead, we're going to continue to, I think, be very balanced in our thinking. We're conscious about making sure that our level of investment is at the appropriate levels against the right initiatives to make sure that we are managing the business and being able to fund growth initiatives into the future. But we're also conscious of making sure that we're careful about our expenses as we go forward as well, Darrin. Rayna, it's a couple of points, and it's been consistently that through the entire run of the pandemic. No, I think it was a very complete answer of Visa. The only other factor that you didn't mention relative to ticket sizes is something I said in answering, I think Darrin's question that as the affluent segment, which is the segment that -- who spending went down the most during the that comes back in, obviously, they tend to have higher ticket sizes as well. So, there's a number of factors that drive ticket sizes actually getting to precision on causality and what the different weighting of those different factors are is virtually impossible. Sanjay, I'd say a couple of things. One is that much of the innovation that we have seen is coming in ways to pay. And we're a network that is agnostic to the different ways people want to pay. We're truly a global open network that is willing to embrace fintechs and bigger players who want to introduce new ways for consumers to pay. We're not going to decide who's a winner or a loser. I'm not here to predict how big PNPL will get or crypto will get. I don't know. But I think that our job is to lean in and support them and give them a chance to have their capabilities or there are ways to pay run on our network. Ultimately, the consumer will decide who wins and losses based on the value that they believe that they're seeing as well as the user experience. I also think that the fact of the matter is if you look out over time, open networks win over closed networks. And Visa is a truly open global network with incredible reach and scale. And what ends up happening in any kind of closed situation is that after the initial excitement, initial pop, people run into a wall where it gets much more difficult to scale their businesses. And when somebody comes in and does business with us where we can make our 80 million or really closer to 100 million merchants available to them and help bring scale instantly and prevent people from having to for instance, go merchant-by-merchant in order to scale their business, we can do it much more quickly and much more efficiently for them. So I think that this kind of distinction between how to pay and a network like ours that is enabling multiple ways to pay is a distinction, I think, that people haven't fully appreciated. Well, Lisa, first of all, it's early days with this. Our approach on this is to not charge for it because we think it's extremely valuable for the ecosystem to expand acceptance. And that's really the driving strategic force for us here is to drive acceptance. And certainly, my expectation is that once we can get the transaction on our network will have more opportunity to sell things like value-added services over time. But despite the fact that our network has the 100 million merchant locations, there is still a long tail of merchants around the world that are not accepting. And it's important that we do everything we can to bolster the acceptance footprint that we have around the world. Jason, for as long as I've been involved in payments, there's always been regulatory issues and discussions that take place around the world. So it's really part of being in the business. I do not think there has been any material change in the environment in the last quarter or for that matter in the last year. I do think that the pandemic has helped governments recognize a couple of things though. One is the incredible importance of digitization because at a time when people around the world were locked down, they were able to continue to order food and order items delivered to their house because of digital, the digital payment ecosystem that is reliable and secure around the world. I also think that during this time, governments realize that they should become more digital. And we, during this period, helped a number of governments with the issuance of stimulus money or, in some cases, there was money to recognize the first responders and health care workers and those kinds of things. So I think there's more discussions going on with governments related to digital payments and we're helping them more. I'd also say that they, subject of Central Bank digital currencies, opens up and gives us an opportunity to talk to central bankers who, in many cases, are seeking our counsel as to what they should potentially be able to do. And I think that's because it allows us to have an avenue to potentially talk about other things that they might be contemplating from a regulatory point of view. So I guess, in sum, I'd say, regulatory attention is nothing new. There hasn't been any material change, and we continue to engage thoughtfully and frequently around the world with regulators. Tien-Tsin, the only thing I would add is that I think the -- we also had a very strong holiday period. And as -- based pointed out in his remarks or in answer to one of the questions, we've seen this phenomena of the holiday season stretching, and it's no longer really Black Friday to Christmas Eve. It's really starting early in November, driven by the incredible increase in the adoption of e-commerce. Yes, I'd agree with all of that. And if we look at our growth by certain verticals, incredible growth in home improvement and food and drug and a lot of that, I think, is because there's all kinds of new models. People are buying online and picking up or buying online and getting delivery. A lot of these new ways of shopping and paying is going to help us drive growth in new ways going forward."

            "name": "Vasant Prabhu",
            "content": "Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2022 is off to an excellent start with net revenues up 24% and GAAP EPS up 29%. Non-GAAP EPS adjusted for items, including investment gains and the litigation accrual was up 27%. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was approximately 1 point higher at 25% and non-GAAP EPS approximately 1.5 points higher at over 28%. A few key highlights. We had a very sharp recovery in cross-border travel in October and November as much of the globe ex-China moved to reopen borders or announced timetables to open borders and listed restrictions such as quarantines. As a result, card present and card not present travel, which exited September at an index of 61 to 2019 rose. steeply to hit an index of 72 for the first quarter. Border reopening came sooner than we had anticipated and as we've seen throughout 2021, consumers are very quick to actually. As Omicron hits some border shut and some restrictions were reinstated. However, as we speak, moreover, being reopened, and restrictions lifted, and we expect the travel recovery to resume as we head into February. Payments volumes remained robust through the quarter globally with index for 2019 stepping up relative to the prior quarter by 2 points in the U.S. and 6 points internationally. The credit recovery continued and debit growth remained strong and stable. U.S. holiday retail spending was specifically strong more than 40% over 2019. E-commerce continued to gain share retail spending up 5 point since 2019. The impact of Omicron on domestic volume has been modest. As the Omicron wave affects globally, we expect the impact to ease as it has in market such South Africa and the UK weaker among the first to be helped. Revenue growth was very strong across our three growth engines. Consumer payments and new flows net revenues grew in the mid 20% range and value added services revenues grew over 20%. We significantly stepped up the pace of our stock buybacks during the quarter. We acquired 19.4 million shares for $4.1 billion at an average price of $210. And our Board authorized a new $12 billion stock buyback program in December. Also in late December, we closed the currency cloud transaction. Now on to the details. In constant dollars, Global Payments volume was up 20% year-over-year and 26% versus 2019, each accelerating 3 to 5 points versus the last quarter, led by continued strength in debit as well as improving credit spending. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 22% or 31% higher than 2019 and a 4 to 5-point acceleration from the fourth quarter. U.S. payments volume grew 22%, up 32% over 2019, both higher than Q4. Credit grew 27% and improved 6 points to 23% above 2019, helped by affluent consumer and small business spending. Debit grew 18% year-over-year and remained very strong at 43% about 2019 similar to the last quarter. As you can see, debit spend has remained resilient even as credit recovered. U.S. card presence spend grew 25% and was 17% above 2019, improving 2 points at its highest level yet in the pandemic, driven by fuel, retail and entertainment spending. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 16% and about 2019, similar to last quarter. E-commerce growth remains robust even as card presence spend continues to recover. U.S. retail spending during the holiday season grew double digits and more than 40% of our 2019 levels, both of which are very strong by historical standards. The share of holiday card present retail spending improved a few points from last year, but was still 5 points lower than 2019 as the shift towards e-commerce over the past decade continues. Retail shopping is happening earlier in the holiday season than it used to, which is a trend that started last year. As a result, relative to 2019, November volumes were stronger than December. U.S. holiday spending trends are fairly consistent with other major markets around the world. International constant dollar payments volume, excluding China, grew 22% and was 29% about 2019, improving 7 points from the fourth quarter. A few regional highlights: Latin America was up 44% year-over-year and 66% about 2019, accelerating 8 points from the fourth quarter with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region remained strong, up 31% and 58% from 2019 levels, accelerating 10 points from the fourth quarter, also fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Europe was up 17% and 23% from 2019, improving 3 points from the last quarter due to strong performance across Continental Europe. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region, up 16% both year-over-year and versus 2019, but the recovery is finally underway with an 11-point improvement from Q4, mostly due to relaxed restrictions. The largest improvements were in Australia, India, Southeast Asia and Japan. Global process transactions were up 21% year-over-year and 26% over 2019, 2 points better than the fourth quarter, accelerating less than overall volume growth due to higher ticket sizes. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was up 51% year-over-year and was 1% above 2019 volumes, a 15-point improvement from the fourth quarter. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, continued to strengthen, up 26% year-over-year and 50% above 2019, 7 points higher than the fourth quarter as consumer engagement continues to grow. Cross-border travel-related spending, excluding intra-Europe, grew 102% year-over-year and was 72% of 2019 levels, improving an extraordinary 14 points from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. The recovery in the first two months of the quarter versus 2019 was very fast and broad-based with outbound travel from each of our regions improving more than 10 points relative to 2019 from September to November. Inbound travel to the U.S., Canada, EMEA and Europe, all improved about 20 points during that time, while Latin America and Asia each improved at least 5 points. This recovery was driven by a combination of border openings, the relaxing restrictions and pent-up demand. Countries such as the U.S., Singapore, Thailand, Australia, Chile, Argentina and many more reduced friction for inbound travelers. The U.S. to Europe corridor remained open. This deep travel recovery started to lose momentum in the last week of December as Omicron spread around the globe. We expect this to be short-lived. Moving now to a quick review of first quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 19%, slightly better than the 18% nominal growth in Q4 payments volume, helped by increased utilization of card benefits and small pricing modifications. Data processing revenues grew 19%, slightly below the 21% processed transaction growth, mostly due to exchange rate changes. International transaction revenues were up 50% consistent with nominal cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Other revenues grew 17%, led by consulting, data and marketing services as well as travel-related benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer Payments grew in the mid-20s led by improving cross-border volumes and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows also grew in the mid-20s driven by Visa Direct and the carded B2B recovery. Visa Direct transactions grew 35%. We're lapping very strong quarters from last year, which is moderating U.S. growth rates. Meanwhile, the international business is ramping fast as is growth from use cases such as cross-border remittances earned wage access and marketplace payouts. Commercial or B2B volumes grew 28% year-over-year and up 26% over 2019, a 5-point improvement from the prior quarter, mostly in credit. The growth is helped by share gains and a portfolio of diverse spend categories that is not overly dependent on T&E. Value-added services revenue grew over 20%, led by risk and identity as well as consulting and data services. Growth was driven by new client adoption, increased usage among existing clients and international expansion. Client incentives were 25.1% of gross revenues, about 1 point below our expectations. This was a result of a significantly better revenue mix due to the faster-than-expected recovery of our cross-border business. As our revenue mix continues to normalize with the cross-border recovery, it will help this ratio. GAAP operating expenses grew 24% inclusive of $145 million litigation provision associated with U.S. interchange multi-district litigation case. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 16%, in line with our expectations. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $231 million. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $110 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 19.3% was in line with expectations. Our first quarter tax rate is typically a little lower than the full year rate. GAAP EPS was $1.83. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, up 27% over last year. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buyback, we returned $4.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. A few comments on our trends through the first three weeks of January. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 13%, with debit up 4% and credit up 25%. As you assess these numbers, it is important to remember that there was a government stimulus disbursement, which caused the surge in debit spending in early January 2021. January spend growth versus 2019 was up 40% with debit up a robust 52% and credit up 29%. These trends are relatively consistent with performance in our major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 17% year-over-year, up 37% versus 2019, lagging volume growth due to larger ticket sizes. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis grew 44% year-over-year and was 4% above 2019. Card-not-present non-travel growth remained strong at 67% above 2019, up 17 points from the first quarter. The cross-border travel recovery has stalled since late December due to Omicron, indexing at 72 to 2019, in line with the first quarter. Border reopening, and we expect the recovery to resume in February. Total cross-border volume was 14% above 2019. Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter. Domestic volume growth has stayed robust and stable for the past three quarters. While Omicron has had some recent impact, it has been modest and will ease as the way of crest. This is also the case with e-commerce growth both domestic and cross-border. We are assuming that these trends continue. The swing factor is cross-border travel. As discussed, the cross-border travel recovery was very rapid in October and November as the U.S. border reopened and many countries ease restrictions or announced plans to do so. With Omicron surging, some restrictions were put back in place and some reopening plans were put on hold. However, restrictions are being eased and border reopening. We're assuming the cross-border travel recovery resumes in February. As such, we expect net revenues to grow at the high end of high teens in the second quarter, including over 1 point of exchange rate drag. Incentives should grow at a similar rate as the first quarter, which as a percent of gross revenues will likely be in the 25.5% to 26.5% range based on volumes, renewal activity and cross-border performance. We expect organic non-GAAP operating expenses growth at the high end of mid-teens with some additional investment spend. The inclusion of currency cloud will add another 1.5 points to non-GAAP operating expense growth. Tax rate is expected to come in at the high end of the 19% to 19.5% range. We can also update some of the planning assumptions for the full year we had shared with you in October. Domestic payments volumes and cross-border e-commerce volume as well as the associated transactions are largely in line with expectations. At the end of December, we were running significantly ahead on cross-border travel indexed to 2019 relative to our assumptions in the fall. As such, we are now assuming that the cross-border travel index for 2019, excluding intra-Europe, end the fiscal year 10 points ahead of our prior assumptions are at 90%. Inclusive of intra-Europe travel, this would be back at 2019 levels. With these updated assumptions, net revenue for the full year would grow at the high end of high teens including 1 point of exchange rate drag. Obviously, revenue growth would be higher if the cross-border recovery is more robust in the second half and more akin to what we saw in October and November. With revenue mix improving from higher cross-border volumes, incentives as a percent of gross revenues would range between 25.5% to 26.5% for the year. We expect organic non-GAAP operating expenses growth at the high end of mid-teens. The inclusion of Currencycloud will add another point to non-GAAP operating expense growth. Tax rate is expected to be at the upper end of the 19% to 19.5% range. On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, the impact of Currencycloud is not material for the year. As a reminder, in our non-GAAP numbers, we make adjustments to exclude amortization of intangibles and nonrecurring acquisition-related costs. In summary, FY '22 is off to an excellent start. We expect our growth this year will be well above the pre-COVID rate as cross-border recovers. This will likely continue into fiscal year '23. Beyond that, we are confident the business can sustain a revenue growth rate above pre-COVID levels for three reasons. First, an acceleration away from cash and check for merchant payments both domestic and cross-border as digitization becomes pervasive across consumers and businesses globally; second, acceleration of cash, check and wire transfer displacement as our new flows initiatives penetrate a broad range of new use cases with very large total addressable markets; third, sustainable high-teens growth across our value-added services, both from existing services and new offerings. As new flows and value-added services become a larger part of our revenue mix, growing faster than consumer payments, the sustainable growth rate will continue to rise. We are and will continue to invest in the capabilities required to capture the extraordinary growth opportunity ahead of us. With that, I'll turn this back to Mike. Yes. I mean going back to your question about shareholders and returning cash to shareholders, we did step up our dividend. It's $1.50 per quarter now. We did that last quarter. And then as you saw, we accelerated our stock buybacks. Our stock buyback is programmatic, but when we see opportunities, we step it up. And clearly, our cash flows are better. We felt there was an opportunity and we stepped up. As Al said, I mean our first priority is investing in our core business. There's plenty of opportunity here for growth. Second would be acquisitions that enhance our capabilities like Currencycloud and hopefully soon we close on Tink. And then, of course, we've always been returning cash to shareholders, most of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and buybacks. Sure. In terms of inflation as it relates to our revenues, as you know, our service fees, cross-border, et cetera, are denominated primarily in basis points on ticket size. So to the extent that there's inflation, driving up ticket size, clearly, it's beneficial to us. When it comes to transactions processing, our fees are generally tried to number of transactions. Right now, of course, the size of the basket has gone up. Some of it is because of inflation. Some of it is because it's just gone up through the pandemic. Some of it has to do with the fact that some of the smaller transactions, you've got in a normal world like people going and buying themselves lunch at work or a cup of coffee. We're losing some of those transits. And so that causes ticket size on a mix basis to go up, which will recover, and that will be good for our transactions business. And in general, when people are ordering in through e-commerce, basket sizes have tended to go up. So the basket size increase we see now it's partially inflation, partially it's some elements like the ones I just went through. So net-net, I mean we are a beneficiary of inflation. And in terms of wage inflation, generally speaking, I mean, we expect some everybody is seeing it. But overall, I mean, it's reasonable at this point, and we'll update you as time goes by, if it's more than we expected. Al, I'm sure you have things to add. Going back to your second question on cross-border, I think what's become evident from multiple data points over the last six to nine months, is that when borders open, it's like a switch turning on, the reaction is almost immediate. There's massive pent-up demand and consumers are quick to act. And what we saw in October and November was really the world opening up ex-China. And if it hadn't been for Omicron, that trend was quite extraordinary. Between September and November, we saw a very steep increase in cross-border travel driven by the opening of the U.S. border, the opening up of most borders in Europe. And what we started to see in October was many Asian countries, which have been the most restrictive, excluding China, of course, either open up or announce a timetable for opening up. So that tells you that opening borders, which is something that is hard to predict because governments control it can have a sizable and immediate impact. In terms of your question as to what is our assumption, our assumption is for steady improvement through the year. But we know it won't be steady. I mean there will be periods when borders open, and we could see some sharp improvements. And there may be occasional periods where if there is another variant, there may be some flattening out just as we saw in January. But the bottom line is it is very clear that when borders are open, things will move very fast to normalize. Well, I think the short answer is we fully expect to get back to pre-COVID trend levels, meaning whatever the trend line was, we will get back to that trend line. And at least initially, the mix will be a little different because the part of the business that is growing well above trend is the cross-border business that right now is below trend -- below the trend line is the travel business. The e-commerce business cross-border is clearly one that we think can sustain above trend growth rates relative to pre-COVID. And if the travel business returns only to the pre-COVID growth rates, which we see no reason why it wouldn't, so let's assume it grows above pre-COVID growth rates gets to the trend line and then begins to grow at pre-COVID trend rates. We see no reason why that isn't the case. There is a possibility because of the e-commerce business that the cross-border business in total can grow faster than pre-COVID growth rates after it gets back to the pre-COVID trend line. I assume that is sort of what you were asking. Yes. You're right, Tien-Tsin. I mean, the cross-border outperformance in the first quarter was primarily cross-border, but we also had value-added services performing quite a bit better than we expected. So strong value-add service was also a contributor. So those would be the sort of the two main drivers. As you know, we service -- when payments volumes outperform we booked the revenue with a lag. There was outperformance on payments volumes too, but that doesn't show up in the quarter. It certainly wasn't anywhere on the order of magnitude as our cross-border performance, but there was there's definitely. There would have been higher service revenues had there been no lag. The other part of your question was... Rebates and incentives, yes, we have been saying for a while that those numbers were going up because of the mix change away from cross-border. We thought coming into this quarter that we'd be somewhere in the region of 26% at the low end of the prior range we had. We were a whole point lower entirely because our mix improved because of cross-border and the reduction in the range for the year is also driven by the improvement in the mix since we now expect the cross-border business to be stronger than we had originally expected. Yes. I mean we don't sort of -- no one corridor accounts for a big chunk of our volume. So China opening or not don't have to make specific assumptions on that. We certainly expect some opening in Asia. The big surprise in October before Omicron hit was Asia was opening up faster than we expected. So for example, Thailand pretty much opened up all their resorts. Now they did pause, but they've reopened them again now that the Omicron wave seems to be passing. We saw Singapore announced a phased opening plan, and I believe they're still on track to do that. We even saw Indonesia, India ease restrictions. So more kinds of people can travel to India without -- and Indonesia without quarantines and things like that. China is completely shut and it's hard to predict when it opens. So I would say on balance, we are not counting on a big recovery of the Chinese business. But otherwise, the big swing factor at this point is how quickly Asia opens and how restrictive is it after opening. Yes, I can start, and I'm sure Al will add. I mean, look in the short run the cyclical recovery is by far the biggest driver of the growth. Having said that, I mean, underneath the cyclical recovery, which is most acute right now in cross-border, you can see that other components of the business are not only stable but also growing at an above trend level. So if you look at our payments volumes. Credit is in a recovery mode, but debit is very resilient even as credit recovers and is at a growth rate, if you do a CAGR over the time period pre-pandemic, it's a higher CAGR than it was pre-pandemic. The same is true for e-commerce growth. You could say the same about our value-added services and new flows. So while the biggest driver of short-term growth being above trend is the recovery component. If you look below it, the underlying sustainable and secular growth trends are also about trend relative to where they were pre-pandemic."

And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic loss of life and suffering in Israel and Gaza. We are in constant contact with our teams in Israel and throughout the region, and I have the deepest admiration for their commitment to each other and their clients during this exceptionally challenging time. We continue to monitor the situation, prioritize the safety of our people and stay close to our clients to ensure the continuity of business operations. Turning now to our results. At the beginning of 2023, there was a lot of uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment with fears of a recession. There were many unknowns around FX, volatility, interest rates and inflation. There was also some noise in our growth rates in early 2023 due to the effects of Omicron and the suspension of operations in Russia. Against that backdrop, Visa delivered. Total full fiscal year net revenues grew 11% with GAAP EPS up 18% and non-GAAP EPS up 17%. Credentials grew 7%. We also surpassed 7.5 billion tokens. Total transactions, including cash and payment transactions, were 276 billion, which means that Visa credentials were used, on average, 757 million times a day during the fiscal year. We signed over 500 commercial partnerships with fintechs globally from early-stage companies to growing and mature players, up 25% versus last year. Merchant locations were up 17%, helped by strong growth in Latin America and CEMEA. Global Tap to Pay penetration, excluding the US, grew 5 points from last year to 76% of total face-to-face transactions. And in the US, penetration expanded 13 points to surpass 40%. Global tap to ride transactions were 1.6 billion for the full year 2023, up over 30%, and we added nearly 150 new transit systems throughout the year, such as in Philadelphia and Bangkok, bringing the footprint to more than 750 systems. More than 40% of our transit system launches this year also included our value-added services, Acceptance Solutions. On the new flows side, total revenue grew 17% in constant dollars for the full year. I'll note a few highlights. Total commercial volume was $1.57 trillion, up 12% in constant dollars. We have increased the number of banks that have signed on to Visa B2B Connect by more than 70% this year, and activation continues to happen with the number of transacting banks more than doubling. Visa Direct had 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% year-over-year and nearly 30%, excluding Russia, across 65-plus use cases and over 2,800 programs helped by more than 500 enablers. Cross-border P2P transactions grew 65% year-over-year and reached a new record for payments volume in the fourth quarter. Value-added services revenue grew 18% for the full year in constant dollars. Across our hundreds of products, our top 265 largest clients used 22 products on average, up 8% from last year versus our overall clients who used 11 products on average. With all of this strong momentum and performance, we finished the fourth quarter with net revenue growth of 11% and GAAP EPS growth of 22%. Other highlights from the fourth quarter include the following in constant dollars: global payments volume grew 9%; US payments volume grew 6%; international payments volume grew 11%; cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe grew 18% with cross-border travel up 26% year-over-year; and process transactions were up 10%. Across all our growth levers, we continued to drive progress in innovation and money movement. As I mentioned last quarter, when asked why Visa, our clients tell us they are choosing to deepen and expand their partnerships with us for a number of reasons, including our people, our products, our value-added services, our new flows capabilities and our brand. We continued to see that play out in our fourth quarter. I'll walk through each one and highlight some examples. First, our people. We have the best team in the business, and our clients tell us that they deeply value the advice, local support and partnership from our outstanding teams who are laser-focused on helping our clients grow their businesses. Our clients also appreciate our thoughtful leadership on important and complex industry issues across the ecosystem. An example this quarter was with US Bank, one of the largest issuers in the United States. They have renewed our long-term agreement for their consumer and commercial portfolios. In addition, we are engaging on consulting services and co-marketing projects that include leveraging our NFL sponsorship. Also in the US, we are very pleased to have renewed our long-standing relationship with top 20 US issuer FNBO across consumer, commercial and value-added services. In Brazil, credit unions or cooperatives are fast growing, and we recently reached an expanded relationship with Secovi, whose system spans nearly 340 cooperatives and 7.5 million members. In addition to our people, our payment products and innovations consistently help us win. We are constantly driving innovation and delivering next-generation payment solutions and experiences that enable our clients to better serve their customers and grow their businesses. In terms of our capabilities to serve fintechs, in Colombia, we expanded our partnership with Nequi, the first digital wallet in the country to enable their 17 million-plus account holders for tap to pay with digital credentials. We also provide targeted offerings for certain customers. In India, we are focused on delivering market-leading offerings for affluent customers. With that in mind, we have signed with fintech Appify for a consumer credit offering for high net worth and mass affluent customers. We also recently expanded our acceptance with fintech Razorpay to enable Visa debit cards to purchase mutual funds and securities, offering greater convenience to customers with higher payment success rates versus traditional methods. And in the e-commerce seller space, we renewed our agreement with Shopify for the Balance Card, allowing Shopify's US sellers to access funds from sales by the next business day and receive cashback on everyday business expenses like shipping and marketing. We also signed a new issuing agreement for small business credit. Next, our value-added services are helping us win. They help our clients innovate and grow, provide risk management solutions and drive better outcomes for them and, in turn, for Visa. Our acceptance solutions, including CyberSource, have really resonated with clients this year. We sold more than 2,600 new acceptance services in over 100 countries. In North America, Costco has chosen Visa Acceptance Solutions, including CyberSource, for all of their US and Canadian e-commerce transactions. Alaska Airlines has selected CyberSource to process their kiosk payments in support of their initiative to transform the airport lobby experience. In Asia Pacific, China Merchants Bank, the largest issuer in Mainland China has renewed its consumer and small business portfolios. In addition to our flagship risk management services, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, they will also expand their use of consulting services. Bank of China and Aon Financial Service in Japan have also signed on to use VAA and VRM. In Latin America, we have been focused on expanding our processing penetration as it allows us to offer more value-added services to our customers. In Colombia, we have recently expanded our processing penetration through the addition of four more banks under our strategic agreement with CredibanCo, the market's largest acquirer and issuer processor. This positions us to reach nearly 80% of domestic transactions by the end of FY 2024 from essentially zero in 2019. As part of these agreements, banks have added anywhere from four to 11 value-added services, including risk and acceptance services. As part of our network of networks strategy, we continue to both collaborate with and offer our solutions in the real-time payment space, most recently with FedNow. In Q4, Visa became a certified service provider for FedNow. Using our service, Visa financial institution clients can receive funds in real-time through the FedNow service with origination capabilities to follow. This means that Visa is now processing FedNow payments with the clearinghouse RTP to follow in the next few months. Now on to our new flows capabilities, which are increasingly an important differentiator to our clients. On the B2B side, we are pleased to have reached an expanded long-term global agreement across more than 60 countries with Citibank for their commercial card business, which also encompasses over 20 value-added services. We also recently won the IBM commercial card business spanning T&E, meeting and purchasing card programs in over 60 countries, also with Citibank as the issuer. In Singapore, we renewed our long-standing partnership with DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, to continue offering commercial debit and credit services for consumers and expanded into new commercial products for small businesses. On the Visa Direct side, we continue to expand Visa Direct's reach, especially to wallet endpoints. Most recently, we signed an agreement with Tencent for the Visa Direct cross-border remittance business. This will bring the total wallet reach for Visa Direct to over 2.5 billion. We have expanded our partnership with Paysend from US and UK payments to enable all of Paysend's customers across the globe to send money in real-time to eligible Visa cards across 170 countries and territories. Paysend is also a Currencycloud customer offering compelling cross-border solutions. We also recently renewed with the largest issuer in Korea, Shinhan Card, for consumer and business credit, which also incorporates the provision of our data capabilities in value-added services and the enablement of Visa Direct for cross-border remittances. We have also continued to add new Visa Direct use cases with our partners, such as with small ticket B2B payments and bill pay. In Brazil, Banco RB will enable Visa Direct for low-value, high-velocity cross-border payments as part of their corporate banking business. In the US, payment platform everywhere will be enabling bill payments with Visa Direct. And last but certainly not least, our brand. Visa's brand strength helps deliver added value to our clients and their customers, financial institutions, merchants and partners through a wide range of products and services as well as innovative brand and marketing efforts. We are pleased to have signed an agreement with Universal Destinations and Experiences to be the exclusive payment network for their new co-branded credit card that will be issued by FNBO. In addition, Visa is now the official way to pay at Universal Destinations and Experiences. And together, we will provide compelling benefits to Visa cardholders across their Orlando and Hollywood properties. Also in the US, we have recently renewed the Fidelity Investments co-brand credit portfolio issued by US Bank. And we signed with Coupang, a large retailer with 20 million customers in Korea for their inaugural co-brand card. And in CEMEA, we have signed a Saudi Airlines co-brand with Riyadh Bank, and we renewed our co-brand partnership with Etihad Guest, the loyalty program of Etihad Airways. As we look ahead, we're excited to be activating our brand with clients and partners at the Paris 2024 and Milano-Cortina 2026, Olympic and Paralympic Summer and Winter Games. Since 1986, Visa has been a proud sponsor of the Olympic Movement, which provides an unparalleled opportunity to promote the Visa brand at a regional and global level while also facilitating partnerships and joint business initiatives with clients. The games provide a unique platform for showcasing product innovation and engaging consumers and clients with exclusive experiences. We are looking forward to the upcoming games, and we have been building momentum in the business across Europe with a particular focus on the continent. I'll share a few recent highlights for our European business. On the people front, payments is a local business, and we have expanded into seven new locations over the past five years and have more than doubled our workforce in the market. On innovative products, we have well over 100 fintech relationships and have expanded our capabilities through the acquisitions of Tink and CurrencyCloud. In new flows, Visa Direct has more than 100 enablers and over 1,000 programs with transactions more than doubling over the past two years. And in value-added services, we have increased our client penetration. In VAA alone, the number of clients enrolled in the service has more than doubled since three years ago, and we will be introducing nearly 20 additional products in 2024. We have been steadily building an attractive position on the continent and have built a strong pipeline of signed deals for the future by competing uniquely in each market. Active cards across Continental Europe have grown nearly 50% since 2019. Over the next few years, we expect to migrate more than 40 million cards across nearly 40 clients. And the nature of the portfolios we are winning in Continental Europe tend to include more cross-border volume, resulting in higher yields. So our brand, our capabilities, our people, all of these make a difference for Visa's clients. 2023 had many milestones and solid financial performance. As we are now three weeks into our new fiscal year, I would like to make a few general points, and then Chris will go into more detail. One, there is still macro uncertainty, but just like in fiscal year 2023, I am confident that we can manage through it. Our strategy and focus remain the same: propelling growth across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Two, we are focused on delivering for our stockholders. In that light, I'm sure that you saw that we released an 8-K back in September regarding our potential exchange offer program. We appreciate the dialogue we've had with Class A, B and C stockholders and the board is evaluating next steps as we continue to engage with investors. Finally, you may have seen today that we announced a $25 billion multiyear share repurchase program, which reflects our Board's confidence in our strategy and future potential. I continue to see tremendous opportunity ahead. Visa has the brand, the capabilities, the strategy and, most importantly, the people to propel our growth for years to come. And with that, let me hand it over to Chris.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q4 was another good quarter, closing out a strong fiscal 2023 driven by healthy growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and process transactions and continued solid execution of our strategy, with new flows and value-added services revenue growing faster than consumer payments. I'll first start with a high-level summary of our Q4 performance and then click into more details. Looking at our drivers. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9% year-over-year and process transactions grew 10% year-over-year, both stable to Q3. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe growth was strong, up 18% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenues were up 11% and 10% in constant dollars, with minimal impact from FX, in line with our expectations. GAAP EPS was up 22% and non-GAAP EPS was up 21% in both nominal and constant dollars. Now, on to the details, starting with the US. Payments volume was up 6% year-over-year, stable to Q3. Credit volume grew 6% year-over-year and debit volume grew 7%. Card-present spend grew 3% and US card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9%. US process transactions growth was stable at 8%. Over the course of the quarter, we saw payments volume growth tick up from July to September, primarily driven by sequential improvement in ticket size growth that was mostly led by fuel with higher gas prices and easier year-over-year comparisons as well as a positive days mix impact. Consumer spend across all segments from high to low spend has remained stable since March. Our data did not indicate any behavior change across consumer segments. In international markets, total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars. Payments volume growth rates were strong through the quarter in most major regions with Latin America, CEMEA and Europe ex-UK growing about 20% or more in constant dollars. Now, to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars, excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 18% and up 152% versus 2019. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, grew 9% year-over-year and 173% versus 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, cross-border e-commerce spending grew year-over-year in the low double-digits, in line with pre-COVID growth rates and consistent with the trends we have seen for most of the fiscal year. Cross-border travel-related spend grew 26% year-over-year. The cross-border travel volume index to 2019 increased from 139% in June to 143% in September, totaling 141% for the quarter, a 5-point improvement from Q3. We continued to see healthy travel volume levels in and out of LAC, Europe and CEMEA, ranging from 145% to 165% of 2019 levels. Travel volume into Asia continued to improve, indexing at 128% to 2019 levels for the quarter, up 10 points from Q3, while travel volume out of Asia was up 7 points to 114%. Looking at Mainland China specifically, cross-border travel volume continued to improve but remain below 2019 levels. Travel volume outbound from the US to all geographies continued to be strong in the mid-150s indexed to 2019. US inbound travel recovery accelerated this quarter, pushing the index above 2019 levels for the first time even as the dollar continued to remain strong relative to pre-COVID levels. Now, let's review our fourth quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 12% year-over-year versus the 9% growth in Q3 constant dollar payments volume, primarily due to business mix, pricing and card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 13% versus 10% process transaction growth led by value-added services and pricing. International transaction revenues were up 10% versus the 18% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth lagged volume growth primarily due to declining currency volatility. Other revenues grew 35%, led by pricing, consulting and marketing services, and client incentives grew 20%. Now, let me dive into revenues growth across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by stability in domestic volume growth and process transactions as well as strong growth in cross-border volumes. New flows revenue grew 14% in constant dollars. Commercial volumes were up 9% in constant dollars and up 156% versus 2019. Remember that revenue is recorded based on last quarter's payment volumes growth, which was 9% in constant dollars in Q3. Visa Direct transactions grew 19% and as we mentioned last quarter, were impacted by a client that transitioned its domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system and that was not meaningful to revenue. Value-added services grew 19% in constant dollars, driven primarily by strong advisory services, select pricing actions and higher volume. GAAP operating expenses increased 13%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 9%, primarily due to personnel expenses from growth in headcount, and FX had a nearly 2-point drag. Excluding net gains from our equity investments of $7 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $79 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates. Our GAAP tax rate was 16.9% and non-GAAP was 17% due to a tax benefit related to the extension of the US foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in an indirect tax expense in the operating expense line and a much larger tax benefit in the income tax provision. GAAP EPS was $2.27. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.33, up 21% over last year, inclusive of a little more than 0.5 point of drag from exchange rates. In Q4, we bought back approximately $4.1 billion in stock and distributed $928 million in dividends to our stockholders. We also added $150 million to the litigation escrow account, which has the same effect as a stock buyback. At the end of September, we had $4.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. For the full fiscal year 2023, net revenues increased 11%. GAAP EPS of $8.28 was up 18% and non-GAAP EPS of $8.77 was up 17%, inclusive of an over 2-point drag from exchange rates. Now let's move to fiscal year 2024. Before we share our perspectives on the year, I want to make a few brief comments. In many ways, FY 2024 will be as close to a normal year as we've had in a while. We have fully lapped the Russia and Omicron impacts and overall inflation continues to moderate in many of our markets. As such, we're pleased to resume our pre-COVID guidance practices and will provide our outlook for FY 2024, which we will update each quarter. At the same time, we will no longer be providing the intra-quarter 8-Ks associated with interim driver updates. Now let's look at what we've seen through the first three weeks of October. US payment volume was up 5% with debit and credit both up 5%. The sequential step down from September was primarily driven by the days mix impact in September and declining fuel prices in October. Excluding those two items, payments volume growth was relatively stable from September to October. Reg II has not meaningfully impacted volumes so far. Process transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 19%, and travel-related cross-border volumes were 144% indexed to 2019. Turning now to our key assumptions. As we said consistently, we're not economic forecasters, and so at a macro level, we are assuming no recession in our outlook. We're also not factoring in any impact from Reg II and student loan repayments because as I mentioned before, we've yet to see any meaningful impact. As the year progresses and we gather more information with regard to these assumptions, we will continue to provide updates. For key drivers, we are assuming that the trends we saw in Q4 generally continue throughout the year. Overall payments volume growth and process transaction growth are expected to be in the low double-digits on a year-over-year basis. Cross-border, card-not-present ex travel and ex crypto volume growth will continue to be in the low double-digits year-over-year on a constant dollar basis. Cross-border travel volume, excluding intra-Europe, year-over-year growth will moderate to the low 20s in constant dollars and when compared to 2019 would equate to a 4- to 5-point improvement each quarter. This assumption is driven primarily by improving AP cross-border travel volume mostly from China and, to a lesser extent, improving US inbound travel volume. In terms of what this means for the financials, I'll speak to the numbers on an adjusted basis, which we define as non-GAAP results presented in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts, which you can review in the footnotes in our earnings release and earnings presentation for more detail. Okay. First, let's discuss net revenues. For the full year, we expect low double-digit adjusted net revenue growth. Based on current currency forward curves, FX will be approximately a 1-point drag for the year. We are assuming that currency volatility moderates slightly from Q4 levels but remains relatively stable throughout the year. On a year-over-year basis, incentives are expected to grow slightly less than what we saw in FY 2023. For new flows and value-added services, we continue to expect those to grow faster than consumer payments in FY 2024. Now moving to expenses. Our current plans are to grow adjusted operating expense in the high single-digit to low double-digits with approximately 1.5 points of FX benefit to nominal non-GAAP growth. Non-operating income is expected to be between $250 million and $300 million. The tax rate is expected to be slightly favorable to our typical rate of 19% to 19.5% due to some offsetting factors. On the one hand, we have the impact of tax rate increases in certain countries, which puts our new run rate closer to 19.5% to 20%. However, we also anticipate some onetime tax benefits in the second half related to the resolution of certain tax matters. In total, this will put us between 18.5% and 19% for the full fiscal year. Putting all this together, we expect full year adjusted EPS growth in the low teens with about 0.5 point of FX drag to nominal non-GAAP growth. Also FY 2024 will likely be a tale of two halves with variability in our growth rate from the first half to the second half. A few aspects to keep in mind. First, cross-border volume ex intra-Europe grew 31% year-over-year in the first half of FY 2023 and 20% in the second half. Second, recall that we had relatively high currency volatility in the first half of FY 2023, and it moderated considerably in the second half. Third, incentives were 16% higher in the second half of FY 2023 versus the first half due primarily to deal timing and client performance. As a result, we expect overall adjusted net revenue growth to be lower in the first half than in the second half of FY 2024. This will also be the case on a nominal basis, even with a slightly larger FX headwind in the second half of FY 2024 than the first half. On the expense side, as Ryan mentioned, this is an Olympics year, and we expect Q2 and Q3 expense to have the largest percentage increases as we ramp. But adjusted operating expense growth and the FX impact will roughly be the same in both half. The tax rate is expected to be lower in the second half than the first due to the anticipated onetime tax benefits I mentioned. So for the first quarter specifically, given the variables I just described, Q1 is expected to have the lowest adjusted year-over-year net revenues growth rate with an improving trend throughout the year, and Q4 is expected to be at the highest adjusted growth rate. We expect first quarter net revenues growth in the upper mid to high single digits on an adjusted basis. A few factors to keep in mind. Again, one, currency volatility was the highest in Q1 of 2023; two, cross-border volume grew 31% in Q1 of 2023; and three, Q1 2023 other revenue was strong due to FIFA World Cup related value-added services revenue, and incentives were lower than expected due to client performance and other items. Adjusted operating expense growth is expected to be in the high single digits, driven by headcount growth and salary increases. We anticipate approximately 0.5 point FX headwind to nominal net revenues growth and approximately 1.5 point benefit to nominal non-GAAP expense growth. The tax rate is expected to be closer to a new run rate of between 19.5% and 20% in Q1. This puts first quarter adjusted EPS growth in the upper mid-single digits with minimal impact from FX. Keep in mind that the adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results presented in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. And non-GAAP expenses and EPS exclude acquisition related items and the litigation provision for the first quarter of 2023. For FY 2024, the estimated results exclude approximately $20 million or $0.01 of acquisition-related costs and approximately $40 million or $0.02 from the amortization of acquired intangibles. And finally, moving to capital return. As Ryan said, the Board has authorized a $25 billion multiyear share repurchase program and increased our quarterly dividend by 16%. In summary, Visa's underlying business continues to be healthy and stable and the growth opportunities are significant. While there continue to be macro uncertainties, we feel confident in our ability to manage the business through a changing environment and deliver value for our stockholders. And now, Jennifer, let's move to Q&A.\nJennifer Como: Thanks Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hey guys. Thanks for the time and congrats on the quarter. Just when thinking about your guidance for the fiscal year ahead, it's good to see the constant currency double-digit growth rate. So, I just want to make sure we understand the inputs and how you think about structural growth as far as some of the inputs like value-added services, new flows? So, number one, I mean, maybe you can give us a little more color on what you're assuming for some of those -- some of the VAS and new flows growth potential? And then more importantly, do you believe that's the right algorithm medium term? Is the structural growth of this company sustainably yet at the same 10% to 12% rate it's been or has anything changed?\nChris Suh: Hi Darrin, yes, let me address that. This is Chris. So, yes, a couple of things I'll say about the FY 2024 guide. First, the underlying drivers, as we shared, both payments volume and process transactions will be growing in the low double-digits, which is very consistent and reflects the stable business trends that we see in the underlying drivers. I also said on the call commentary that we do expect VAS, value-added services, and new flows to continue to be our growth engine, growing faster than the consumer payments part of the business. And so I think that structure, which you described, is consistent in many ways to 2023, and that's what we certainly expect to see in 2024.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Koning: Yes, thanks so much. Good job. And I guess two quick ones. Asia-Pacific constant currency volume growth was 4%, a little lower than normal. Maybe you could dive into that. And then tax rate longer term, basically in the out years, 19.5% to 20%, that's how we should think about it? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Hey Dave, I'll talk about Asia and maybe put it in the context of what we're seeing around the world, and then Chris, you can take the tax rate. Just to answer your question specifically on Asia, as you said, growth ex-China slowed four points from Q3. There's a couple of things going on there. One is we're lapping some strong COVID ramp in Q4 of 2022, but we're also seeing a little softness in a couple of places, notably Australia, what I'd point you to. If you guys just kind of back up and look at that in kind of the bigger picture, what are we seeing around the world, outside of Asia, it sounds like you've looked at the numbers and you would have seen we're seeing resiliency. Outside of North America and Asia, if you look at Europe ex-UK, Latin America, CEMEA, most of these regions are growing at around 20% or more. So, we feel good about what's happening there. On the tax rate, Chris, I'll turn it over to you the long-term tax rate.\nChris Suh: Yes, sure. Hi, Dave. Yes, I do think that's the right way to think about it. At least based on what we know now, the new run rate, we would put at about 19.5% to 20%. It does -- it is related to how our tax -- the mix of our tax jurisdictions around the world and certain tax increases in certain parts of the world. As we talked about in the next fiscal year, we'll be below that due to some of the benefits that we anticipate in the second half of the year. But based on what we know today, the new run rate is as you estimated.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good to see the 19% growth in Visa Direct transactions, and in particular, the 65% growth in cross-border P2P transactions year-over-year. As we look to FY 2024, what are some of the biggest, most promising new use cases you're working on for Visa Direct?\nRyan McInerney: Hey, David. Cross-border remittances is a big one. Since you called that out, I'll highlight it. And I mentioned, I think, on this call and some others, the work we're doing with Paysend and Shinhan and things we're doing around the world we've mentioned in previous calls with some of the both kind of traditional and fintech remittance players. 65% year-over-year growth is strong and continue to invest behind that with new partners and try to drive further growth going forward. We're focused on bill payments. We're focused on earned wage access. We're focused on insurance disbursements. We continue to focus on P2P more broadly in new geographies around the world, both domestic and cross-border. If you just back up, I've said this, I think, on previous calls. I believe at this point in time, Visa Direct is the largest at-scale money movement network on the planet. We have made investments consistently year-over-year to get to a point where we now have 8.5 billion endpoints, 3 billion cards, 3 billion accounts with some of the news I announced in my prepared remarks, 2.5 billion digital wallets. And we'll continue to invest in expanding the network even further. But now we've got the ability to work with enablers around the world, sell new use cases in and put this network to work. And we're going to continue to do that and look forward to hopefully talking to you about more good results to come.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. You guys had a lot of great commentary on commercial and B2B progress and deal wins in the quarter. Can you just give us a broader update on your commercial strategy? Where do you see the bigger opportunities there going forward?\nRyan McInerney: Yes, thanks. It was -- we did have some really good commercial wins in the quarter. I'd put it in a couple of different buckets. One is we're looking to expand our partnerships, right? So I mentioned Citi and IBM this quarter. I mentioned SAP last quarter. And we're just -- we're having good success building and expanding those partnerships around the world. Second thing we're focused on is expanding verticals. You've heard us talk about government, travel, fleet and fuel. I talked about agro, I think, last quarter, working and selling into marketplaces, like I mentioned, healthcare. So taking these products, innovating, creating new use cases and delivering them into new verticals. And then just making the products easier to use. Yesterday, we announced that actually we had a new product to make it easier to accept virtual cards. We call it virtual card acceptance platform. Virtual cards are a preferred acceptance of many suppliers, but they're not as easy to accept as sometimes we'd like them to be. So putting new platforms out to make the core products like virtual cards easier to use. And then continuing to invest in the partnerships that we've announced over the last couple of years. WEX is a great example of a partner that we announced a couple of years ago that we've invested in and growing in and really getting to see some of the benefits of that around the world. So, I guess the last thing I would say, Ramsey, is just also taking these products more broadly around the world. In so many different countries outside of the most developed markets that we work in, there's opportunity to get some of the basic products into the hands of small businesses, for example. In a lot of countries we're doing business, there's still a lot of small businesses that are actually using consumer products instead of the more sophisticated advanced small business products, let alone the large and middle market products that we can get out there. So, more partners, more use cases, more verticals, more countries, we'll continue to invest in that business.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nWill Nance: Hi guys. Appreciate taking the question. You had some interesting commentary around processing market share gains. Wondering if you could just give us kind of a state of the union of where you stand with that. And if there's any geographies that are kind of top of mind as opportunities to increase processing share, what would those be? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yes, sure. I mean, we're very focused on processing share for a couple of reasons, but the one I noted in my prepared remarks is a very important one, which is we can deliver more of our value-added services when we're actually processing the transaction. Obviously, we earn more yield when we process the transaction as well, just on the core processing of it. But the ability to serve our clients more effectively, deliver them our risk capabilities, our issuing capabilities, our loyalty capabilities and those types of things are enhanced when we actually process the transaction. So, we spend a lot of time on it. I think we've made very good progress over the last many years. I mentioned Colombia in my prepared remarks, and Colombia is a good use case. In a lot of these markets, to really unlock the processing, we have to work with the local processor, which we did in Colombia and then worked with the clients to get them on that processor. They will then test out the transaction, see how they're working and ultimately move those transactions to VisaNet, which we like. We've been very focused in Latin America. We've made some good strides in several different countries in Latin America, and I think we continue to have opportunity in Latin America. We're making strides in Europe, and we'll continue to focus on processing opportunities in several of the different countries that have local schemes in Europe as well as some places in Asia-Pacific. So, those are some of the opportunities we have, Will. Thanks.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Good afternoon everybody. Just want to circle back on the travel component of cross-border and how you're thinking about that in the coming year. I can appreciate, as you guys have often said, you're not necessarily economic forecasters. But can you just repeat for us what your underlying assumption is for the coming year? And then maybe give a little bit of color on inputs of how you're arriving at that expectation and target for the year? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Let me give some context on how we think about just cross-border travel in general, and then, Chris, you can add and/or fill in the blanks on the assumptions that we've made for the year. Here's how we think about it. In and out of Asia, we still have yet to normalize. So, as Chris alluded to or said in his prepared remarks, we have opportunity to continue to catch up to pre-COVID travel levels in and out of Asia. There's also the opportunity to still catch up into the United States. But more broadly around the world, I would say we've got to normalize in terms of cross-border travel. But I think what's interesting is we've normalized at a growth rate higher than pre-pandemic levels. People are traveling international at this new normal at a faster rate than they would have been, all else equal, before the pre-COVID level. So in a couple of quarters, we still have an opportunity to catch up to what would be normalized levels. Around the rest of the corners around the world, I think we've normalized but at higher growth rates than we saw pre-COVID. Do you want to mention the numbers for the year?\nChris Suh: Sure. The only thing I'd really add and I covered a lot of the assumptions in the call commentary. The thing that I might just emphasize is that it is pretty healthy growth. And if you look at what we've shared in terms of what we expect the index to grow at four to five points a quarter, I think that does reflect what Ryan said, which is normalized in many cases and continuing to be elevated growth.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJamie Friedman: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Ryan, in your prepared remarks, you called out CyberSource. I know it's a very important asset for you and always has been. But why is -- am I inferring that there's an increased cadence in the business? And if so, why would that be? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yeah. As I said, Jamie, in my prepared remarks, we're seeing great strong client demand around the world for CyberSource. Why? I think it's a result of a lot of the investments we've made in the platform over the last several years. We've been very purposeful about investing in our omni-commerce capabilities for CyberSource. We've been very purposeful in investing in our tokenization capabilities, our risk management and fraud prevention capabilities. And a lot of that has been driven by sitting down with our clients and partners, understanding their road maps, understanding what they needed us to deliver, making those investments and then having success growing with our partners. And in any given market around the world, when clients start adopting the CyberSource platform and others look around at the success they're having with authorization rates or transaction success or others, that leads to new opportunities, and we've had the ability to sell into those. So thanks for the question.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I have a question on Reg II. Chris, you mentioned no impact yet and also caveated the outlook. I'm just wondering, is there anything that gives you pause there? And then, Ryan, anything you guys are doing proactively to get in front of any adverse impacts? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Why don't I talk just contextually about Reg II and then you can answer anything else on Sanjay's question? So two things going on, obviously, with Reg II, let's just talk about them both. One is the change that was made last summer that went into effect with regards to routing in the e-comm space. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks there, we haven't seen any meaningful impact. Having said that, there's a lot of work happening around the ecosystem and we're out there talking to clients and partners about our products and our value propositions, making sure they understand the benefits of a Visa transaction, especially in the e-commerce space, where often the merchant holds the fraud liability. So our sales teams are in with merchant clients and acquire clients day in and day out, explaining the value of our product, showing them the value of our products. And going forward, we feel good about our ability to compete. The second thing that's going on with Reg II that I'm sure people would have seen is the Fed has announced that they're going to, I think it's tomorrow, announce some changes potentially to the debit interchange rate in the US. We don't know what they're going to say. We'll obviously follow it very closely. And when they do publish something, we'll take a look and see if it merits a response on our behalf. And just as a reminder, interchange is the exchange value between the merchant and the issuer. And I think what's notable about our business model is we've proven that we can be resilient and have a strong business in regulated interchange markets, not regulated interchange markets, in markets that have higher regulated interchange and lower regulated interchange. So, as you alluded to, a lot going on in the US with Reg II, but we're all over it and we feel good about our ability to compete.\nChris Suh: Yes, and I'll just add on from a guidance perspective. Hopefully, we're very clear on the call, we have not seen any meaningful impact thus far, and therefore, haven't included any impact of that in our FY 2024 guidance. But it is early days and there's a lot going on, as Ryan described at length, and so we'll keep you posted as things evolve in the coming months.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question around tokenization and the implications for just broader-based authorization rate improvements, and this is not just like domestic but like international. It just feels like a lot of your partners are able to drive higher authorization rates as a result of the token. So, I'm just wondering how you're viewing that in the context of being able to drive incremental transactions back to Visa? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yes, thanks for the question. Just for a reminder for everyone, tokenization is technology that we use that essentially helps protect issuers, merchants and consumers, and to your question, ultimately, drives higher authorizations and lower fraud. I think I said in my prepared remarks, we crossed 7.5 billion tokens as of the end of September. We're in 198 markets. I think we have 14 billion token transactions in the fourth quarter, which is growing at like 60%. So, this is another example of a platform and a service that we invested in over many years and we're now scaling broadly around the world. To your question, we are. We're seeing, on average, somewhere between 4% and 5% higher approval rates across our partners. And we also see it with a reduction in fraud -- a 30% reduction in fraud. So, you say, why do we have 7.5 billion tokens that are now out there in the ecosystem? Well, if you're one of our partners, as you said, and you can reduce your fraud rates 30% and drive your auth rates four or five percentage points, that is a great opportunity. That's higher sales, that's lower fraud, that's better customer experience. And we continue to invest in that platform as well. We see a lot of benefits to our issuers, to our consumers who ultimately use the products. You'll see more from us enhancing the platform in terms of using the Fido biometrics and enabling merchants to be able to authorize and authenticate customers across multiple devices and those types of things. So, yes, higher auth, lower fraud. We love the platform, continue to invest in it.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTrevor Williams: Great. Thanks a lot. Chris, I wanted to clarify on incentives within the guide. I think you said you're assuming slightly slower growth than in fiscal 2023. Just want to make sure, is that year-over-year growth in dollars or as a percentage of gross revenue? And then just the second part to that. You're framing this as a more normal year. Should we be interpreting that as meaning all else equal, a normal year incentive should be going up kind of plus or minus 100 basis points as a percentage of gross revenue? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Hi, Jeff [ph]. Yeah, let me try to clarify a bit. As I said, 2024 is, in many ways, a normal year. It's still normalizing in some aspects, but in many ways, it is normalizing. And as a result, we've made some changes. We've returned to pre-COVID practices on a number of fronts. We provided formal guidance as you went through -- as we went through in detail, and we talked about on this call, for the full year and next quarter, and we'll continue that practice. And that guidance is on net revenue guide specifically and directional commentary about the growth in incentives, which to your specific question, it is a dollar year-over-year growth rate that we said will grow slower in 2024 relative to 2023. Importantly, this is very, very consistent and it's aligned with how we think about the business, how we manage the business going forward. We haven't guided on the percentage, which is the other part of your question because, again, this is consistent with how we manage the business. The thing that we do track very importantly is that we look at the yield across our net revenue yield specifically, and that's remained very stable, and that's very consistent again with how we think about deal economics.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks. I'm actually at Money20/20, is really good energy here. I'm curious, Ryan, if you'd characterize the deal pipeline as being any different than what it was a year ago. How does that feel to you? And if you don't mind me asking just on the credential side, I think you said up 7%. I'm curious same thing, is pipeline there to support that same high single digit growth in fiscal 2024, credentials? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Hi, Tien-Tsin. Glad there's great energy at Money20/20, and I hope my Visa team members that are there are serving clients, finding sales opportunities growing our business. Yeah, we see a great pipeline. We really do with clients issuing, fintechs, co-brands, with opportunities to grow credentials. I mentioned some of the new things on my prepared remarks. And we're having good success. I think just some of the wins on the call, whether it's Citi or US Bank, FNBO, Fidelity, Shinhan, China Merchants Bank, Shopify, I mean, list goes on, right? IBM, DBS, Etihad, Saudi. We feel good about the pipeline. We feel good about the way our teams are out there serving clients around the world. We feel good about the wins that we have and feel good about the growth that it's generating.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Hi, Ryan. Hi, Chris. Congratulations on the quarter. Questions on open banking, CFPB obviously proposed a rule to jump-start competition, shift to open banking a few days back. You guys have dealt with open banking frameworks outside the US in many different geographies. Just kind of curious how that translates in terms of products, in terms of acquisitions you made like Tink, Pismo and so on, to bring that over to the US?\nRyan McInerney: Thanks for the question. I think the CFPB rule that they put out is good for Americans. I think it's great for clarifying the structure and the regulatory framework here in America. I think it's likely to be a catalyst for growth of open banking in the United States, is it gives clarity to all the various different players in the ecosystem. If you think about it, like, it's a great opportunity for Americans to be able to put their own data to work in different types of digital tools that will help their own personal financial management, help them manage their financial lives better, get a better view of their finances across multiple different providers. And then to your point, we've seen different regulatory frameworks in different markets around the world. Our Tink business continues to perform very well in Europe, which obviously was one of the leaders in terms of establishing a regulatory framework for open banking. And we look forward to the opportunity to bring Tink outside of Europe. So when we look at the proposed rules here in the US, we welcome that because we want to understand what the regulatory expectations are so that we can build a business that will thrive and serve our clients and serve consumers effectively. So thanks for the question.\nJennifer Como: Last question, Jordan\nOperator: Our final question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon. As you're looking into the next fiscal year and beyond, I want to ask about the cash digitization opportunity in your growth to drive [ph] business. As you know, this is always a persistent question for Visa investors and thinking about it again, given the pandemic moving forward and during inflation tailwinds. So how are you thinking about the runway especially segmenting it between developed markets and also EM a little bit more competition? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. Thanks for the question. We continue to be excited about the cash, check digitization opportunity around the world. We continue to digitize cash and check around the world, and economies continue to grow around the world. So I think continues to surprise many people when they look at developed markets like the United States, how much cash and check still exists. And certainly, when you look to the developing world, how much cash and checks still exist. So we continue to be excited about the runway. We think it offers us tremendous growth opportunity. And we're going to continue to work with our partners across the ecosystem to get more credentials into consumers' hands, get more acceptance out there in the ecosystem, especially among micro and nano merchants and work with our partners to drive more activation and usage among the credentials and feel good about that entire algorithm.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Chris Suh",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q4 was another good quarter, closing out a strong fiscal 2023 driven by healthy growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and process transactions and continued solid execution of our strategy, with new flows and value-added services revenue growing faster than consumer payments. I'll first start with a high-level summary of our Q4 performance and then click into more details. Looking at our drivers. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9% year-over-year and process transactions grew 10% year-over-year, both stable to Q3. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe growth was strong, up 18% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenues were up 11% and 10% in constant dollars, with minimal impact from FX, in line with our expectations. GAAP EPS was up 22% and non-GAAP EPS was up 21% in both nominal and constant dollars. Now, on to the details, starting with the US. Payments volume was up 6% year-over-year, stable to Q3. Credit volume grew 6% year-over-year and debit volume grew 7%. Card-present spend grew 3% and US card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9%. US process transactions growth was stable at 8%. Over the course of the quarter, we saw payments volume growth tick up from July to September, primarily driven by sequential improvement in ticket size growth that was mostly led by fuel with higher gas prices and easier year-over-year comparisons as well as a positive days mix impact. Consumer spend across all segments from high to low spend has remained stable since March. Our data did not indicate any behavior change across consumer segments. In international markets, total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars. Payments volume growth rates were strong through the quarter in most major regions with Latin America, CEMEA and Europe ex-UK growing about 20% or more in constant dollars. Now, to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars, excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 18% and up 152% versus 2019. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, grew 9% year-over-year and 173% versus 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, cross-border e-commerce spending grew year-over-year in the low double-digits, in line with pre-COVID growth rates and consistent with the trends we have seen for most of the fiscal year. Cross-border travel-related spend grew 26% year-over-year. The cross-border travel volume index to 2019 increased from 139% in June to 143% in September, totaling 141% for the quarter, a 5-point improvement from Q3. We continued to see healthy travel volume levels in and out of LAC, Europe and CEMEA, ranging from 145% to 165% of 2019 levels. Travel volume into Asia continued to improve, indexing at 128% to 2019 levels for the quarter, up 10 points from Q3, while travel volume out of Asia was up 7 points to 114%. Looking at Mainland China specifically, cross-border travel volume continued to improve but remain below 2019 levels. Travel volume outbound from the US to all geographies continued to be strong in the mid-150s indexed to 2019. US inbound travel recovery accelerated this quarter, pushing the index above 2019 levels for the first time even as the dollar continued to remain strong relative to pre-COVID levels. Now, let's review our fourth quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 12% year-over-year versus the 9% growth in Q3 constant dollar payments volume, primarily due to business mix, pricing and card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 13% versus 10% process transaction growth led by value-added services and pricing. International transaction revenues were up 10% versus the 18% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth lagged volume growth primarily due to declining currency volatility. Other revenues grew 35%, led by pricing, consulting and marketing services, and client incentives grew 20%. Now, let me dive into revenues growth across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by stability in domestic volume growth and process transactions as well as strong growth in cross-border volumes. New flows revenue grew 14% in constant dollars. Commercial volumes were up 9% in constant dollars and up 156% versus 2019. Remember that revenue is recorded based on last quarter's payment volumes growth, which was 9% in constant dollars in Q3. Visa Direct transactions grew 19% and as we mentioned last quarter, were impacted by a client that transitioned its domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system and that was not meaningful to revenue. Value-added services grew 19% in constant dollars, driven primarily by strong advisory services, select pricing actions and higher volume. GAAP operating expenses increased 13%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 9%, primarily due to personnel expenses from growth in headcount, and FX had a nearly 2-point drag. Excluding net gains from our equity investments of $7 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $79 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates. Our GAAP tax rate was 16.9% and non-GAAP was 17% due to a tax benefit related to the extension of the US foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in an indirect tax expense in the operating expense line and a much larger tax benefit in the income tax provision. GAAP EPS was $2.27. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.33, up 21% over last year, inclusive of a little more than 0.5 point of drag from exchange rates. In Q4, we bought back approximately $4.1 billion in stock and distributed $928 million in dividends to our stockholders. We also added $150 million to the litigation escrow account, which has the same effect as a stock buyback. At the end of September, we had $4.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. For the full fiscal year 2023, net revenues increased 11%. GAAP EPS of $8.28 was up 18% and non-GAAP EPS of $8.77 was up 17%, inclusive of an over 2-point drag from exchange rates. Now let's move to fiscal year 2024. Before we share our perspectives on the year, I want to make a few brief comments. In many ways, FY 2024 will be as close to a normal year as we've had in a while. We have fully lapped the Russia and Omicron impacts and overall inflation continues to moderate in many of our markets. As such, we're pleased to resume our pre-COVID guidance practices and will provide our outlook for FY 2024, which we will update each quarter. At the same time, we will no longer be providing the intra-quarter 8-Ks associated with interim driver updates. Now let's look at what we've seen through the first three weeks of October. US payment volume was up 5% with debit and credit both up 5%. The sequential step down from September was primarily driven by the days mix impact in September and declining fuel prices in October. Excluding those two items, payments volume growth was relatively stable from September to October. Reg II has not meaningfully impacted volumes so far. Process transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 19%, and travel-related cross-border volumes were 144% indexed to 2019. Turning now to our key assumptions. As we said consistently, we're not economic forecasters, and so at a macro level, we are assuming no recession in our outlook. We're also not factoring in any impact from Reg II and student loan repayments because as I mentioned before, we've yet to see any meaningful impact. As the year progresses and we gather more information with regard to these assumptions, we will continue to provide updates. For key drivers, we are assuming that the trends we saw in Q4 generally continue throughout the year. Overall payments volume growth and process transaction growth are expected to be in the low double-digits on a year-over-year basis. Cross-border, card-not-present ex travel and ex crypto volume growth will continue to be in the low double-digits year-over-year on a constant dollar basis. Cross-border travel volume, excluding intra-Europe, year-over-year growth will moderate to the low 20s in constant dollars and when compared to 2019 would equate to a 4- to 5-point improvement each quarter. This assumption is driven primarily by improving AP cross-border travel volume mostly from China and, to a lesser extent, improving US inbound travel volume. In terms of what this means for the financials, I'll speak to the numbers on an adjusted basis, which we define as non-GAAP results presented in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts, which you can review in the footnotes in our earnings release and earnings presentation for more detail. Okay. First, let's discuss net revenues. For the full year, we expect low double-digit adjusted net revenue growth. Based on current currency forward curves, FX will be approximately a 1-point drag for the year. We are assuming that currency volatility moderates slightly from Q4 levels but remains relatively stable throughout the year. On a year-over-year basis, incentives are expected to grow slightly less than what we saw in FY 2023. For new flows and value-added services, we continue to expect those to grow faster than consumer payments in FY 2024. Now moving to expenses. Our current plans are to grow adjusted operating expense in the high single-digit to low double-digits with approximately 1.5 points of FX benefit to nominal non-GAAP growth. Non-operating income is expected to be between $250 million and $300 million. The tax rate is expected to be slightly favorable to our typical rate of 19% to 19.5% due to some offsetting factors. On the one hand, we have the impact of tax rate increases in certain countries, which puts our new run rate closer to 19.5% to 20%. However, we also anticipate some onetime tax benefits in the second half related to the resolution of certain tax matters. In total, this will put us between 18.5% and 19% for the full fiscal year. Putting all this together, we expect full year adjusted EPS growth in the low teens with about 0.5 point of FX drag to nominal non-GAAP growth. Also FY 2024 will likely be a tale of two halves with variability in our growth rate from the first half to the second half. A few aspects to keep in mind. First, cross-border volume ex intra-Europe grew 31% year-over-year in the first half of FY 2023 and 20% in the second half. Second, recall that we had relatively high currency volatility in the first half of FY 2023, and it moderated considerably in the second half. Third, incentives were 16% higher in the second half of FY 2023 versus the first half due primarily to deal timing and client performance. As a result, we expect overall adjusted net revenue growth to be lower in the first half than in the second half of FY 2024. This will also be the case on a nominal basis, even with a slightly larger FX headwind in the second half of FY 2024 than the first half. On the expense side, as Ryan mentioned, this is an Olympics year, and we expect Q2 and Q3 expense to have the largest percentage increases as we ramp. But adjusted operating expense growth and the FX impact will roughly be the same in both half. The tax rate is expected to be lower in the second half than the first due to the anticipated onetime tax benefits I mentioned. So for the first quarter specifically, given the variables I just described, Q1 is expected to have the lowest adjusted year-over-year net revenues growth rate with an improving trend throughout the year, and Q4 is expected to be at the highest adjusted growth rate. We expect first quarter net revenues growth in the upper mid to high single digits on an adjusted basis. A few factors to keep in mind. Again, one, currency volatility was the highest in Q1 of 2023; two, cross-border volume grew 31% in Q1 of 2023; and three, Q1 2023 other revenue was strong due to FIFA World Cup related value-added services revenue, and incentives were lower than expected due to client performance and other items. Adjusted operating expense growth is expected to be in the high single digits, driven by headcount growth and salary increases. We anticipate approximately 0.5 point FX headwind to nominal net revenues growth and approximately 1.5 point benefit to nominal non-GAAP expense growth. The tax rate is expected to be closer to a new run rate of between 19.5% and 20% in Q1. This puts first quarter adjusted EPS growth in the upper mid-single digits with minimal impact from FX. Keep in mind that the adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results presented in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. And non-GAAP expenses and EPS exclude acquisition related items and the litigation provision for the first quarter of 2023. For FY 2024, the estimated results exclude approximately $20 million or $0.01 of acquisition-related costs and approximately $40 million or $0.02 from the amortization of acquired intangibles. And finally, moving to capital return. As Ryan said, the Board has authorized a $25 billion multiyear share repurchase program and increased our quarterly dividend by 16%. In summary, Visa's underlying business continues to be healthy and stable and the growth opportunities are significant. While there continue to be macro uncertainties, we feel confident in our ability to manage the business through a changing environment and deliver value for our stockholders. And now, Jennifer, let's move to Q&A. Hi Darrin, yes, let me address that. This is Chris. So, yes, a couple of things I'll say about the FY 2024 guide. First, the underlying drivers, as we shared, both payments volume and process transactions will be growing in the low double-digits, which is very consistent and reflects the stable business trends that we see in the underlying drivers. I also said on the call commentary that we do expect VAS, value-added services, and new flows to continue to be our growth engine, growing faster than the consumer payments part of the business. And so I think that structure, which you described, is consistent in many ways to 2023, and that's what we certainly expect to see in 2024. Yes, sure. Hi, Dave. Yes, I do think that's the right way to think about it. At least based on what we know now, the new run rate, we would put at about 19.5% to 20%. It does -- it is related to how our tax -- the mix of our tax jurisdictions around the world and certain tax increases in certain parts of the world. As we talked about in the next fiscal year, we'll be below that due to some of the benefits that we anticipate in the second half of the year. But based on what we know today, the new run rate is as you estimated. Sure. The only thing I'd really add and I covered a lot of the assumptions in the call commentary. The thing that I might just emphasize is that it is pretty healthy growth. And if you look at what we've shared in terms of what we expect the index to grow at four to five points a quarter, I think that does reflect what Ryan said, which is normalized in many cases and continuing to be elevated growth. Yes, and I'll just add on from a guidance perspective. Hopefully, we're very clear on the call, we have not seen any meaningful impact thus far, and therefore, haven't included any impact of that in our FY 2024 guidance. But it is early days and there's a lot going on, as Ryan described at length, and so we'll keep you posted as things evolve in the coming months. Hi, Jeff [ph]. Yeah, let me try to clarify a bit. As I said, 2024 is, in many ways, a normal year. It's still normalizing in some aspects, but in many ways, it is normalizing. And as a result, we've made some changes. We've returned to pre-COVID practices on a number of fronts. We provided formal guidance as you went through -- as we went through in detail, and we talked about on this call, for the full year and next quarter, and we'll continue that practice. And that guidance is on net revenue guide specifically and directional commentary about the growth in incentives, which to your specific question, it is a dollar year-over-year growth rate that we said will grow slower in 2024 relative to 2023. Importantly, this is very, very consistent and it's aligned with how we think about the business, how we manage the business going forward. We haven't guided on the percentage, which is the other part of your question because, again, this is consistent with how we manage the business. The thing that we do track very importantly is that we look at the yield across our net revenue yield specifically, and that's remained very stable, and that's very consistent again with how we think about deal economics."

            "name": "Ryan McInerney",
            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic loss of life and suffering in Israel and Gaza. We are in constant contact with our teams in Israel and throughout the region, and I have the deepest admiration for their commitment to each other and their clients during this exceptionally challenging time. We continue to monitor the situation, prioritize the safety of our people and stay close to our clients to ensure the continuity of business operations. Turning now to our results. At the beginning of 2023, there was a lot of uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment with fears of a recession. There were many unknowns around FX, volatility, interest rates and inflation. There was also some noise in our growth rates in early 2023 due to the effects of Omicron and the suspension of operations in Russia. Against that backdrop, Visa delivered. Total full fiscal year net revenues grew 11% with GAAP EPS up 18% and non-GAAP EPS up 17%. Credentials grew 7%. We also surpassed 7.5 billion tokens. Total transactions, including cash and payment transactions, were 276 billion, which means that Visa credentials were used, on average, 757 million times a day during the fiscal year. We signed over 500 commercial partnerships with fintechs globally from early-stage companies to growing and mature players, up 25% versus last year. Merchant locations were up 17%, helped by strong growth in Latin America and CEMEA. Global Tap to Pay penetration, excluding the US, grew 5 points from last year to 76% of total face-to-face transactions. And in the US, penetration expanded 13 points to surpass 40%. Global tap to ride transactions were 1.6 billion for the full year 2023, up over 30%, and we added nearly 150 new transit systems throughout the year, such as in Philadelphia and Bangkok, bringing the footprint to more than 750 systems. More than 40% of our transit system launches this year also included our value-added services, Acceptance Solutions. On the new flows side, total revenue grew 17% in constant dollars for the full year. I'll note a few highlights. Total commercial volume was $1.57 trillion, up 12% in constant dollars. We have increased the number of banks that have signed on to Visa B2B Connect by more than 70% this year, and activation continues to happen with the number of transacting banks more than doubling. Visa Direct had 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% year-over-year and nearly 30%, excluding Russia, across 65-plus use cases and over 2,800 programs helped by more than 500 enablers. Cross-border P2P transactions grew 65% year-over-year and reached a new record for payments volume in the fourth quarter. Value-added services revenue grew 18% for the full year in constant dollars. Across our hundreds of products, our top 265 largest clients used 22 products on average, up 8% from last year versus our overall clients who used 11 products on average. With all of this strong momentum and performance, we finished the fourth quarter with net revenue growth of 11% and GAAP EPS growth of 22%. Other highlights from the fourth quarter include the following in constant dollars: global payments volume grew 9%; US payments volume grew 6%; international payments volume grew 11%; cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe grew 18% with cross-border travel up 26% year-over-year; and process transactions were up 10%. Across all our growth levers, we continued to drive progress in innovation and money movement. As I mentioned last quarter, when asked why Visa, our clients tell us they are choosing to deepen and expand their partnerships with us for a number of reasons, including our people, our products, our value-added services, our new flows capabilities and our brand. We continued to see that play out in our fourth quarter. I'll walk through each one and highlight some examples. First, our people. We have the best team in the business, and our clients tell us that they deeply value the advice, local support and partnership from our outstanding teams who are laser-focused on helping our clients grow their businesses. Our clients also appreciate our thoughtful leadership on important and complex industry issues across the ecosystem. An example this quarter was with US Bank, one of the largest issuers in the United States. They have renewed our long-term agreement for their consumer and commercial portfolios. In addition, we are engaging on consulting services and co-marketing projects that include leveraging our NFL sponsorship. Also in the US, we are very pleased to have renewed our long-standing relationship with top 20 US issuer FNBO across consumer, commercial and value-added services. In Brazil, credit unions or cooperatives are fast growing, and we recently reached an expanded relationship with Secovi, whose system spans nearly 340 cooperatives and 7.5 million members. In addition to our people, our payment products and innovations consistently help us win. We are constantly driving innovation and delivering next-generation payment solutions and experiences that enable our clients to better serve their customers and grow their businesses. In terms of our capabilities to serve fintechs, in Colombia, we expanded our partnership with Nequi, the first digital wallet in the country to enable their 17 million-plus account holders for tap to pay with digital credentials. We also provide targeted offerings for certain customers. In India, we are focused on delivering market-leading offerings for affluent customers. With that in mind, we have signed with fintech Appify for a consumer credit offering for high net worth and mass affluent customers. We also recently expanded our acceptance with fintech Razorpay to enable Visa debit cards to purchase mutual funds and securities, offering greater convenience to customers with higher payment success rates versus traditional methods. And in the e-commerce seller space, we renewed our agreement with Shopify for the Balance Card, allowing Shopify's US sellers to access funds from sales by the next business day and receive cashback on everyday business expenses like shipping and marketing. We also signed a new issuing agreement for small business credit. Next, our value-added services are helping us win. They help our clients innovate and grow, provide risk management solutions and drive better outcomes for them and, in turn, for Visa. Our acceptance solutions, including CyberSource, have really resonated with clients this year. We sold more than 2,600 new acceptance services in over 100 countries. In North America, Costco has chosen Visa Acceptance Solutions, including CyberSource, for all of their US and Canadian e-commerce transactions. Alaska Airlines has selected CyberSource to process their kiosk payments in support of their initiative to transform the airport lobby experience. In Asia Pacific, China Merchants Bank, the largest issuer in Mainland China has renewed its consumer and small business portfolios. In addition to our flagship risk management services, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, they will also expand their use of consulting services. Bank of China and Aon Financial Service in Japan have also signed on to use VAA and VRM. In Latin America, we have been focused on expanding our processing penetration as it allows us to offer more value-added services to our customers. In Colombia, we have recently expanded our processing penetration through the addition of four more banks under our strategic agreement with CredibanCo, the market's largest acquirer and issuer processor. This positions us to reach nearly 80% of domestic transactions by the end of FY 2024 from essentially zero in 2019. As part of these agreements, banks have added anywhere from four to 11 value-added services, including risk and acceptance services. As part of our network of networks strategy, we continue to both collaborate with and offer our solutions in the real-time payment space, most recently with FedNow. In Q4, Visa became a certified service provider for FedNow. Using our service, Visa financial institution clients can receive funds in real-time through the FedNow service with origination capabilities to follow. This means that Visa is now processing FedNow payments with the clearinghouse RTP to follow in the next few months. Now on to our new flows capabilities, which are increasingly an important differentiator to our clients. On the B2B side, we are pleased to have reached an expanded long-term global agreement across more than 60 countries with Citibank for their commercial card business, which also encompasses over 20 value-added services. We also recently won the IBM commercial card business spanning T&E, meeting and purchasing card programs in over 60 countries, also with Citibank as the issuer. In Singapore, we renewed our long-standing partnership with DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, to continue offering commercial debit and credit services for consumers and expanded into new commercial products for small businesses. On the Visa Direct side, we continue to expand Visa Direct's reach, especially to wallet endpoints. Most recently, we signed an agreement with Tencent for the Visa Direct cross-border remittance business. This will bring the total wallet reach for Visa Direct to over 2.5 billion. We have expanded our partnership with Paysend from US and UK payments to enable all of Paysend's customers across the globe to send money in real-time to eligible Visa cards across 170 countries and territories. Paysend is also a Currencycloud customer offering compelling cross-border solutions. We also recently renewed with the largest issuer in Korea, Shinhan Card, for consumer and business credit, which also incorporates the provision of our data capabilities in value-added services and the enablement of Visa Direct for cross-border remittances. We have also continued to add new Visa Direct use cases with our partners, such as with small ticket B2B payments and bill pay. In Brazil, Banco RB will enable Visa Direct for low-value, high-velocity cross-border payments as part of their corporate banking business. In the US, payment platform everywhere will be enabling bill payments with Visa Direct. And last but certainly not least, our brand. Visa's brand strength helps deliver added value to our clients and their customers, financial institutions, merchants and partners through a wide range of products and services as well as innovative brand and marketing efforts. We are pleased to have signed an agreement with Universal Destinations and Experiences to be the exclusive payment network for their new co-branded credit card that will be issued by FNBO. In addition, Visa is now the official way to pay at Universal Destinations and Experiences. And together, we will provide compelling benefits to Visa cardholders across their Orlando and Hollywood properties. Also in the US, we have recently renewed the Fidelity Investments co-brand credit portfolio issued by US Bank. And we signed with Coupang, a large retailer with 20 million customers in Korea for their inaugural co-brand card. And in CEMEA, we have signed a Saudi Airlines co-brand with Riyadh Bank, and we renewed our co-brand partnership with Etihad Guest, the loyalty program of Etihad Airways. As we look ahead, we're excited to be activating our brand with clients and partners at the Paris 2024 and Milano-Cortina 2026, Olympic and Paralympic Summer and Winter Games. Since 1986, Visa has been a proud sponsor of the Olympic Movement, which provides an unparalleled opportunity to promote the Visa brand at a regional and global level while also facilitating partnerships and joint business initiatives with clients. The games provide a unique platform for showcasing product innovation and engaging consumers and clients with exclusive experiences. We are looking forward to the upcoming games, and we have been building momentum in the business across Europe with a particular focus on the continent. I'll share a few recent highlights for our European business. On the people front, payments is a local business, and we have expanded into seven new locations over the past five years and have more than doubled our workforce in the market. On innovative products, we have well over 100 fintech relationships and have expanded our capabilities through the acquisitions of Tink and CurrencyCloud. In new flows, Visa Direct has more than 100 enablers and over 1,000 programs with transactions more than doubling over the past two years. And in value-added services, we have increased our client penetration. In VAA alone, the number of clients enrolled in the service has more than doubled since three years ago, and we will be introducing nearly 20 additional products in 2024. We have been steadily building an attractive position on the continent and have built a strong pipeline of signed deals for the future by competing uniquely in each market. Active cards across Continental Europe have grown nearly 50% since 2019. Over the next few years, we expect to migrate more than 40 million cards across nearly 40 clients. And the nature of the portfolios we are winning in Continental Europe tend to include more cross-border volume, resulting in higher yields. So our brand, our capabilities, our people, all of these make a difference for Visa's clients. 2023 had many milestones and solid financial performance. As we are now three weeks into our new fiscal year, I would like to make a few general points, and then Chris will go into more detail. One, there is still macro uncertainty, but just like in fiscal year 2023, I am confident that we can manage through it. Our strategy and focus remain the same: propelling growth across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Two, we are focused on delivering for our stockholders. In that light, I'm sure that you saw that we released an 8-K back in September regarding our potential exchange offer program. We appreciate the dialogue we've had with Class A, B and C stockholders and the board is evaluating next steps as we continue to engage with investors. Finally, you may have seen today that we announced a $25 billion multiyear share repurchase program, which reflects our Board's confidence in our strategy and future potential. I continue to see tremendous opportunity ahead. Visa has the brand, the capabilities, the strategy and, most importantly, the people to propel our growth for years to come. And with that, let me hand it over to Chris. Hey Dave, I'll talk about Asia and maybe put it in the context of what we're seeing around the world, and then Chris, you can take the tax rate. Just to answer your question specifically on Asia, as you said, growth ex-China slowed four points from Q3. There's a couple of things going on there. One is we're lapping some strong COVID ramp in Q4 of 2022, but we're also seeing a little softness in a couple of places, notably Australia, what I'd point you to. If you guys just kind of back up and look at that in kind of the bigger picture, what are we seeing around the world, outside of Asia, it sounds like you've looked at the numbers and you would have seen we're seeing resiliency. Outside of North America and Asia, if you look at Europe ex-UK, Latin America, CEMEA, most of these regions are growing at around 20% or more. So, we feel good about what's happening there. On the tax rate, Chris, I'll turn it over to you the long-term tax rate. Hey, David. Cross-border remittances is a big one. Since you called that out, I'll highlight it. And I mentioned, I think, on this call and some others, the work we're doing with Paysend and Shinhan and things we're doing around the world we've mentioned in previous calls with some of the both kind of traditional and fintech remittance players. 65% year-over-year growth is strong and continue to invest behind that with new partners and try to drive further growth going forward. We're focused on bill payments. We're focused on earned wage access. We're focused on insurance disbursements. We continue to focus on P2P more broadly in new geographies around the world, both domestic and cross-border. If you just back up, I've said this, I think, on previous calls. I believe at this point in time, Visa Direct is the largest at-scale money movement network on the planet. We have made investments consistently year-over-year to get to a point where we now have 8.5 billion endpoints, 3 billion cards, 3 billion accounts with some of the news I announced in my prepared remarks, 2.5 billion digital wallets. And we'll continue to invest in expanding the network even further. But now we've got the ability to work with enablers around the world, sell new use cases in and put this network to work. And we're going to continue to do that and look forward to hopefully talking to you about more good results to come. Yes, thanks. It was -- we did have some really good commercial wins in the quarter. I'd put it in a couple of different buckets. One is we're looking to expand our partnerships, right? So I mentioned Citi and IBM this quarter. I mentioned SAP last quarter. And we're just -- we're having good success building and expanding those partnerships around the world. Second thing we're focused on is expanding verticals. You've heard us talk about government, travel, fleet and fuel. I talked about agro, I think, last quarter, working and selling into marketplaces, like I mentioned, healthcare. So taking these products, innovating, creating new use cases and delivering them into new verticals. And then just making the products easier to use. Yesterday, we announced that actually we had a new product to make it easier to accept virtual cards. We call it virtual card acceptance platform. Virtual cards are a preferred acceptance of many suppliers, but they're not as easy to accept as sometimes we'd like them to be. So putting new platforms out to make the core products like virtual cards easier to use. And then continuing to invest in the partnerships that we've announced over the last couple of years. WEX is a great example of a partner that we announced a couple of years ago that we've invested in and growing in and really getting to see some of the benefits of that around the world. So, I guess the last thing I would say, Ramsey, is just also taking these products more broadly around the world. In so many different countries outside of the most developed markets that we work in, there's opportunity to get some of the basic products into the hands of small businesses, for example. In a lot of countries we're doing business, there's still a lot of small businesses that are actually using consumer products instead of the more sophisticated advanced small business products, let alone the large and middle market products that we can get out there. So, more partners, more use cases, more verticals, more countries, we'll continue to invest in that business. Yes, sure. I mean, we're very focused on processing share for a couple of reasons, but the one I noted in my prepared remarks is a very important one, which is we can deliver more of our value-added services when we're actually processing the transaction. Obviously, we earn more yield when we process the transaction as well, just on the core processing of it. But the ability to serve our clients more effectively, deliver them our risk capabilities, our issuing capabilities, our loyalty capabilities and those types of things are enhanced when we actually process the transaction. So, we spend a lot of time on it. I think we've made very good progress over the last many years. I mentioned Colombia in my prepared remarks, and Colombia is a good use case. In a lot of these markets, to really unlock the processing, we have to work with the local processor, which we did in Colombia and then worked with the clients to get them on that processor. They will then test out the transaction, see how they're working and ultimately move those transactions to VisaNet, which we like. We've been very focused in Latin America. We've made some good strides in several different countries in Latin America, and I think we continue to have opportunity in Latin America. We're making strides in Europe, and we'll continue to focus on processing opportunities in several of the different countries that have local schemes in Europe as well as some places in Asia-Pacific. So, those are some of the opportunities we have, Will. Thanks. Let me give some context on how we think about just cross-border travel in general, and then, Chris, you can add and/or fill in the blanks on the assumptions that we've made for the year. Here's how we think about it. In and out of Asia, we still have yet to normalize. So, as Chris alluded to or said in his prepared remarks, we have opportunity to continue to catch up to pre-COVID travel levels in and out of Asia. There's also the opportunity to still catch up into the United States. But more broadly around the world, I would say we've got to normalize in terms of cross-border travel. But I think what's interesting is we've normalized at a growth rate higher than pre-pandemic levels. People are traveling international at this new normal at a faster rate than they would have been, all else equal, before the pre-COVID level. So in a couple of quarters, we still have an opportunity to catch up to what would be normalized levels. Around the rest of the corners around the world, I think we've normalized but at higher growth rates than we saw pre-COVID. Do you want to mention the numbers for the year? Yeah. As I said, Jamie, in my prepared remarks, we're seeing great strong client demand around the world for CyberSource. Why? I think it's a result of a lot of the investments we've made in the platform over the last several years. We've been very purposeful about investing in our omni-commerce capabilities for CyberSource. We've been very purposeful in investing in our tokenization capabilities, our risk management and fraud prevention capabilities. And a lot of that has been driven by sitting down with our clients and partners, understanding their road maps, understanding what they needed us to deliver, making those investments and then having success growing with our partners. And in any given market around the world, when clients start adopting the CyberSource platform and others look around at the success they're having with authorization rates or transaction success or others, that leads to new opportunities, and we've had the ability to sell into those. So thanks for the question. Why don't I talk just contextually about Reg II and then you can answer anything else on Sanjay's question? So two things going on, obviously, with Reg II, let's just talk about them both. One is the change that was made last summer that went into effect with regards to routing in the e-comm space. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks there, we haven't seen any meaningful impact. Having said that, there's a lot of work happening around the ecosystem and we're out there talking to clients and partners about our products and our value propositions, making sure they understand the benefits of a Visa transaction, especially in the e-commerce space, where often the merchant holds the fraud liability. So our sales teams are in with merchant clients and acquire clients day in and day out, explaining the value of our product, showing them the value of our products. And going forward, we feel good about our ability to compete. The second thing that's going on with Reg II that I'm sure people would have seen is the Fed has announced that they're going to, I think it's tomorrow, announce some changes potentially to the debit interchange rate in the US. We don't know what they're going to say. We'll obviously follow it very closely. And when they do publish something, we'll take a look and see if it merits a response on our behalf. And just as a reminder, interchange is the exchange value between the merchant and the issuer. And I think what's notable about our business model is we've proven that we can be resilient and have a strong business in regulated interchange markets, not regulated interchange markets, in markets that have higher regulated interchange and lower regulated interchange. So, as you alluded to, a lot going on in the US with Reg II, but we're all over it and we feel good about our ability to compete. Yes, thanks for the question. Just for a reminder for everyone, tokenization is technology that we use that essentially helps protect issuers, merchants and consumers, and to your question, ultimately, drives higher authorizations and lower fraud. I think I said in my prepared remarks, we crossed 7.5 billion tokens as of the end of September. We're in 198 markets. I think we have 14 billion token transactions in the fourth quarter, which is growing at like 60%. So, this is another example of a platform and a service that we invested in over many years and we're now scaling broadly around the world. To your question, we are. We're seeing, on average, somewhere between 4% and 5% higher approval rates across our partners. And we also see it with a reduction in fraud -- a 30% reduction in fraud. So, you say, why do we have 7.5 billion tokens that are now out there in the ecosystem? Well, if you're one of our partners, as you said, and you can reduce your fraud rates 30% and drive your auth rates four or five percentage points, that is a great opportunity. That's higher sales, that's lower fraud, that's better customer experience. And we continue to invest in that platform as well. We see a lot of benefits to our issuers, to our consumers who ultimately use the products. You'll see more from us enhancing the platform in terms of using the Fido biometrics and enabling merchants to be able to authorize and authenticate customers across multiple devices and those types of things. So, yes, higher auth, lower fraud. We love the platform, continue to invest in it. Hi, Tien-Tsin. Glad there's great energy at Money20/20, and I hope my Visa team members that are there are serving clients, finding sales opportunities growing our business. Yeah, we see a great pipeline. We really do with clients issuing, fintechs, co-brands, with opportunities to grow credentials. I mentioned some of the new things on my prepared remarks. And we're having good success. I think just some of the wins on the call, whether it's Citi or US Bank, FNBO, Fidelity, Shinhan, China Merchants Bank, Shopify, I mean, list goes on, right? IBM, DBS, Etihad, Saudi. We feel good about the pipeline. We feel good about the way our teams are out there serving clients around the world. We feel good about the wins that we have and feel good about the growth that it's generating. Thanks for the question. I think the CFPB rule that they put out is good for Americans. I think it's great for clarifying the structure and the regulatory framework here in America. I think it's likely to be a catalyst for growth of open banking in the United States, is it gives clarity to all the various different players in the ecosystem. If you think about it, like, it's a great opportunity for Americans to be able to put their own data to work in different types of digital tools that will help their own personal financial management, help them manage their financial lives better, get a better view of their finances across multiple different providers. And then to your point, we've seen different regulatory frameworks in different markets around the world. Our Tink business continues to perform very well in Europe, which obviously was one of the leaders in terms of establishing a regulatory framework for open banking. And we look forward to the opportunity to bring Tink outside of Europe. So when we look at the proposed rules here in the US, we welcome that because we want to understand what the regulatory expectations are so that we can build a business that will thrive and serve our clients and serve consumers effectively. So thanks for the question. Yes. Thanks for the question. We continue to be excited about the cash, check digitization opportunity around the world. We continue to digitize cash and check around the world, and economies continue to grow around the world. So I think continues to surprise many people when they look at developed markets like the United States, how much cash and check still exists. And certainly, when you look to the developing world, how much cash and checks still exist. So we continue to be excited about the runway. We think it offers us tremendous growth opportunity. And we're going to continue to work with our partners across the ecosystem to get more credentials into consumers' hands, get more acceptance out there in the ecosystem, especially among micro and nano merchants and work with our partners to drive more activation and usage among the credentials and feel good about that entire algorithm."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Visa\u2019s fiscal third quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; Vasant Prabhu, Visa\u2019s Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Suh, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Designate. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC\u2019s website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today\u2019s earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our financial performance in the third quarter of 2023 was strong, with net revenues up 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was $2.16, up 9%. Overall, our global quarterly payments volume was up 9% year-over-year. In the U.S., quarterly payments volume was up 6%, as expected, primarily due to moderating inflation. Outside the U.S., international payments volume was up 12%. Excluding intra-Europe, total cross-border volume remained strong, up 22%, with cross-border travel volume at 136% of 2019. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. As I mentioned on our previous earnings call, my priorities are focused on doing everything that we can to accelerate our growth by executing our strategy, including supporting our go-to-market teams, delivering for our clients, shipping innovative products even faster and selling our solutions even more effectively. With those priorities in mind, I would like to review our progress across our three growth levers: consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. We continue to make great strides growing and expanding our consumer payments business, winning with new and existing clients and shifting volume to Visa from a wide array of local, regional and global competitors around the world. Our clients tell us they\u2019re choosing to deepen and expand their partnerships with us for a number of reasons, including our people, our products, our value-added services, our new flows and our brand. I\u2019ll share a few examples. First, our people. We consistently hear from our clients that they deeply value the advice, local support and partnership they receive day in and day out from our outstanding team members around the world. They also appreciate our thoughtful industry leadership on important and complicated issues across the ecosystem. In fact, in our latest global Net Promoter Score survey, our clients rated us at 73. In the U.S., we retained our position of serving 8 of the top 10 credit unions by recently renewing one of the largest players in the space, Pentagon Federal Credit Union. While there are many reasons for our success with PenFed, our people and our local market relationship model made the difference, just like it has for over 350 U.S. community bank and credit union renewals this year to date. Payments is a local business, and our priority to invest locally with great talent has paid off. For example, across Eastern Europe, Intesa Sanpaolo will issue Visa debit in Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia representing over 3 million Visa credentials. Second, our payment products and innovations consistently help us win. Our clients tell us they choose Visa because our innovative products help ensure they are delivering leading-edge payment solutions to their customers. For example, in Korea, we recently renewed our partnership with Hyundai Card. As part of our new partnership, Hyundai will be taking advantage of our digital payment solutions like data and analytics services to launch a series of new innovations. Hyundai will grow their share of Visa cards in credit and debit for consumer and business. Our innovation also comes from targeted value propositions in traditional products, and we are very pleased to have signed a new long-term partnership with the NatWest Group for consumer debit and credit. Third, our value-added services are helping us win in consumer payments. Our value-added services, such as consulting and analytics, AI-driven data solutions, risk solutions and processing, are a critical differentiator that helps our clients innovate and grow, often without having to use their most scarce resources: technology and engineering. For example, Rakuten Card, a subsidiary of Rakuten Group, which operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in Japan, has signed a new credit deal with Visa to further their strategy to become a top global player. As part of our partnership, Rakuten Card will utilize Visa\u2019s processing capabilities and dedicated Visa consulting, data science and analytics teams to support them on strategic initiatives. Fourth, our new flows capabilities. Increasingly, our new flows capabilities such as Visa Direct are an important differentiator to our clients when they\u2019re making consumer payments decisions. A great example is Cash App, with 53 million monthly transacting actives, Cash App has renewed and expanded agreement globally, encompassing card issuance, Visa Direct and value-added services. And last, but certainly not least, our brand. In many cases, our clients ask their customers, which brand do you prefer? Would you spend more if we issued this brand or that brand? And our clients consistently tell us that consumers overwhelmingly prefer Visa. We see this particularly play out with co-brands. For example, for many of the largest airline co-brands in the world, we remain a partner of choice, and we recently renewed with Korean Air and signed a new agreement with Breeze Airways. We also won a co-brand portfolio with Allegiant Travel Company, the parent company of Allegiant Air. In addition, in Latin America, we expanded our relationship with LifeMiles, Avianca\u2019s frequent flyer program from our existing portfolios in 9 countries with 18 issuing banks to an additional 4 countries in the Caribbean region. And finally, we signed a co-brand agreement with Indian conglomerate, Adani, serving 400 million customers through retail, airports and online travel services, among others. Let me now turn to new flows, again, with a focus on how effectively we are delivering on our priorities. Total new flows revenue was up 20% in constant dollars. Commercial volumes increased 9% in constant dollars to total $405 billion. In terms of how we go to market, we are focused on adding commercial products to our existing consumer relationships. KBank, a leading bank in Thailand, has renewed its relationship across debit and co-brand as well as signing a new deal to launch a new business debit card to serve SMEs and micro businesses. PagSeguro, a key Brazilian fintech client, already leveraging our consumer credit and prepaid and commercial prepaid products will expand in the commercial space with the launch of Visa Business Credit for their base of 28 million clients. As we do in the consumer space, we are also constantly working with commercial clients as a strategic partner to develop and deploy unique and innovative solutions. A recent example is with SAP, the global market leader in enterprise application software, which has signed a deal with us across multiple countries in Asia Pacific. We will integrate Visa\u2019s virtual card and business solution payment provider capabilities into SAP\u2019s business technology platform. SAP serves more than 46,000 customers across Asia-Pacific. This deal will create an embedded finance solution for their customers to make B2B payments, helping to improve their working capital positions and enhance their supply chains. For Visa Direct, third quarter transactions grew 20% and were $1.8 billion. In Latin America, we had a bank client transition its onus domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system. And while it could be impactful to our transactions over the next several quarters, the impact to revenue is expected to be minimal. At the same time, for their other transactions, this client will continue to utilize our interoperability capabilities provided by YellowPepper. I am very excited about Visa Direct, particularly as we enter new markets and increase our cross-border presence. Recently, we have expanded or entered several key markets, including in France, with Lydia, the leading P2P provider with over 7 million users. We renewed our issuance relationship, and we have signed a Visa Direct deal to enable their users to top up their wallets using an eligible card. In Bolivia, with fintech lib\u00e9lula\u2019s new app called Lula, Visa Direct will be enabling domestic P2P transactions within the app, and YellowPepper will be providing alias directory services. In Mexico, with fintech Alchemy Pay, Visa Direct will enable B2B cross-border supplier payments for thousands of SME clients in industries, including textiles, software, hardware and electronics across multiple corridors. And we\u2019ve also continued to expand corridors with important cross-border partners. For example, Revolut, with over 30 million users, has expanded its remittance service with Visa Direct to 89 markets after just launching in July of 2022. Similarly, TransferGo, a cross-border provider in the UK, serving 6 million customers, have expanded its Visa Direct-enabled corridors from 32 in 2020 to over 160. New flows continue to be an important part of Visa\u2019s growth story and our teams are effectively selling and activating our solutions. Now I will touch on value-added services. Our go-to-market approach remains focused on three growth areas: deepening client penetration of existing products, expanding geographically and building and launching new solutions. Unlike our core business, our growth in value-added services is often driven by selling a larger number of smaller solutions. This quarter, we succeeded in selling more than 300 new issuing services, 600 new acceptance services and almost 500 new risk and identity services, in some cases, even within the same client. Our sales teams continue to work day in and day out with our clients to understand and resolve their pain points and realize new growth opportunities. Altogether, in the third quarter, we generated $1.8 billion in value-added services revenue, up 19% in constant dollars. A couple of examples of new value-added services to highlight this quarter. First, our partnership with Pay.UK, the account-to-account payments operator in the UK was recently announced. We will be piloting our new fraud capability, RTP Prevent, which is uniquely built for instant payments with deep learning AI models. Using RTP Prevent, we can provide a risk score in real time so banks can decide whether to approve or reject the transaction on an RTP network. This is a great example of building and deploying entirely new solutions and our network of network strategy. Second, our recent announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire cloud native issuer processing and core banking platform, Pismo. We believe that Pismo will allow us to strategically serve our clients through additional capabilities, with core banking ledger and issuer processing through cloud-native APIs; additional geographies with operations in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe; and additional products with credit, debit, prepaid and commercial cards as well as connections to local networks, including PICs in Brazil. From a network perspective, issuer processing and core banking have become important elements to support issuers, activate card credentials and distribute value-added services. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and approvals and is expected to close by the end of 2023. To wrap up, over the last few months, I have traveled across the globe meeting with clients, partners and regulators, and I continue to see enormous opportunity and momentum. Our brand capabilities, innovation and partnership approach continue to position us well for Visa\u2019s future growth, but the most important aspect is our people. And with that in mind, I would like to welcome the newest member of our executive team, Chris Suh, who will become Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer on August 1. Chris brings to Visa more than 25 years of finance leadership experience from global high-growth companies. His deep experience in finance and technology, plus his leadership in growing and scaling businesses, will be extraordinarily valuable to us as we continue to drive growth and better serve our clients and customers around the world. Plus, as I am sure you will soon learn, Chris is a real hands-on business builder with a passion for technology and an intense focus on people who will fit in well with the culture of Visa. I\u2019ve asked Chris to join the Q&A portion of our call today, but please remember he isn\u2019t our CFO for a few more days. Before the Q&A, let me hand it over to Vasant to provide financial highlights for the quarter and our thoughts on the rest of the year. But first, Vasant, I know I speak on behalf of all of Visa and our investors that we are deeply grateful to you for your outstanding strategic and financial leadership. I have worked shoulder to shoulder with Vasant for the past 8 years, and I continue to be in awe of him. He is a world class CFO. And if there is a CFO Hall of Fame, I am confident he will be a first ballot inductee. Vasant, we wish you all the best. So for likely the last time on an earnings call in your career, over to you, Vasant.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon everyone. Fiscal third quarter net revenues were up 12% and GAAP EPS, up 25%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 9%. In constant dollars, net revenues grew 13%, and non-GAAP EPS grew 11%. We have now lapped the impact of Russia. A few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9%. Index to 2019, global payments volume was up 48%. U.S. payments volume was up 6% year-over-year, consistent with expectations and stable since March. Transactions growth has remained steady at pre-COVID levels of 8%. Average ticket size is down 2%, largely due to declining fuel prices and the general moderation of inflation across multiple categories. Relative to 2019, U.S. payments volume was up 54%. International payments volume growth was up 12%. The uptick in international payments volume since the last quarter is the result of lapping the discontinuation of Russian operations. Relative to 2019, international payments volume was up 43%. The cross-border travel recovery continues at the pace we expected with volume ex intra-Europe indexing at 1.36 versus 4 years ago, a 6 point improvement from the second quarter. Summer travel across most regions picked up, with travel in and out of Asia seeing strong gains, along with travel inbound to CEMEA and outbound from Europe. Travel into the U.S. is still hovering at 2019 levels. Our new flows and value-added services businesses continued to grow at almost 20% in constant dollars. In the third quarter, we bought back approximately $3 billion in stock at an average cost of $229.19 and distributed $937 million in dividends. We also added $500 million to the litigation escrow account, which has the same effect as a stock buyback. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 5% year-over-year. Debit grew 6%, generally in line with March growth rates post the uptick in January and February due to lapping of Omicron in 2022. U.S. card present spend grew 3%. Adjusted for fuel, which saw a significant price increase last year, U.S. card presence spend was up 5%. U.S. card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 8%. U.S. processed transactions growth was stable at 8%. The step-down in U.S. payments volume growth since March was driven by a 2% decline in average ticket size. When we look at spend by category, ticket sizes are declining most significantly in fuel and, to a lesser extent, in retail goods, travel and food and drug. As you know, fuel prices spiked last year due to the Ukraine war. Travel prices spiked as the world reopened post Omicron. Goods prices spiked due to supply chain bottlenecks and commodity inflation. Excluding these four categories average ticket size growth is positive. Consumer spend across all spend bands from affluent to low spend remained stable since March. Our data did not indicate any behavior change across consumer segments. Putting all this together, we continue to believe that the primary driver of the step-down in U.S. payments volume growth since March is moderating inflation and that the consumer has remained resilient so far. Moving on to international markets. In constant dollars, international payments volume growth rates were strong through the quarter in the major markets. Latin America was up 20%. Our CEMEA region grew 28%. We\u2019re now lapping the impact of Russia. Europe was up 10%. Excluding the UK, Europe volumes grew 23%. Asia Pacific, excluding China, grew 12%. Global process transactions were up 10%. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, were up 22% year-over-year, up 49% versus 4 years ago. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 9% year-over-year and 74% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, cross-border e-commerce spending grew year-over-year in the low double digits, in line with pre-COVID growth rates. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 34% year-over-year. The cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe index to 4 years ago, went from 134 in March to 139 in June. Travel into Asia continued to improve, indexing at 118 for the quarter, up more than 10 points from Q2, while travel out of Asia was up almost 10 points to 107. Looking at Mainland China specifically, cross-border travel continued to improve but remains well below 2019 levels. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continue to be strong in the mid-150s index to 2019. The inbound travel recovery remains sluggish, still just under 2019 levels. While some of the mitigating factors eased this quarter, the dollar remained quite strong relative to pre-COVID levels. In Europe, excluding intra-Europe, inbound and outbound travel remains robust with the index for 2019 in the low 140s for outbound, improving 10 points from the second quarter, and in the low 150s for inbound. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean also remained very strong, indexing in the low 160s to 2019 levels. Travel out of CEMEA indexed in the 140s versus 4 years ago, and inbound improved more than 10 points to the low 160s. Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 15% versus the 10% growth in second quarter constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was more than offset by business mix and pricing. As a reminder, third quarter service fees reflect second quarter payments volume growth, which was helped by lapping Omicron in fiscal year \u201822. Data processing revenues grew 15% versus 10% processed transactions growth. They have fully lapped the Russia impact, and the key drivers of performance were value-added services and pricing. International transaction revenues were up 14% versus a 22% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth lagged volume growth primarily due to declining currency volatility and exchange rate shifts. Other revenues grew 15% led by pricing, consulting services and card benefits. Client incentives were 28.1% of gross revenues, in line with our expectations. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by stability in domestic volume growth and transactions as well as growth in cross-border volumes. New flows revenue grew 20% in constant dollars. Commercial volumes were up 9% in constant dollars and 58% over 4 years ago. Visa Direct transactions grew 20%, and as Ryan mentioned, were impacted by a bank client that transitioned its domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system. While it could be impactful to transactions over the next several quarters, the impact to revenue is expected to be minimal. Value-added services revenue grew 19% in constant dollars driven by higher volume, strong advisory services and select pricing actions. GAAP operating expenses decreased 1%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 10%, driven primarily by personnel expenses from headcount additions over the past year. Excluding gains from our equity investments of $85 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $37 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates. Our GAAP tax rate was 19.2%, and non-GAAP was 19.4%. GAAP EPS was $2. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.16, up 9% over last year, inclusive of a nearly 1.5 point drag from the strong dollar. We have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Pismo for $1 billion in cash, subject to customary closing conditions. We will keep you posted on closing timing and financial impact. In May, we upsized our revolving credit facility to $7 billion and renewed it for 5 years. Through the first 3 weeks of July, U.S. payments volume was up 6%, with debit up 6% and credit up 6%. Compared to 4 years ago, they are up 56%, 65% and 47%, respectively. REG II has not measurably impacted volumes so far. In several key markets around the world, growth was in line with the third quarter. Process transactions grew 10% year-over-year and up 54% about 4 years ago. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 20% and was 51% about 4 years ago. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 72% about 4 years ago. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 41% over 4 years ago. Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Growth in domestic payments volumes remained stable around the globe. As such, we\u2019re assuming recent trends will sustain in the U.S. and key international markets for the rest of the quarter. On the cross-border front, the travel recovery trend has been steady and generally in line with our expectations so far for fiscal year \u201823. The cross-border travel index to 2019, excluding intra-Europe, has been improving at a rate of 5 to 6 points each quarter. We are assuming this pace of recovery continues into the fourth quarter. The region to monitor closely is Asia, especially travel in and out of Mainland China. On the cross-border e-commerce front, we\u2019re also assuming recent trends continue adjusted for crypto-related volatility. It is important to note that just as we saw in the third quarter, even as the cross-border business continues to recover relative to 2019, the year-over-year growth rate will continue to slow down. Also, currency volatility is moderating, and we are now lapping very high currency volatility from the fourth quarter last year. Our value-added services and new flows businesses have grown much faster than our consumer payments business. Sustaining faster growth rates for these businesses remains a critical priority. In the fourth quarter, we expect incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be between 27.5% to 28.5% to finish the year at the high end of the 26.5% to 27.5% range. When you pull all this together, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth of around 10% in nominal dollars with minimal impact from exchange rate shifts. The sequential slowdown is driven by three factors: the quarter lag in recognizing service fees, the expected slowdown in cross-border growth and moderating currency volatility lapping very high levels reached last year. As we indicated previously, non-GAAP operating expense growth in Q4 will likely be another 2 to 3 points lower than Q3. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items from the fourth quarter last year. Non-operating income will continue to benefit from the attractive rates we\u2019re earning on our cash balances. Interest income from cash will more than offset interest expense from debt by around $30 million in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in Q4. Assuming the performance expected in the fourth quarter, we will deliver low double-digit net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in fiscal year \u201823 despite concerns about a slowdown and an exchange rate drag. This once again demonstrates the resilience of our business, the large opportunity that remains available to digitize cash globally and the opportunity to accelerate our growth by developing vast new use cases while layering on additional value-added services. To finish, this will be my last earnings call as CFO of Visa. I want to thank all of you for your trust and support. At all times, you kept us on our toes with our nose to the grindstone. Hopefully, we\u2019ve delivered for you. This is also my last call as a public company CFO. I started this journey in September 2000, almost exactly 23 years ago. To use a cricketing term some of you will understand, I did not hit a century of earnings calls. I fell as I entered the \u201890s. On October 1, I will be switching over to your side as a shareholder of Visa, cheering from the stands as Ryan, Chris and the team lead Visa to another double and triple. Thank you, Ryan. We\u2019ve had a great run together. It\u2019s over to you, Chris. I\u2019m going to miss my finance team and the wonderful people of Visa. And as far as the CFO Hall of Fame goes, I\u2019m sure no CFO would invest in that business proposition. And now, Jennifer, it\u2019s time for some Q&A.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Vasant. And with that, we\u2019re ready to take questions, Jordan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon, thank you for taking my question. I want to ask about the Block lawsuit. They have been close partner of yours and all the issuers of Cash App, Visa cards on which they ought to benefit from interchange. And Ryan, you talked about the current partnership there. Any comments you have on the lawsuit will be helpful. And also just broadly, how should we think about the relationships with fin-tech and Cash App. Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. Thanks for the question. We have a wonderful relationship with Block, a deep partnership across many different elements, as I mentioned. As it relates to the lawsuit, there was some confusion in the market by the lawsuit. There is really nothing new here. The lawsuit is included in the MDL 1720. And thus, the lawsuit itself is covered litigation under our share class structure. So I would really put it in the category of nothing new here. And all the way back to the beginning of your question, we deeply value our relationship with Block and feel great about the deep and extended partnership we have with them.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan? \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. Good evening. I wanted to just touch base real quickly on value-added services from the standpoint of penetration for a second. I think it\u2019s around 20% or so of the company\u2019s net revenues. It\u2019s clearly yield enhancing. So it seems like a pretty large business. But Ryan, every time you talk about it, it sounds like there is so much room for growth, and it\u2019s hard for us to kind of pinpoint where you are in terms of penetration within your existing business. So any way you could frame that either anecdotally or quantitatively would be great. Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. Thanks for the question. I mean the truth is we are at the beginning of the journey across all of our value-added services businesses. They all have enormous TAM. We all have \u2013 they have enormous runway in terms of the opportunity to continue to penetrate. Our Acceptance Solutions business, whether it\u2019s CyberSource or Verifi or Visa Acceptance Cloud, I mean enormous amount of runway there. In issuing, we\u2019ve talked about the opportunity we have now with Pismo when we close on that deal, and the same thing with DPS risk and identity advisory. I mean it really is \u2013 they are all businesses that have enormous TAM. We\u2019re in the very early innings of our penetration, and we don\u2019t see in any of those businesses anywhere close to running out of runway anytime.\nDan Perlin: Thank you.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Your line is open.\nJennifer Como: Craig, are you there? \nCraig Maurer: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry, wasn\u2019t quick enough on the unmute button. So I wanted to ask about the loss of what I think I heard was a Visa Direct client in LatAm and why the transition to an internal system for them. And that leads to my follow-on which is, can you discuss the trends you\u2019re seeing globally in terms of domestic payments moving away from or back to domestic networks? Your comments in the beginning of the call seemed to indicate that there might be an acceleration toward the global networks to take advantage of what has clearly been greater investment levels into the capabilities. Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Craig, thanks for the two questions. I\u2019ll take the second one first. We are continuing to see the benefits of our investment all around the world. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing issuers, consumers shift share to Visa, shift their preference to Visa. And it happens in different ways in different countries versus the domestic schemes. But it is coming back to what you said, which is our ability to consistently invest in security features and tokenization and new digital use cases, we believe, is what\u2019s helping us win in that space. If you go back to the first part of your question, these types of things are going to happen when you\u2019re building out a new platform like we are in Visa Direct. It\u2019s still the very early days of building out Visa Direct. We\u2019re expanding in geographies and use cases. And as different partners use Visa Direct and they start to try it for different use cases, they\u2019ll find some of them work great. And other ones, they\u2019ll find opportunities to use it differently. In the case of the situation in Latin America that I mentioned, they started the journey of what they were working on using Visa Direct. They found it to be a more efficient way to get going in their journey, and then they found that they built an internal ledger system that they didn\u2019t have originally. But as I mentioned, they are going to continue to use our services for a number of things that they do. And listen, I think as we all talk over the coming quarters and years as we build out this platform, there is going to be ebbs and flows. There is going to be use cases that grow faster than others and things that stick and others that don\u2019t, and that\u2019s what building a new global business that has the reach of our platform is going to have.\nCraig Maurer: Thanks, Ryan.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. And congratulations, Vasant. Despite the concerns of choppy economy and disinflation, Vasant, you mentioned when we look at the July trends, and obviously, the trends in general over the course of the year, they have been very encouraging. And you mentioned the different categories. But as we look across the next 12 months, anything to parse out or think about in terms of the comps or how you see things playing out as we get maybe preliminary views on 2024?\nVasant Prabhu: Thanks, Sanjay. Yes. I mean the general term we\u2019ve used all along is stability, and we think things are still very stable. You look at transactions growth, it\u2019s been very stable in the U.S., around 8%. If you just adjust for the Omicron uptick we had last quarter, and you go back to pre-COVID trends or first quarter trends, transactions growth has been very stable. Clearly, some of the change in trends we pointed to ticket size. I don\u2019t think I want to get into talking about next year. We will leave that to Ryan and Chris in October, which is when we normally do talk about next year. But more \u2013 in the more near-term, the fourth quarter, the biggest hit to ticket size has been fuel, and fuel comparisons are going to moderate. And so that should help us a bit in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s reflected in our expectations. In general, I would say the trends we\u2019re seeing across the board are unchanged from where they have been for the past several months.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks. Vasant, best of luck to you. I wanted to actually ask about surcharging. I know Visa recently lowered the cap on the credit card surcharging to 3% from 4%. Just wanted to know, is this in response to a trend of more merchants employing surcharges, whether that might be in a compliant or a non-compliant manner? If so, are there any implications for Visa we should be considering from surcharging?\nRyan McInerney: No implications you should be considering. It won\u2019t surprise you, we don\u2019t feel great that consumers get surcharge. But of course, in certain jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, merchants have the ability to do that, and some choose to do it. Many choose to do it, and then they choose to pull back on it because it\u2019s not a great customer experience. The small adjustment that we made that you referenced was one. Just making sure that when consumers do get surcharge, it\u2019s something that\u2019s fair and equitable, and that was the purpose of the change.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Vasant, since it\u2019s your last earnings call, I got to ask you about incentives. You got to go out on an incentives question, at least. So as incentives look like they are going to be towards the higher end of the range, just the puts and takes that pushed it towards the high end. Was there more deal activity this fiscal year or different volumes that changed the incentives towards the high end?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 well, thanks for saying those nice things. I \u2013 in general, on incentives, they were in line with what we expected. So there were no surprises there. And incentives, everybody focuses on the percentage. If you look at what really counts, which is net revenue growth, we had healthy net revenue growth in the quarter. Even with the exchange rate drag, we were almost 12%, and the exchange rate drag would have added another point. If you look at yields, net revenue yields are higher than they were a year ago. We did have some renewals happen earlier than we expected. So we did have some renewals come into this year and Q3 that we might have thought would happen next year, but we\u2019re happy about that. We\u2019re always happy to renew clients even if we have to do it a little earlier. So all in all, no surprises there.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and welcome, Chris. And Vasant, you will be missed. I wanted to follow-up on the prepared remarks call-out on the partnership with Pay.UK around RTP Prevent. Can you elaborate a bit more on that? These are the types of value-added services I know we have all been eagerly waiting to see. So, can you talk a little more about sort of what the scope is of the pilot and exactly how that service works and how you will be monetizing it, if not in the pilot, then over the longer term? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Hi Lisa. Yes, thanks. So, it is one of the things we have been talking about is how we can build value-added services for new networks, specifically for RTP as it starts to grow and expand around the world. So, I guess how it works to the core of your question. So, first of all, what we have done is we have built a real-time risk score. We have built it uniquely for instant payments, where there is often unique cases of fraud in terms of how they work. We built it using deep learning AI models. And what it does is it enables banks to be able to decide whether to approve or reject the transaction in real time, which is the capability that most banks or most real-time payments networks around the world have been very hungry for. It\u2019s a score from 1 to 99. It comes with an instant real-time code that explains the score. And what it does is it leverages our proprietary data that kind of we have used to enhance our own risk algorithms as well as the data that we see on a lot of our payment platforms, including Visa Direct. And one of the benefits of us bringing that to market is it integrates with the bank\u2019s existing fraud and risk tools. Because we are often providing these types of risk scores to banks and they are ingesting them from us, it directly integrates into their fraud and risk tools, so the real-time information, their systems know how to use it. It can be automated into their decisioning algorithms and those types of things. So, think about it \u2013 if you back way up, if you think about it, it\u2019s similar to our Visa Advanced Authorization service that we offer on VisaNet. But we have built from the bottoms up, clean sheet of paper, a customized solution, leveraging deep learning AI models and integrated that directly into the bank system so that they can ingest that in real time. The pilot is just getting going. It\u2019s very early days, so we will report back as we learn more. And hopefully, we will have more examples like this to talk about around the world.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you and congratulations, gentlemen. Also Chris, welcome and Vasant, thank you for your help and partnership over the years. I wanted to ask about value-added services. Revenue yield there was quite solid and wanted to ask what\u2019s leading to that. Would you call it sort of structural at this point, or is it more episodic? Like in the past, you had benefits from, say, FX volatility or incentives, things like that. So, that\u2019s the question.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. FX volatility would not affect value-added services. We don\u2019t count our treasury revenues in value-added services. So, value-added services are benefiting from structural and secular things. First, it\u2019s deepening our penetration of existing clients. So, it\u2019s a concerted effort to sell more services to existing clients. Second is some of the services were not operating globally. We are now making these services available around the world. So, it allows us to clearly increase the scope of the market. And then third, as you know, we have been adding services over time. So, this is a long-term growth engine for us. Our goal is to continue to grow it at a very hefty clip. And think about it as, to get a transaction and the more services you can layer on and the more value you can add to the transaction, the more yield you can get on it. So, it\u2019s very much a growth engine, one of three, and we think it can grow for a very long time.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nKen Suchoski: Hi. Good evening everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about cross-border. Obviously, Visa is shaking some headwinds on the yield side in this business. Can you just talk about how much more of a headwind you think this is going to be in fiscal 4Q and fiscal 1Q of next year compared to what we saw this past quarter? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. So, just to correct, the way to think about value-added services yield, and I know you are looking at the revenue and dividing it by the volume, is there the yield on the transaction and then there is the yield on the exchange rate translation services we provide. Where the yield has gone down, because it was very high last year, is on the exchange rate translation service, what we call our treasury revenues, because currency volatility last year was 30% to 40% higher than it is right now. Currency volatility right now is a little higher than the long-term average. But last year, it was at extraordinary highs. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we will lap some of the highest levels of currency volatility reached last year. And based on where volatilities are today versus last year, volatilities are down almost 40%. So, it\u2019s a sizable move. So, any yield difference you see in that line is because of treasury revenues. It\u2019s not from our core cross-border yields, which remain very steady. It\u2019s going to fluctuate based on currency volatility. And really, it\u2019s still decent. It\u2019s just that it was very high last year.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hi guys. Thank you. Visa right now is net cash for the first time, I think since 2016, since pre the Visa Europe deal, and gross debt below 1x. I know your target generally is 1x to 1.5x. And the buyback, frankly, was a little bit light also tracking at about 76%. Last year, you paid out about 76% of net income and buybacks. So, I think you need to do a pretty big catch-up in this quarter. So, just curious to hear how you are thinking about capital allocation. I guess Ryan, the multiple is lower versus the market has been in a while. Do you see this as a good opportunity for buybacks to pick up pace, or are there other reasons why you would want to allocate capital different ways, guys? Thanks again.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I will start and maybe Ryan can add. No, there is no change in capital allocation strategy, which is pay a dividend. The dividend has a certain set of criteria we use between a certain percentage range of our EPS. It gets to a certain yield, and it\u2019s almost $1 billion a quarter now. We do buybacks generally out of free cash flow. We have historically not borrowed to do buybacks. And clearly, our first priority is to invest in the core business and to do acquisitions that make sense. And as you can see, we have been doing both. In terms of the volume of buybacks, remember that we did contribute $850 million to the escrow account, which is also equivalent to a buyback. So, if you count that in, we are probably around $9 billion or so in buybacks, if I remember right, so far this year. Clearly, we have more capacity if you want to do buybacks. We have always said that if we felt there was a disruption in the market and stock was trading at levels that did not reflect intrinsic value, we would be willing to step up our buybacks and borrow money if that made sense. So obviously, we will keep you posted if any of our plans change. Ryan, you may want to add some things.\nRyan McInerney: Nothing to add to your very well-said comments, Vasant.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: I appreciate you taking the question and Vasant, best of luck to you. It\u2019s been a pleasure. Ryan, I wanted to ask about the \u2013 some of the commercial efforts that Visa is making. I know it\u2019s a pretty important driver of sort of new flows, the non-consumer part of your business growth. And this quarter, it was a little bit slower than overall volume. Can you just comment on the pipeline and what you see as the opportunities in commercial and how we should think about that business growing over the next few years?\nRyan McInerney: Sure. Thanks for the question. We remain very excited about B2B in general. It\u2019s an enormous TAM, and we are just kind of scratching the surface, and we are very excited about commercial specifically. We have the largest commercial business on the planet, as we have talked about in the past. I think it\u2019s in the neighborhood of $1.5 trillion of payment volume, and we have been releasing numbers of innovations into the market in that space. we have released Visa Spend Clarity, which helps our clients with expense management, Visa Commercial Pay, which helps with control. There is a lot of things we have done around enabling acceptance around the world. So, we feel good about it. As it relates to the volume, some of the dynamics that we are seeing in the commercial space are similar to what we are seeing in the consumer space, you have the impact from fuel and those types of things. But as we think over the next 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, we have never been more excited about the opportunities that we have got. And we have never felt better about the product that we are putting in the market, and we are getting great feedback from our clients as well.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations to you Vasant. I wanted to ask for a follow-up on Reg II. You mentioned not seeing any impact yet. I am just wondering from your vantage point, whether you are now seeing that routing choice more broadly available to kind of all merchants or are we still in the midst of an implementation and rollout. And then just quickly and separately, your tax rate guidance would imply no impact from the recent Brazil tax law changes that did impact Mastercard, but I am just double checking if that\u2019s the case.\nRyan McInerney: Why don\u2019t I \u2013 I will take the first part and let Vasant take the second part. It\u2019s early days with Reg II. There has been a lot of work that happened ahead of the July 1 date, but there is also work still happening. As it relates to our views on our ability to compete in the space, we are \u2013 we continue to be very excited and confident about our ability to compete. We think that many merchants are going to still choose to route to Visa. As you all know, merchants bear liability for fraud in the e-commerce space. So, when they are making decisions, it\u2019s not just a cost-based decision. And we bring a lot to merchants in terms of the way we help them with managed risk. We have advanced fraud tools, advanced risk scoring capabilities. And as you know, we also have the product functionality enabled by dual messaging to enable a lot of use cases that are key in the e-commerce space. So, we are \u2013 we feel very good about our ability to compete. And there is still a lot that\u2019s going to happen over the course of the next many months and quarters, and we will keep you posted on how it evolves.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. On the Brazil topic, you should ask Mastercard what was unique to them, really no change from our standpoint as it relates to Brazil.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question and Vasant, thank you for always being a gentlemen for all the help over the years. I want to dig a little bit, but actually this question is for you, Vasant. On the gap between nominal cross-border volumes ex inter-Europe and international revenue on a nominal basis, you talked about the FX volatility part plenty. I was just hoping you could dig into a little bit about the other factors that drive that gap, meaning quarter mix and any pricing and how we should think about those over the coming quarters?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Thank you. Yes, it is largely volatility-driven because of the very high volatilities we had last year and more normal volatilities we are getting to now. Beyond that, there is some FX impact, obviously. That line is always affected by FX more than any other line in the P&L. And other than that, there are always mix factors. It depends on corridors and all that. There is always some impact from that. But I would say the bulk of it is the two we have talked about, volatility and exchange rates.\nTimothy Chiodo: Vasant, thank you.\nJennifer Como: Last question Jordan.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey. Thanks so much. Last question, so I won\u2019t ask you, for Vasant. That\u2019s my gift and way to thank you, so I will spare you a macro question. I will ask Ryan instead on Pismo if that\u2019s okay. Ryan, you mentioned \u2013 I think you mentioned shipping products faster in your upfront remarks that made me think about Pismo a little bit. Is buying Pismo an indication in any way that Visa is more interested in owning tech and infrastructure that touches products, the consumer and that gives you a chance to develop products faster? Just I am curious to get your thoughts on that. It feels like you are widening the swim lane a little bit here. Is that fair to say? I would love your thoughts. Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Hi Tien-tsin. What we are trying to do is serve our clients. I mean that\u2019s where it all starts with. And what our clients are looking for is they are looking for innovative processing solutions. They are increasingly looking for cloud-native API-based services. Processing is certainly one of those. We have heard from clients around the world that many of them are embarking on digital transformations in their processing platforms. And so when we hear that from our clients, we immediately get to work on how we can help them, how we can serve them. We went through a global process looking at all the different players around the world, and we identified Pismo as the best. We literally studied hundreds of companies. We met with dozens of them. And after a deep, thorough scan, we identified Pismo. And yes, Pismo is the kind of tech platform, Tien-tsin that you were alluding to. That is the type of tech that our clients are increasingly looking for. And in this example, it was an opportunity for us to buy the leading player that could help clients serve their customers, expand globally and deliver a lot of new leading edge use cases to their customers. So, we are very excited about it. Thanks for the question.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we would like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day, and please join me in wishing Vasant the best.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vasant Prabhu",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon everyone. Fiscal third quarter net revenues were up 12% and GAAP EPS, up 25%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 9%. In constant dollars, net revenues grew 13%, and non-GAAP EPS grew 11%. We have now lapped the impact of Russia. A few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9%. Index to 2019, global payments volume was up 48%. U.S. payments volume was up 6% year-over-year, consistent with expectations and stable since March. Transactions growth has remained steady at pre-COVID levels of 8%. Average ticket size is down 2%, largely due to declining fuel prices and the general moderation of inflation across multiple categories. Relative to 2019, U.S. payments volume was up 54%. International payments volume growth was up 12%. The uptick in international payments volume since the last quarter is the result of lapping the discontinuation of Russian operations. Relative to 2019, international payments volume was up 43%. The cross-border travel recovery continues at the pace we expected with volume ex intra-Europe indexing at 1.36 versus 4 years ago, a 6 point improvement from the second quarter. Summer travel across most regions picked up, with travel in and out of Asia seeing strong gains, along with travel inbound to CEMEA and outbound from Europe. Travel into the U.S. is still hovering at 2019 levels. Our new flows and value-added services businesses continued to grow at almost 20% in constant dollars. In the third quarter, we bought back approximately $3 billion in stock at an average cost of $229.19 and distributed $937 million in dividends. We also added $500 million to the litigation escrow account, which has the same effect as a stock buyback. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 5% year-over-year. Debit grew 6%, generally in line with March growth rates post the uptick in January and February due to lapping of Omicron in 2022. U.S. card present spend grew 3%. Adjusted for fuel, which saw a significant price increase last year, U.S. card presence spend was up 5%. U.S. card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 8%. U.S. processed transactions growth was stable at 8%. The step-down in U.S. payments volume growth since March was driven by a 2% decline in average ticket size. When we look at spend by category, ticket sizes are declining most significantly in fuel and, to a lesser extent, in retail goods, travel and food and drug. As you know, fuel prices spiked last year due to the Ukraine war. Travel prices spiked as the world reopened post Omicron. Goods prices spiked due to supply chain bottlenecks and commodity inflation. Excluding these four categories average ticket size growth is positive. Consumer spend across all spend bands from affluent to low spend remained stable since March. Our data did not indicate any behavior change across consumer segments. Putting all this together, we continue to believe that the primary driver of the step-down in U.S. payments volume growth since March is moderating inflation and that the consumer has remained resilient so far. Moving on to international markets. In constant dollars, international payments volume growth rates were strong through the quarter in the major markets. Latin America was up 20%. Our CEMEA region grew 28%. We're now lapping the impact of Russia. Europe was up 10%. Excluding the UK, Europe volumes grew 23%. Asia Pacific, excluding China, grew 12%. Global process transactions were up 10%. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, were up 22% year-over-year, up 49% versus 4 years ago. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 9% year-over-year and 74% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, cross-border e-commerce spending grew year-over-year in the low double digits, in line with pre-COVID growth rates. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 34% year-over-year. The cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe index to 4 years ago, went from 134 in March to 139 in June. Travel into Asia continued to improve, indexing at 118 for the quarter, up more than 10 points from Q2, while travel out of Asia was up almost 10 points to 107. Looking at Mainland China specifically, cross-border travel continued to improve but remains well below 2019 levels. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continue to be strong in the mid-150s index to 2019. The inbound travel recovery remains sluggish, still just under 2019 levels. While some of the mitigating factors eased this quarter, the dollar remained quite strong relative to pre-COVID levels. In Europe, excluding intra-Europe, inbound and outbound travel remains robust with the index for 2019 in the low 140s for outbound, improving 10 points from the second quarter, and in the low 150s for inbound. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean also remained very strong, indexing in the low 160s to 2019 levels. Travel out of CEMEA indexed in the 140s versus 4 years ago, and inbound improved more than 10 points to the low 160s. Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 15% versus the 10% growth in second quarter constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was more than offset by business mix and pricing. As a reminder, third quarter service fees reflect second quarter payments volume growth, which was helped by lapping Omicron in fiscal year \u201822. Data processing revenues grew 15% versus 10% processed transactions growth. They have fully lapped the Russia impact, and the key drivers of performance were value-added services and pricing. International transaction revenues were up 14% versus a 22% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth lagged volume growth primarily due to declining currency volatility and exchange rate shifts. Other revenues grew 15% led by pricing, consulting services and card benefits. Client incentives were 28.1% of gross revenues, in line with our expectations. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by stability in domestic volume growth and transactions as well as growth in cross-border volumes. New flows revenue grew 20% in constant dollars. Commercial volumes were up 9% in constant dollars and 58% over 4 years ago. Visa Direct transactions grew 20%, and as Ryan mentioned, were impacted by a bank client that transitioned its domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system. While it could be impactful to transactions over the next several quarters, the impact to revenue is expected to be minimal. Value-added services revenue grew 19% in constant dollars driven by higher volume, strong advisory services and select pricing actions. GAAP operating expenses decreased 1%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 10%, driven primarily by personnel expenses from headcount additions over the past year. Excluding gains from our equity investments of $85 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $37 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates. Our GAAP tax rate was 19.2%, and non-GAAP was 19.4%. GAAP EPS was $2. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.16, up 9% over last year, inclusive of a nearly 1.5 point drag from the strong dollar. We have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Pismo for $1 billion in cash, subject to customary closing conditions. We will keep you posted on closing timing and financial impact. In May, we upsized our revolving credit facility to $7 billion and renewed it for 5 years. Through the first 3 weeks of July, U.S. payments volume was up 6%, with debit up 6% and credit up 6%. Compared to 4 years ago, they are up 56%, 65% and 47%, respectively. REG II has not measurably impacted volumes so far. In several key markets around the world, growth was in line with the third quarter. Process transactions grew 10% year-over-year and up 54% about 4 years ago. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 20% and was 51% about 4 years ago. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 72% about 4 years ago. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 41% over 4 years ago. Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Growth in domestic payments volumes remained stable around the globe. As such, we're assuming recent trends will sustain in the U.S. and key international markets for the rest of the quarter. On the cross-border front, the travel recovery trend has been steady and generally in line with our expectations so far for fiscal year \u201823. The cross-border travel index to 2019, excluding intra-Europe, has been improving at a rate of 5 to 6 points each quarter. We are assuming this pace of recovery continues into the fourth quarter. The region to monitor closely is Asia, especially travel in and out of Mainland China. On the cross-border e-commerce front, we're also assuming recent trends continue adjusted for crypto-related volatility. It is important to note that just as we saw in the third quarter, even as the cross-border business continues to recover relative to 2019, the year-over-year growth rate will continue to slow down. Also, currency volatility is moderating, and we are now lapping very high currency volatility from the fourth quarter last year. Our value-added services and new flows businesses have grown much faster than our consumer payments business. Sustaining faster growth rates for these businesses remains a critical priority. In the fourth quarter, we expect incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be between 27.5% to 28.5% to finish the year at the high end of the 26.5% to 27.5% range. When you pull all this together, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth of around 10% in nominal dollars with minimal impact from exchange rate shifts. The sequential slowdown is driven by three factors: the quarter lag in recognizing service fees, the expected slowdown in cross-border growth and moderating currency volatility lapping very high levels reached last year. As we indicated previously, non-GAAP operating expense growth in Q4 will likely be another 2 to 3 points lower than Q3. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items from the fourth quarter last year. Non-operating income will continue to benefit from the attractive rates we're earning on our cash balances. Interest income from cash will more than offset interest expense from debt by around $30 million in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in Q4. Assuming the performance expected in the fourth quarter, we will deliver low double-digit net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in fiscal year \u201823 despite concerns about a slowdown and an exchange rate drag. This once again demonstrates the resilience of our business, the large opportunity that remains available to digitize cash globally and the opportunity to accelerate our growth by developing vast new use cases while layering on additional value-added services. To finish, this will be my last earnings call as CFO of Visa. I want to thank all of you for your trust and support. At all times, you kept us on our toes with our nose to the grindstone. Hopefully, we've delivered for you. This is also my last call as a public company CFO. I started this journey in September 2000, almost exactly 23 years ago. To use a cricketing term some of you will understand, I did not hit a century of earnings calls. I fell as I entered the \u201890s. On October 1, I will be switching over to your side as a shareholder of Visa, cheering from the stands as Ryan, Chris and the team lead Visa to another double and triple. Thank you, Ryan. We've had a great run together. It's over to you, Chris. I'm going to miss my finance team and the wonderful people of Visa. And as far as the CFO Hall of Fame goes, I'm sure no CFO would invest in that business proposition. And now, Jennifer, it's time for some Q&A. Thanks, Sanjay. Yes. I mean the general term we've used all along is stability, and we think things are still very stable. You look at transactions growth, it's been very stable in the U.S., around 8%. If you just adjust for the Omicron uptick we had last quarter, and you go back to pre-COVID trends or first quarter trends, transactions growth has been very stable. Clearly, some of the change in trends we pointed to ticket size. I don't think I want to get into talking about next year. We will leave that to Ryan and Chris in October, which is when we normally do talk about next year. But more \u2013 in the more near-term, the fourth quarter, the biggest hit to ticket size has been fuel, and fuel comparisons are going to moderate. And so that should help us a bit in the fourth quarter, and that's reflected in our expectations. In general, I would say the trends we're seeing across the board are unchanged from where they have been for the past several months. Yes. I mean it's \u2013 well, thanks for saying those nice things. I \u2013 in general, on incentives, they were in line with what we expected. So there were no surprises there. And incentives, everybody focuses on the percentage. If you look at what really counts, which is net revenue growth, we had healthy net revenue growth in the quarter. Even with the exchange rate drag, we were almost 12%, and the exchange rate drag would have added another point. If you look at yields, net revenue yields are higher than they were a year ago. We did have some renewals happen earlier than we expected. So we did have some renewals come into this year and Q3 that we might have thought would happen next year, but we're happy about that. We're always happy to renew clients even if we have to do it a little earlier. So all in all, no surprises there. Yes. FX volatility would not affect value-added services. We don't count our treasury revenues in value-added services. So, value-added services are benefiting from structural and secular things. First, it's deepening our penetration of existing clients. So, it's a concerted effort to sell more services to existing clients. Second is some of the services were not operating globally. We are now making these services available around the world. So, it allows us to clearly increase the scope of the market. And then third, as you know, we have been adding services over time. So, this is a long-term growth engine for us. Our goal is to continue to grow it at a very hefty clip. And think about it as, to get a transaction and the more services you can layer on and the more value you can add to the transaction, the more yield you can get on it. So, it's very much a growth engine, one of three, and we think it can grow for a very long time. Yes. So, just to correct, the way to think about value-added services yield, and I know you are looking at the revenue and dividing it by the volume, is there the yield on the transaction and then there is the yield on the exchange rate translation services we provide. Where the yield has gone down, because it was very high last year, is on the exchange rate translation service, what we call our treasury revenues, because currency volatility last year was 30% to 40% higher than it is right now. Currency volatility right now is a little higher than the long-term average. But last year, it was at extraordinary highs. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we will lap some of the highest levels of currency volatility reached last year. And based on where volatilities are today versus last year, volatilities are down almost 40%. So, it's a sizable move. So, any yield difference you see in that line is because of treasury revenues. It's not from our core cross-border yields, which remain very steady. It's going to fluctuate based on currency volatility. And really, it's still decent. It's just that it was very high last year. Yes. I will start and maybe Ryan can add. No, there is no change in capital allocation strategy, which is pay a dividend. The dividend has a certain set of criteria we use between a certain percentage range of our EPS. It gets to a certain yield, and it's almost $1 billion a quarter now. We do buybacks generally out of free cash flow. We have historically not borrowed to do buybacks. And clearly, our first priority is to invest in the core business and to do acquisitions that make sense. And as you can see, we have been doing both. In terms of the volume of buybacks, remember that we did contribute $850 million to the escrow account, which is also equivalent to a buyback. So, if you count that in, we are probably around $9 billion or so in buybacks, if I remember right, so far this year. Clearly, we have more capacity if you want to do buybacks. We have always said that if we felt there was a disruption in the market and stock was trading at levels that did not reflect intrinsic value, we would be willing to step up our buybacks and borrow money if that made sense. So obviously, we will keep you posted if any of our plans change. Ryan, you may want to add some things. Yes. On the Brazil topic, you should ask Mastercard what was unique to them, really no change from our standpoint as it relates to Brazil. Yes. Thank you. Yes, it is largely volatility-driven because of the very high volatilities we had last year and more normal volatilities we are getting to now. Beyond that, there is some FX impact, obviously. That line is always affected by FX more than any other line in the P&L. And other than that, there are always mix factors. It depends on corridors and all that. There is always some impact from that. But I would say the bulk of it is the two we have talked about, volatility and exchange rates."

            "name": "Ryan McInerney",
            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our financial performance in the third quarter of 2023 was strong, with net revenues up 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was $2.16, up 9%. Overall, our global quarterly payments volume was up 9% year-over-year. In the U.S., quarterly payments volume was up 6%, as expected, primarily due to moderating inflation. Outside the U.S., international payments volume was up 12%. Excluding intra-Europe, total cross-border volume remained strong, up 22%, with cross-border travel volume at 136% of 2019. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. As I mentioned on our previous earnings call, my priorities are focused on doing everything that we can to accelerate our growth by executing our strategy, including supporting our go-to-market teams, delivering for our clients, shipping innovative products even faster and selling our solutions even more effectively. With those priorities in mind, I would like to review our progress across our three growth levers: consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. We continue to make great strides growing and expanding our consumer payments business, winning with new and existing clients and shifting volume to Visa from a wide array of local, regional and global competitors around the world. Our clients tell us they're choosing to deepen and expand their partnerships with us for a number of reasons, including our people, our products, our value-added services, our new flows and our brand. I'll share a few examples. First, our people. We consistently hear from our clients that they deeply value the advice, local support and partnership they receive day in and day out from our outstanding team members around the world. They also appreciate our thoughtful industry leadership on important and complicated issues across the ecosystem. In fact, in our latest global Net Promoter Score survey, our clients rated us at 73. In the U.S., we retained our position of serving 8 of the top 10 credit unions by recently renewing one of the largest players in the space, Pentagon Federal Credit Union. While there are many reasons for our success with PenFed, our people and our local market relationship model made the difference, just like it has for over 350 U.S. community bank and credit union renewals this year to date. Payments is a local business, and our priority to invest locally with great talent has paid off. For example, across Eastern Europe, Intesa Sanpaolo will issue Visa debit in Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia representing over 3 million Visa credentials. Second, our payment products and innovations consistently help us win. Our clients tell us they choose Visa because our innovative products help ensure they are delivering leading-edge payment solutions to their customers. For example, in Korea, we recently renewed our partnership with Hyundai Card. As part of our new partnership, Hyundai will be taking advantage of our digital payment solutions like data and analytics services to launch a series of new innovations. Hyundai will grow their share of Visa cards in credit and debit for consumer and business. Our innovation also comes from targeted value propositions in traditional products, and we are very pleased to have signed a new long-term partnership with the NatWest Group for consumer debit and credit. Third, our value-added services are helping us win in consumer payments. Our value-added services, such as consulting and analytics, AI-driven data solutions, risk solutions and processing, are a critical differentiator that helps our clients innovate and grow, often without having to use their most scarce resources: technology and engineering. For example, Rakuten Card, a subsidiary of Rakuten Group, which operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in Japan, has signed a new credit deal with Visa to further their strategy to become a top global player. As part of our partnership, Rakuten Card will utilize Visa's processing capabilities and dedicated Visa consulting, data science and analytics teams to support them on strategic initiatives. Fourth, our new flows capabilities. Increasingly, our new flows capabilities such as Visa Direct are an important differentiator to our clients when they're making consumer payments decisions. A great example is Cash App, with 53 million monthly transacting actives, Cash App has renewed and expanded agreement globally, encompassing card issuance, Visa Direct and value-added services. And last, but certainly not least, our brand. In many cases, our clients ask their customers, which brand do you prefer? Would you spend more if we issued this brand or that brand? And our clients consistently tell us that consumers overwhelmingly prefer Visa. We see this particularly play out with co-brands. For example, for many of the largest airline co-brands in the world, we remain a partner of choice, and we recently renewed with Korean Air and signed a new agreement with Breeze Airways. We also won a co-brand portfolio with Allegiant Travel Company, the parent company of Allegiant Air. In addition, in Latin America, we expanded our relationship with LifeMiles, Avianca's frequent flyer program from our existing portfolios in 9 countries with 18 issuing banks to an additional 4 countries in the Caribbean region. And finally, we signed a co-brand agreement with Indian conglomerate, Adani, serving 400 million customers through retail, airports and online travel services, among others. Let me now turn to new flows, again, with a focus on how effectively we are delivering on our priorities. Total new flows revenue was up 20% in constant dollars. Commercial volumes increased 9% in constant dollars to total $405 billion. In terms of how we go to market, we are focused on adding commercial products to our existing consumer relationships. KBank, a leading bank in Thailand, has renewed its relationship across debit and co-brand as well as signing a new deal to launch a new business debit card to serve SMEs and micro businesses. PagSeguro, a key Brazilian fintech client, already leveraging our consumer credit and prepaid and commercial prepaid products will expand in the commercial space with the launch of Visa Business Credit for their base of 28 million clients. As we do in the consumer space, we are also constantly working with commercial clients as a strategic partner to develop and deploy unique and innovative solutions. A recent example is with SAP, the global market leader in enterprise application software, which has signed a deal with us across multiple countries in Asia Pacific. We will integrate Visa's virtual card and business solution payment provider capabilities into SAP's business technology platform. SAP serves more than 46,000 customers across Asia-Pacific. This deal will create an embedded finance solution for their customers to make B2B payments, helping to improve their working capital positions and enhance their supply chains. For Visa Direct, third quarter transactions grew 20% and were $1.8 billion. In Latin America, we had a bank client transition its onus domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system. And while it could be impactful to our transactions over the next several quarters, the impact to revenue is expected to be minimal. At the same time, for their other transactions, this client will continue to utilize our interoperability capabilities provided by YellowPepper. I am very excited about Visa Direct, particularly as we enter new markets and increase our cross-border presence. Recently, we have expanded or entered several key markets, including in France, with Lydia, the leading P2P provider with over 7 million users. We renewed our issuance relationship, and we have signed a Visa Direct deal to enable their users to top up their wallets using an eligible card. In Bolivia, with fintech libe\u0301lula's new app called Lula, Visa Direct will be enabling domestic P2P transactions within the app, and YellowPepper will be providing alias directory services. In Mexico, with fintech Alchemy Pay, Visa Direct will enable B2B cross-border supplier payments for thousands of SME clients in industries, including textiles, software, hardware and electronics across multiple corridors. And we've also continued to expand corridors with important cross-border partners. For example, Revolut, with over 30 million users, has expanded its remittance service with Visa Direct to 89 markets after just launching in July of 2022. Similarly, TransferGo, a cross-border provider in the UK, serving 6 million customers, have expanded its Visa Direct-enabled corridors from 32 in 2020 to over 160. New flows continue to be an important part of Visa's growth story and our teams are effectively selling and activating our solutions. Now I will touch on value-added services. Our go-to-market approach remains focused on three growth areas: deepening client penetration of existing products, expanding geographically and building and launching new solutions. Unlike our core business, our growth in value-added services is often driven by selling a larger number of smaller solutions. This quarter, we succeeded in selling more than 300 new issuing services, 600 new acceptance services and almost 500 new risk and identity services, in some cases, even within the same client. Our sales teams continue to work day in and day out with our clients to understand and resolve their pain points and realize new growth opportunities. Altogether, in the third quarter, we generated $1.8 billion in value-added services revenue, up 19% in constant dollars. A couple of examples of new value-added services to highlight this quarter. First, our partnership with Pay.UK, the account-to-account payments operator in the UK was recently announced. We will be piloting our new fraud capability, RTP Prevent, which is uniquely built for instant payments with deep learning AI models. Using RTP Prevent, we can provide a risk score in real time so banks can decide whether to approve or reject the transaction on an RTP network. This is a great example of building and deploying entirely new solutions and our network of network strategy. Second, our recent announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire cloud native issuer processing and core banking platform, Pismo. We believe that Pismo will allow us to strategically serve our clients through additional capabilities, with core banking ledger and issuer processing through cloud-native APIs; additional geographies with operations in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe; and additional products with credit, debit, prepaid and commercial cards as well as connections to local networks, including PICs in Brazil. From a network perspective, issuer processing and core banking have become important elements to support issuers, activate card credentials and distribute value-added services. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and approvals and is expected to close by the end of 2023. To wrap up, over the last few months, I have traveled across the globe meeting with clients, partners and regulators, and I continue to see enormous opportunity and momentum. Our brand capabilities, innovation and partnership approach continue to position us well for Visa's future growth, but the most important aspect is our people. And with that in mind, I would like to welcome the newest member of our executive team, Chris Suh, who will become Visa's Chief Financial Officer on August 1. Chris brings to Visa more than 25 years of finance leadership experience from global high-growth companies. His deep experience in finance and technology, plus his leadership in growing and scaling businesses, will be extraordinarily valuable to us as we continue to drive growth and better serve our clients and customers around the world. Plus, as I am sure you will soon learn, Chris is a real hands-on business builder with a passion for technology and an intense focus on people who will fit in well with the culture of Visa. I've asked Chris to join the Q&A portion of our call today, but please remember he isn't our CFO for a few more days. Before the Q&A, let me hand it over to Vasant to provide financial highlights for the quarter and our thoughts on the rest of the year. But first, Vasant, I know I speak on behalf of all of Visa and our investors that we are deeply grateful to you for your outstanding strategic and financial leadership. I have worked shoulder to shoulder with Vasant for the past 8 years, and I continue to be in awe of him. He is a world class CFO. And if there is a CFO Hall of Fame, I am confident he will be a first ballot inductee. Vasant, we wish you all the best. So for likely the last time on an earnings call in your career, over to you, Vasant. Yes. Thanks for the question. We have a wonderful relationship with Block, a deep partnership across many different elements, as I mentioned. As it relates to the lawsuit, there was some confusion in the market by the lawsuit. There is really nothing new here. The lawsuit is included in the MDL 1720. And thus, the lawsuit itself is covered litigation under our share class structure. So I would really put it in the category of nothing new here. And all the way back to the beginning of your question, we deeply value our relationship with Block and feel great about the deep and extended partnership we have with them. Yes. Thanks for the question. I mean the truth is we are at the beginning of the journey across all of our value-added services businesses. They all have enormous TAM. We all have \u2013 they have enormous runway in terms of the opportunity to continue to penetrate. Our Acceptance Solutions business, whether it's CyberSource or Verifi or Visa Acceptance Cloud, I mean enormous amount of runway there. In issuing, we've talked about the opportunity we have now with Pismo when we close on that deal, and the same thing with DPS risk and identity advisory. I mean it really is \u2013 they are all businesses that have enormous TAM. We're in the very early innings of our penetration, and we don't see in any of those businesses anywhere close to running out of runway anytime. Craig, thanks for the two questions. I'll take the second one first. We are continuing to see the benefits of our investment all around the world. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing issuers, consumers shift share to Visa, shift their preference to Visa. And it happens in different ways in different countries versus the domestic schemes. But it is coming back to what you said, which is our ability to consistently invest in security features and tokenization and new digital use cases, we believe, is what's helping us win in that space. If you go back to the first part of your question, these types of things are going to happen when you're building out a new platform like we are in Visa Direct. It's still the very early days of building out Visa Direct. We're expanding in geographies and use cases. And as different partners use Visa Direct and they start to try it for different use cases, they'll find some of them work great. And other ones, they'll find opportunities to use it differently. In the case of the situation in Latin America that I mentioned, they started the journey of what they were working on using Visa Direct. They found it to be a more efficient way to get going in their journey, and then they found that they built an internal ledger system that they didn't have originally. But as I mentioned, they are going to continue to use our services for a number of things that they do. And listen, I think as we all talk over the coming quarters and years as we build out this platform, there is going to be ebbs and flows. There is going to be use cases that grow faster than others and things that stick and others that don't, and that's what building a new global business that has the reach of our platform is going to have. No implications you should be considering. It won't surprise you, we don't feel great that consumers get surcharge. But of course, in certain jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, merchants have the ability to do that, and some choose to do it. Many choose to do it, and then they choose to pull back on it because it's not a great customer experience. The small adjustment that we made that you referenced was one. Just making sure that when consumers do get surcharge, it's something that's fair and equitable, and that was the purpose of the change. Hi Lisa. Yes, thanks. So, it is one of the things we have been talking about is how we can build value-added services for new networks, specifically for RTP as it starts to grow and expand around the world. So, I guess how it works to the core of your question. So, first of all, what we have done is we have built a real-time risk score. We have built it uniquely for instant payments, where there is often unique cases of fraud in terms of how they work. We built it using deep learning AI models. And what it does is it enables banks to be able to decide whether to approve or reject the transaction in real time, which is the capability that most banks or most real-time payments networks around the world have been very hungry for. It's a score from 1 to 99. It comes with an instant real-time code that explains the score. And what it does is it leverages our proprietary data that kind of we have used to enhance our own risk algorithms as well as the data that we see on a lot of our payment platforms, including Visa Direct. And one of the benefits of us bringing that to market is it integrates with the bank's existing fraud and risk tools. Because we are often providing these types of risk scores to banks and they are ingesting them from us, it directly integrates into their fraud and risk tools, so the real-time information, their systems know how to use it. It can be automated into their decisioning algorithms and those types of things. So, think about it \u2013 if you back way up, if you think about it, it's similar to our Visa Advanced Authorization service that we offer on VisaNet. But we have built from the bottoms up, clean sheet of paper, a customized solution, leveraging deep learning AI models and integrated that directly into the bank system so that they can ingest that in real time. The pilot is just getting going. It's very early days, so we will report back as we learn more. And hopefully, we will have more examples like this to talk about around the world. Nothing to add to your very well-said comments, Vasant. Sure. Thanks for the question. We remain very excited about B2B in general. It's an enormous TAM, and we are just kind of scratching the surface, and we are very excited about commercial specifically. We have the largest commercial business on the planet, as we have talked about in the past. I think it's in the neighborhood of $1.5 trillion of payment volume, and we have been releasing numbers of innovations into the market in that space. we have released Visa Spend Clarity, which helps our clients with expense management, Visa Commercial Pay, which helps with control. There is a lot of things we have done around enabling acceptance around the world. So, we feel good about it. As it relates to the volume, some of the dynamics that we are seeing in the commercial space are similar to what we are seeing in the consumer space, you have the impact from fuel and those types of things. But as we think over the next 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, we have never been more excited about the opportunities that we have got. And we have never felt better about the product that we are putting in the market, and we are getting great feedback from our clients as well. Why don't I \u2013 I will take the first part and let Vasant take the second part. It's early days with Reg II. There has been a lot of work that happened ahead of the July 1 date, but there is also work still happening. As it relates to our views on our ability to compete in the space, we are \u2013 we continue to be very excited and confident about our ability to compete. We think that many merchants are going to still choose to route to Visa. As you all know, merchants bear liability for fraud in the e-commerce space. So, when they are making decisions, it's not just a cost-based decision. And we bring a lot to merchants in terms of the way we help them with managed risk. We have advanced fraud tools, advanced risk scoring capabilities. And as you know, we also have the product functionality enabled by dual messaging to enable a lot of use cases that are key in the e-commerce space. So, we are \u2013 we feel very good about our ability to compete. And there is still a lot that's going to happen over the course of the next many months and quarters, and we will keep you posted on how it evolves. Hi Tien-tsin. What we are trying to do is serve our clients. I mean that's where it all starts with. And what our clients are looking for is they are looking for innovative processing solutions. They are increasingly looking for cloud-native API-based services. Processing is certainly one of those. We have heard from clients around the world that many of them are embarking on digital transformations in their processing platforms. And so when we hear that from our clients, we immediately get to work on how we can help them, how we can serve them. We went through a global process looking at all the different players around the world, and we identified Pismo as the best. We literally studied hundreds of companies. We met with dozens of them. And after a deep, thorough scan, we identified Pismo. And yes, Pismo is the kind of tech platform, Tien-tsin that you were alluding to. That is the type of tech that our clients are increasingly looking for. And in this example, it was an opportunity for us to buy the leading player that could help clients serve their customers, expand globally and deliver a lot of new leading edge use cases to their customers. So, we are very excited about it. Thanks for the question."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Jordin. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2023 was very strong with net revenues up 11% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.09, up 17%. Overall, our global quarterly payments volume was up 13% year-over-year, excluding Russia and China. In the U.S., quarterly payments volume was up 10%. Outside the U.S., excluding China and Russia, payments volume was up 17.5%. Excluding intra-Europe, total cross-border volume remained strong, up 32%, with cross-border travel volume at 130% of 2019. Process transactions grew 12% year-over-year. We remain confident that our strategy is focused on the right opportunities. In the second quarter, this strategy continued to deliver, driving strong growth through consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. I'll talk briefly about our progress in each area. Let's start with consumer payments. Consumer payments remains a massive opportunity for Visa. Even with all the digitization over the last several decades, there is still a tremendous amount of cash and check spent globally. There is a very long runway for growth in this business. In consumer payments, the flywheel has three parts: grow credentials, more buyers on the network; grow acceptance, more sellers on the network; and drive engagement, more transactions. We continue to grow credentials, up 7% year-over-year through December and 11% excluding Russia. And we now have more than 6 billion tokenized credentials, up nearly 90% from last year, excluding Russia. We continue to grow acceptance with over 100 million merchant locations worldwide. And tap-to-pay continues to be a powerful driver of engagement. Globally, 74% of all face-to-face transactions outside the U.S. are now taps. In the U.S., we're at 34%, up 7x from three years ago and up more than 10 percentage points from last year. A couple of highlights in the second quarter include U.S. quick service restaurants, where penetration surpassed 40% and in key metro areas across the United States, we continue to see great traction beyond the success in New York and San Francisco, L.A., Detroit, Seattle, San Diego and Ocean to Miami are all now over 40%. Mass transit continues to be one of the best ways to get people used to tapping and we've set records. In the first half of 2023, we processed more than 745 million Visa Tap to Ride transactions globally, up 35% over the first half of last year. We've enabled 55 new transit systems, bringing our footprint to over 650. We also had some significant client wins in the quarter. Starting in North America, we are pleased to have renewed a multiyear agreement with TD, a top 10 North American bank for continued Visa credit and debit issuance in both Canada and the U.S. In Canada, we renewed our relationship with CIBC with a new multiyear agreement for Visa credit issuance. We renewed our partnership with Marqeta, a leading fintech issuer processor and MoneyGram, who is utilizing Visa Direct for cross-border money movement and just recently signed a consumer debit agreement. In Asia-Pacific, UOB one of the leading banks in Asia, has renewed and expanded its relationship with us in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam for both credit and debit cards. OCBC Bank, the second-largest bank in Singapore by market cap, renewed its flagship product and portfolio with us, the OCBC 365 credit card. MUFG bank, the banking arm of Japan's largest financial group, renewed its long-term debit partnership. Chunghwa Post, Taiwan's Post Office and the largest debit issuer in Taiwan has renewed its long-term exclusive partnership with Visa. And in India, we're very excited about a long-term consumer credit contract with Axis Bank, targeting new affluent customer segments. Additionally, I want to highlight an exciting new product innovation that we launched in Japan with our long time partner SMBC. It is a single flexible prudential that a consumer can choose to use as a debit, credit, or prepaid card. SMBC calls the product Olive, and we think it could meaningfully enhance the buying experience for SMBC customers and users in many other countries around the world. Now to Europe, in Germany we've signed a co-brand deal with Solaris and ADAC, which is Germany's largest automobile association with 21 million members. Visa is excited to be the new network of choice for one of the country's largest co-brand portfolios. In Israel, we renewed and expanded our relationship with our largest issuer, Bank Leumi. In Belgium, we recently reached agreements with six issuers to migrate over 2.6 million debit cards to Visa in the next few years, bringing our country total since 2021 to 6.5 million new Visa debit cards. And finally in Latin America, from December 2019 to 2022, we have grown our credentials by 1.5x and our merchant locations by almost 2.5x. Over that time period, the percentage of our total volume that is point-of-sale payments versus getting cash out of an ATM has grown from 46% to 59%, demonstrating the cash digitization happening in the region. In Colombia, we're pleased to partner on a co-brand with LATAM Airlines, the largest airline in Latin America. We continued to strengthen our position in Brazil, renewing our partnership with Itau, the largest private bank in the country. We also announced a new strategic deal with Banco de Brasilia, that expands upon our existing agreement including a popular credit program issued in partnership with one of Brazil's leading football teams with over 40 million fans. Also in Brazil, WhatsApp had already launched peer-to-peer service to facilitate money transfer using Visa Direct, and recently they announced they will be offering payments from consumers to small businesses as well. And more and more, we see clients work with Visa on multiple levels, across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Natura, the world's fourth largest beauty group with 4., -- I'm sorry, 4 million beauty consultants in Latin America is a recent example. In 2020, we announced a deal with them and we just renewed our agreement, which includes digital issuance of a Visa business credential and adds acceptance innovations, as well as CyberSource risk management solutions. Thus far, in Brazil, we've issued cards to almost 50% of the Natura consultants. And we love working with clients that take advantage of our full range of solutions. It's Visa at our best, serving clients in multiple ways across our growth levers. Now let me turn to new flows. The potential payments volume opportunity in new flows is enormous, 10x that of consumer payments. New flows revenue in our second quarter grew more than 20% in constant dollars, excluding Russia. Commercial volume was up 15% in constant dollars and Visa Direct transactions were up 32%, excluding Russia. We've been winning in new flows by executing our network of network strategy. And two weeks ago, we announced a new network called Visa+, that further extends our network of networks. This new network allows users to send and receive payments among different P2P apps through a personalized payment address, a Visa+ Payname. This enables P2P payments from one app directly to another app, as well as gig, creator and marketplace payouts. This can be done through an app, a neo-bank, or a wallet. We're connecting endpoints and form factors and enabling interoperability, our network of network strategy at work. We are launching pilots with several partners including Venmo, PayPal, Tap-to-Pay and Western Union with more to come soon. Let me now turn to Visa Direct. Visa Direct is also a great example of our network of networks. Visa Direct utilizes 66 ACH networks, 11 RTP networks, 16 card-based networks, and five gateways, with the potential to reach nearly 7 billion endpoints globally. We continue to grow Visa Direct with new use cases and partners. For example, in Peru, Banco de Credito del Peru, BBVA, Interbank, and Scotiabank chose Visa Direct as their preferred network and YellowPepper as their technology enabler for the interoperability among their wallets and payment apps. Last year, we announced our agreement with the payments infrastructure platform, Thunes, to add send-a-wallet capabilities to Visa Direct. Similarly, this quarter our cross-border reach continued to grow, expanding coverage to 32 new wallet providers across 22 countries by connecting to TerraPay, a leading cross-border payments infrastructure company. Together, Visa Direct and TerraPay can enable P2P remittances for individuals, as well as business payouts through accounts, wallets, and cards. Enablers remain an important part of our strategy and we're partnering with Pfizer to expand on their U.S. domestic Visa Direct business by commercially launching cross-border capabilities for their clients, starting with outbound payouts. I'll mention two other recent cross-border agreements. We signed a deal with Brightwell, a global payments technology company to leverage Visa Direct to expand cross-border remittances and payout capabilities for their customers in over 175 countries across a variety of industries, such as travel and financial services. And earlier this quarter, PayPal Xoom announced that customers in the United States can send money directly to an eligible Visa debit card in 25 countries, utilizing Visa Direct. In the second quarter, Visa Direct cross-border P2P transactions, excluding Russia, grew nearly 50%. While Visa Direct is growing fast, B2B is the largest component of new flows. And traditional issuance is the core of what we do today in B2B, comprising the majority of the over $760 billion in commercial payments volume year-to-date. I'll highlight three important issuance deals. In Colombia, we renewed with Grupo Bancolombia, the largest issuer acquirer in the country for commercial credit and prepaid, as well as consumer credit. Financial Technology platform, Adyen, has expanded its offerings with a Visa commercial card, initially targeted towards global merchant customers. Visa and Stripe's issuing partnership offers card issuance to enterprise and startup consumers in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe. And for cross-border B2B money movement, which you all know is about Visa B2B Connect, a solution that seeks to deliver predictability, speed, reliability, efficiency, data, and flexibility to our clients. We're building an entirely new network and we're making progress. Over the last six months, we've signed nearly 30 banks in more than 20 countries and payments have been routed to 90 countries globally. And there are several areas for additional expansion in B2B, such as new capabilities, new geographies, and new verticals. Today, I'll talk about two verticals, fleet and fuel and agriculture. In fleet and fuel, we're seeing a big shift in this vertical, where the historically closed-loop systems are opening up and receiving the benefits of our investment and innovation. For example, the Standard Bank in South Africa will issue Visa Fleet Cards in South Africa with plans to roll out across four additional priority markets across Africa in 2024. Over the past two years, Visa has signed or launched fleet-focused solutions for over a dozen providers with more to come. In Latin America, we're bringing our innovative capabilities to an untapped vertical, the agriculture industry. Agriculture represents nearly 15% of the workforce and nearly 25% of the exports in the region, which supplies nearly 15% of the world's food production. Visa has developed a solution called Visa Agro. It provides credit access to farmers in advance of their harvest so that they can buy inputs using Visa credentials, with payment periods aligned with their production cycle. Visa Agro is live in six countries through partnerships with banks, fintechs, processors, and marketplaces. Now, I will touch on value-added services. Value-added services are equally important to Visa's accelerated growth. By offering compelling value-added services, we hope to grow our clients' businesses and deepen our relationships with these clients, increase the yields on our own network volumes, and expand beyond our own network by adding value to non-Visa transactions. Our existing suite of value-added services is impressive. In the second quarter, we had about $1.7 billion in value-added services revenue, up 20% in constant dollars. And our clients continue to add value through value-added services. An example is Wells Fargo. As they modernize their acquiring solutions, they're working with CyberSource to offer enhanced product features and functionality for their merchant services customers. Or in Europe, fiscal year-to-date, we've signed on nearly 80% more clients than last year across 11 countries in our popular risk products, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, which together deliver increased transactions through higher authorization rates, while also lowering fraud. Our network products, which include services such as account and address verification, stop payments, and smarter stand-in processing continued to grow at a rapid pace, with nearly 500 clients added year to date globally. We also enhanced and developed new value-added services, which are helping to drive growth and innovation. I'll briefly share three examples, Visa Acceptance cloud, managed services, and risk as a service. We spoke about Visa Acceptance cloud last year, which moves embedded payment processing from individual devices to the cloud. It eliminates the need for expensive terminals, as well as the cost and time to certify the processing software. I'm pleased to share that First National Bank in South Africa has launched a solution and Visa expects more pilots to follow soon globally. Next is Managed Services, part of our advisory solutions, which is when we embed Visa employees with subject matter expertise within a clients' organization to execute on a specific actionable project, such as an ongoing management of risk and fraud parameters, product implementations, or execution of customer engagement strategies. For example, one issuer for whom we provided end-to-end campaign execution enjoyed a 15% lift in spend and a 40% increase in activation. Managed Services are bringing strong results for our clients and growing revenue twice as fast as our core advisory business through the second quarter. Finally, our Risk as a Service offerings also continued to be utilized, powered by network level data, AI capabilities, and our risk experts. For example, our AI and machine learning-enabled monitoring service identifies suspicious decline activity. For one client, we were able to identify a scheme where fraudsters were testing for valid accounts and then using the accounts to make fraudulent purchases. Visa blocked over $7 million in attempted fraud in just one month on behalf of this client. This is just one example, but you can see how these risk services enable us to both help our clients and generate revenue for Visa. Since launching six months ago, we've added nearly a dozen direct clients across three regions with a very active pipeline. In closing, as you all know, I've been at Visa for nearly a decade, and I can say, I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us. We have a compelling strategy, a world-class team, fantastic clients, and an incredible set of capabilities that I believe are second to none. While the current environment still feels uncertain, we have contingency plans ready and are prepared to take action as needed. We're constantly seeking the right balance between the realities of short term with the enormous opportunities ahead. So with that, now Vasant will lead us through the financial highlights from the quarter and our thoughts on the rest of the year.\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. In our fiscal second quarter net revenues were up 11% and GAAP EPS up 20%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 17%. In constant dollars, net revenues grew 13% and non-GAAP EPS grew 20%. Adjusted for the discontinuation of operations in Russia, net revenue growth was around 18% in constant dollars. Net revenue growth exceeded our expectations due to strong value-added services and new flows growth, high currency volatility, and lower-than-anticipated client incentives. A few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 10%. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 13%. As a reminder, January and the early part of February lapped Omicron impacts last year. Index to 2019, excluding China and Russia, global payments volume was up 61%, which is a compound annual growth rate of approximately 12.5% over the pandemic year. U.S. payments volume was up 10% year-over-year, again helped by lapping the Omicron impact last year. Relative to 2019, U.S. payments volume was up 58%, compounding at 12% over the pandemic year. The cross-border travel recovery continues at the pace we expected, indexing at 130 versus four years ago, a 5 point improvement from Q1. As expected, the rebound in Asia is now the primary driver. Travel in and out of Asia reached 2019 levels in the quarter and travel into the U.S. was very close. We believe there is more recovery to come. Travel from Mainland China has mostly benefited other parts of Asia so far, but early bookings suggest strong interest in Europe as the summer approaches. Our new flows and value-added services businesses continued to power ahead. Excluding Russia and in constant dollars, both businesses grew revenues at or about 20%. In the second quarter of fiscal year '23, we bought back approximately $2.2 billion in stock at an average cost of $222.09 and distributed $941 million in dividends. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 10.5% year-over-year, slightly faster than first quarter. U.S. debit grew 9.6%, up more than 1 point from Q1. U.S. card present spend grew 8%. U.S. card not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9%. As you look at the monthly cadence in the U.S. through the quarter, January and the early part of February benefited from lapping Omicron to varying degrees. In March, payments volume growth ticked down and has remained at similar growth level through the first three weeks of April. The primary driver of the tick down in the growth rate has been U.S. ticket size, while transaction growth remains in line with Q1 levels at around 8%. Ticket size is up over 1% year-over-year in the first quarter and it's down about 2% in March through April 21. Ticket sizes are declining as inflation moderates. Most notably, starting in March and through the summer, we will be lapping the peaks in fuel prices last year. For example, in March 2023, fuel prices were nearly 20% lower than last year. In 2022, fuel prices continued to rise through spring and peaked in June. Also contributing discounting in particular retail goods channels, you've heard various U.S. retailers comment publicly about price cuts they are implementing to clear out inventory or pass on reductions in costs. Across other categories of spend in the U.S., payments volume growth remains strong in services, in particular travel and entertainment. Non-discretionary spend growth in categories like food and drug is also holding up well. Another factor that is the potential drag on U.S. payments volume growth starting in March and through April is the impact of lapping higher tax refunds. Refunds are largely spent in the few weeks post receipt. Based on IRS-reported data through April 14, tax refunds are 11% lower this year. We expect this headwind to a bit as we get into May. Moving on to international markets. In constant dollars, international payments volume growth rate was strong through the quarter in the major markets. Latin America was up 27% due to improved growth in Mexico and the South Cone. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 29%. Europe was up 13%. Excluding the U.K., Europe volume grew 31%, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Excluding portfolio conversion, volume trends in the U.K. improved. Asia-Pacific, excluding China, continued to recover, up 17%. Global processed transactions were up 12%. Constant dollar cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe, but including Russia in prior period, were up 32% year-over-year and up 46% versus four years ago. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by about 3 points and the index to four years ago was higher by 5 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 6% year-over-year and was 77% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases and Russia, cross-border e-commerce spending grew in the low-double-digits. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel and intra-Europe, represented over 40% of total cross-border volume in the second quarter. Cross-border travel-related spend excluding intra-Europe grew 59% year-over-year. The cross-border travel, excluding the intra-Europe index to four years ago, went from 129 in December to 134 in March or up 5 points. Travel into Asia now exceeds 2019 level, while travel out of Asia is around 2019 levels, improving 13 and 11 points respectively from the first quarter versus four years ago. Travel out of Mainland China is a key driver to watch. With airline capacity coming back fast and streamline's Visa issuance, Southeast Asia has been the biggest beneficiary of travel from Mainland China. This is beginning to change as airline capacity is added in other corridors, especially Europe and COVID-related requirements are eased. We expect the recovery of Asian, and in particular Chinese travel, to be a key driver of the final leg of the cross-border recovery. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continued to be strong in the low 150s indexed to 2019. Travel inbound to the U.S. is still hovering just under 2019 levels. A strong U.S. dollar, travel Visa backlog and COVID restrictions have been dragged on the recovery, but all are beginning to ease. Europe, excluding intra-Europe, inbound and outbound remained strong with the travel indexed to 2019 in the low 130s for outbound and high 140s for inbound. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean also remained very strong, indexing the 160s to 2019 levels. Travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the high 140s versus four years ago with outbound up more than 5 points from the first quarter and inbound up by about 10 points. Moving now to a quick review of our second quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 7% versus the 7% growth in first quarter, constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was offset by growth from business mix and pricing. Data processing revenues grew 10% versus the 12% process transactions growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia, however, our transactions growth is not. Adjusting for Russia, data processing revenues were up 14%, helped by value-added services strength. International transaction revenues were up 24% versus the 32% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility, although lower than the first quarter and pricing actions, offset by exchange rate shifts and business mix. Other revenues grew 16%, led by marketing and consulting services, as well as benefiting from acquisitions. Client incentives were 26.7% of gross revenues, below expectations due to some deal timing, client performance, and other items. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was led by the strength in domestic volume transactions and cross-border volume, as well as high currency volatility. New flows revenue grew over 20%, excluding Russia in constant dollars. Commercial volumes were up 15% in constant dollars and 60% over four years ago, excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 32%. Value-added services revenue grew 20% in constant dollars, driven by higher-volume increased client penetration and select pricing actions. GAAP operating expenses grew 11%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 13%, led primarily by personnel expenses from headcount additions over the past year. Excluding losses from our equity investments of around $90 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $32 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates and a few other items. Our GAAP tax rate was 19.3% and non-GAAP was 19.4%. GAAP EPS was $2.03, non-GAAP EPS was $2.09, up 17% over last year, inclusive of a 3-point drag from the stronger dollar. Through the first three weeks of April, U.S. payments volume was up 6%, with debit up 6% and credit also up 6%, compared to four years ago, they are up 54%, 63%, and 45% respectively. In key markets around the world, we saw continued strength. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year and are 50% above four years ago. Constant dollar cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe grew 28% and was 47% of our four years ago. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 77% about four years ago. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 31% over four years ago. Moving now to our outlook for the third quarter. Growth in domestic payments volumes remained stable around the globe. As we said last quarter, the recovery from COVID is behind us now for domestic volume. Post the Omicron impact from last year in January and February, U.S. domestic volume growth rates have ticked down in March, driven by the factors we discussed earlier. We believe that some of these factors will persist through the third quarter. As such, we are assuming March and April trends will continue in the U.S. for the rest of the quarter. In aggregate, we expect the international growth trajectory remains largely unchanged from the second quarter. On the cross-border front, the travel recovery trend has been steady and generally in line with our expectations so far in fiscal year '23. The cross-border travel index to 2019, excluding intra-Europe, has been improving at a rate of 5 points to 6 points each quarter. We are assuming this trend is sustained through the third quarter. The big driver as recovery in Asia continuing, especially driven by Mainland China. We expect Chinese travel to extend beyond Asia to Europe as we enter the summer. On the cross-border e-commerce front, we're also assuming recent trends continue, adjusted for crypto-related volatility. It is important to note that even as the cross-border business continues to recover, relative to 2019, the year-over-year growth rate will continue to slow down as it has over the past few quarters. Also, currency volatility is moderating, and we are now lapping very high currency volatility from the third quarter of last year. Our value-added services and new flows businesses have grown much faster than our consumer payments business. Sustaining faster growth rates for these businesses remains a critical priority. Client incentive growth is expected to be higher in the second half than it was in the first. This was driven by some delays in renewals that were expected in the first half, as well as some significant renewals that were anticipated in fiscal year '24 but are now happening in the second half of fiscal year '23. In the first half, client incentives as a percent of gross revenue was below our outlook range of 26.5% to 27.5%. In the second half, this percentage is likely to run above the high-end of the range. We expect to finish the year in the upper half of the 26.5% to 27.5% range. When you put all this together, third quarter net revenue growth is expected to be in the low-double-digits, inclusive of an approximately 1 point drag from exchange rate. As we indicated previously, non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to moderate through the year. Our expectations remain unchanged. Q3 non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to be 2 points to 3 points lower than the second quarter inclusive of an exchange rate impact, which may add half a point to growth. And Q4 non-GAAP operating expense growth will likely be another 2 points, 3 points lower than Q3. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items and the litigation provision from the third quarter last year. Non-operating income will continue to benefit from the attractive rates we're earning on our cash balances. As you know, short-term rates have been high lately, which is very helpful given that we always have very low duration on our cash balances. Interest income from cash will likely offset interest expense from debt by $5 million to $10 million in the third quarter. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in the third quarter. As we've said previously, should there be a recession on a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our presumptions, they will of course adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs, and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel, and other controllable categories. In summary, as Ryan said, Visa today has three robust growth engines, consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Our results in the second quarter attest that growth remains healthy across all three businesses. The opportunity is vast and the runway for growth remains long. With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I want to talk a little bit about Visa+, a little bit on the mechanics and sort of what could be, and then a brief follow-up. So on mechanics, my understanding is, as you mentioned, apps, neo banks, and wallets can be a part of this, but what about the prospect of any account being able to be attached to a Payname that's associated with Visa+, meaning traditional bank accounts. And also understand that at present, the Payname concept in Visa+ is domestic only, but potentially has the -- I guess the chance to expand to cross-border.\nRyan McInerney: Thanks for the question. Just before I get into two specific parts that you asked about, just back up, Visa+ is a great example of how a lot of innovations in Visa work. Our team started with a problem in the market, which is people have, we all have these apps with money in them, and it's not easy to get money from one app to another and so starting with the problem, which then created the opportunity, we then together with a number of different parts of the company laid out a roadmap and then announced the Payname feature in the Visa+ network, I guess it was a couple of weeks ago. And like anything to find product market fit, we are starting with kind of some very specific use cases, so, yes, domestic. Yes, we've started with a few partners who happen to be, but not just in the P2P wallet business like PayPal is, with both Venmo and PayPal, we also mentioned Western Union, who is a launch partner with us. In theory, the Payname construct could be extended to really any source of funds on any surface, but we're really focused on, it's early days. We just launched, we think it's a great idea. We think it's got great product market fit. We've gotten really good feedback from the market. We're focused on launching in the U.S. with the partners that we mentioned, then we'll go from there. Thanks for the question, Timothy.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordin.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJennifer Como: Tien-Tsin, are you there?\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, Jennifer, can you hear me?\nJennifer Como: Yes, now we can.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question and for all the good detail here. Just -- I want to make sure just can we infer from the no change in the operating expense outlook here that Vasant went through, that the modest slowdown you saw in March is limited to the U.S. and largely inflation, and I think tax related. It sounds like it shouldn't extend beyond third quarter from what you see, and otherwise no real surprises in the consumer globally, just wanted to rehash that back to you.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, the short answer is yes. We think the consumer is still in good shape. As we said, spending across most categories other than a couple I mentioned like fuel and some retail goods price cutting, very strong across services, strong across travel and entertainment, strong in non-discretionary, so, yes, that's how we feel.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nWill Nance: Hi, guys. I appreciate you taking my question. We've heard a couple of instances of several large merchants that have made the decision to start routing more e-commerce -- more e-commerce transactions over alternative networks over the past three to five months, so I just wanted to maybe get an update on your thoughts around some of the recent regulations in the U.S. based on conversations with acquirers, merchants, and issuers, are there any updated thoughts or expectations around the potential impact of new regulations that are implemented over the next few several months?\nRyan McInerney: No updates, but I'll just kind of again summarize for you how we see things. The changes that the Fed put in place were consistent with our expectations. No changes to the card-present side of things. Obviously, in the e-commerce side of things, it requires issuers to enable to one affiliated networks for e-comm. Most Visa issuers were already in compliance. Those that aren't will be. We've said and continue to believe that there'll be minimum impact in fiscal year '23 and beyond that, it's yet to be determined. We'll kind of see how the marketplace plays out. We continue to believe that merchants are going to want to choose to route transactions to Visa for a number of reasons. One is, in the e-comm space the merchants bear the liability for fraud in e-commerce. So the ability to save a couple of basis points in cost have to be weighed against the risk that comes from the liability of fraud in the e-commerce space. We believe that our tools, capabilities, and platforms to help reduce fraud are second to none. We've got advanced fraud and risk processing capabilities that help both issuers, acquirers, and sellers reduce fraud. And we've also got a product that has dual messaging functionality that, in a number of different use cases whether it's airlines or hotels or rental cars or the retail space, where they are ordering multiple products that are shipped at different times. The enhanced dual messaging functionality is really required. So, as always, we're going to -- we're going to continue to compete vigorously. We're going to continue to invest in our products, our capabilities, our services. The market is very competitive today. It's going to get more competitive, but we like our chances to continue to win.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTrevor Williams: Great. Thanks. I want to follow-up on value-added services and how much cyclicality we should expect on that line. I mean, they've been consistently growing faster than net revenue. Vasant, I know you said maintaining that elevated growth in new flows and value-added services is a priority, but if we are in an environment with slowing volume growth, just -- how do you expect value-added services in aggregate? And I know there's a wide range of what gets folded in under that label, but just in aggregate, how you expect value-add services to hold up relative to the consumer payments business? Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I'll start and I'm sure Ryan will add. Yes, our goal of course is to grow the value-added services business faster than the consumer payments business and you have to remember that the secular growth in that business coming from adding new services, which we are doing regularly from expanding services outside the U.S., which we're doing, as well as deepening penetration with existing clients because all of them by all of the services. So there's already a secular growth component. In terms of being affected by market trends, there are services clearly that are linked to transactions. That's true of many of our services, like our DPS business, which is issuer processing on a CyberSource business and even to some degree the fraud businesses. So, yes, these transactions are impacted in some way. There will be some impact on it, but that is underlying secular growth in that business. I don't know if you'd add anything?\nRyan McInerney: Nothing to add, well said.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.\nBob Napoli: Thank you and good afternoon. I wanted to -- without the growth in new flows and networks, I just wanted to follow-up on the evolution of new technologies, AI and blockchain, and how that's affecting your business? How Visa is utilizing those technologies? And do they add any opportunities or risks to your business?\nRyan McInerney: Hi Bob. I think I heard gist of the question cut in and out a little bit. Let me hit AI and blockchain. I think that's what you're asking. I think more broadly. We're obviously monitoring anything and everything that's impacting commerce and money movement around the world. And our approach is what it has been, which is to lean into those technologies and use them to add value to our products and services and clients and capabilities around the world. I guess, AI and blockchain. On AI, clearly, a lot of activity in generative AI right now. Before I get to that, I'll just mention that we have a long history of developing and using predictive AI and deep learning. We were one of the pioneers of applied predictive AI. We have an enormous data set that we've architected to be utilized at scale by hundreds of AI and ML different services that people use all across Visa. We use it -- we need to run our company more effectively. We use it to serve our clients more effectively. And this will continue to be a big part of what we do. As you transition to generative AI, this is where we see this as an opportunity to take our current AI services to the next level. We are kind of as a platform, experimenting with a lot of the new capabilities that are available. We've got people all over the company that are tinkering and dreaming and thinking and doing testing and figuring out ways that we could use generative AI to transform how we do what we do, which is deliver simple, safe and easy-to-use payment solutions. And we're also spending a fair time thinking how generative AI will change the way that sellers sell, and we all buy and all of the shop. So that is -- it's a big area of opportunity that we're looking at in many different ways across the company. In terms of, I guess, blockchain and crypto, it's -- as far as we see, it's still early days, still emerging technologies. But as we've said in other venues, we see the potential for blockchain. We see the potential for stable coins. If you look at what we're doing in the market today, it's relatively basic, but I'd call it important work. We're enabling on and off ramps on crypto. We're working with exchanges around the world to issue their users Visa credentials, and we're developing the capability for our issuer and acquirer partners to have a choice to settle in stable coins. And we're engaging with central banks all around the world on CBDC priorities. Now the stuff we've got going in the lab, if you will, the R&D work that we're doing is we're testing and ideating on all sorts of different ideas on how we could leverage blockchain and Web3 and Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions, smart contracts. I mean we've got teams of people that are exploring all those different types of innovations. And we'll see how they play out in the market. And if there's things to scale, we want to be part of that.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Vasant, I'm just trying to think about all the areas that are impacting you differently than what you may have planned for, for the fiscal year like this transitory impact that you mentioned in March and April that are persisting and then the moderating FX volatility. As we pull up and think about the fiscal year, do you feel like we're in about the same place where you started in terms of your forecast given the strength in other places? Just trying to think through all of that. Thanks.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes, I think that's right. Clearly, the moderation in volatility is not a big surprise. Volatility last year were very high by historical standards. If anything, they've held up better than we expected so far this year. And even now, they're, I'd say, a little bit higher than long run medians, but not -- last year was real highs that we haven't seen in a while. So that's not a surprise. The cross-border business is recovering almost on track with our expectations, which, again, we had no real crystal ball, but we are very close to what we were expecting. And it's recovering nicely, and it's exactly as we expected. Asia driving it. China playing an important role. The cross-border e-commerce business, in general, the e-commerce business is holding up well. International is very strong, especially Europe. Europe is strong. Define what we may have expected going into the year. If there is a positive surprise, it's clearly Europe. And then other parts of the world like Latin America, many most parts of Latin America and the Middle East are also doing well. And Asia is recovering. So yes, I mean, as you would expect something is better than you expect, something is a little bit lower. But in aggregate, the business is doing as well or better than we expected, as you saw from our results.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Good afternoon, guys. Just going back to your initial expectations for fiscal '23 at the outset of the fiscal year. I believe you were forecasting that Q4 net revenue growth would accelerate versus Q3. Just wondering if that's still the case given some of the quarterly moving parts here, including on the incentive line. Thank you.\nVasant Prabhu: I don't think we gave you a quarterly revenue growth outlook. So I don't know exactly where that came from. I mean, we said -- we gave you some sense of our planning assumptions for the full year, and said that we would give you one quarter out. Our best sense of the quarter out, which we've done for Q3. And we'll give you our best sense of Q4 when we get to July.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just had question on the upcoming official launch of Fed -- now in July, Ryan, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, of course, that Visa Direct works with dozens of other networks around the world. Are you anticipating connecting into FedNow? And can you just update us again on how you see the rollout of FedNow affecting Visa, particularly your ability to win in new flows? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Thanks, Lisa. Yes, we want to connect to any real-time payment network in the planet - on the planet, and that's been our track record so far. That's the short answer to the first part of your question. Just back up, and I'll just take a minute on this. Before I dive into FedNow, let me put it in context as it relates to Visa. Today, I'll start with Visa Debit. Visa Debit is a feature-rich widely adopted safe, simple, secure payment option. We've got global broad-based acceptance. We've got dual message capabilities, as I mentioned earlier, well-established disputes and charge-back processes, well-understood rules and accepted rules, not just in the U.S. but around the world. We've got zero liability fraud protection, tokenization capabilities, risk management tools, security services. And it's a really, really good customer experience. It's a great buying experience. It's a great selling experience. So that's Visa Debit. On Visa Direct, Visa Direct builds on all those features, the scale, the ubiquity, the great experiences to deliver push payment solutions, both domestically and around the world, as I mentioned earlier to 7 billion endpoints. And there, too, it's a really, really good customer experience, both for the user and for the kind of enabler of the experience. So if you put FedNow in context of all of that. So just to talk specifically about FedNow, the first thing I would say is that modernizing the payments infrastructure in the United States is a smart thing to do. It's a necessary thing to do, and it's good for Americans. So that's -- it's something that is a good thing happening in the U.S. And I'd also say that any force that digitizing money movement is a catalyzing force for all of us. And I expect that the FedNow, like TCH, it's going to take some time. It will eventually get traction, but it will take some time to build adoption. And one of the most -- I'd say it this way. One of the most powerful capabilities in payments is ubiquity. RTP doesn't have that yet in the U.S. It will happen, but it's going to take time. And the other thing I'd say is that an RTP transaction is a relatively simple transaction type, it's instant, it's permanent and it's irrevocable. I think over time, it will get enhanced, but that's kind of where we are. So if you take all that and say, what does it mean? I think the most instructive thing to do as we think about real-time payments in the U.S. is look around the world. And if you go to the U.K., we've had faster payments in the U.K. for 15 years now. We haven't seen much, if any, impact on Visa Debit. And the U.K. is also -- it's a robust and growing market for Visa Direct. So just I think we'll see what happens. We'll see how things expand in the U.S., but kind of like I was saying earlier, we like our products. We love our clients. We love the capabilities and teams that we have, and we feel good about our ability to continue to add value and grow the businesses in the U.S.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Your line is open.\nRayna Kumar: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. B2B Connect seems like it could be a big opportunity to capture B2B cross-border. I know, Ryan, you mentioned that over the last six months, Visa has done nearly 30 banks for B2B Connect. Can you talk about the competitive environment and the sales process with those customers? And if you can give us a sense of how much volume has been flowing through B2B Connect. Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yes, thanks for the question. We're building out a new network. We know how to do that, and we also know it takes time. If I give you an example and then come back to your question, we're excited to talk with all of you about the success we're having with Visa Direct. The billions of transactions, the use cases, everything that we're seeing now. That journey started many, many years ago, country by country, client by client, working with our issuing clients, especially to get into their tech cues, build out the functionality and then fast forward many years and we're having the success that we're having with that platform today. B2B Connect is in the earlier stages of that. So to your question around the sales cycles, we know how to do it. We've done it with other networks as we built out, but it takes time. Country-by-country around the world we're working with our banks. We're helping them understand the value of the product and the solution, which almost unanimously is the easiest part of the sales process. Like when you compare B2B Connect versus the alternatives that are out there, I mean, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, side-by-side to almost any other alternative that's out there, B2B Connect is a far superior product but it takes store. So we're working on it country by country. I mentioned some of the numbers in my prepared remarks. I don't have any numbers to share today beyond those. And we expect, over time, we'll share more with you about the success we're hopefully having.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open.\nDavid Koning: Yes. Hi, guys. Thank you. And my question, just personnel expense was up 24% year-over-year. It was one of the biggest increases we've seen, which is kind of in the face of a lot of tech companies that are cutting. Why was it up so much, I guess, is just the question.\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. It's additions, we had made over the last 12 months in head count. There's also some unusual items that flow through there that are offset. This is the deferred comp. It hits you on the personnel line, but it's offset on the nonoperating income line. So that distorts it a little bit. But you will see that growth rate start to decline quite a bit because we've been moderating headcount increases as we went through the year. And it's all incorporated in the outlook we gave you for expenses, which we told you with the growth of expenses will flow through the year. It was 2 points or 3 points lower than last quarter. This quarter, it will be 2 points to 3 points lower next quarter and another 2 points to 3 points lower in the fourth quarter, and we're on track for that.\nJennifer Como: Last question, Jordin.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hi, thanks guys. Vasant, we heard your comments on third quarter growth expectations, but would just love to hear a little bit more on full year. You've obviously outperformed so far especially on -- really on both reported and constant currency basis, the first fiscal quarters. And then guidance seems to be shaping up better than your full year outlook. So just maybe a little more comment on how you see the full year versus guidance? And then I guess, Ryan, on the yields, it looks so strong. Is that -- do you see a long runway for value-added services to keep growing as a percentage of the yield of every transaction revenue mix going forward, so that that can keep being sustainable?\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Look, I think we'll stick with what we said earlier. I think you have a good sense of the trends. And if the trends continue, you have -- it's very easy for you to assess what the fourth quarter would look like. And as it relates to value-added services, I don't know, Ryan, if you want to add anything. But clearly, I mean, the approach to value-added services is the yield and answer. If you have the transaction, the more value-added services you can provide, the higher the yield you can get on the transaction, and that is clearly the objective.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. I think we've got great sales teams, great product teams all around the world. They're doing a great job sitting with our clients, helping them understand these products and services and getting those products and services embedded into our clients. And we've got a very robust product pipeline across all of our various types of value-added services and we're optimistic about the ability to continue to grow that business.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.",

            "name": "Vasant Prabhu",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. In our fiscal second quarter net revenues were up 11% and GAAP EPS up 20%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 17%. In constant dollars, net revenues grew 13% and non-GAAP EPS grew 20%. Adjusted for the discontinuation of operations in Russia, net revenue growth was around 18% in constant dollars. Net revenue growth exceeded our expectations due to strong value-added services and new flows growth, high currency volatility, and lower-than-anticipated client incentives. A few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 10%. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 13%. As a reminder, January and the early part of February lapped Omicron impacts last year. Index to 2019, excluding China and Russia, global payments volume was up 61%, which is a compound annual growth rate of approximately 12.5% over the pandemic year. U.S. payments volume was up 10% year-over-year, again helped by lapping the Omicron impact last year. Relative to 2019, U.S. payments volume was up 58%, compounding at 12% over the pandemic year. The cross-border travel recovery continues at the pace we expected, indexing at 130 versus four years ago, a 5 point improvement from Q1. As expected, the rebound in Asia is now the primary driver. Travel in and out of Asia reached 2019 levels in the quarter and travel into the U.S. was very close. We believe there is more recovery to come. Travel from Mainland China has mostly benefited other parts of Asia so far, but early bookings suggest strong interest in Europe as the summer approaches. Our new flows and value-added services businesses continued to power ahead. Excluding Russia and in constant dollars, both businesses grew revenues at or about 20%. In the second quarter of fiscal year '23, we bought back approximately $2.2 billion in stock at an average cost of $222.09 and distributed $941 million in dividends. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 10.5% year-over-year, slightly faster than first quarter. U.S. debit grew 9.6%, up more than 1 point from Q1. U.S. card present spend grew 8%. U.S. card not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9%. As you look at the monthly cadence in the U.S. through the quarter, January and the early part of February benefited from lapping Omicron to varying degrees. In March, payments volume growth ticked down and has remained at similar growth level through the first three weeks of April. The primary driver of the tick down in the growth rate has been U.S. ticket size, while transaction growth remains in line with Q1 levels at around 8%. Ticket size is up over 1% year-over-year in the first quarter and it's down about 2% in March through April 21. Ticket sizes are declining as inflation moderates. Most notably, starting in March and through the summer, we will be lapping the peaks in fuel prices last year. For example, in March 2023, fuel prices were nearly 20% lower than last year. In 2022, fuel prices continued to rise through spring and peaked in June. Also contributing discounting in particular retail goods channels, you've heard various U.S. retailers comment publicly about price cuts they are implementing to clear out inventory or pass on reductions in costs. Across other categories of spend in the U.S., payments volume growth remains strong in services, in particular travel and entertainment. Non-discretionary spend growth in categories like food and drug is also holding up well. Another factor that is the potential drag on U.S. payments volume growth starting in March and through April is the impact of lapping higher tax refunds. Refunds are largely spent in the few weeks post receipt. Based on IRS-reported data through April 14, tax refunds are 11% lower this year. We expect this headwind to a bit as we get into May. Moving on to international markets. In constant dollars, international payments volume growth rate was strong through the quarter in the major markets. Latin America was up 27% due to improved growth in Mexico and the South Cone. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 29%. Europe was up 13%. Excluding the U.K., Europe volume grew 31%, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Excluding portfolio conversion, volume trends in the U.K. improved. Asia-Pacific, excluding China, continued to recover, up 17%. Global processed transactions were up 12%. Constant dollar cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe, but including Russia in prior period, were up 32% year-over-year and up 46% versus four years ago. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by about 3 points and the index to four years ago was higher by 5 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 6% year-over-year and was 77% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases and Russia, cross-border e-commerce spending grew in the low-double-digits. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel and intra-Europe, represented over 40% of total cross-border volume in the second quarter. Cross-border travel-related spend excluding intra-Europe grew 59% year-over-year. The cross-border travel, excluding the intra-Europe index to four years ago, went from 129 in December to 134 in March or up 5 points. Travel into Asia now exceeds 2019 level, while travel out of Asia is around 2019 levels, improving 13 and 11 points respectively from the first quarter versus four years ago. Travel out of Mainland China is a key driver to watch. With airline capacity coming back fast and streamline's Visa issuance, Southeast Asia has been the biggest beneficiary of travel from Mainland China. This is beginning to change as airline capacity is added in other corridors, especially Europe and COVID-related requirements are eased. We expect the recovery of Asian, and in particular Chinese travel, to be a key driver of the final leg of the cross-border recovery. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continued to be strong in the low 150s indexed to 2019. Travel inbound to the U.S. is still hovering just under 2019 levels. A strong U.S. dollar, travel Visa backlog and COVID restrictions have been dragged on the recovery, but all are beginning to ease. Europe, excluding intra-Europe, inbound and outbound remained strong with the travel indexed to 2019 in the low 130s for outbound and high 140s for inbound. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean also remained very strong, indexing the 160s to 2019 levels. Travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the high 140s versus four years ago with outbound up more than 5 points from the first quarter and inbound up by about 10 points. Moving now to a quick review of our second quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 7% versus the 7% growth in first quarter, constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was offset by growth from business mix and pricing. Data processing revenues grew 10% versus the 12% process transactions growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia, however, our transactions growth is not. Adjusting for Russia, data processing revenues were up 14%, helped by value-added services strength. International transaction revenues were up 24% versus the 32% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility, although lower than the first quarter and pricing actions, offset by exchange rate shifts and business mix. Other revenues grew 16%, led by marketing and consulting services, as well as benefiting from acquisitions. Client incentives were 26.7% of gross revenues, below expectations due to some deal timing, client performance, and other items. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was led by the strength in domestic volume transactions and cross-border volume, as well as high currency volatility. New flows revenue grew over 20%, excluding Russia in constant dollars. Commercial volumes were up 15% in constant dollars and 60% over four years ago, excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 32%. Value-added services revenue grew 20% in constant dollars, driven by higher-volume increased client penetration and select pricing actions. GAAP operating expenses grew 11%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 13%, led primarily by personnel expenses from headcount additions over the past year. Excluding losses from our equity investments of around $90 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $32 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates and a few other items. Our GAAP tax rate was 19.3% and non-GAAP was 19.4%. GAAP EPS was $2.03, non-GAAP EPS was $2.09, up 17% over last year, inclusive of a 3-point drag from the stronger dollar. Through the first three weeks of April, U.S. payments volume was up 6%, with debit up 6% and credit also up 6%, compared to four years ago, they are up 54%, 63%, and 45% respectively. In key markets around the world, we saw continued strength. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year and are 50% above four years ago. Constant dollar cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe grew 28% and was 47% of our four years ago. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 77% about four years ago. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 31% over four years ago. Moving now to our outlook for the third quarter. Growth in domestic payments volumes remained stable around the globe. As we said last quarter, the recovery from COVID is behind us now for domestic volume. Post the Omicron impact from last year in January and February, U.S. domestic volume growth rates have ticked down in March, driven by the factors we discussed earlier. We believe that some of these factors will persist through the third quarter. As such, we are assuming March and April trends will continue in the U.S. for the rest of the quarter. In aggregate, we expect the international growth trajectory remains largely unchanged from the second quarter. On the cross-border front, the travel recovery trend has been steady and generally in line with our expectations so far in fiscal year '23. The cross-border travel index to 2019, excluding intra-Europe, has been improving at a rate of 5 points to 6 points each quarter. We are assuming this trend is sustained through the third quarter. The big driver as recovery in Asia continuing, especially driven by Mainland China. We expect Chinese travel to extend beyond Asia to Europe as we enter the summer. On the cross-border e-commerce front, we're also assuming recent trends continue, adjusted for crypto-related volatility. It is important to note that even as the cross-border business continues to recover, relative to 2019, the year-over-year growth rate will continue to slow down as it has over the past few quarters. Also, currency volatility is moderating, and we are now lapping very high currency volatility from the third quarter of last year. Our value-added services and new flows businesses have grown much faster than our consumer payments business. Sustaining faster growth rates for these businesses remains a critical priority. Client incentive growth is expected to be higher in the second half than it was in the first. This was driven by some delays in renewals that were expected in the first half, as well as some significant renewals that were anticipated in fiscal year '24 but are now happening in the second half of fiscal year '23. In the first half, client incentives as a percent of gross revenue was below our outlook range of 26.5% to 27.5%. In the second half, this percentage is likely to run above the high-end of the range. We expect to finish the year in the upper half of the 26.5% to 27.5% range. When you put all this together, third quarter net revenue growth is expected to be in the low-double-digits, inclusive of an approximately 1 point drag from exchange rate. As we indicated previously, non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to moderate through the year. Our expectations remain unchanged. Q3 non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to be 2 points to 3 points lower than the second quarter inclusive of an exchange rate impact, which may add half a point to growth. And Q4 non-GAAP operating expense growth will likely be another 2 points, 3 points lower than Q3. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items and the litigation provision from the third quarter last year. Non-operating income will continue to benefit from the attractive rates we're earning on our cash balances. As you know, short-term rates have been high lately, which is very helpful given that we always have very low duration on our cash balances. Interest income from cash will likely offset interest expense from debt by $5 million to $10 million in the third quarter. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in the third quarter. As we've said previously, should there be a recession on a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our presumptions, they will of course adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs, and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel, and other controllable categories. In summary, as Ryan said, Visa today has three robust growth engines, consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Our results in the second quarter attest that growth remains healthy across all three businesses. The opportunity is vast and the runway for growth remains long. With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer. Yes, the short answer is yes. We think the consumer is still in good shape. As we said, spending across most categories other than a couple I mentioned like fuel and some retail goods price cutting, very strong across services, strong across travel and entertainment, strong in non-discretionary, so, yes, that's how we feel. Yes, I'll start and I'm sure Ryan will add. Yes, our goal of course is to grow the value-added services business faster than the consumer payments business and you have to remember that the secular growth in that business coming from adding new services, which we are doing regularly from expanding services outside the U.S., which we're doing, as well as deepening penetration with existing clients because all of them by all of the services. So there's already a secular growth component. In terms of being affected by market trends, there are services clearly that are linked to transactions. That's true of many of our services, like our DPS business, which is issuer processing on a CyberSource business and even to some degree the fraud businesses. So, yes, these transactions are impacted in some way. There will be some impact on it, but that is underlying secular growth in that business. I don't know if you'd add anything? Yes, I think that's right. Clearly, the moderation in volatility is not a big surprise. Volatility last year were very high by historical standards. If anything, they've held up better than we expected so far this year. And even now, they're, I'd say, a little bit higher than long run medians, but not -- last year was real highs that we haven't seen in a while. So that's not a surprise. The cross-border business is recovering almost on track with our expectations, which, again, we had no real crystal ball, but we are very close to what we were expecting. And it's recovering nicely, and it's exactly as we expected. Asia driving it. China playing an important role. The cross-border e-commerce business, in general, the e-commerce business is holding up well. International is very strong, especially Europe. Europe is strong. Define what we may have expected going into the year. If there is a positive surprise, it's clearly Europe. And then other parts of the world like Latin America, many most parts of Latin America and the Middle East are also doing well. And Asia is recovering. So yes, I mean, as you would expect something is better than you expect, something is a little bit lower. But in aggregate, the business is doing as well or better than we expected, as you saw from our results. I don't think we gave you a quarterly revenue growth outlook. So I don't know exactly where that came from. I mean, we said -- we gave you some sense of our planning assumptions for the full year, and said that we would give you one quarter out. Our best sense of the quarter out, which we've done for Q3. And we'll give you our best sense of Q4 when we get to July. Yes. It's additions, we had made over the last 12 months in head count. There's also some unusual items that flow through there that are offset. This is the deferred comp. It hits you on the personnel line, but it's offset on the nonoperating income line. So that distorts it a little bit. But you will see that growth rate start to decline quite a bit because we've been moderating headcount increases as we went through the year. And it's all incorporated in the outlook we gave you for expenses, which we told you with the growth of expenses will flow through the year. It was 2 points or 3 points lower than last quarter. This quarter, it will be 2 points to 3 points lower next quarter and another 2 points to 3 points lower in the fourth quarter, and we're on track for that. Yes. Look, I think we'll stick with what we said earlier. I think you have a good sense of the trends. And if the trends continue, you have -- it's very easy for you to assess what the fourth quarter would look like. And as it relates to value-added services, I don't know, Ryan, if you want to add anything. But clearly, I mean, the approach to value-added services is the yield and answer. If you have the transaction, the more value-added services you can provide, the higher the yield you can get on the transaction, and that is clearly the objective."

            "name": "Ryan McInerney",
            "content": "Hi, everyone. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2023 was very strong with net revenues up 11% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.09, up 17%. Overall, our global quarterly payments volume was up 13% year-over-year, excluding Russia and China. In the U.S., quarterly payments volume was up 10%. Outside the U.S., excluding China and Russia, payments volume was up 17.5%. Excluding intra-Europe, total cross-border volume remained strong, up 32%, with cross-border travel volume at 130% of 2019. Process transactions grew 12% year-over-year. We remain confident that our strategy is focused on the right opportunities. In the second quarter, this strategy continued to deliver, driving strong growth through consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. I'll talk briefly about our progress in each area. Let's start with consumer payments. Consumer payments remains a massive opportunity for Visa. Even with all the digitization over the last several decades, there is still a tremendous amount of cash and check spent globally. There is a very long runway for growth in this business. In consumer payments, the flywheel has three parts: grow credentials, more buyers on the network; grow acceptance, more sellers on the network; and drive engagement, more transactions. We continue to grow credentials, up 7% year-over-year through December and 11% excluding Russia. And we now have more than 6 billion tokenized credentials, up nearly 90% from last year, excluding Russia. We continue to grow acceptance with over 100 million merchant locations worldwide. And tap-to-pay continues to be a powerful driver of engagement. Globally, 74% of all face-to-face transactions outside the U.S. are now taps. In the U.S., we're at 34%, up 7x from three years ago and up more than 10 percentage points from last year. A couple of highlights in the second quarter include U.S. quick service restaurants, where penetration surpassed 40% and in key metro areas across the United States, we continue to see great traction beyond the success in New York and San Francisco, L.A., Detroit, Seattle, San Diego and Ocean to Miami are all now over 40%. Mass transit continues to be one of the best ways to get people used to tapping and we've set records. In the first half of 2023, we processed more than 745 million Visa Tap to Ride transactions globally, up 35% over the first half of last year. We've enabled 55 new transit systems, bringing our footprint to over 650. We also had some significant client wins in the quarter. Starting in North America, we are pleased to have renewed a multiyear agreement with TD, a top 10 North American bank for continued Visa credit and debit issuance in both Canada and the U.S. In Canada, we renewed our relationship with CIBC with a new multiyear agreement for Visa credit issuance. We renewed our partnership with Marqeta, a leading fintech issuer processor and MoneyGram, who is utilizing Visa Direct for cross-border money movement and just recently signed a consumer debit agreement. In Asia-Pacific, UOB one of the leading banks in Asia, has renewed and expanded its relationship with us in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam for both credit and debit cards. OCBC Bank, the second-largest bank in Singapore by market cap, renewed its flagship product and portfolio with us, the OCBC 365 credit card. MUFG bank, the banking arm of Japan's largest financial group, renewed its long-term debit partnership. Chunghwa Post, Taiwan's Post Office and the largest debit issuer in Taiwan has renewed its long-term exclusive partnership with Visa. And in India, we're very excited about a long-term consumer credit contract with Axis Bank, targeting new affluent customer segments. Additionally, I want to highlight an exciting new product innovation that we launched in Japan with our long time partner SMBC. It is a single flexible prudential that a consumer can choose to use as a debit, credit, or prepaid card. SMBC calls the product Olive, and we think it could meaningfully enhance the buying experience for SMBC customers and users in many other countries around the world. Now to Europe, in Germany we've signed a co-brand deal with Solaris and ADAC, which is Germany's largest automobile association with 21 million members. Visa is excited to be the new network of choice for one of the country's largest co-brand portfolios. In Israel, we renewed and expanded our relationship with our largest issuer, Bank Leumi. In Belgium, we recently reached agreements with six issuers to migrate over 2.6 million debit cards to Visa in the next few years, bringing our country total since 2021 to 6.5 million new Visa debit cards. And finally in Latin America, from December 2019 to 2022, we have grown our credentials by 1.5x and our merchant locations by almost 2.5x. Over that time period, the percentage of our total volume that is point-of-sale payments versus getting cash out of an ATM has grown from 46% to 59%, demonstrating the cash digitization happening in the region. In Colombia, we're pleased to partner on a co-brand with LATAM Airlines, the largest airline in Latin America. We continued to strengthen our position in Brazil, renewing our partnership with Itau, the largest private bank in the country. We also announced a new strategic deal with Banco de Brasilia, that expands upon our existing agreement including a popular credit program issued in partnership with one of Brazil's leading football teams with over 40 million fans. Also in Brazil, WhatsApp had already launched peer-to-peer service to facilitate money transfer using Visa Direct, and recently they announced they will be offering payments from consumers to small businesses as well. And more and more, we see clients work with Visa on multiple levels, across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Natura, the world's fourth largest beauty group with 4., -- I'm sorry, 4 million beauty consultants in Latin America is a recent example. In 2020, we announced a deal with them and we just renewed our agreement, which includes digital issuance of a Visa business credential and adds acceptance innovations, as well as CyberSource risk management solutions. Thus far, in Brazil, we've issued cards to almost 50% of the Natura consultants. And we love working with clients that take advantage of our full range of solutions. It's Visa at our best, serving clients in multiple ways across our growth levers. Now let me turn to new flows. The potential payments volume opportunity in new flows is enormous, 10x that of consumer payments. New flows revenue in our second quarter grew more than 20% in constant dollars, excluding Russia. Commercial volume was up 15% in constant dollars and Visa Direct transactions were up 32%, excluding Russia. We've been winning in new flows by executing our network of network strategy. And two weeks ago, we announced a new network called Visa+, that further extends our network of networks. This new network allows users to send and receive payments among different P2P apps through a personalized payment address, a Visa+ Payname. This enables P2P payments from one app directly to another app, as well as gig, creator and marketplace payouts. This can be done through an app, a neo-bank, or a wallet. We're connecting endpoints and form factors and enabling interoperability, our network of network strategy at work. We are launching pilots with several partners including Venmo, PayPal, Tap-to-Pay and Western Union with more to come soon. Let me now turn to Visa Direct. Visa Direct is also a great example of our network of networks. Visa Direct utilizes 66 ACH networks, 11 RTP networks, 16 card-based networks, and five gateways, with the potential to reach nearly 7 billion endpoints globally. We continue to grow Visa Direct with new use cases and partners. For example, in Peru, Banco de Credito del Peru, BBVA, Interbank, and Scotiabank chose Visa Direct as their preferred network and YellowPepper as their technology enabler for the interoperability among their wallets and payment apps. Last year, we announced our agreement with the payments infrastructure platform, Thunes, to add send-a-wallet capabilities to Visa Direct. Similarly, this quarter our cross-border reach continued to grow, expanding coverage to 32 new wallet providers across 22 countries by connecting to TerraPay, a leading cross-border payments infrastructure company. Together, Visa Direct and TerraPay can enable P2P remittances for individuals, as well as business payouts through accounts, wallets, and cards. Enablers remain an important part of our strategy and we're partnering with Pfizer to expand on their U.S. domestic Visa Direct business by commercially launching cross-border capabilities for their clients, starting with outbound payouts. I'll mention two other recent cross-border agreements. We signed a deal with Brightwell, a global payments technology company to leverage Visa Direct to expand cross-border remittances and payout capabilities for their customers in over 175 countries across a variety of industries, such as travel and financial services. And earlier this quarter, PayPal Xoom announced that customers in the United States can send money directly to an eligible Visa debit card in 25 countries, utilizing Visa Direct. In the second quarter, Visa Direct cross-border P2P transactions, excluding Russia, grew nearly 50%. While Visa Direct is growing fast, B2B is the largest component of new flows. And traditional issuance is the core of what we do today in B2B, comprising the majority of the over $760 billion in commercial payments volume year-to-date. I'll highlight three important issuance deals. In Colombia, we renewed with Grupo Bancolombia, the largest issuer acquirer in the country for commercial credit and prepaid, as well as consumer credit. Financial Technology platform, Adyen, has expanded its offerings with a Visa commercial card, initially targeted towards global merchant customers. Visa and Stripe's issuing partnership offers card issuance to enterprise and startup consumers in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe. And for cross-border B2B money movement, which you all know is about Visa B2B Connect, a solution that seeks to deliver predictability, speed, reliability, efficiency, data, and flexibility to our clients. We're building an entirely new network and we're making progress. Over the last six months, we've signed nearly 30 banks in more than 20 countries and payments have been routed to 90 countries globally. And there are several areas for additional expansion in B2B, such as new capabilities, new geographies, and new verticals. Today, I'll talk about two verticals, fleet and fuel and agriculture. In fleet and fuel, we're seeing a big shift in this vertical, where the historically closed-loop systems are opening up and receiving the benefits of our investment and innovation. For example, the Standard Bank in South Africa will issue Visa Fleet Cards in South Africa with plans to roll out across four additional priority markets across Africa in 2024. Over the past two years, Visa has signed or launched fleet-focused solutions for over a dozen providers with more to come. In Latin America, we're bringing our innovative capabilities to an untapped vertical, the agriculture industry. Agriculture represents nearly 15% of the workforce and nearly 25% of the exports in the region, which supplies nearly 15% of the world's food production. Visa has developed a solution called Visa Agro. It provides credit access to farmers in advance of their harvest so that they can buy inputs using Visa credentials, with payment periods aligned with their production cycle. Visa Agro is live in six countries through partnerships with banks, fintechs, processors, and marketplaces. Now, I will touch on value-added services. Value-added services are equally important to Visa's accelerated growth. By offering compelling value-added services, we hope to grow our clients' businesses and deepen our relationships with these clients, increase the yields on our own network volumes, and expand beyond our own network by adding value to non-Visa transactions. Our existing suite of value-added services is impressive. In the second quarter, we had about $1.7 billion in value-added services revenue, up 20% in constant dollars. And our clients continue to add value through value-added services. An example is Wells Fargo. As they modernize their acquiring solutions, they're working with CyberSource to offer enhanced product features and functionality for their merchant services customers. Or in Europe, fiscal year-to-date, we've signed on nearly 80% more clients than last year across 11 countries in our popular risk products, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, which together deliver increased transactions through higher authorization rates, while also lowering fraud. Our network products, which include services such as account and address verification, stop payments, and smarter stand-in processing continued to grow at a rapid pace, with nearly 500 clients added year to date globally. We also enhanced and developed new value-added services, which are helping to drive growth and innovation. I'll briefly share three examples, Visa Acceptance cloud, managed services, and risk as a service. We spoke about Visa Acceptance cloud last year, which moves embedded payment processing from individual devices to the cloud. It eliminates the need for expensive terminals, as well as the cost and time to certify the processing software. I'm pleased to share that First National Bank in South Africa has launched a solution and Visa expects more pilots to follow soon globally. Next is Managed Services, part of our advisory solutions, which is when we embed Visa employees with subject matter expertise within a clients' organization to execute on a specific actionable project, such as an ongoing management of risk and fraud parameters, product implementations, or execution of customer engagement strategies. For example, one issuer for whom we provided end-to-end campaign execution enjoyed a 15% lift in spend and a 40% increase in activation. Managed Services are bringing strong results for our clients and growing revenue twice as fast as our core advisory business through the second quarter. Finally, our Risk as a Service offerings also continued to be utilized, powered by network level data, AI capabilities, and our risk experts. For example, our AI and machine learning-enabled monitoring service identifies suspicious decline activity. For one client, we were able to identify a scheme where fraudsters were testing for valid accounts and then using the accounts to make fraudulent purchases. Visa blocked over $7 million in attempted fraud in just one month on behalf of this client. This is just one example, but you can see how these risk services enable us to both help our clients and generate revenue for Visa. Since launching six months ago, we've added nearly a dozen direct clients across three regions with a very active pipeline. In closing, as you all know, I've been at Visa for nearly a decade, and I can say, I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us. We have a compelling strategy, a world-class team, fantastic clients, and an incredible set of capabilities that I believe are second to none. While the current environment still feels uncertain, we have contingency plans ready and are prepared to take action as needed. We're constantly seeking the right balance between the realities of short term with the enormous opportunities ahead. So with that, now Vasant will lead us through the financial highlights from the quarter and our thoughts on the rest of the year. Thanks for the question. Just before I get into two specific parts that you asked about, just back up, Visa+ is a great example of how a lot of innovations in Visa work. Our team started with a problem in the market, which is people have, we all have these apps with money in them, and it's not easy to get money from one app to another and so starting with the problem, which then created the opportunity, we then together with a number of different parts of the company laid out a roadmap and then announced the Payname feature in the Visa+ network, I guess it was a couple of weeks ago. And like anything to find product market fit, we are starting with kind of some very specific use cases, so, yes, domestic. Yes, we've started with a few partners who happen to be, but not just in the P2P wallet business like PayPal is, with both Venmo and PayPal, we also mentioned Western Union, who is a launch partner with us. In theory, the Payname construct could be extended to really any source of funds on any surface, but we're really focused on, it's early days. We just launched, we think it's a great idea. We think it's got great product market fit. We've gotten really good feedback from the market. We're focused on launching in the U.S. with the partners that we mentioned, then we'll go from there. Thanks for the question, Timothy. No updates, but I'll just kind of again summarize for you how we see things. The changes that the Fed put in place were consistent with our expectations. No changes to the card-present side of things. Obviously, in the e-commerce side of things, it requires issuers to enable to one affiliated networks for e-comm. Most Visa issuers were already in compliance. Those that aren't will be. We've said and continue to believe that there'll be minimum impact in fiscal year '23 and beyond that, it's yet to be determined. We'll kind of see how the marketplace plays out. We continue to believe that merchants are going to want to choose to route transactions to Visa for a number of reasons. One is, in the e-comm space the merchants bear the liability for fraud in e-commerce. So the ability to save a couple of basis points in cost have to be weighed against the risk that comes from the liability of fraud in the e-commerce space. We believe that our tools, capabilities, and platforms to help reduce fraud are second to none. We've got advanced fraud and risk processing capabilities that help both issuers, acquirers, and sellers reduce fraud. And we've also got a product that has dual messaging functionality that, in a number of different use cases whether it's airlines or hotels or rental cars or the retail space, where they are ordering multiple products that are shipped at different times. The enhanced dual messaging functionality is really required. So, as always, we're going to -- we're going to continue to compete vigorously. We're going to continue to invest in our products, our capabilities, our services. The market is very competitive today. It's going to get more competitive, but we like our chances to continue to win. Nothing to add, well said. Hi Bob. I think I heard gist of the question cut in and out a little bit. Let me hit AI and blockchain. I think that's what you're asking. I think more broadly. We're obviously monitoring anything and everything that's impacting commerce and money movement around the world. And our approach is what it has been, which is to lean into those technologies and use them to add value to our products and services and clients and capabilities around the world. I guess, AI and blockchain. On AI, clearly, a lot of activity in generative AI right now. Before I get to that, I'll just mention that we have a long history of developing and using predictive AI and deep learning. We were one of the pioneers of applied predictive AI. We have an enormous data set that we've architected to be utilized at scale by hundreds of AI and ML different services that people use all across Visa. We use it -- we need to run our company more effectively. We use it to serve our clients more effectively. And this will continue to be a big part of what we do. As you transition to generative AI, this is where we see this as an opportunity to take our current AI services to the next level. We are kind of as a platform, experimenting with a lot of the new capabilities that are available. We've got people all over the company that are tinkering and dreaming and thinking and doing testing and figuring out ways that we could use generative AI to transform how we do what we do, which is deliver simple, safe and easy-to-use payment solutions. And we're also spending a fair time thinking how generative AI will change the way that sellers sell, and we all buy and all of the shop. So that is -- it's a big area of opportunity that we're looking at in many different ways across the company. In terms of, I guess, blockchain and crypto, it's -- as far as we see, it's still early days, still emerging technologies. But as we've said in other venues, we see the potential for blockchain. We see the potential for stable coins. If you look at what we're doing in the market today, it's relatively basic, but I'd call it important work. We're enabling on and off ramps on crypto. We're working with exchanges around the world to issue their users Visa credentials, and we're developing the capability for our issuer and acquirer partners to have a choice to settle in stable coins. And we're engaging with central banks all around the world on CBDC priorities. Now the stuff we've got going in the lab, if you will, the R&D work that we're doing is we're testing and ideating on all sorts of different ideas on how we could leverage blockchain and Web3 and Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions, smart contracts. I mean we've got teams of people that are exploring all those different types of innovations. And we'll see how they play out in the market. And if there's things to scale, we want to be part of that. Thanks, Lisa. Yes, we want to connect to any real-time payment network in the planet - on the planet, and that's been our track record so far. That's the short answer to the first part of your question. Just back up, and I'll just take a minute on this. Before I dive into FedNow, let me put it in context as it relates to Visa. Today, I'll start with Visa Debit. Visa Debit is a feature-rich widely adopted safe, simple, secure payment option. We've got global broad-based acceptance. We've got dual message capabilities, as I mentioned earlier, well-established disputes and charge-back processes, well-understood rules and accepted rules, not just in the U.S. but around the world. We've got zero liability fraud protection, tokenization capabilities, risk management tools, security services. And it's a really, really good customer experience. It's a great buying experience. It's a great selling experience. So that's Visa Debit. On Visa Direct, Visa Direct builds on all those features, the scale, the ubiquity, the great experiences to deliver push payment solutions, both domestically and around the world, as I mentioned earlier to 7 billion endpoints. And there, too, it's a really, really good customer experience, both for the user and for the kind of enabler of the experience. So if you put FedNow in context of all of that. So just to talk specifically about FedNow, the first thing I would say is that modernizing the payments infrastructure in the United States is a smart thing to do. It's a necessary thing to do, and it's good for Americans. So that's -- it's something that is a good thing happening in the U.S. And I'd also say that any force that digitizing money movement is a catalyzing force for all of us. And I expect that the FedNow, like TCH, it's going to take some time. It will eventually get traction, but it will take some time to build adoption. And one of the most -- I'd say it this way. One of the most powerful capabilities in payments is ubiquity. RTP doesn't have that yet in the U.S. It will happen, but it's going to take time. And the other thing I'd say is that an RTP transaction is a relatively simple transaction type, it's instant, it's permanent and it's irrevocable. I think over time, it will get enhanced, but that's kind of where we are. So if you take all that and say, what does it mean? I think the most instructive thing to do as we think about real-time payments in the U.S. is look around the world. And if you go to the U.K., we've had faster payments in the U.K. for 15 years now. We haven't seen much, if any, impact on Visa Debit. And the U.K. is also -- it's a robust and growing market for Visa Direct. So just I think we'll see what happens. We'll see how things expand in the U.S., but kind of like I was saying earlier, we like our products. We love our clients. We love the capabilities and teams that we have, and we feel good about our ability to continue to add value and grow the businesses in the U.S. Yes, thanks for the question. We're building out a new network. We know how to do that, and we also know it takes time. If I give you an example and then come back to your question, we're excited to talk with all of you about the success we're having with Visa Direct. The billions of transactions, the use cases, everything that we're seeing now. That journey started many, many years ago, country by country, client by client, working with our issuing clients, especially to get into their tech cues, build out the functionality and then fast forward many years and we're having the success that we're having with that platform today. B2B Connect is in the earlier stages of that. So to your question around the sales cycles, we know how to do it. We've done it with other networks as we built out, but it takes time. Country-by-country around the world we're working with our banks. We're helping them understand the value of the product and the solution, which almost unanimously is the easiest part of the sales process. Like when you compare B2B Connect versus the alternatives that are out there, I mean, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, side-by-side to almost any other alternative that's out there, B2B Connect is a far superior product but it takes store. So we're working on it country by country. I mentioned some of the numbers in my prepared remarks. I don't have any numbers to share today beyond those. And we expect, over time, we'll share more with you about the success we're hopefully having. Yes. I think we've got great sales teams, great product teams all around the world. They're doing a great job sitting with our clients, helping them understand these products and services and getting those products and services embedded into our clients. And we've got a very robust product pipeline across all of our various types of value-added services and we're optimistic about the ability to continue to grow that business."

Visa's performance in the first quarter of 2023 reflects stable domestic volumes and transactions and a continued recovery of cross-border travel. Total Q1 payments volume was up 7% year-over-year or 135% versus three years ago, flat with Q4. Excluding Russia and China, payments volume was up 12% or 146% of 2019. U.S. Q1 payments volume was up 9% year-over-year or 144% of 2019, down 1 point from Q4. International volume, excluding Russia and China, was up 15% or 147% of 2019, up 1 point from Q4. Q1 cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, grew 31% year-over-year and 132% versus three years ago, up 5 points from Q4. Excluding Russia, cross-border year-over-year growth was higher by 4 points. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 6 points from 112% of 2019 in Q4 to 118% in Q1, driven by Asia Pacific, helped by China lifting restrictions, continued modest improvements inbound into the United States and CEMEA benefiting from the FIFA World Cup. Processed transactions were up 10% year-over-year or 139% versus 2019, and we processed 571 million transactions a day during the quarter. Although first quarter net revenues grew -- altogether, I should say, first quarter net revenues grew 12% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21%. In each of our growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, we saw strong revenue growth. In our consumer payments business, we made significant progress this quarter through large deals with traditional issuers and co-brands. And with the pandemic largely behind us, we saw many businesses focused on payments through Visa's new flows capabilities. In addition, we continue to develop and expand our global value-added services globally. Now let me explore each of these growth areas. In consumer payments, credentials grew 8% overall, 11% excluding Russia, with strong double-digit growth in the United States, India and Brazil. Tap-to-pay penetration of face-to-face transactions globally was 72%, excluding Russia and the United States. In the United States, we surpassed a notable 30%, with San Jose, San Francisco and New York City all above 50%. U.S. drugstores went above 40% for the first time in the United States, and nearly 65% of Costco's face-to-face credit transactions were made with a tap. In the United States, we had several important renewals. First, we renewed our partnership with Bank of America in the United States, maintaining our current debit and credit business, including their cash rewards, travel rewards, premium rewards and newly launched Premium Rewards Elite consumer credit cards. We're excited to continue to invest together in the growth of our joint business and to innovate with Bank of America to deliver enhanced capabilities and improved experiences for their customers. Second, we renewed with Commerce Bank, a top 25 Visa U.S. issuer across their consumer and commercial portfolios. Finally, we also renewed our agreement with Capital One. In Australia, we renewed our agreement with the country's largest independent payment solutions provider, Costco, with over 4 million cardholders for debit and prepaid and also signed a new agreement for credit issuance. Also in the region, we extended our exclusive relationship with Kiwibank, the largest New Zealand-owned bank. In Latin America, we renewed with ICBC Argentina, one of the largest issuers in the country, and with Banco do Brasil, one of the largest Visa issuers in the region. In addition, we entered into a new agreement with one of the largest banks in Panama, Banco Nacional de Panam\u00e1. Also in Latin America, we reached a new strategic deal with fintech platform, Tigo Money and parent company, Millicom, a leading provider of telecommunication services in the region. Visa and Millicom expect to offer Tigo Money's more than 5 million wallet users the ability to digitize their cash in an easy and secure way, making purchases wherever Visa is accepted with the Visa-Tigo Money Access Card. Another strategic fintech deal was with Niyo in India, a fast-growing cross-border focused neobank with 5 million customers. We've extended our relationship from debit into credit to grow cross-border spending with affluent as well as corporate customers. We're also happy to share that we renewed and extended our global partnership with HSBC. Our agreement covers consumer and commercial and it will foster growth and digital acceleration. This deal also cuts across all of Visa's five regions. As you know, Visa is the leader in travel co-brand globally, and I'm happy to report that we recently reached agreements with three important travel relationships. First, Qatar Airways' Privilege Club, which today has a split portfolio across networks around the world, has signed a new 10-year exclusive partnership with Visa to enhance and expand its portfolio of co-branded payment initiatives with key financial partners across key markets worldwide. This expanded partnership creates a new world of opportunities for our Visa customers and Privilege Club members to collect and spend Avios, the rewards currency of Privilege Club. Second, with Southwest Airlines in the United States, Visa will continue to be the exclusive payment network for their co-brand credit card issued by JPMorgan Chase. It represents one of the largest co-brand partnerships in the world. Third, with Star Alliance and HSBC in Australia, this is the world's first credit card created with an airline alliance and is issued exclusively on Visa Credit. At the time of the launch, it brought together seven Star Alliance carriers in a single credit card platform. Also, we recently advanced our co-brand partnership with Flipkart, one of India's leading digital commerce entities with a registered customer base of 450 million. So whether it's with traditional issuers or co-brand partners, we are continuing to position Visa well for the future. On to new flows, where this past quarter, new flows continued to grow with revenue up more than 20% in constant dollars led by strong growth in B2B payments volume and Visa Direct transactions. First, on the Visa Direct side, Visa Direct had 1.9 billion transactions in Q1, up 39% year-over-year, excluding Russia. We continue to grow globally. Non-U.S. Visa Direct transactions as a percentage of total transactions expanded nearly 20 points, excluding Russia, from Q1 '21 to Q1 '23. Building on the success of our remittance program with Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong, we recently launched Malaysia as an additional origination market spanning across six currency payers with more currencies to come. We also continue to bring existing use cases to new markets. First, in Australia, Visa Direct is now enabling driver payouts with DoorDash. Second, we launched our inaugural P2P program in South Africa with FNB, one of the country's largest banks to enable their 10 million active customers to move money within their mobile app using Visa Direct rails. Third, we launched our wallet cash payout program in Bangladesh with bKash. With this launch, the nearly 65 million bKash users can make wallet to money, bank transfers, 24/7 in near real time using Visa Direct. We are enabling several use cases, including seller payouts in the United States on Poshmark, a social media marketplace where more than 80 million registered users, and card top-offs with fintech, GoHenry. As a follow-on to the issuance deal we announced last quarter with them, GoHenry is enabling its members to top up their child's prepaid Visa card with Visa Direct first in the UK, with plans to expand this service across Europe in the future. In addition to Visa Direct, we had noteworthy developments in the B2B space this past quarter, where commercial payments volume grew 15% in constant dollars. In traditional issuance, we signed an agreement with Raiffeisen Bank for a new commercial credit partnership in addition to renewing customer -- consumer credit across their 3 million clients in Austria. And in the United States, we renewed with UBS for consumer credit and debit as well as several business credit portfolios and Visa Spend Clarity for business. Another issuing partnership was with Stone, one of the largest acquirers in Brazil focused on small businesses. Stone has recently become a Visa debit and credit issuer of cards that could be embedded digitally in its wallet. On the virtual card front, for accounts receivable and payable, we completed several agreements. First, Divvy, an expense management platform owned by BILL, has renewed its agreement to offer Visa virtual cards for small and midsized businesses in the United States as part of its expense and vendor payment solutions. Second, Viewpost converts U.S.-based B2B check payments to Visa virtual cards. And together, we are expanding card opportunities for issuers and corporates by offering a solution that can be deployed easily to every commercial business that still produces checks. Third, we've reached an agreement with Plate IQ, a leading end-to-end accounts payable automation provider in the United States with direct integrations to accounting systems. Plate IQ will be offering a Visa virtual card solution to commercial partners across multiple industries including restaurants and hospitality, retail and accounting and bookkeeping, among others. Fourth, in our Asia Pacific region, SUNRATE, a global payment and treasury management platform has launched Visa virtual cards as part of its solution for more than 1,000 B2B clients, including global online travel agencies and small business customers. Fleet issuance continues to grow as well. This quarter, we issued -- we signed with Zemo a European fleet and mobility solutions provider to issue Visa Open Loop fleet and fuel commercial cards as they expand from three European markets to 10. In the United States, Highnote, a cloud-native card issuance and embedded finance platform, expanded its relationship with Visa with a five-year card issuance agreement across credit, debit, virtual solutions and fleet. In addition, Highnote became certified as a Visa Fleet card processor, which provides businesses with more specific product category level controls and more detailed and faster data for real-time decisions on new fleet and fuel card programs. B2B is an active space for fintechs and Visa continues to partner with new players to drive innovation for businesses. A recent example is Konfio, a fintech in Mexico that has already issued approximately 50,000 Visa small business cards and recently expanded its agreement to issue Visa Business Infinite cards. In addition, they are positioned to grow acceptance in the market with their newly established acquiring business, Sr. Pago. Now moving to value-added services, which had about $1.7 billion in revenue this first quarter, up more than 20% in constant dollars. Remember that our focus for value-added services is threefold: one, to deepen client penetration of existing products; two, to build and launch new solutions; and three, to expand geographically. CyberSource is a great example on all three areas of focus. First, on deepening client penetration of existing products. CyberSource's Decision Manager offering provides broad capabilities to existing CyberSource clients and has experienced strong growth throughout the pandemic, more than doubling transactions in the last three years. In Q1, transactions utilizing Decision Manager grew in the low teens year-over-year, demonstrating the continued demand for this solution even as we enter a post-pandemic environment. Another area of growth we have mentioned is with acquirers who utilize CyberSource's capabilities to offer them to their merchant clients.  In Q1, we signed agreements with several acquirers for gateway services, including Elavon in North America. In Saudi Arabia, Saudi British Bank has announced its strategic partnership with our CyberSource Payment Gateway and Risk Platform to enhance the overall capabilities of SABB's payment gateway with the aim of fostering the bank's growth in an evolving and dynamic e-commerce space. On extended geographically, we've continued our efforts to strengthen our global presence. Our non-U.S. CyberSource transactions have nearly quadrupled since the first quarter of 2019, and they now comprise the majority of our transactions, led in particular by the Asia Pacific region. CyberSource has also created new offerings. While historically, CyberSource has been an e-commerce capability, over the past few years, we have accelerated the product development of our card-present and omnichannel offerings, including with the acquisition of Payworks back in 2019. In the past quarter, we saw nearly 50% of year-over-year increase in card-present authorized CyberSource transactions. Other value-added services highlights this quarter include our innovative dispute capability through Verifi, which saw nearly 40% growth in cases processed this quarter as we expanded globally with more than 1/3 of our cases from outside North America. This rapid dispute resolution solution automatically resolves disputes between merchants and issuers through the acquirer of rails, reduce the average time to resolve a dispute from 24 days to typically seconds. And Tink, our open banking platform continue to deepen and develop relationships across Europe. Tink recently signed a master agreement with BNP Paribas to be their main open banking and money movement services provider for millions of customers across Europe. Tink is already live with several businesses in the group. 3 million customers use Tink's money management, data enrichment and transactions products at BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium and BNL in Italy. Tink has also renewed and expanded its commitment with ABN AMRO to integrate Tink's Money Manager and data enrichment products into the bank's app for more than 3 million customers. In conclusion, in the first quarter, Visa delivered very strong results and continue to effectively execute our growth strategy. Vasant will go into detail on our thoughts for the rest of the year, but I'd like to make a few other brief closing comments. We will continue to manage our business for the medium to long term, and we'll invest in initiatives that are compelling and will provide future growth, all while being very mindful of the current environment. I continue to see a bright future for Visa as we look ahead to the rest of this year and beyond, and I believe we have the right strategy to continue to deliver great results. As we announced in November, effective February 1, 2023, I'll be stepping down as CEO and assuming the full-time role as Executive Chairman. I'm exceedingly grateful to the Board and leadership of Visa, in addition to all of our passionate 26,500 employee colleagues who helped make this job so rewarding. I'm proud of all that we have accomplished together since I started in 2016. Ryan McInerney will become Visa's CEO, and I cannot think of a finer leader to continue to position Visa at the center of money movement in increasingly innovative ways. I worked side-by-side with Ryan for almost 6.5 years. He knows our business, our clients and he is deeply respected by our employees. He and his team will do a great job, and I expect this transition to be totally seamless.  With that in mind, and as Jennifer alluded to, I've asked Ryan to join the Q&A portion of our call today. But before that, let me hand it over to Vasant to provide financial highlights for the quarter and our thoughts on the second quarter and beyond.\nVasant Prabhu : Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal first quarter results reflect sustained growth in domestic spending and continued recovery in cross-border travel. Net revenues were up 12%, GAAP EPS up 8%, non-GAAP EPS was up 21%. The strong dollar dragged down reported net revenue growth by almost 3 points and non-GAAP EPS growth by approximately 3.5 points. Discontinuation of operations in Russia reduced net revenue growth by about 4.5 points. Adjusted for Russia, net revenues were up almost 20% in constant dollars. Net revenue growth exceeded our expectations as value-added services and new flows growth were very strong, currency volatility stayed high and client incentives were lower than anticipated. A few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year and 35% above 2019. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 46% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume was up 9% year-over-year and 44% over 2019. In constant dollars, international payments volume, excluding China and Russia, was up 15% year-over-year and 47% above 2019. U.S. holiday spending growth was in the high single digits on a year-over-year basis and up more than 41% versus 2019. E-commerce maintained its share of retail spending versus last year, up over 5 points since 2019. Spending continues to smooth out over the holiday season with Black Friday and Cyber Monday still significant shopping days but less important post pandemic. Holiday spending around the globe was generally consistent with U.S. trends. The cross-border travel recovery continues. However, as expected, the pace of recovery has moderated as most borders are now open, including Japan in October and now China in January. As a reminder, we saw a very sharp cross-border travel recovery in October and November of 2021, which we are lapping. Indexed to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, rose 6 points in the first quarter versus a 20-point gain in the third quarter of fiscal year '22 and 10 points in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. New plans -- new flows and value-added services revenue sustained robust growth in excess of 20% in constant dollars. In the first quarter of fiscal year '23, we bought back approximately $3.1 billion in stock at an average price of $198.74. Contributions to the litigation escrow account, which have the same effect as a stock buyback, added another $350 million. We also distributed $945 million in dividends. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 10% year-over-year and 35% over 2019, lapping the credit recovery from last year, and as compared sequentially to last quarter, impacted by retail spending and fuel prices. U.S. debit grew 8%, up sequentially over last quarter. In level to 2019, debit grew 55% withstanding significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. U.S. card present spend grew 8% year-over-year, impacted by fuel prices and retail spend as compared sequentially to last quarter. U.S. card present spend was 26% above 2019. U.S. card not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9% year-over-year and was 65% higher than 2019. E-commerce spend remains well above the pre-COVID trend line even as card-present spending has recovered. On the international front in constant dollars, Latin America was up 25% year-over-year and 107% higher than 2019. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 25% year-over-year and was 108% higher than 2019 as we saw, all through FY '22, growth in both regions was fueled by client wins, cash digitization and acceptance expansion. Europe was up 10% year-over-year and 34% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion that is now nearly complete in the UK. Ex UK, Europe volumes grew 28% year-over-year and was 71% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Ex portfolio conversions, volume trends in the UK remained stable. Asia Pacific, excluding China, continued to recover, up 16% year-over-year and 34% above 2019. Global processed transactions were up 10% year-over-year and 39% over 2019 levels. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe but including Russia in prior periods, were up 31% year-over-year and 32% over 2019. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by about 4 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 3% year-over-year and was 55% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases and Russia, cross-border e-commerce spending grew in the low double digits. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel, represented over 40% of total cross-border volume in the first quarter. Cross-border travel spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 63% year-over-year and is now 18% above 2019. The cross-border travel, excluding Europe, indexed to 2019 went from [114] in September to [121] in December. Travel in and out of Asia recovered sharply in the quarter by more than 12 points from the mid-70s indexed to 2019 to 85 for outbound and more than 90 for inbound helped by Japan. Japan alone improved by about 50 points since opening its borders in October. With China lifting restrictions on January 8, we expect more recovery to come. Europe inbound and outbound remained strong, with the travel indexed to 2019 in the 120s for outbound and 130s for inbound, both up slightly from the fourth quarter. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continues to be strong in the low 140s indexed to 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter. Travel inbound to the U.S. approached 2019 levels and improved 4 points in the quarter, likely due to the weakening dollar. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean remained very strong and stable, indexing around 150 to 2019 levels. Travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the 130s and mid-120s, respectively, relative to 2019, with outbound up more than 10 points in the quarter and inbound by more than 15, helped by the FIFA World Cup. Finally, some color on Mainland China post the removal of COVID zero policies. The 40-day Spring Festival season is underway in Mainland China, the world's largest travel event. Domestic travel is rising sharply. From a revenue standpoint, this will not contribute much. In terms of outbound mainland Chinese travel, this will pick up steam as more flight capacity is available, ticket prices moderate, new passports and visas are obtained and restrictions are lifted in some corridors. The initial destinations for mainland Chinese visitors look to be Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, in particular, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. Inbound travel to Mainland China has not increased much and may not until the COVID situation settles down. Moving now to a quick review of first quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 10% versus the 10% growth in fourth quarter constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was offset by growth from business mix, pricing and card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 6% versus the 10% process transactions growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia. However, our transactions growth is not. Adjusted for Russia, data processing revenues were up 10%. International transaction revenues were up 29% versus the 31% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility, although lower than the fourth quarter and pricing actions, which were offset by exchange rate shifts. Other revenues grew 31%, led by marketing and consulting services, pricing actions and acquisitions. Client incentives were 26% of gross revenues, below expectations due to some adjustments based on client performance and other items. For the year, we expect to renew about 20% of our payments volume with a good amount already completed in the first quarter. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows revenue growth was over 20% in constant dollars. Commercial card volumes grew 15% year-over-year and are up 45% versus 2019. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 39%. Value-added services revenue was also up over 20% in constant dollars, driven by higher volume, increased client penetration and select pricing actions. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. GAAP operating expenses grew 25%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 15%. Non-GAAP operating expense growth was higher than expected, primarily due to a smaller exchange rate benefit. The primary drivers of expense growth were personnel costs from hiring activity in the second half of last year and into the first quarter, as well as G&A expenses driven by lower exchange rate benefits, higher travel and expenses from new acquisitions. Marketing increased 18%, primarily driven by the FIFA World Cup spend and client marketing. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $106 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $7 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates and some other items. Our tax rate was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax initiative coming in at 16% GAAP and 16.5% non-GAAP. GAAP EPS was $1.99, non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 3.5-point drag from the stronger dollar. Through the first three weeks of February, business trends have remained strong and stable. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 14% with debit up 13% and credit up 14%. Lapping of Omicron-related weakness from last year has contributed to strong January month-to-date growth. The Omicron-related uptick will fade as we get into February. These trends are generally consistent with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 14% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 36% year-over-year and was 42% over 2019 and 32% over 2020. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 75% above 2019 and 52% above 2020. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 25% above 2019 and 20% above 2020. We are now past the pandemic recovery stage on domestic volumes and transactions. As such, starting next quarter, we will no longer provide comparisons to 2019 for payments volumes and processed transactions. Since the cross-border recovery is still ongoing, we will continue to provide comparisons to 2019 for cross-border volumes through this calendar year. Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter. For the second quarter, we are assuming that trends in domestic payments volume and processed transactions are sustained with some benefit from lapping Omicron in January last year. As a reminder, discontinuation of operations in Russia will impact reported payments volume growth rates in the second quarter. Russia will not impact reported processed transaction growth. Cross-border e-commerce trends have been stable, too, especially when you adjust for Russia and crypto-related volatility. We're resuming cross-border e-commerce growth rates sustained through the second quarter, ex Russia and crypto. The cross-border travel recovery continued generally in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We are assuming recent trends to sustain into the second quarter. We expect most of the Mainland China travel recovery in the second half and beyond for reasons I outlined earlier. We expect outbound travel from Mainland China to recover first. The pace of inbound travel recovery will depend on the COVID situation. Discontinuation of operations in Russia will reduce second quarter net revenue growth by almost 5 points since we recorded nearly two quarters' worth of service fees in the second quarter of fiscal year '22. Based on where the dollar is today and the forward curve, exchange rates will reduce reported net revenue growth in the second quarter by about 2 points. When you put all this together, our planning assumptions get us to mid-teens constant dollar net revenue growth in the second quarter on a run rate basis i.e., adjusted for Russia. With an almost 5-point Russia impact and a 2-point exchange rate headwind, reported nominal dollar Q2 net revenue growth would be in the high single digits. Client incentives were below our 26.5% to 27.5% range of gross revenues in the first quarter. Second quarter client incentives are expected to run higher at the upper end of the range, finishing the first half in the middle of the range. As we indicated in October, operating expenses growth rates will moderate through the year as we reduce the rate of increase as well as lap higher levels from last year. In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating expense growth in nominal dollars is expected to be 2 points to 3 points lower than the first quarter expense growth. Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expense growth rate is expected to decline an additional 2 points to 3 points, with a further 2 point to 3 point reduction in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items and the litigation provision from the third quarter last year. We currently expect non-GAAP non-operating expense to be in the $40 million to $50 million range in the second quarter, driven largely by higher interest income from our cash balances. Our tax rate is expected to be at the upper end of the 19% to 19.5% range for the rest of the year. With a non-GAAP 16.5% rate in the first quarter, the full year non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to range between 18.5% to 19%. As we said last quarter, should there be a recession or a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our planning assumptions in the second half, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel and other controllable categories. In a business like ours, this always requires a careful balance between short- and long-term considerations. We have contingency plans in place and will activate them should we need to. Our business has been resilient so far this year. Our first quarter performance has demonstrated strong consumer payments growth from cash digitization and client wins. New flows and value-added services momentum remains very strong. There is still much uncertainty from an economic standpoint in the months ahead. We will remain vigilant and ready to act. As we look past fiscal year '23, we remain as optimistic as we've ever been about the long-term growth potential of our business.  Before I finish, this is a sad day for me personally. It's Al's last week as CEO. Al has been the best CEO I've worked for and I've worked for many in my career. Al is a wonderful human being, an exceptional leader with extraordinary business judgment. It has been an eventful six years. Despite a three-year global pandemic, revenues have almost doubled, non-GAAP EPS is up over 2.5x and our stock price has tripled during Al's tenure. I will miss you as CEO, Al, along with 26,500 or so others at Visa.  With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\nJennifer Como : Thanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Thanks, and congratulations to Al and Ryan as well. Vasant, as we think about your baseline plan forecast, how are you factoring in the economy? I mean, are we assuming resilient consumer, stable economy or are you assuming some mild downturn?\nVasant Prabhu : Well, we went through what we call our planning assumptions last -- on the last call for the full year, and we told you we had assumed no recession. As you can see, business trends have been remarkably stable. The spend levels just around the world, they've indexed in the mid-140s for almost four quarters right now, and there's no evidence of a change in trend. That's reflected in our second quarter outlook. At this point, we're not changing any expectations for the second half. I mean, clearly, the dollar has weakened a bit so that will change the exchange rate impact in the second half, but we're not changing any of our views in the second half. I mean, they are planning assumptions. And if there is a slowdown, then we will react accordingly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller : So it's nice to see that -- it seems like from the trends you're seeing in Q1 and what you're guiding for Q2 is an element of conservatism based on the trends so far relative to what we could see in the second half, which I think is what The Street probably wanted. But when we just think about the underlying trends for a moment, I mean, some of the strength we're seeing, like debit being up still high single digits constant currency in the U.S. on really tough comps, combined with other services. Maybe you could just touch on what's the driving forces of both of those metrics because they were a little better than we thought. And I don't know if it's Visa Direct in the debit side helping or it's other factors on share, and then if you could comment on other revenue strength.\nVasant Prabhu : Yes. On debit, it's what we told you earlier. In general, if you look at the -- looking at 2019 has kept us honest, so to speak. It's a good view of what's going on. And there's -- in total spend, it's remarkable stability. What's happening is as good spending slowed down a bit, services spending really took up all the slack. And so consumers have just shifted their spending but they're spending the same amount, and that's why debit has stayed resilient. Debit has been the biggest beneficiary of the move to digitization that happened globally and including in the U.S., more e-commerce, more tap-to-pay, more people using digital credentials just about on any payment occasion. So some people were worried that when things settle down, that debit might start to see some slowdown. But as you've seen, debit has stayed resilient even as credit has recovered, which has kept our overall payment volumes very stable. Those would be the big trends and the other question?\nJennifer Como : Other revenue.\nVasant Prabhu : And other revenue was helped by mostly marketing services and consulting revenue, a fair amount of that linked to the FIFA World Cup. There was a lot of client-related marketing and spending related to the World Cup. Clients ask us to activate a variety of programs and that certainly helped the revenue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs.\nWill Nance : Wanted to kind of double click on some of the comments you made around China. It sounds like you guys are looking towards that region as being a fairly big driver of continued recovery in cross-border travel. I think we heard this morning from your competitor that those volumes in aggregate seem to only be something like 1% to 2% of overall cross-border volumes pre COVID. So was wondering, given how much of a focus this is for investors as a driver of continued strong growth, can you put some guardrails around how we should be thinking about the magnitude of impact of China once it's fully reopened relative to kind of what we saw in the most recent quarter?\nAl Kelly: Well, a couple of things. First, our numbers are fairly close to those of our competitor. We are -- as Vasant said, we really think that, first, we're going to see the travel outbound from China to Southeast Asia. I think it's going to be still a bit of time before we're going to see a Chinese traveler back in Europe at the level of pre pandemic or back in the United States at the level of pre-pandemic. And I think it's going to -- people are going to wait and see what's happening with COVID within China. So Vasant talked about the fact that we're not counting on any kind of recovery that inbound into China into the second half of the year. But my personal expectation is that we'll see probably a spread of three to five quarters before, starting in the second half before China gets back to a level of pre pandemic or 2019. So it is -- for us, it's -- we have built our plan around pretty much what Vasant said in his remarks and what I just said. And if China comes back faster than we're saying, then obviously, that will help us. If it comes back slower, it will have the opposite impact.\nVasant Prabhu : Yes. I mean, in terms of thinking about the impact, you all and we all have been tracking how is our cross-border recovering relative to pre-COVID levels and are we back on the trend line and so on, as you know? And we've told you now for a few quarters that many corridors, and I went through a lot of that, are well above the 2019 level. The three that were not and are still not, U.S. is approaching -- U.S. inbound is approaching 2019 levels and was held back by the strong dollar, but Asia is still -- and I went through the numbers, quite a bit below 2019 levels. Most of Asia is open, only China isn't. So if Asia is going to get back to pre-COVID levels and back to the original trend line, that's where the China impact is going to be visible. And then you expect and we expect that cross-border travel index to keep improving through the year. For that to happen, we obviously need China to come back. So it is important.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with SVB MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis : I had a question about the evolution of Visa Direct. You highlighted the plus 39% year-on-year growth ex Russia in the quarter. Over the last few years, you've been talking a lot with tap-to-pay and contactless about there being sort of this inflection point dynamic where you reach a certain level of critical mass and then growth really accelerates. Is this similar dynamic true for Visa Direct? And can you give us a sense for sort of how we should think about that evolve over the next couple of years?\nAl Kelly: Well, I think, Lisa, you're absolutely right. We're focused in Visa Direct at this point on extending into new geographies, new use cases and more cross-border. I would say those are our focuses. Initially out of the chute, Visa Direct in a country goes through Phase 1, which tends to be P2P before you then get into things like gig economy payouts and transactions like remittances or insurance payments, those kinds of things. So in the United States, and every country is going to go through this kind of evolution where they'll start with P2P, get into things like gig economy payouts and then get into more sophistic and remittances and then more sophisticated use cases. And the United States is much further along that continuum. In other countries, we are -- some good progress kind of in that first phase or 2 but haven't gotten into more sophisticated use cases. And then in other geographies, frankly, we're still not there. So I think there's a tremendous amount of gas left in the tank in Visa Direct. When I look at the opportunities to take use cases to more sophisticated levels in more markets, to open up more markets and to put a real focus on cross-border Visa Direct transactions, which we'll have better yields to them as well. So I think your bottom line theory of your question is -- has some real legitimacy to it, although I would say that it will be probably a bit longer elevation -- a bit longer period of time before you meet the maturity simply because of the different amount of use cases, whereas tap-to-pay is really kind of a single type of initiative.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.\nDavid Koning : Good job. I guess my question, rest of world debit is the one place where I guess, numbers were a little weaker than we had thought, negative 2% on constant currency. Is that just a function of portfolio deconversions, Russia, some of the one-off things? And when does that kind of inflect back into positive territory?\nAl Kelly: I think, Dave, when you look at it ex China and ex Russia, it grew over 10%. And then, yes, the UK migrations, in particular, are happening at a faster pace than we thought. And as Vasant said in his remarks, they're almost fully migrated, so certainly, that is having a dragging impact on the growth as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal : Al, could you give us your latest thoughts on sort of balance sheet deployment, M&A strategy, what you might be looking for, whether this environment is yielding more potential opportunities or deals? Or is it time maybe to not pursue additional deals as the macro environment remains volatile?\nAl Kelly: Nothing has changed in our strategy. We're focused, first and foremost, on organic growth and then growing through M&A, and then from there, dividend and share buybacks in that order. Clearly, there's been a little bit of a burst of the balloon in terms of some of the valuations, in particular, in the fintech world. That's a helpful characteristic of the environment right now. But I think we will continue to look for capabilities and management teams that would bring more value to Visa than we could bring to ourselves organically. And we're in constant evaluation of options. We have a very good corporate development team. It's something that Ryan and Vasant, in particular, spent a good deal of time on. And when we see something that we think will make us better as a company and has a fair value attached to it, we're not afraid to go after it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette : And thanks for all the work and effort, Al, over time. And I wanted to address kind of a bigger picture question for you and maybe for Ryan, is that one of the questions we get a lot from investors is how do we think about kind of the challenges as we eventually reach some level of maturation of card penetration, especially in the U.S. and developed markets, especially given some of the preferences we've seen in other countries for them to develop domestic schemes or at least favor domestic schemes. So just wondering if you can provide a little bit of reflection on what we've seen thus far, and maybe, Ryan, some ideas on how we should think about kind of maturation and expansion issues going forward.\nAl Kelly: I'll start, and then certainly, Ryan, can add. First, I would say that I believe deeply that there is tremendous opportunity in the card -- traditional card world, both in the consumer space as well as in the B2B space. There are still hundreds and hundreds of millions of people to bring into the financial mainstream. There are still trillions of dollars spent on cash and check. And when you look in the B2B space, we see a total addressable market of about $120 billion across carded opportunities, cross-border and payables and receivables, where I talked a bunch about a number of examples that we have worked on over the course of the last quarter. RTP systems are helping to digitize money movement. That's a good thing. If you look at the disruption caused by monetization in India, it ended up being extraordinarily positive in terms of what it's done in terms of growth in card credentials as well as acceptance, which by the way, I also should have said in the traditional world, there's still a tremendous opportunity to grow our acceptance footprint from the level that it's at today. These RTP systems are also helping us and we're leaning into them. They're helping us extend the reach of Visa Direct as we utilize them as part of our network-of-network strategies. They're helping us with open banking through Tink, where we can facilitate greater access to more developers on 1 end and more financial institutions on the other end. I think RTPs represent an opportunity for us to sell value-added services. And I still think the advantages of -- and the capabilities associated with the carded space are still far superior to account that the consumer protections, et cetera. And if you look at PICs in Brazil, you look at UPI in India, these things developed and were put in the marketplace, and we're seeing a fair amount of -- hearing a lot from clients in terms of fraud associated with these networks. And in many ways, that makes sense. They haven't spent the decades and hundreds of millions of dollars that Visa has to build security, fraud capability, risk management capabilities that help keep the ecosystem secure and trusted by consumers. And I think we have the opportunity over time in the A2A space to bring some of those capabilities and earn some good revenue and yield from them. So Ryan, what would you add to it?\nRyan McInerney : Not a lot to add to that, Al. It's great. I mean, James, just in short, we still see a ton of runway. We love our products. We love our people. We love our brand. We love our position and all these markets, whether they're mature or emerging around the world. So tons of runway.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.\nDaniel Perlin : Al, I just wanted to ask a question about how when you look at the new business that you've won, let's say, in the past 12, maybe even 18 months or so, how that kind of sets Visa up as we think about the next, I would say the next two years, not really much beyond that. But the question really here is, is it tilting to take advantage more of debit trends, credit trends, global hospitality? And I'm kind of asking because MasterCard kind of called it out this morning is their positioning in travel, and it sounds like you were also kind of hinting at some positioning for your business. So I would just be interested to know what that new business pipeline that you brought in suggests over the course of the next two years for your company.\nAl Kelly: Well, I'd say a couple of things, Dan. Number one, on the travel front, it's been a focus for us for a long time. And I think we have about 650 co-brands around the world. Many of them are travel co-brands, and I think we're the leading co-brand player on the planet. I think that when I look around the world, there's certainly opportunities with traditional issuers. We've made a lot of inroads in markets like Brazil and Chile, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan over the past year. We've had some great renewals in the United States over the last couple of years from JPMorgan Chase to Wells to the ones I talked about today in terms of Bank of America, Cap One, Commerce Bank.  But we've also made great inroads with fintechs and neobanks. We have had a great track record of wins in the last 24 to 36 months. And a lot of these people are getting to scale in their particular markets. And I think for us, we have to have a wider lens in terms of who can provide services. We're trying to get -- make sure we get Visa cards in as many wallets as we can around the world. And then I'm going to come back to acceptance. One of the great ways to continue to grow our business is to grow our acceptance footprint, which still requires a lot of growth around the world. One of the places we've concentrated on that in the last 1.5 years is Latin America. And if you look at the ratio of spending in Latin America that went from -- moved from cash to PV in the last couple of years. Back in full year 2020, only 46% of Latin America's volume was PV, with 54% being cash. This past quarter, we just finished [59%] of their PV -- [69%] of their volume was purchase volume, so there was a 13-point swing in the Latin America region in the last not even quite three years. And that's a combination of winning with traditional FIs, winning with fintechs, having a localized market-by-market approach with a lot of good -- really good progress in countries that's out in Latin America like Brazil and Chile.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat : Al, best wishes to you and we'll miss hearing from you on this call. Ryan, congratulations. Can you talk about how business growth strategy in organization that has evolved under your leadership? Are you starting to focus more or less on certain things or do some things differently? And Vasant very quickly, can you comment under your decel from your fourth fiscal quarter to 1Q? You talked about some of the dynamics, but how is that relative to your initial expectations?\nAl Kelly: Harshita, I don't think we got the second half of your question because maybe we can knock that off, and then Ryan can talk -- you did?\nVasant Prabhu : I think you were asking about -- you said decel, I'm assuming you meant deceleration between the first and the second?\nHarshita Rawat : Yes.\nVasant Prabhu : Yes. I mean, just a couple of things. The Russia impact is a little larger in the second quarter because we had almost two quarters' worth of service fees last year. Remember, we recognize service fees with a lag, so the service fees recognized in the first quarter were based on Q4 growth rates. So sequentially, Q1 was a little lower, so Q2 service fees will be impacted by that. Also, currency volatility is moderating as we speak. It has been moderating for a few weeks. And incentive growth is a little higher as you saw. So you put it all together, we were a little better than we expected. As you know, we thought we would be high single digits in the first quarter. We were higher for the reasons I mentioned, will be high single digits in the second quarter. That's our expectation right now.\nAl Kelly: Ryan?\nRyan McInerney : Yes, on the first part of your question, I've been a President now for close to 10 years, so I've been shoulder to shoulder with Al and Vasant and the rest of our team as we've made all of our key decisions, as we've developed our strategy, as we've executed our strategy. So probably won't or shouldn't surprise you, I'm going to continue to focus on the three growth pillars that we've laid out, consumer payments, new inflows and value-added services. And my priorities are going to be focused on doing everything that we can to accelerate our progress and accelerate our momentum. So how do we go to market, how do we work with clients, how do we ship product faster, how do we sell solutions more effectively to our clients? And to part of your question, how do we organize. So earlier this month, I announced a new organizational structure that really reflects our strategy that we talked with all of you about all the time. And we believe it's going to help us accelerate our progress in all 3 of those growth factors. To give you a quick sketch of that, Oliver Jenkyn, long-time Visa veteran, who many of you know, is going to lead a new global markets organization that includes driving our consumer payments growth in all of our markets around the world. So our five regional presidents will report to Oliver. Chris Newkirk, who formally led our strategy organization, is going to lead our new flows business unit reporting directly to me. Antony Cahill, who is our former Deputy CEO of Europe, is going to lead our value-added services business unit reporting directly to me. So our global markets team, our value-added services business unit, our new flows business unit, all will report directly to me. And then just to round that out a little bit, Jack Forestell, who also many of you know, will become our Chief Product and Strategy Officer and will partner closely with our President of Technology, Rajat Taneja. And the two of them are focused on delivering a robust product and innovation road map, shipping world-class products and services that help our clients grow their businesses and deepen their relationships with their customers. So that gives you a sense of where we are with strategy and the organization.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research.\nKenneth Suchoski : Thanks for taking the question and congrats to Al and Ryan. I think you mentioned earlier that you're keeping the second half guidance unchanged. Can you just remind us what that guidance was from either a volume or a net revenue standpoint? Just because I think we have only the prior kind of full year guidance, and I know there's FX that's becoming less of a headwind as you get into the second half.\nVasant Prabhu : Yes. When we talked to you last quarter, we said for the full year revenue growth would be somewhere in the mid-teens on a constant dollar basis adjusted for Russia. And then when you adjust for Russia and you adjust for a full year impact at that time of about 2 points on FX, it was going to be high single digits in nominal dollars. And so you know sort of where we are in Q1 and Q2. And exchange rates have moved around some so you can do some of the math. We're basically not changing any views on the second half right now because trends have been still fairly stable. The only thing you might want to change is what the exchange rate impact in the second half might be based on where these are right now. I also gave you fairly clear operating expense expectations. We were about 15% growth in the first quarter. We said growth will be 2 points to 3 points lower in nominal dollar terms in the second quarter, another 2 points to 3 points lower in the third quarter and another 2 points to 3 points lower in the fourth quarter. And that reflects what we had said last quarter that is expense growth will moderate through the year, both as we moderate the rate of increase when also as we lap higher levels of expenses from last year. So those pretty much are the sort of the broad outlines of what we said last quarter. And then we'll update you once again on our next call with any changes we might have based on trends.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Thanks so much, and congrats to Al and Ryan. Excited for both of you. On the renewal front and new deal front, I'll ask on that if you don't mind. Any call-outs on pricing contract requirements, that kind of thing? I know you'd named a bunch of big names on the renewal front. MasterCard talked about the Citizens win there. Just curious what's happening in the whole balance of trade area?\nAl Kelly: Well, it's a competitive world out there, Tien-tsin, as you well know. I think that there's a price that you need to get to and then a lot of it has to do with the combination of incumbency or not, the capabilities you have, what your line-up of customers' clients are in that market, what kind of experience you've had, what kind of innovative ideas you bring to the table, the other kinds of capabilities that we have in terms of services and new flows. So every deal is different and potentially hinging on on different things depending upon the needs of a particular client. And we tried to be very bespoke when we look at deals and talk to clients because their needs and their situation will always tend to be a bit different.\nJennifer Como : And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Visa's performance in the first quarter of 2023 reflects stable domestic volumes and transactions and a continued recovery of cross-border travel. Total Q1 payments volume was up 7% year-over-year or 135% versus three years ago, flat with Q4. Excluding Russia and China, payments volume was up 12% or 146% of 2019. U.S. Q1 payments volume was up 9% year-over-year or 144% of 2019, down 1 point from Q4. International volume, excluding Russia and China, was up 15% or 147% of 2019, up 1 point from Q4. Q1 cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, grew 31% year-over-year and 132% versus three years ago, up 5 points from Q4. Excluding Russia, cross-border year-over-year growth was higher by 4 points. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 6 points from 112% of 2019 in Q4 to 118% in Q1, driven by Asia Pacific, helped by China lifting restrictions, continued modest improvements inbound into the United States and CEMEA benefiting from the FIFA World Cup. Processed transactions were up 10% year-over-year or 139% versus 2019, and we processed 571 million transactions a day during the quarter. Although first quarter net revenues grew -- altogether, I should say, first quarter net revenues grew 12% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21%. In each of our growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, we saw strong revenue growth. In our consumer payments business, we made significant progress this quarter through large deals with traditional issuers and co-brands. And with the pandemic largely behind us, we saw many businesses focused on payments through Visa's new flows capabilities. In addition, we continue to develop and expand our global value-added services globally. Now let me explore each of these growth areas. In consumer payments, credentials grew 8% overall, 11% excluding Russia, with strong double-digit growth in the United States, India and Brazil. Tap-to-pay penetration of face-to-face transactions globally was 72%, excluding Russia and the United States. In the United States, we surpassed a notable 30%, with San Jose, San Francisco and New York City all above 50%. U.S. drugstores went above 40% for the first time in the United States, and nearly 65% of Costco's face-to-face credit transactions were made with a tap. In the United States, we had several important renewals. First, we renewed our partnership with Bank of America in the United States, maintaining our current debit and credit business, including their cash rewards, travel rewards, premium rewards and newly launched Premium Rewards Elite consumer credit cards. We're excited to continue to invest together in the growth of our joint business and to innovate with Bank of America to deliver enhanced capabilities and improved experiences for their customers. Second, we renewed with Commerce Bank, a top 25 Visa U.S. issuer across their consumer and commercial portfolios. Finally, we also renewed our agreement with Capital One. In Australia, we renewed our agreement with the country's largest independent payment solutions provider, Costco, with over 4 million cardholders for debit and prepaid and also signed a new agreement for credit issuance. Also in the region, we extended our exclusive relationship with Kiwibank, the largest New Zealand-owned bank. In Latin America, we renewed with ICBC Argentina, one of the largest issuers in the country, and with Banco do Brasil, one of the largest Visa issuers in the region. In addition, we entered into a new agreement with one of the largest banks in Panama, Banco Nacional de Panama\u0301. Also in Latin America, we reached a new strategic deal with fintech platform, Tigo Money and parent company, Millicom, a leading provider of telecommunication services in the region. Visa and Millicom expect to offer Tigo Money's more than 5 million wallet users the ability to digitize their cash in an easy and secure way, making purchases wherever Visa is accepted with the Visa-Tigo Money Access Card. Another strategic fintech deal was with Niyo in India, a fast-growing cross-border focused neobank with 5 million customers. We've extended our relationship from debit into credit to grow cross-border spending with affluent as well as corporate customers. We're also happy to share that we renewed and extended our global partnership with HSBC. Our agreement covers consumer and commercial and it will foster growth and digital acceleration. This deal also cuts across all of Visa's five regions. As you know, Visa is the leader in travel co-brand globally, and I'm happy to report that we recently reached agreements with three important travel relationships. First, Qatar Airways' Privilege Club, which today has a split portfolio across networks around the world, has signed a new 10-year exclusive partnership with Visa to enhance and expand its portfolio of co-branded payment initiatives with key financial partners across key markets worldwide. This expanded partnership creates a new world of opportunities for our Visa customers and Privilege Club members to collect and spend Avios, the rewards currency of Privilege Club. Second, with Southwest Airlines in the United States, Visa will continue to be the exclusive payment network for their co-brand credit card issued by JPMorgan Chase. It represents one of the largest co-brand partnerships in the world. Third, with Star Alliance and HSBC in Australia, this is the world's first credit card created with an airline alliance and is issued exclusively on Visa Credit. At the time of the launch, it brought together seven Star Alliance carriers in a single credit card platform. Also, we recently advanced our co-brand partnership with Flipkart, one of India's leading digital commerce entities with a registered customer base of 450 million. So whether it's with traditional issuers or co-brand partners, we are continuing to position Visa well for the future. On to new flows, where this past quarter, new flows continued to grow with revenue up more than 20% in constant dollars led by strong growth in B2B payments volume and Visa Direct transactions. First, on the Visa Direct side, Visa Direct had 1.9 billion transactions in Q1, up 39% year-over-year, excluding Russia. We continue to grow globally. Non-U.S. Visa Direct transactions as a percentage of total transactions expanded nearly 20 points, excluding Russia, from Q1 '21 to Q1 '23. Building on the success of our remittance program with Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong, we recently launched Malaysia as an additional origination market spanning across six currency payers with more currencies to come. We also continue to bring existing use cases to new markets. First, in Australia, Visa Direct is now enabling driver payouts with DoorDash. Second, we launched our inaugural P2P program in South Africa with FNB, one of the country's largest banks to enable their 10 million active customers to move money within their mobile app using Visa Direct rails. Third, we launched our wallet cash payout program in Bangladesh with bKash. With this launch, the nearly 65 million bKash users can make wallet to money, bank transfers, 24/7 in near real time using Visa Direct. We are enabling several use cases, including seller payouts in the United States on Poshmark, a social media marketplace where more than 80 million registered users, and card top-offs with fintech, GoHenry. As a follow-on to the issuance deal we announced last quarter with them, GoHenry is enabling its members to top up their child's prepaid Visa card with Visa Direct first in the UK, with plans to expand this service across Europe in the future. In addition to Visa Direct, we had noteworthy developments in the B2B space this past quarter, where commercial payments volume grew 15% in constant dollars. In traditional issuance, we signed an agreement with Raiffeisen Bank for a new commercial credit partnership in addition to renewing customer -- consumer credit across their 3 million clients in Austria. And in the United States, we renewed with UBS for consumer credit and debit as well as several business credit portfolios and Visa Spend Clarity for business. Another issuing partnership was with Stone, one of the largest acquirers in Brazil focused on small businesses. Stone has recently become a Visa debit and credit issuer of cards that could be embedded digitally in its wallet. On the virtual card front, for accounts receivable and payable, we completed several agreements. First, Divvy, an expense management platform owned by BILL, has renewed its agreement to offer Visa virtual cards for small and midsized businesses in the United States as part of its expense and vendor payment solutions. Second, Viewpost converts U.S.-based B2B check payments to Visa virtual cards. And together, we are expanding card opportunities for issuers and corporates by offering a solution that can be deployed easily to every commercial business that still produces checks. Third, we've reached an agreement with Plate IQ, a leading end-to-end accounts payable automation provider in the United States with direct integrations to accounting systems. Plate IQ will be offering a Visa virtual card solution to commercial partners across multiple industries including restaurants and hospitality, retail and accounting and bookkeeping, among others. Fourth, in our Asia Pacific region, SUNRATE, a global payment and treasury management platform has launched Visa virtual cards as part of its solution for more than 1,000 B2B clients, including global online travel agencies and small business customers. Fleet issuance continues to grow as well. This quarter, we issued -- we signed with Zemo a European fleet and mobility solutions provider to issue Visa Open Loop fleet and fuel commercial cards as they expand from three European markets to 10. In the United States, Highnote, a cloud-native card issuance and embedded finance platform, expanded its relationship with Visa with a five-year card issuance agreement across credit, debit, virtual solutions and fleet. In addition, Highnote became certified as a Visa Fleet card processor, which provides businesses with more specific product category level controls and more detailed and faster data for real-time decisions on new fleet and fuel card programs. B2B is an active space for fintechs and Visa continues to partner with new players to drive innovation for businesses. A recent example is Konfio, a fintech in Mexico that has already issued approximately 50,000 Visa small business cards and recently expanded its agreement to issue Visa Business Infinite cards. In addition, they are positioned to grow acceptance in the market with their newly established acquiring business, Sr. Pago. Now moving to value-added services, which had about $1.7 billion in revenue this first quarter, up more than 20% in constant dollars. Remember that our focus for value-added services is threefold: one, to deepen client penetration of existing products; two, to build and launch new solutions; and three, to expand geographically. CyberSource is a great example on all three areas of focus. First, on deepening client penetration of existing products. CyberSource's Decision Manager offering provides broad capabilities to existing CyberSource clients and has experienced strong growth throughout the pandemic, more than doubling transactions in the last three years. In Q1, transactions utilizing Decision Manager grew in the low teens year-over-year, demonstrating the continued demand for this solution even as we enter a post-pandemic environment. Another area of growth we have mentioned is with acquirers who utilize CyberSource's capabilities to offer them to their merchant clients.  In Q1, we signed agreements with several acquirers for gateway services, including Elavon in North America. In Saudi Arabia, Saudi British Bank has announced its strategic partnership with our CyberSource Payment Gateway and Risk Platform to enhance the overall capabilities of SABB's payment gateway with the aim of fostering the bank's growth in an evolving and dynamic e-commerce space. On extended geographically, we've continued our efforts to strengthen our global presence. Our non-U.S. CyberSource transactions have nearly quadrupled since the first quarter of 2019, and they now comprise the majority of our transactions, led in particular by the Asia Pacific region. CyberSource has also created new offerings. While historically, CyberSource has been an e-commerce capability, over the past few years, we have accelerated the product development of our card-present and omnichannel offerings, including with the acquisition of Payworks back in 2019. In the past quarter, we saw nearly 50% of year-over-year increase in card-present authorized CyberSource transactions. Other value-added services highlights this quarter include our innovative dispute capability through Verifi, which saw nearly 40% growth in cases processed this quarter as we expanded globally with more than 1/3 of our cases from outside North America. This rapid dispute resolution solution automatically resolves disputes between merchants and issuers through the acquirer of rails, reduce the average time to resolve a dispute from 24 days to typically seconds. And Tink, our open banking platform continue to deepen and develop relationships across Europe. Tink recently signed a master agreement with BNP Paribas to be their main open banking and money movement services provider for millions of customers across Europe. Tink is already live with several businesses in the group. 3 million customers use Tink's money management, data enrichment and transactions products at BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium and BNL in Italy. Tink has also renewed and expanded its commitment with ABN AMRO to integrate Tink's Money Manager and data enrichment products into the bank's app for more than 3 million customers. In conclusion, in the first quarter, Visa delivered very strong results and continue to effectively execute our growth strategy. Vasant will go into detail on our thoughts for the rest of the year, but I'd like to make a few other brief closing comments. We will continue to manage our business for the medium to long term, and we'll invest in initiatives that are compelling and will provide future growth, all while being very mindful of the current environment. I continue to see a bright future for Visa as we look ahead to the rest of this year and beyond, and I believe we have the right strategy to continue to deliver great results. As we announced in November, effective February 1, 2023, I'll be stepping down as CEO and assuming the full-time role as Executive Chairman. I'm exceedingly grateful to the Board and leadership of Visa, in addition to all of our passionate 26,500 employee colleagues who helped make this job so rewarding. I'm proud of all that we have accomplished together since I started in 2016. Ryan McInerney will become Visa's CEO, and I cannot think of a finer leader to continue to position Visa at the center of money movement in increasingly innovative ways. I worked side-by-side with Ryan for almost 6.5 years. He knows our business, our clients and he is deeply respected by our employees. He and his team will do a great job, and I expect this transition to be totally seamless.  With that in mind, and as Jennifer alluded to, I've asked Ryan to join the Q&A portion of our call today. But before that, let me hand it over to Vasant to provide financial highlights for the quarter and our thoughts on the second quarter and beyond. Well, a couple of things. First, our numbers are fairly close to those of our competitor. We are -- as Vasant said, we really think that, first, we're going to see the travel outbound from China to Southeast Asia. I think it's going to be still a bit of time before we're going to see a Chinese traveler back in Europe at the level of pre pandemic or back in the United States at the level of pre-pandemic. And I think it's going to -- people are going to wait and see what's happening with COVID within China. So Vasant talked about the fact that we're not counting on any kind of recovery that inbound into China into the second half of the year. But my personal expectation is that we'll see probably a spread of three to five quarters before, starting in the second half before China gets back to a level of pre pandemic or 2019. So it is -- for us, it's -- we have built our plan around pretty much what Vasant said in his remarks and what I just said. And if China comes back faster than we're saying, then obviously, that will help us. If it comes back slower, it will have the opposite impact. Well, I think, Lisa, you're absolutely right. We're focused in Visa Direct at this point on extending into new geographies, new use cases and more cross-border. I would say those are our focuses. Initially out of the chute, Visa Direct in a country goes through Phase 1, which tends to be P2P before you then get into things like gig economy payouts and transactions like remittances or insurance payments, those kinds of things. So in the United States, and every country is going to go through this kind of evolution where they'll start with P2P, get into things like gig economy payouts and then get into more sophistic and remittances and then more sophisticated use cases. And the United States is much further along that continuum. In other countries, we are -- some good progress kind of in that first phase or 2 but haven't gotten into more sophisticated use cases. And then in other geographies, frankly, we're still not there. So I think there's a tremendous amount of gas left in the tank in Visa Direct. When I look at the opportunities to take use cases to more sophisticated levels in more markets, to open up more markets and to put a real focus on cross-border Visa Direct transactions, which we'll have better yields to them as well. So I think your bottom line theory of your question is -- has some real legitimacy to it, although I would say that it will be probably a bit longer elevation -- a bit longer period of time before you meet the maturity simply because of the different amount of use cases, whereas tap-to-pay is really kind of a single type of initiative. I think, Dave, when you look at it ex China and ex Russia, it grew over 10%. And then, yes, the UK migrations, in particular, are happening at a faster pace than we thought. And as Vasant said in his remarks, they're almost fully migrated, so certainly, that is having a dragging impact on the growth as well. Nothing has changed in our strategy. We're focused, first and foremost, on organic growth and then growing through M&A, and then from there, dividend and share buybacks in that order. Clearly, there's been a little bit of a burst of the balloon in terms of some of the valuations, in particular, in the fintech world. That's a helpful characteristic of the environment right now. But I think we will continue to look for capabilities and management teams that would bring more value to Visa than we could bring to ourselves organically. And we're in constant evaluation of options. We have a very good corporate development team. It's something that Ryan and Vasant, in particular, spent a good deal of time on. And when we see something that we think will make us better as a company and has a fair value attached to it, we're not afraid to go after it. I'll start, and then certainly, Ryan, can add. First, I would say that I believe deeply that there is tremendous opportunity in the card -- traditional card world, both in the consumer space as well as in the B2B space. There are still hundreds and hundreds of millions of people to bring into the financial mainstream. There are still trillions of dollars spent on cash and check. And when you look in the B2B space, we see a total addressable market of about $120 billion across carded opportunities, cross-border and payables and receivables, where I talked a bunch about a number of examples that we have worked on over the course of the last quarter. RTP systems are helping to digitize money movement. That's a good thing. If you look at the disruption caused by monetization in India, it ended up being extraordinarily positive in terms of what it's done in terms of growth in card credentials as well as acceptance, which by the way, I also should have said in the traditional world, there's still a tremendous opportunity to grow our acceptance footprint from the level that it's at today. These RTP systems are also helping us and we're leaning into them. They're helping us extend the reach of Visa Direct as we utilize them as part of our network-of-network strategies. They're helping us with open banking through Tink, where we can facilitate greater access to more developers on 1 end and more financial institutions on the other end. I think RTPs represent an opportunity for us to sell value-added services. And I still think the advantages of -- and the capabilities associated with the carded space are still far superior to account that the consumer protections, et cetera. And if you look at PICs in Brazil, you look at UPI in India, these things developed and were put in the marketplace, and we're seeing a fair amount of -- hearing a lot from clients in terms of fraud associated with these networks. And in many ways, that makes sense. They haven't spent the decades and hundreds of millions of dollars that Visa has to build security, fraud capability, risk management capabilities that help keep the ecosystem secure and trusted by consumers. And I think we have the opportunity over time in the A2A space to bring some of those capabilities and earn some good revenue and yield from them. So Ryan, what would you add to it? Well, I'd say a couple of things, Dan. Number one, on the travel front, it's been a focus for us for a long time. And I think we have about 650 co-brands around the world. Many of them are travel co-brands, and I think we're the leading co-brand player on the planet. I think that when I look around the world, there's certainly opportunities with traditional issuers. We've made a lot of inroads in markets like Brazil and Chile, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan over the past year. We've had some great renewals in the United States over the last couple of years from JPMorgan Chase to Wells to the ones I talked about today in terms of Bank of America, Cap One, Commerce Bank.  But we've also made great inroads with fintechs and neobanks. We have had a great track record of wins in the last 24 to 36 months. And a lot of these people are getting to scale in their particular markets. And I think for us, we have to have a wider lens in terms of who can provide services. We're trying to get -- make sure we get Visa cards in as many wallets as we can around the world. And then I'm going to come back to acceptance. One of the great ways to continue to grow our business is to grow our acceptance footprint, which still requires a lot of growth around the world. One of the places we've concentrated on that in the last 1.5 years is Latin America. And if you look at the ratio of spending in Latin America that went from -- moved from cash to PV in the last couple of years. Back in full year 2020, only 46% of Latin America's volume was PV, with 54% being cash. This past quarter, we just finished [59%] of their PV -- [69%] of their volume was purchase volume, so there was a 13-point swing in the Latin America region in the last not even quite three years. And that's a combination of winning with traditional FIs, winning with fintechs, having a localized market-by-market approach with a lot of good -- really good progress in countries that's out in Latin America like Brazil and Chile. Harshita, I don't think we got the second half of your question because maybe we can knock that off, and then Ryan can talk -- you did? Ryan? Well, it's a competitive world out there, Tien-tsin, as you well know. I think that there's a price that you need to get to and then a lot of it has to do with the combination of incumbency or not, the capabilities you have, what your line-up of customers' clients are in that market, what kind of experience you've had, what kind of innovative ideas you bring to the table, the other kinds of capabilities that we have in terms of services and new flows. So every deal is different and potentially hinging on on different things depending upon the needs of a particular client. And we tried to be very bespoke when we look at deals and talk to clients because their needs and their situation will always tend to be a bit different."

            "content": "Not a lot to add to that, Al. It's great. I mean, James, just in short, we still see a ton of runway. We love our products. We love our people. We love our brand. We love our position and all these markets, whether they're mature or emerging around the world. So tons of runway. Yes, on the first part of your question, I've been a President now for close to 10 years, so I've been shoulder to shoulder with Al and Vasant and the rest of our team as we've made all of our key decisions, as we've developed our strategy, as we've executed our strategy. So probably won't or shouldn't surprise you, I'm going to continue to focus on the three growth pillars that we've laid out, consumer payments, new inflows and value-added services. And my priorities are going to be focused on doing everything that we can to accelerate our progress and accelerate our momentum. So how do we go to market, how do we work with clients, how do we ship product faster, how do we sell solutions more effectively to our clients? And to part of your question, how do we organize. So earlier this month, I announced a new organizational structure that really reflects our strategy that we talked with all of you about all the time. And we believe it's going to help us accelerate our progress in all 3 of those growth factors. To give you a quick sketch of that, Oliver Jenkyn, long-time Visa veteran, who many of you know, is going to lead a new global markets organization that includes driving our consumer payments growth in all of our markets around the world. So our five regional presidents will report to Oliver. Chris Newkirk, who formally led our strategy organization, is going to lead our new flows business unit reporting directly to me. Antony Cahill, who is our former Deputy CEO of Europe, is going to lead our value-added services business unit reporting directly to me. So our global markets team, our value-added services business unit, our new flows business unit, all will report directly to me. And then just to round that out a little bit, Jack Forestell, who also many of you know, will become our Chief Product and Strategy Officer and will partner closely with our President of Technology, Rajat Taneja. And the two of them are focused on delivering a robust product and innovation road map, shipping world-class products and services that help our clients grow their businesses and deepen their relationships with their customers. So that gives you a sense of where we are with strategy and the organization."

            "name": "Vasant Prabhu",
            "content": "Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal first quarter results reflect sustained growth in domestic spending and continued recovery in cross-border travel. Net revenues were up 12%, GAAP EPS up 8%, non-GAAP EPS was up 21%. The strong dollar dragged down reported net revenue growth by almost 3 points and non-GAAP EPS growth by approximately 3.5 points. Discontinuation of operations in Russia reduced net revenue growth by about 4.5 points. Adjusted for Russia, net revenues were up almost 20% in constant dollars. Net revenue growth exceeded our expectations as value-added services and new flows growth were very strong, currency volatility stayed high and client incentives were lower than anticipated. A few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year and 35% above 2019. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 46% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume was up 9% year-over-year and 44% over 2019. In constant dollars, international payments volume, excluding China and Russia, was up 15% year-over-year and 47% above 2019. U.S. holiday spending growth was in the high single digits on a year-over-year basis and up more than 41% versus 2019. E-commerce maintained its share of retail spending versus last year, up over 5 points since 2019. Spending continues to smooth out over the holiday season with Black Friday and Cyber Monday still significant shopping days but less important post pandemic. Holiday spending around the globe was generally consistent with U.S. trends. The cross-border travel recovery continues. However, as expected, the pace of recovery has moderated as most borders are now open, including Japan in October and now China in January. As a reminder, we saw a very sharp cross-border travel recovery in October and November of 2021, which we are lapping. Indexed to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, rose 6 points in the first quarter versus a 20-point gain in the third quarter of fiscal year '22 and 10 points in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. New plans -- new flows and value-added services revenue sustained robust growth in excess of 20% in constant dollars. In the first quarter of fiscal year '23, we bought back approximately $3.1 billion in stock at an average price of $198.74. Contributions to the litigation escrow account, which have the same effect as a stock buyback, added another $350 million. We also distributed $945 million in dividends. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 10% year-over-year and 35% over 2019, lapping the credit recovery from last year, and as compared sequentially to last quarter, impacted by retail spending and fuel prices. U.S. debit grew 8%, up sequentially over last quarter. In level to 2019, debit grew 55% withstanding significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. U.S. card present spend grew 8% year-over-year, impacted by fuel prices and retail spend as compared sequentially to last quarter. U.S. card present spend was 26% above 2019. U.S. card not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9% year-over-year and was 65% higher than 2019. E-commerce spend remains well above the pre-COVID trend line even as card-present spending has recovered. On the international front in constant dollars, Latin America was up 25% year-over-year and 107% higher than 2019. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 25% year-over-year and was 108% higher than 2019 as we saw, all through FY '22, growth in both regions was fueled by client wins, cash digitization and acceptance expansion. Europe was up 10% year-over-year and 34% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion that is now nearly complete in the UK. Ex UK, Europe volumes grew 28% year-over-year and was 71% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Ex portfolio conversions, volume trends in the UK remained stable. Asia Pacific, excluding China, continued to recover, up 16% year-over-year and 34% above 2019. Global processed transactions were up 10% year-over-year and 39% over 2019 levels. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe but including Russia in prior periods, were up 31% year-over-year and 32% over 2019. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by about 4 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 3% year-over-year and was 55% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases and Russia, cross-border e-commerce spending grew in the low double digits. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel, represented over 40% of total cross-border volume in the first quarter. Cross-border travel spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 63% year-over-year and is now 18% above 2019. The cross-border travel, excluding Europe, indexed to 2019 went from [114] in September to [121] in December. Travel in and out of Asia recovered sharply in the quarter by more than 12 points from the mid-70s indexed to 2019 to 85 for outbound and more than 90 for inbound helped by Japan. Japan alone improved by about 50 points since opening its borders in October. With China lifting restrictions on January 8, we expect more recovery to come. Europe inbound and outbound remained strong, with the travel indexed to 2019 in the 120s for outbound and 130s for inbound, both up slightly from the fourth quarter. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continues to be strong in the low 140s indexed to 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter. Travel inbound to the U.S. approached 2019 levels and improved 4 points in the quarter, likely due to the weakening dollar. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean remained very strong and stable, indexing around 150 to 2019 levels. Travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the 130s and mid-120s, respectively, relative to 2019, with outbound up more than 10 points in the quarter and inbound by more than 15, helped by the FIFA World Cup. Finally, some color on Mainland China post the removal of COVID zero policies. The 40-day Spring Festival season is underway in Mainland China, the world's largest travel event. Domestic travel is rising sharply. From a revenue standpoint, this will not contribute much. In terms of outbound mainland Chinese travel, this will pick up steam as more flight capacity is available, ticket prices moderate, new passports and visas are obtained and restrictions are lifted in some corridors. The initial destinations for mainland Chinese visitors look to be Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, in particular, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. Inbound travel to Mainland China has not increased much and may not until the COVID situation settles down. Moving now to a quick review of first quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 10% versus the 10% growth in fourth quarter constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was offset by growth from business mix, pricing and card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 6% versus the 10% process transactions growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia. However, our transactions growth is not. Adjusted for Russia, data processing revenues were up 10%. International transaction revenues were up 29% versus the 31% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility, although lower than the fourth quarter and pricing actions, which were offset by exchange rate shifts. Other revenues grew 31%, led by marketing and consulting services, pricing actions and acquisitions. Client incentives were 26% of gross revenues, below expectations due to some adjustments based on client performance and other items. For the year, we expect to renew about 20% of our payments volume with a good amount already completed in the first quarter. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows revenue growth was over 20% in constant dollars. Commercial card volumes grew 15% year-over-year and are up 45% versus 2019. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 39%. Value-added services revenue was also up over 20% in constant dollars, driven by higher volume, increased client penetration and select pricing actions. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. GAAP operating expenses grew 25%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 15%. Non-GAAP operating expense growth was higher than expected, primarily due to a smaller exchange rate benefit. The primary drivers of expense growth were personnel costs from hiring activity in the second half of last year and into the first quarter, as well as G&A expenses driven by lower exchange rate benefits, higher travel and expenses from new acquisitions. Marketing increased 18%, primarily driven by the FIFA World Cup spend and client marketing. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $106 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $7 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates and some other items. Our tax rate was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax initiative coming in at 16% GAAP and 16.5% non-GAAP. GAAP EPS was $1.99, non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 3.5-point drag from the stronger dollar. Through the first three weeks of February, business trends have remained strong and stable. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 14% with debit up 13% and credit up 14%. Lapping of Omicron-related weakness from last year has contributed to strong January month-to-date growth. The Omicron-related uptick will fade as we get into February. These trends are generally consistent with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 14% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 36% year-over-year and was 42% over 2019 and 32% over 2020. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 75% above 2019 and 52% above 2020. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 25% above 2019 and 20% above 2020. We are now past the pandemic recovery stage on domestic volumes and transactions. As such, starting next quarter, we will no longer provide comparisons to 2019 for payments volumes and processed transactions. Since the cross-border recovery is still ongoing, we will continue to provide comparisons to 2019 for cross-border volumes through this calendar year. Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter. For the second quarter, we are assuming that trends in domestic payments volume and processed transactions are sustained with some benefit from lapping Omicron in January last year. As a reminder, discontinuation of operations in Russia will impact reported payments volume growth rates in the second quarter. Russia will not impact reported processed transaction growth. Cross-border e-commerce trends have been stable, too, especially when you adjust for Russia and crypto-related volatility. We're resuming cross-border e-commerce growth rates sustained through the second quarter, ex Russia and crypto. The cross-border travel recovery continued generally in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We are assuming recent trends to sustain into the second quarter. We expect most of the Mainland China travel recovery in the second half and beyond for reasons I outlined earlier. We expect outbound travel from Mainland China to recover first. The pace of inbound travel recovery will depend on the COVID situation. Discontinuation of operations in Russia will reduce second quarter net revenue growth by almost 5 points since we recorded nearly two quarters' worth of service fees in the second quarter of fiscal year '22. Based on where the dollar is today and the forward curve, exchange rates will reduce reported net revenue growth in the second quarter by about 2 points. When you put all this together, our planning assumptions get us to mid-teens constant dollar net revenue growth in the second quarter on a run rate basis i.e., adjusted for Russia. With an almost 5-point Russia impact and a 2-point exchange rate headwind, reported nominal dollar Q2 net revenue growth would be in the high single digits. Client incentives were below our 26.5% to 27.5% range of gross revenues in the first quarter. Second quarter client incentives are expected to run higher at the upper end of the range, finishing the first half in the middle of the range. As we indicated in October, operating expenses growth rates will moderate through the year as we reduce the rate of increase as well as lap higher levels from last year. In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating expense growth in nominal dollars is expected to be 2 points to 3 points lower than the first quarter expense growth. Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expense growth rate is expected to decline an additional 2 points to 3 points, with a further 2 point to 3 point reduction in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items and the litigation provision from the third quarter last year. We currently expect non-GAAP non-operating expense to be in the $40 million to $50 million range in the second quarter, driven largely by higher interest income from our cash balances. Our tax rate is expected to be at the upper end of the 19% to 19.5% range for the rest of the year. With a non-GAAP 16.5% rate in the first quarter, the full year non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to range between 18.5% to 19%. As we said last quarter, should there be a recession or a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our planning assumptions in the second half, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel and other controllable categories. In a business like ours, this always requires a careful balance between short- and long-term considerations. We have contingency plans in place and will activate them should we need to. Our business has been resilient so far this year. Our first quarter performance has demonstrated strong consumer payments growth from cash digitization and client wins. New flows and value-added services momentum remains very strong. There is still much uncertainty from an economic standpoint in the months ahead. We will remain vigilant and ready to act. As we look past fiscal year '23, we remain as optimistic as we've ever been about the long-term growth potential of our business.  Before I finish, this is a sad day for me personally. It's Al's last week as CEO. Al has been the best CEO I've worked for and I've worked for many in my career. Al is a wonderful human being, an exceptional leader with extraordinary business judgment. It has been an eventful six years. Despite a three-year global pandemic, revenues have almost doubled, non-GAAP EPS is up over 2.5x and our stock price has tripled during Al's tenure. I will miss you as CEO, Al, along with 26,500 or so others at Visa.  With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer. Well, we went through what we call our planning assumptions last -- on the last call for the full year, and we told you we had assumed no recession. As you can see, business trends have been remarkably stable. The spend levels just around the world, they've indexed in the mid-140s for almost four quarters right now, and there's no evidence of a change in trend. That's reflected in our second quarter outlook. At this point, we're not changing any expectations for the second half. I mean, clearly, the dollar has weakened a bit so that will change the exchange rate impact in the second half, but we're not changing any of our views in the second half. I mean, they are planning assumptions. And if there is a slowdown, then we will react accordingly. Yes. On debit, it's what we told you earlier. In general, if you look at the -- looking at 2019 has kept us honest, so to speak. It's a good view of what's going on. And there's -- in total spend, it's remarkable stability. What's happening is as good spending slowed down a bit, services spending really took up all the slack. And so consumers have just shifted their spending but they're spending the same amount, and that's why debit has stayed resilient. Debit has been the biggest beneficiary of the move to digitization that happened globally and including in the U.S., more e-commerce, more tap-to-pay, more people using digital credentials just about on any payment occasion. So some people were worried that when things settle down, that debit might start to see some slowdown. But as you've seen, debit has stayed resilient even as credit has recovered, which has kept our overall payment volumes very stable. Those would be the big trends and the other question? And other revenue was helped by mostly marketing services and consulting revenue, a fair amount of that linked to the FIFA World Cup. There was a lot of client-related marketing and spending related to the World Cup. Clients ask us to activate a variety of programs and that certainly helped the revenue. Yes. I mean, in terms of thinking about the impact, you all and we all have been tracking how is our cross-border recovering relative to pre-COVID levels and are we back on the trend line and so on, as you know? And we've told you now for a few quarters that many corridors, and I went through a lot of that, are well above the 2019 level. The three that were not and are still not, U.S. is approaching -- U.S. inbound is approaching 2019 levels and was held back by the strong dollar, but Asia is still -- and I went through the numbers, quite a bit below 2019 levels. Most of Asia is open, only China isn't. So if Asia is going to get back to pre-COVID levels and back to the original trend line, that's where the China impact is going to be visible. And then you expect and we expect that cross-border travel index to keep improving through the year. For that to happen, we obviously need China to come back. So it is important. I think you were asking about -- you said decel, I'm assuming you meant deceleration between the first and the second? Yes. I mean, just a couple of things. The Russia impact is a little larger in the second quarter because we had almost two quarters' worth of service fees last year. Remember, we recognize service fees with a lag, so the service fees recognized in the first quarter were based on Q4 growth rates. So sequentially, Q1 was a little lower, so Q2 service fees will be impacted by that. Also, currency volatility is moderating as we speak. It has been moderating for a few weeks. And incentive growth is a little higher as you saw. So you put it all together, we were a little better than we expected. As you know, we thought we would be high single digits in the first quarter. We were higher for the reasons I mentioned, will be high single digits in the second quarter. That's our expectation right now. Yes. When we talked to you last quarter, we said for the full year revenue growth would be somewhere in the mid-teens on a constant dollar basis adjusted for Russia. And then when you adjust for Russia and you adjust for a full year impact at that time of about 2 points on FX, it was going to be high single digits in nominal dollars. And so you know sort of where we are in Q1 and Q2. And exchange rates have moved around some so you can do some of the math. We're basically not changing any views on the second half right now because trends have been still fairly stable. The only thing you might want to change is what the exchange rate impact in the second half might be based on where these are right now. I also gave you fairly clear operating expense expectations. We were about 15% growth in the first quarter. We said growth will be 2 points to 3 points lower in nominal dollar terms in the second quarter, another 2 points to 3 points lower in the third quarter and another 2 points to 3 points lower in the fourth quarter. And that reflects what we had said last quarter that is expense growth will moderate through the year, both as we moderate the rate of increase when also as we lap higher levels of expenses from last year. So those pretty much are the sort of the broad outlines of what we said last quarter. And then we'll update you once again on our next call with any changes we might have based on trends."

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\nJennifer Como: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights have been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. Our comments today regarding our financial results will reflect revenue on a GAAP basis and all other results on a non-GAAP nominal basis unless otherwise noted. The related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release and related materials available on our IR website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter results were very strong with $9.6 billion in net revenue, up 12% year-over-year and EPS up 16%. Our key business drivers were relatively stable compared to Q3. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year, U.S. payments volume grew 5% and international payments volume grew 10%. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 13%, and processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. As I reflect on this quarter and the full fiscal year, I am incredibly proud of the more than 31,000 Visa employees who have been focused on delivering our strategy and enabling our clients with compelling solutions, which resulted in the company's strong performance. We have continued to grow our consumer payments business through an intense focus on product design and innovation. In new flows, our targeted strategy for non-consumer payments is paying off. And in value-added services, we have deepened our relationships with our clients through multiple different solutions and continue to expand our services to non-Visa transactions. We have done all this while further increasing our suite of solutions. Now let's dive into some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and the year. In consumer payments, we continued to increase credentials and acceptance. We have over 4.6 billion credentials, up 7% year-over-year and 11.5 billion tokens with more than 30% of our total transactions tokenized. Global merchant locations crossed 150 million. The Olympics and Paralympics certainly helped, with more than 7 million Paris 2024 branded cards issued and more than 130,000 merchant locations added in Europe. And I am particularly excited about new acceptance use cases. For example, we renewed an agreement with Canelo, a leading provider of self-service commerce across sectors such as food and beverage automated retail with over 1 million active devices globally and more than 1 billion transactions annually. And in the Netherlands, we reached an agreement with the country's largest grocer, Albert Heijn to expand in-store acceptance to all Visa products. We also recently renewed our agreement with AppFolio in the U.S. for rental payments acceptance. AppFolio is one of the largest software providers in the property management space and services 8 million-plus units across more than 20,000 clients. Throughout the year, we have continued to innovate in order to expand Visa's capabilities to non-card payments. This quarter, we announced Visa A2A, bringing the power of Visa's brand, infrastructure, and rules as well as consumer protections to enable simpler, safer and more secure account-to-account payments. We are excited to be collaborating with several banks, including NatWest and Nationwide Building Society and several leading fintechs, including Modulr to deliver an industry-driven solution to unlock the full potential of account-to-account transactions in the UK. And Visa A2A is open, open to any eligible bank, open banking provider, and verified biller. Initially, this is targeted at bill payments and we plan to launch in 2025 in the UK. We are very excited to bring this to market. In prior quarters, I've mentioned our account-to-account fraud risk scoring solution, Visa Protect for A2A payments. It was recently announced as Juniper Research's Platinum Winner for Fraud and Security Innovation of the Year Award, and we will be piloting on 10 new RTP networks in 2025. We're also seeing very strong interest in our new Flexible Credential, which enables multiple payment options from one Visa credential. We have hundreds of issuers in the pipeline and several launches planned for 2025 in the U.S., Asia Pacific, Europe, and CEMEA. Last quarter, I mentioned the expansion of tapping use cases on a mobile device. Tap to add card is now enabled by issuers in more than 15 countries across our 5 regions. We know that transit is a key activator for tapping and global tap-to-ride transactions exceeded 2 billion for the first time in fiscal year 2024, up 25% year-over-year. We added more than 110 new transit systems throughout the year in cities such as Boston, Athens, Beijing, Las Vegas, and Lima to total over 870 globally. And more than 40% of these new systems also use our value-added services acceptance solutions. Tap to Pay penetration globally, excluding the U.S., was at 82%, up 6 points from 2023. And in the U.S., it was at 54%, up 13 points from last year with 29 out of the top 30 U.S. merchants accepting Tap to Pay. Now pivoting to some deal highlights. We had some significant renewals this quarter around the globe: first, with one of our largest clients in Latin America, Grupo Promerica in credit, debit, and commercial across 8 countries; second, with our largest Asia Pacific client, SMCC across consumer and commercial credit; third, with our largest CEMEA client, Al Rajhi across consumer, commercial, and value-added services, including CyberSource and Visa Risk Manager, our network-agnostic risk product; and across both Asia Pacific and CEMEA, with Standard Chartered Bank, a credit renewal across key markets in Asia, a debit renewal with key markets in Africa as well as a new expansion in the Middle East for credit. In addition, they will continue to use our value-added services. In North America, we had three very important renewals: in Canada, we renewed our relationship with the country's top issuer, RBC across consumer credit and debit, small business credit, and commercial credit; in the U.S., we recently extended our long-standing partnership with US Bank to grow our relationship across their consumer and commercial portfolios. And we have renewed with USAA across both their consumer debit and credit portfolios. Finally, in Europe, building upon our strong relationship in Italy and across 11 other markets, we are pleased to have renewed the strategic agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo, expanding our collaboration in Italy with the largest bank in the country for innovative solutions amongst businesses and consumers. In addition, together, we will enable new value-added services for their Visa customers. Across all of our regions and all of our fintech partners from early stage to mature, we signed over 650 commercial partnerships, up 30% from last year. As you can see, we have continued to grow our businesses through active engagement with our clients and a relentless focus on new product innovations. Now moving to new flows, where our targeted strategy for capturing newer areas of growth is paying off. This quarter, new flows revenue grew 22% year-over-year in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions grew 38% for the quarter to 2.8 billion, and commercial volumes grew 5% year-over-year. We finished the year with almost 10 billion Visa Direct transactions and $1.7 trillion in commercial payments volume. Commercial credentials grew at 18% year-over-year, significantly faster than the 7% growth for total credentials that I mentioned earlier. We are very focused on growing B2B in new verticals such as travel. We are pleased to announce that we signed a virtual card issuing deal with JPMorgan Chase in Europe. This is a significant opportunity for Visa to further build on our strong issuing relationship in North America as well as further grow in the B2B travel vertical. Additionally, in Europe, we will be partnering with Adyen so that they can offer online travel agencies, or OTAs, Visa virtual cards as part of their B2B travel solution. Another area of focus is the cross-border B2B space, where we offer significant value for complex payments through both card and Visa B2B Connect. For Visa B2B Connect, we increased the number of banks that have signed on by almost 40% year-over-year, and the number of transacting banks is up nearly 60%. In Korea, we reached two agreements with Hana Card. The first is a commercial and consumer credit and debit issuance partnership, with enhanced multicurrency capabilities targeted towards the cross-border needs of its customers. The second is an agreement with Hana Card and the Government Trade Agency, KOTRA, so that small business exporters can receive cross-border B2B payments via card. In Canada, we are very pleased to have won the multicurrency credit issuance with fintech Loop, a cross-border banking platform for Canadian-based SMBs. In addition, our cross-border capabilities through Currencycloud will provide FX solutions across accounts, digital wallets and international payments. In Australia, we reached a multicurrency commercial debit agreement with OFX, a leading global money transfer company that offers foreign exchange services, international payment, and spend management controls. Now moving to Visa Direct, where we have continued to grow through new and expanded relationships. In Europe, we expanded our existing cross-border P2P partnership with Revolut to now allow real-time card transfers for their business customers via the Visa Direct platform in over 78 countries supporting over 50 currencies. In the U.S., we are excited about an expanded partnership with DailyPay, whose users are currently accessing earnings on demand via Visa Direct to now seamlessly send those earnings as international remittances to friends and family around the world. In Brazil, we reached a new agreement with Travelex Banco de Cambio, one of the largest foreign exchange banks in the country and the first to specialize in FX operations regulated by the Central Bank. The client will use Visa Direct for import and export payments and for remittances to a broad range of destinations. So across our new flows, we have seen our specific strategies succeeding in the marketplace. And now on to value-added services, where revenue was up 22% in the fourth quarter and full year in constant dollars. Let's look at the progress we have made across our value-added services. In our issuing solutions, our core banking and issuer processing platform, Pismo has a good pipeline and its solutions are resonating with clients with nearly 12 billion API calls a month. Recently, Pismo renewed its agreement with Itau in Brazil. And in 2025, we plan to expand Pismo's offerings to clients in more than 5 countries across four regions. In Risk and Identity Solutions, we recently announced our intent to acquire Featurespace, a developer of real-time artificial intelligence payments protection technology. It will enable Visa to provide enhanced fraud prevention tools to our clients and protect consumers in real-time across various payment methods. And Worldline, already a Visa partner and leading European acquirer, will soon be launching an optimized fraud management solution, utilizing Decision Manager to provide businesses with AI-based e-commerce fraud detection capabilities. In acceptance, food delivery platform, Foodpanda, has been a long-standing CyberSource client in Asia across several markets. They will also soon be using our AI-powered data token solution, which we announced earlier this year, enabling customers to control how their data is used to experience tailored shopping experiences. In Advisory Services, Visa Consulting and Analytics delivered more than 3,000 consulting engagements during the year, and we estimate that we helped clients realize over $5 billion of incremental revenue as a result. So our value-added services have continued to show strong momentum across both Visa and non-Visa transactions and nonpayment value-added services. Before I close, I wanted to make a few comments on the recent lawsuit by the Department of Justice. We believe the lawsuit is meritless and shows a clear lack of understanding of the payments ecosystem in the United States. We will defend ourselves vigorously and are confident in our ability to demonstrate that Visa competes for every transaction in a thriving debit space that continues to grow and see new entrants. In closing, I am proud of our team and all that we have accomplished. We delivered on our financial expectations while also investing in Visa's future through important product innovation. Back at 2020 at our Investor Day, we set a goal for new flows and value-added services revenue to represent more than 30% of net revenue by the end of 2024. I am pleased to say that we have exceeded that goal. And we will be hosting another Investor Day on February 20, 2025, here in San Francisco when we can talk more about our strategy to continue growing value-added services, new flows, and consumer payments. I see tremendous opportunity ahead and feel confident in our plans to get us there. Now over to Chris.\nChris Suh : Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. We closed the year with another strong quarter. In Q4, we saw relatively stable growth across payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions when compared to Q3. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year and cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was up 13% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenue was up 12%, above our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives, stronger-than-expected other revenue and FX being less of a drag than expected. Net revenue was also up 12% in constant dollars. EPS was up 16% year-over-year and 17% in constant dollars, higher than expected from the strong net revenue performance and a lower-than-expected tax rate. Let's go into the details. In the U.S., total payments volume grew 5% year-over-year, in line with Q3. Credit and debit also each grew 5%. Card-present volume grew 2% and card-not-present volume grew 6%. Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable to Q3. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments from last quarter. Moving to international markets. Total payments volume was up 10% in constant dollars, stable to Q3. In most major regions, payments volume year-over-year growth rates in constant dollars were strong for the quarter, with Latin America up 24%, CEMEA up 19%, and Europe up 12%. Asia Pacific payments volume saw a marginal improvement from Q3 in constant dollars for the quarter but was still less than 1% year-over-year growth, primarily due to the macroeconomic environment, most notably in Mainland China. Asia Pacific payments volume growth, excluding Mainland China, was relatively consistent to Q3. Now to cross-border volume, which I will speak to today in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 13% in Q4, below Q3, in line with our expectations. Q4 cross-border e-commerce measured as card-not-present volume, excluding travel and crypto purchases, grew 15%, which was faster than cross-border travel volume growth at 12%, in line with our expectations. Indexed to 2019, cross-border travel was relatively consistent with Q3. As we look at the travel corridors, the primary driver of the lower year-over-year cross-border travel volume growth was Asia Pacific inbound and outbound, which continued to be impacted by the same primary factors we've been mentioning all year: macroeconomic conditions, currency weakness, and flight bookings being below pre-COVID levels. We also saw a step-down in CEMEA outbound travel volume growth compared to Q3 due to Ramadan timing. Normalized for this, the CEMEA growth was stable. Now let's review our fourth quarter financial results. I'll start with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 8% year-over-year versus the 7% growth in Q3 constant dollar payments volume due to mix and improving utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenue grew 8% versus 10% processed transaction growth primarily due to fees and penalties being lower than the prior year. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 13% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping higher currency volatility from last year, even with the average quarterly volatility being slightly higher in Q4 versus Q3. Other revenue grew 30%, primarily driven by strong marketing services revenue growth related to the Olympics, consulting and, to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 6%. As expected, Q4 was the annual low point for year-over-year growth due to lapping significant renewals from the prior year. In addition, it was further lowered from some onetime adjustments due to client performance. While Ryan mentioned a significant amount of renewal activity in his remarks, the majority of that impact will begin in Q1 of '25. Now on to our three growth engines. Consumer payments revenue growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transaction growth. New flows revenue grew 22% year-over-year in constant dollars, helped by a onetime rebate adjustment due to deal timing. Visa Direct transactions grew 38% year-over-year helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Commercial volume rose 5% year-over-year in constant dollars, below Q3, primarily due to days mix. Value-added services revenue grew 22% in constant dollars to $2.4 billion, led by strong growth in marketing services and consulting and issuing solutions. Operating expenses grew 11%, led by increases in marketing and personnel expenses. FX was a minimal drag instead of the 0.5 point benefit we had expected. Our acquisition of Pismo represented an approximately 0.5 point drag as well. Non-operating income was $69 million. Our tax rate was 16.5% due to an update in our tax position across jurisdictions. EPS was $2.71, up 16% over last year, with an approximately 1 point drag from exchange rates and an approximately 0.5 point drag from Pismo. In Q4, we bought back approximately $5.8 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. We also funded the litigation escrow account by $1.5 billion, which has the same effect as a stock buyback. At the end of September, we had $13.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. As we closed out fiscal 2024 and readied for fiscal 2025, I reflected on our full year performance relative to what we had expected at the start of the year. With the strong Q4, full year net revenue grew 10%, in line with our expectations, and EPS grew 15%, above our expectations, a testament to Visa's diversified business model. Volatility started strong in Q1 but then declined and remained at lower-than-expected levels throughout most of the year. For incentives, we anticipated year-over-year growth will be lower than fiscal 2023 due primarily to smaller impacts from renewals in fiscal 2024. The growth rate ended up being even lower than we expected due to client performance adjustments and deal timing. On the business driver front, processed transactions grew 10% as expected. Payments volume grew 8% in constant dollars, below expectations due to a combination of weakness in Asia Pacific, as we have discussed, and in the U.S. from ticket size not improving as expected and, to a lesser extent, from the Reg II impact. Total cross-border volume growth, excluding intra-Europe, was 15% in constant dollars, generally in line with our original expectations, though the growth in cross-border travel volume was lower, primarily due to Asia Pacific travel and card-not-present excluding travel volume growth, performed better than we expected. As we've seen this year, volumes and transactions can swing quarter-to-quarter. As these drivers fluctuate, we work carefully to manage our business to deliver on our expectations. So as we thought about our budget and guidance philosophy going into fiscal 2025, it's largely the same approach and represents our best view based on today. So let's get into the guidance details and a quick note. When I reference 2024 and 2025, I'm referring to our fiscal years. As we regularly say, we are not economic forecasters so we're assuming the macroeconomic environment stays generally where it is today. As such, we expect payments volume and processed transaction growth to remain strong and generally in line with full year 2024 levels. For cross-border volumes, we expect the Q4 '24 trend to generally continue with card-not-present excluding travel volume growing slightly more than travel volume. Now let's cover our underlying assumptions for net revenue growth. First, volatility. We're expecting that the full year currency volatility levels are roughly in line with the Q4 '24 average, which implies that volatility will no longer be a drag starting with Q2 '25. Next, pricing. We will continue to price to value in 2025 with the pricing impact being generally the same as 2024. However, the cadence is expected to be different as we expect the vast majority of the incremental pricing impact will take effect in April versus being more balanced between October and April as it was in 2024. On incentives, first, there were a significant amount of renewals in Ryan's remarks that will be impacting Q1 '25 incentives. In total, we expect more than 20% of our payments volume to be impacted by renewals in 2025 compared to less than 15% that was impacted in 2024. Second, remember that in the first and second quarters of 2024, we called out client performance and deal timing as helping incentives. And in Q4, we had additional onetime performance adjustments. Adding this up, 2025 year-over-year incentives growth is expected to be significantly higher than 2024. We expect to close on Prosa and Featurespace in 2025, and when we do, we will update our estimates for the acquisition impacts. We pulled these assumptions together on an adjusted basis, defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentations for more detail. In 2025, we expect full year adjusted net revenue growth to be in the high single to low double digits, with incentives being the key driver of the difference between '24 and 2025. As always, revenue performance is sensitive to several factors so to the extent that there are deal delays or significant deal performance adjustments and or macro volatility and driver performance that is better than expected, adjusted net revenue growth would be on the higher end of the range. In terms of quarterly variability, we expect the second half revenue performance to be better than the first due to some of the dynamics I have spoken about, volatility, pricing and, to a lesser extent, incentives. Now moving to expenses. We currently expect to grow adjusted operating expense in the high single digit to low double digits as we continue to fund new flows and value-added services projects, our sales efforts and growth initiatives in specific countries. Non-operating income is expected to be between $150 million and $200 million as a result of lower interest rates. Our tax rate is expected to be between 18% and 18.5%. On capital return, the Board has declared an increase to our quarterly dividend by 13%, and we intend to return excess free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks. All this results in adjusted EPS growth to be in the high end of low double digits. Now moving to Q1. For the first three weeks of October through the 21st, with volume growth in constant dollars, U.S. payments volume was up 6%, with debit up 7% and credit up 6% year-over-year. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, grew 13% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 11% year-over-year. Now to financial expectations. We expect Q1 adjusted net revenue growth in the high single digits. Three things to note when we look at the step-down in adjusted net revenue growth from the fourth quarter in 2024 to the first quarter in 2025. First, incentives. There are a number of factors impacting incentives, especially in Q1 and H1 so let me go through each part. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 incentives growth was even lower than expected, with the combined impact of the lapping of significant renewals in 2023 and the onetime adjustments due to client performance. As I also mentioned, in 2025, we expect a significantly higher amount of our payments volume to be impacted by renewals, approximately 20% compared to under 15% in 2024. This is a combination of the large amount of renewals in Q4 '24 that will go into effect plus the amount of renewals we expect in 2025. In addition, the timing of the deal terms in 2025 is such that we expect about 60% of the 2025 renewal volume to go into effect in Q1. Putting those all together, we expect a significant step-up in the dollar amount of incentives from Q4 of '24 to Q1 of '25. Second, the timing of pricing actions. As I mentioned, whereas in 2024, the pricing impact was similar quarter-to-quarter, this year, we expect less pricing impact in the first half than the back half with Q1 having the smallest impact. Third, other revenue. As we do not have a major event in Q1 like the Olympics or FIFA, we anticipate lower growth in consulting and marketing services-related revenue compared to Q4. We expect adjusted operating expense growth to be in the high single digit to low double digits. On a year-over-year basis, remember that the first quarter of 2024 had a lower operating expense growth rate, both from lapping FIFA-related expenses in 2023 and from the allocation of Olympic-related marketing spend to other quarters. Non-operating income is expected to be between $35 million and $45 million, and our tax rate is expected to be around 18.5%. This puts our first quarter adjusted EPS growth in the low double digits. As always, if the environment changes and there are events that impact our business, we will remain flexible and thoughtful on balancing short- and long-term considerations. As we are several weeks into fiscal 2025, Visa's underlying business continues to be healthy and the growth opportunities are significant. We look forward to discussing this and our long-term growth algorithm at the upcoming Investor Day. And now, Jennifer, I'll hand it back to you.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. A lot going on in the U.S. regulatory front with regards to the DoJ lawsuit, Reg II, MDL, CCA. Can you share your overall thoughts on the regulatory and litigation environment in the U.S.? And Chris, just as a follow-up, can you help us maybe size your revenue exposure to U.S. debit, both including as well as excluding Visa DPS? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah, thanks for the question. As you note, a lot going on not just in the U.S. but all over the world. I think regulators appropriately are looking at the payments ecosystem and want to ensure that there's fair competition, that there's multiple options, both for consumers and merchants. And that's a process of engagement that we have in the U.S. to your question, but also with regulators, elected officials all around the world. And we feel very good about our ability to manage through that complexity. We feel very good about the ability to continue to run and grow our business. And we feel very good about the ability to continue to innovate and to continue to serve our clients. In terms of revenue exposure, that's not something that we disclose as it relates to U.S. debit or other parts of the business like that. But in terms of our ability to compete, we feel really, really good about it.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal : Hi. Can you give us your updated thoughts on the competitive environment, especially as it pertains to or specifically as it pertains to pay by bank? We're seeing Walmart move forward with a new product and chatter around some other offerings. We've seen these products in the past, but I'm just wondering if there's anything that sort of changed on the ground to make these a little more interesting for consumers. I know you guys are involved as well serving that part of the market now, so curious to get your comments.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah, there's a lot going on with account-to-account payments in the U.S. and around the world as you know it as well. Pay by bank is not a new capability. It's not a new capability in the United States. It's not a new capability for Walmart. Actually, I think as of today, you can load three different bank accounts into your Walmart.com wallet to pay for things. And as you alluded to, they've also put some news out that they're going to have a new partnership that I think is going to further enhance that. We expect that account-to-account payments will continue to proliferate here and around the world. We think there's a lot that we can add in terms of value to account-to-account payments. I mentioned some of those things in my prepared remarks. But as I've talked about several times on this call, it's a very, very competitive environment in which we operate. But we feel very, very good about our products, our innovation, our ability to provide value to end users in terms of buyers and also sellers, and therefore, our ability to continue to grow the business.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. I had a question on commercial volumes. I know they decelerated in days mix. I'm just wondering what kind of growth rate we should expect on a go-forward basis. I mean -- and are there some macro impacts? Maybe just talk about that specifically.\nChris Suh : Hi, Sanjay, this is Chris. Yeah, as you noted, we did see a days mix impact in Q4 with commercial volumes. But if I just back way up, we're excited about the opportunity in new flows. We're optimistic about the big opportunity ahead. And over time, we do anticipate that we'll see continued growth of commercial volumes ahead of consumer volumes over time.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Paul Golding from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nPaul Golding : Thanks so much. With the Featurespace acquisition in process, I just wanted to ask how you see AI playing into the business model. Do you see it more as driving VAS or incremental business model, uplift revenue or cost improvement? Or is it more of a competitive differentiator that will just keep you ahead of your competition? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah, thank you. In short, I see it as both but let me unpack a couple of things that you said. First, in terms of Featurespace, we're very excited about the opportunity to close on the Featurespace acquisition. As I travel around the world, financial crime, fraud is at the top of mind of clients, partners, regulators all around the world. And Featurespace is a world leader in providing AI-driven solutions to combat that fraud, to reduce that fraud, to enable our clients and partners to continue to serve their customers in a safe way. So we're very excited about that. As it relates more broadly to especially Generative AI at Visa, I see it really in two different buckets. The first is we are adopting it aggressively across our company to drive productivity. And we've seen some great results from everywhere to our engineering teams, to our accounting teams, to our sales teams, our client service teams. And we're still in the early stages of, I think, the very significant impact this will have on the productivity of our business. I also see it as a real differentiator to the products and services that we're putting in market. You've heard me talk about some of the new risk capabilities, risk management capabilities, for example, that we've deployed in the account-to-account space, which are all enabled with generative AI. You mentioned Featurespace. We've had some really good success in other parts of both our value-added services business and the broader consumer payments business as well. And we've got a product pipeline that is very heavily tilted towards some, we think, very exciting Generative AI capabilities that hopefully you'll hear more from us on soon. One of those I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which was the data token that we're starting to pilot with Foodpanda, which is 1 example of that.\nPaul Golding : Thank you.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Thank you. Just wanted to ask how growth in '25 might look different than '24 across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services.\nChris Suh : Hi, Tien-Tsin. This is Chris. So we don't guide by consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. But let me just give you a little bit more color on how we think about the guide that we did give. At the highest level, we took the same approach to guidance as we did a year ago, which is really to provide guidance based on our best estimate of what we expect to happen throughout the year. And so if we take all our assumptions and those assumptions play out as we've articulated, we'd expect total revenue growth, adjusted net revenue growth to be in the middle of the range that we provided. And obviously, if those assumptions, those variables turn out to be better, that could push us to the high end of revenue growth, and vice versa if those assumptions turn out to be slightly worse. The key variables that I would call out are, there's three-- there's probably four here to talk about. So one is incentives. Our plan is based on our best estimate of renewals and deal activity. But as we saw in FY '24, those results can vary quarter-to-quarter with client performance and timing of deals, and lower growth could push revenue growth towards the upper end of the range. Two would be cross-border volumes. Higher or lower growth in cross-border volumes would also contribute toward higher or lower within that revenue range. Third would be volatility. We've assumed FY '25 full year on average to the levels that we saw in Q4, and any significant swing could impact revenue in '25. And of course, across all of it is the assumption on the macro economy. As we've always said, we're not forecasters of the economy. But in the event the U.S. -- in the U.S. or globally, if PC grows faster than currently forecasted, then we should also see stronger growth as well. And so all of these factors can play a role. We feel good about the plan that we shared here for the full year at the start of the year. And we'll obviously continue to update you as the year unfolds.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Rayna Kumar from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nRayna Kumar : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Last week, the CFPB issued a final open banking rule for the U.S. Can you talk about what opportunities this could present for Visa from Tink's perspective and what potential headwinds that could create? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney : My understanding is that the new rules that they, I guess, finalized are largely consistent with the CFPB's initial proposal. And we are strong advocates for consumers having more control and more access to the financial data but ensuring that it's in a safe and secure way. We're still evaluating all the details of the potential impacts from the more detailed regulations across the industry. But it goes without saying, our own capabilities will comply with the CFPB's rules as well as our clients' very high bar for security and privacy. Widening the aperture a little bit to the opportunities that it creates, I think in an environment that open banking is even more available in the United States, like it is in places like Europe, what we found is that the Visa brand can be a meaningful differentiator. The Visa brand can give confidence to end users and data providers, and that if we can bring our capabilities to market like we've done in Europe with Visa A2A, we can give more confidence to the whole ecosystem and help resolve a lot of the complexities that exist in open banking. So we remain excited about the opportunities to add value, especially in the U.S., where we're still in the pretty nascent stages of all this.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Schmidt : Hi, Ryan. Hi, Chris. Thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. I wanted to ask about value-add services growth. It's really good to see the consistency there. Maybe you could just talk about the predictability, and then maybe comment a little bit more on the planning process of how you sort of feed the engine and continue to drive that growth. I know there's an organic and inorganic components penetration aspects to this but if you could help unpack that. I know it's a lot of things in there but if you could help unpack that, it'd be great. Thanks so much.\nRyan McInerney : We, too, are very excited about the consistent growth we've been able to deliver year after year with the value-added services businesses. And we deliver that through planning, sales planning, client planning, product road mapping, all the things that you would expect we do business by business, in the issuer solutions business, the acquirer solutions business, risk and advisory business, and so on and so forth. When you think about the opportunity, here's how I would encourage you to think about it, which is the same way we kind of plan to go to market. We deliver value-added services for Visa transactions. And these are offerings that are built to enable Visa to be the best way to pay and be paid market by market around the world. And we're continuing to invest to add new functionality to improve the payment success and the security on the network. So these are products and services like Visa Account Updater, the risk products that we talk a lot about like Visa Secure, the dispute tools that we deliver like Visa Resolve Online, the benefits that we offer. So that's kind of 1 component of the opportunity. The second part of the opportunity is services for non-Visa transactions. This is an area you've heard me and us talking a lot more about in recent quarters. This includes acceptance services like CyberSource, Authorize.net, Verifi, risk tools like Decision Manager, processing solutions like DPS, like Pismo, and again, these are all capabilities that we're bringing to market for our clients that add value for all different types of payment transactions. And then the third set of opportunities that we're going after are services beyond payments. This is a much broader category. It includes things like our consulting and analytics teams, our marketing services teams, open banking services such as Tink, we were talking about earlier in terms of their data aggregation solutions. We're now offering core banking platform services as part of the Pismo acquisition as well. So that hopefully gives you a sense of how we look at the opportunities, we look at the competitive sets, we build and deliver products, we build and deliver our sales motions and go-to-market and ultimately deliver the consistent growth that you referenced.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Koning : Hey, guys. Thank you. On the cross-border line, revenue growth was stable at 9% this quarter, same as last quarter, but reported volumes accelerated 1%. And I would think FX volatility was less bad so that probably helped a little bit, and mix seemed about the same. So I was wondering, is there anything else, any other little headwinds emerging there? What -- maybe what created the gap?\nChris Suh : Yeah, sure. So a couple of things. So as you pointed out, international revenue grew slower than total cross-border volumes. It really did have to do with the volatility. So Q4 volatility did improve from Q3 a bit but it was lower than the volatility that we saw last year. And secondly, the associated volume, the cross-border volume, 13% in Q4, as expected, but also lower than the volume growth that we saw in Q4 a year ago. And so when you combine those things that had impacted the differential that you see between volumes and revenue.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Tim Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTim Chiodo : Great. Thank you for taking the question. So I wanted to dig into two specific aspects of value-added services, so first being DPS and the second being CyberSource. I believe those two combined make up a reasonably large portion of the transaction-based value-added services. I think the last disclosure on DPS was about $2.5 trillion in volume, and CyberSource is in the roughly $1 trillion. I was hoping you could give sort of relative growth rates relative to the rest of value-added services and maybe some updated stats if possible. Thanks.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah, thanks for the question. We're super proud about the progress that we're making in DPS and CyberSource, DPS being primarily in the U.S. and CyberSource being a really at-scale global platform now. But we don't provide transaction volume growth or break out other metrics at that level of reporting. So I appreciate the interest. Sorry not to be able to provide any more detail.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the pickup you've seen in October for volume growth, especially in debit. Looks like it's perked up a little bit to 7%. Anything you're seeing there in new wins or is that potentially a better economic environment driving that? And then just quickly, secondly, on the price to value, just the change in timing, what was the reason for the change? Why is the timing different this year?\nChris Suh : Sure. Okay, I'll start with your question about October and then I think Ryan will handle your second part of your question. So in terms of October, so as we've consistently said, three weeks don't make a trend. It was true in July when we started a little bit slower and then Q4 ended up being stable. And we think it's true now as we see a strong start to October. Now that said, here's a couple of things that we see in terms of relative strength between the month of October and how we ended Q4. Two things that I'd point to: one is days mix. So the growth in the month of September was lower due to days mix. Last year, September had an extra Friday and Saturday, which are two of the highest spend days of the week. And this September, that was replaced with a Sunday and Monday, which are two of the lower spend days. And so that had an impact on September growth. And then secondly, in the U.S., in addition to that days mix point, we are starting to lap the modest impact of Reg II that we started to talk about a year ago in Q1. And so those combined things are contributing to what we see as the start of October. But as we said, it's three weeks. Let's see how the quarter plays out.\nRyan McInerney : Bryan, yeah, as you noted and we've said many times, we price to value. So when we price to value, we have to ship products. We have to ship services. We have to deliver solutions that are adding value and increasing value to our clients. And our product pipeline in 2025 is a bit more backloaded, especially as we bring some new and exciting products and services to the market, and so that really drives the difference in pricing cadence in 2025.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg : Thanks, guys. Just looking at the U.S. card-present volume growth, I think we've been in the 2% range here for the past two or three quarters. So wondering if you're expecting that to accelerate in fiscal '25. And Chris, can you just quantify what that favorable adjustment to Q4 new flows revenues were? Thank you.\nChris Suh : Got it. Jason, you cut out a little bit at the end. What was the second part of your question, Jason?\nJason Kupferberg : That onetime helper to new flows revenue in Q4, if you could quantify that?\nChris Suh : Okay, got it. I'll start with the second one since you just asked it. Yeah, we feel great about the momentum of new flows. Q3 was 18%, now to 22% in Q4. As I said on the call though, Q4 was helped by this onetime rebate adjustment due to deal timing. So we had expected a client to earn a rebate, which was contingent on them achieving a milestone, and they didn't achieve it. So as such, we recorded a onetime adjustment to that rebate, which landed in Q4. And I think your first question was around card-present and just sort of volumes as we look forward into FY '25. And maybe that's why I'll go out, just broaden it a little bit and say, per our call, our overall assumptions on underlying drivers is that in '25, they remain relatively stable to the trends that we see, both for the full year on payment volume and payment transactions relative to '24 and then on cross-border to the trends that we see in Q4. And so they will remain relatively strong and healthy. And like I said, we'll continue to update you throughout the course of the year.\nJennifer Como: Next question?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Craig Maurer from FT Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer : Hi, thanks everybody for taking my questions. I wanted to ask first, haven't asked in a long time about your thoughts on operating leverage, and you're growing expenses at a similar rate to revenue in the forecast for fiscal year '25. And going forward long term, is there a commitment to grow revenue faster than expenses or are we looking at limited operating leverage in the future? And secondly, considering the fiscal year '25 guide, what are your assumptions around APAC embedded in the guide? Do you need acceleration in China to achieve that or is it basically assuming the same steady no growth situation there? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney : I'll take the first question and you can take the second question, Chris. On your first question, as I said on this call and earlier calls, we have an enormous set of opportunities that we're pursuing. And the way we're running the business day in and day out, quarter in and quarter out, year in and year out is we're going through the assessment of those opportunities, we're figuring out the product pipeline that we can deploy. We're looking at inorganic and organic opportunities. And we're putting together a plan that we think maximizes the long-term growth that we can deliver. That's the way we approach it. That's the way we think about it. And you see the results that we've delivered, and you heard what Chris's comments were in the guide for this year. So that's kind of where we are with that.\nChris Suh : I'll address your comments on AP specifically. So again, at a global basis, we expect overall trends to be relatively similar to where we're ending FY '24. And the situation in AP, so much of that has been driven by the macroeconomic conditions in China. And as we've consistently said, we don't forecast the economy. And so again, in the context of relatively stable drivers, we'll see how AP performs but again, it will really be dependent on the health of the overall economy.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nTrevor Williams : Great, thanks a lot. Yeah, I wanted to follow up on value-added services. I think the general framework you've given is roughly two thirds of VAS revenue is transaction-linked in some form. Of that portion that's tied to transactions or volume, how much of that today needs to be running over VisaNet for you to be earning those vast revenue streams? Ryan, it sounds like most of it today is still running over your network but maybe the off-network piece should be increasing as a percentage of the mix over time. But anything more specific there would be helpful. Thanks.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah. I mean, the largest component of our VAS revenue today is that first bucket of services I mentioned for Visa transactions, and obviously, we've been doing that the longest time. And just to comment on that, what that really does is it drives additional yield on top of our Visa transactions. So we're adding more value to the transaction. We're adding more value to the clients and ultimately driving additional yield on top of the Visa payments volume growth that we see. But as I said, we also see -- we've made meaningful progress building out our platforms to service non-Visa transactions. CyberSource I mentioned, Verifi I mentioned, Pismo I mentioned, Decision Manager I mentioned. These are all becoming meaningful platforms for us with meaningful opportunity. And you can just imagine the TAM that we're able to go after when we're not just delivering services for Visa transactions but we're able to work with clients to deliver services on top of a much broader array of payment transactions is just significant. So we remain very excited about both.\nJennifer Como: Last question, please.\nOperator: Our final question goes to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller : Hey, thanks, guys. Look, just coming off of the, I think it was 12% growth in incentives and rebates in '24, and now you're saying obviously higher in '25. It's obviously great to see the activities [indiscernible] growth. Maybe just help us understand a little more around, you mentioned a lot of renewals but what about just net new business and market share gains. How does that build in? And I guess related to that, looks like this year is a big year of that constant revenue growth rate. So does that have an impact on how you think about this year's growth versus long term? We think it could be actually even better this year being a little bit of an outlying year in terms of growth in incentives and rebates, if we're thinking about that correctly. Thanks, guys.\nRyan McInerney : Yeah, Darrin, I mean, I don't think we're going to get into like the outer years but I'd say a couple of things. One is we're winning, like we're winning region by region and market by market around the world. You look at the size and sophistication of some of those names that I mentioned in my prepared remarks and I've mentioned for the last couple of quarters. We are winning and we feel really good about that market by market around the world. Second thing is, as we've also talked about in the past, we can't necessarily predict the time of when these renewals are going to happen, when a competitive situation is going to happen to our client. We have to be ready at any given time to give our best and hopefully, ultimately win. And as you were alluding to, there's been kind of a string of those recently and more of them this quarter that we're excited about. So we'll continue to deploy a great product. We'll continue to -- we've got a great team that I acknowledged during the prepared remarks that's serving these clients, which is ultimately a big reason they choose to both continue to do business with us and expand the business that they're doing with us, expand the consumer business, expand in the commercial business, expand into new flows, and we feel really good about it.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, all, for participating in Visa's fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and please enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Chris Suh",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. We closed the year with another strong quarter. In Q4, we saw relatively stable growth across payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions when compared to Q3. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year and cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was up 13% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenue was up 12%, above our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives, stronger-than-expected other revenue and FX being less of a drag than expected. Net revenue was also up 12% in constant dollars. EPS was up 16% year-over-year and 17% in constant dollars, higher than expected from the strong net revenue performance and a lower-than-expected tax rate. Let's go into the details. In the U.S., total payments volume grew 5% year-over-year, in line with Q3. Credit and debit also each grew 5%. Card-present volume grew 2% and card-not-present volume grew 6%. Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable to Q3. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments from last quarter. Moving to international markets. Total payments volume was up 10% in constant dollars, stable to Q3. In most major regions, payments volume year-over-year growth rates in constant dollars were strong for the quarter, with Latin America up 24%, CEMEA up 19%, and Europe up 12%. Asia Pacific payments volume saw a marginal improvement from Q3 in constant dollars for the quarter but was still less than 1% year-over-year growth, primarily due to the macroeconomic environment, most notably in Mainland China. Asia Pacific payments volume growth, excluding Mainland China, was relatively consistent to Q3. Now to cross-border volume, which I will speak to today in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 13% in Q4, below Q3, in line with our expectations. Q4 cross-border e-commerce measured as card-not-present volume, excluding travel and crypto purchases, grew 15%, which was faster than cross-border travel volume growth at 12%, in line with our expectations. Indexed to 2019, cross-border travel was relatively consistent with Q3. As we look at the travel corridors, the primary driver of the lower year-over-year cross-border travel volume growth was Asia Pacific inbound and outbound, which continued to be impacted by the same primary factors we've been mentioning all year: macroeconomic conditions, currency weakness, and flight bookings being below pre-COVID levels. We also saw a step-down in CEMEA outbound travel volume growth compared to Q3 due to Ramadan timing. Normalized for this, the CEMEA growth was stable. Now let's review our fourth quarter financial results. I'll start with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 8% year-over-year versus the 7% growth in Q3 constant dollar payments volume due to mix and improving utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenue grew 8% versus 10% processed transaction growth primarily due to fees and penalties being lower than the prior year. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 13% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping higher currency volatility from last year, even with the average quarterly volatility being slightly higher in Q4 versus Q3. Other revenue grew 30%, primarily driven by strong marketing services revenue growth related to the Olympics, consulting and, to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 6%. As expected, Q4 was the annual low point for year-over-year growth due to lapping significant renewals from the prior year. In addition, it was further lowered from some onetime adjustments due to client performance. While Ryan mentioned a significant amount of renewal activity in his remarks, the majority of that impact will begin in Q1 of '25. Now on to our three growth engines. Consumer payments revenue growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transaction growth. New flows revenue grew 22% year-over-year in constant dollars, helped by a onetime rebate adjustment due to deal timing. Visa Direct transactions grew 38% year-over-year helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Commercial volume rose 5% year-over-year in constant dollars, below Q3, primarily due to days mix. Value-added services revenue grew 22% in constant dollars to $2.4 billion, led by strong growth in marketing services and consulting and issuing solutions. Operating expenses grew 11%, led by increases in marketing and personnel expenses. FX was a minimal drag instead of the 0.5 point benefit we had expected. Our acquisition of Pismo represented an approximately 0.5 point drag as well. Non-operating income was $69 million. Our tax rate was 16.5% due to an update in our tax position across jurisdictions. EPS was $2.71, up 16% over last year, with an approximately 1 point drag from exchange rates and an approximately 0.5 point drag from Pismo. In Q4, we bought back approximately $5.8 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. We also funded the litigation escrow account by $1.5 billion, which has the same effect as a stock buyback. At the end of September, we had $13.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. As we closed out fiscal 2024 and readied for fiscal 2025, I reflected on our full year performance relative to what we had expected at the start of the year. With the strong Q4, full year net revenue grew 10%, in line with our expectations, and EPS grew 15%, above our expectations, a testament to Visa's diversified business model. Volatility started strong in Q1 but then declined and remained at lower-than-expected levels throughout most of the year. For incentives, we anticipated year-over-year growth will be lower than fiscal 2023 due primarily to smaller impacts from renewals in fiscal 2024. The growth rate ended up being even lower than we expected due to client performance adjustments and deal timing. On the business driver front, processed transactions grew 10% as expected. Payments volume grew 8% in constant dollars, below expectations due to a combination of weakness in Asia Pacific, as we have discussed, and in the U.S. from ticket size not improving as expected and, to a lesser extent, from the Reg II impact. Total cross-border volume growth, excluding intra-Europe, was 15% in constant dollars, generally in line with our original expectations, though the growth in cross-border travel volume was lower, primarily due to Asia Pacific travel and card-not-present excluding travel volume growth, performed better than we expected. As we've seen this year, volumes and transactions can swing quarter-to-quarter. As these drivers fluctuate, we work carefully to manage our business to deliver on our expectations. So as we thought about our budget and guidance philosophy going into fiscal 2025, it's largely the same approach and represents our best view based on today. So let's get into the guidance details and a quick note. When I reference 2024 and 2025, I'm referring to our fiscal years. As we regularly say, we are not economic forecasters so we're assuming the macroeconomic environment stays generally where it is today. As such, we expect payments volume and processed transaction growth to remain strong and generally in line with full year 2024 levels. For cross-border volumes, we expect the Q4 '24 trend to generally continue with card-not-present excluding travel volume growing slightly more than travel volume. Now let's cover our underlying assumptions for net revenue growth. First, volatility. We're expecting that the full year currency volatility levels are roughly in line with the Q4 '24 average, which implies that volatility will no longer be a drag starting with Q2 '25. Next, pricing. We will continue to price to value in 2025 with the pricing impact being generally the same as 2024. However, the cadence is expected to be different as we expect the vast majority of the incremental pricing impact will take effect in April versus being more balanced between October and April as it was in 2024. On incentives, first, there were a significant amount of renewals in Ryan's remarks that will be impacting Q1 '25 incentives. In total, we expect more than 20% of our payments volume to be impacted by renewals in 2025 compared to less than 15% that was impacted in 2024. Second, remember that in the first and second quarters of 2024, we called out client performance and deal timing as helping incentives. And in Q4, we had additional onetime performance adjustments. Adding this up, 2025 year-over-year incentives growth is expected to be significantly higher than 2024. We expect to close on Prosa and Featurespace in 2025, and when we do, we will update our estimates for the acquisition impacts. We pulled these assumptions together on an adjusted basis, defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentations for more detail. In 2025, we expect full year adjusted net revenue growth to be in the high single to low double digits, with incentives being the key driver of the difference between '24 and 2025. As always, revenue performance is sensitive to several factors so to the extent that there are deal delays or significant deal performance adjustments and or macro volatility and driver performance that is better than expected, adjusted net revenue growth would be on the higher end of the range. In terms of quarterly variability, we expect the second half revenue performance to be better than the first due to some of the dynamics I have spoken about, volatility, pricing and, to a lesser extent, incentives. Now moving to expenses. We currently expect to grow adjusted operating expense in the high single digit to low double digits as we continue to fund new flows and value-added services projects, our sales efforts and growth initiatives in specific countries. Non-operating income is expected to be between $150 million and $200 million as a result of lower interest rates. Our tax rate is expected to be between 18% and 18.5%. On capital return, the Board has declared an increase to our quarterly dividend by 13%, and we intend to return excess free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks. All this results in adjusted EPS growth to be in the high end of low double digits. Now moving to Q1. For the first three weeks of October through the 21st, with volume growth in constant dollars, U.S. payments volume was up 6%, with debit up 7% and credit up 6% year-over-year. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, grew 13% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 11% year-over-year. Now to financial expectations. We expect Q1 adjusted net revenue growth in the high single digits. Three things to note when we look at the step-down in adjusted net revenue growth from the fourth quarter in 2024 to the first quarter in 2025. First, incentives. There are a number of factors impacting incentives, especially in Q1 and H1 so let me go through each part. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 incentives growth was even lower than expected, with the combined impact of the lapping of significant renewals in 2023 and the onetime adjustments due to client performance. As I also mentioned, in 2025, we expect a significantly higher amount of our payments volume to be impacted by renewals, approximately 20% compared to under 15% in 2024. This is a combination of the large amount of renewals in Q4 '24 that will go into effect plus the amount of renewals we expect in 2025. In addition, the timing of the deal terms in 2025 is such that we expect about 60% of the 2025 renewal volume to go into effect in Q1. Putting those all together, we expect a significant step-up in the dollar amount of incentives from Q4 of '24 to Q1 of '25. Second, the timing of pricing actions. As I mentioned, whereas in 2024, the pricing impact was similar quarter-to-quarter, this year, we expect less pricing impact in the first half than the back half with Q1 having the smallest impact. Third, other revenue. As we do not have a major event in Q1 like the Olympics or FIFA, we anticipate lower growth in consulting and marketing services-related revenue compared to Q4. We expect adjusted operating expense growth to be in the high single digit to low double digits. On a year-over-year basis, remember that the first quarter of 2024 had a lower operating expense growth rate, both from lapping FIFA-related expenses in 2023 and from the allocation of Olympic-related marketing spend to other quarters. Non-operating income is expected to be between $35 million and $45 million, and our tax rate is expected to be around 18.5%. This puts our first quarter adjusted EPS growth in the low double digits. As always, if the environment changes and there are events that impact our business, we will remain flexible and thoughtful on balancing short- and long-term considerations. As we are several weeks into fiscal 2025, Visa's underlying business continues to be healthy and the growth opportunities are significant. We look forward to discussing this and our long-term growth algorithm at the upcoming Investor Day. And now, Jennifer, I'll hand it back to you. Hi, Sanjay, this is Chris. Yeah, as you noted, we did see a days mix impact in Q4 with commercial volumes. But if I just back way up, we're excited about the opportunity in new flows. We're optimistic about the big opportunity ahead. And over time, we do anticipate that we'll see continued growth of commercial volumes ahead of consumer volumes over time. Hi, Tien-Tsin. This is Chris. So we don't guide by consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. But let me just give you a little bit more color on how we think about the guide that we did give. At the highest level, we took the same approach to guidance as we did a year ago, which is really to provide guidance based on our best estimate of what we expect to happen throughout the year. And so if we take all our assumptions and those assumptions play out as we've articulated, we'd expect total revenue growth, adjusted net revenue growth to be in the middle of the range that we provided. And obviously, if those assumptions, those variables turn out to be better, that could push us to the high end of revenue growth, and vice versa if those assumptions turn out to be slightly worse. The key variables that I would call out are, there's three-- there's probably four here to talk about. So one is incentives. Our plan is based on our best estimate of renewals and deal activity. But as we saw in FY '24, those results can vary quarter-to-quarter with client performance and timing of deals, and lower growth could push revenue growth towards the upper end of the range. Two would be cross-border volumes. Higher or lower growth in cross-border volumes would also contribute toward higher or lower within that revenue range. Third would be volatility. We've assumed FY '25 full year on average to the levels that we saw in Q4, and any significant swing could impact revenue in '25. And of course, across all of it is the assumption on the macro economy. As we've always said, we're not forecasters of the economy. But in the event the U.S. -- in the U.S. or globally, if PC grows faster than currently forecasted, then we should also see stronger growth as well. And so all of these factors can play a role. We feel good about the plan that we shared here for the full year at the start of the year. And we'll obviously continue to update you as the year unfolds. Yeah, sure. So a couple of things. So as you pointed out, international revenue grew slower than total cross-border volumes. It really did have to do with the volatility. So Q4 volatility did improve from Q3 a bit but it was lower than the volatility that we saw last year. And secondly, the associated volume, the cross-border volume, 13% in Q4, as expected, but also lower than the volume growth that we saw in Q4 a year ago. And so when you combine those things that had impacted the differential that you see between volumes and revenue. Sure. Okay, I'll start with your question about October and then I think Ryan will handle your second part of your question. So in terms of October, so as we've consistently said, three weeks don't make a trend. It was true in July when we started a little bit slower and then Q4 ended up being stable. And we think it's true now as we see a strong start to October. Now that said, here's a couple of things that we see in terms of relative strength between the month of October and how we ended Q4. Two things that I'd point to: one is days mix. So the growth in the month of September was lower due to days mix. Last year, September had an extra Friday and Saturday, which are two of the highest spend days of the week. And this September, that was replaced with a Sunday and Monday, which are two of the lower spend days. And so that had an impact on September growth. And then secondly, in the U.S., in addition to that days mix point, we are starting to lap the modest impact of Reg II that we started to talk about a year ago in Q1. And so those combined things are contributing to what we see as the start of October. But as we said, it's three weeks. Let's see how the quarter plays out. Got it. Jason, you cut out a little bit at the end. What was the second part of your question, Jason? Okay, got it. I'll start with the second one since you just asked it. Yeah, we feel great about the momentum of new flows. Q3 was 18%, now to 22% in Q4. As I said on the call though, Q4 was helped by this onetime rebate adjustment due to deal timing. So we had expected a client to earn a rebate, which was contingent on them achieving a milestone, and they didn't achieve it. So as such, we recorded a onetime adjustment to that rebate, which landed in Q4. And I think your first question was around card-present and just sort of volumes as we look forward into FY '25. And maybe that's why I'll go out, just broaden it a little bit and say, per our call, our overall assumptions on underlying drivers is that in '25, they remain relatively stable to the trends that we see, both for the full year on payment volume and payment transactions relative to '24 and then on cross-border to the trends that we see in Q4. And so they will remain relatively strong and healthy. And like I said, we'll continue to update you throughout the course of the year. I'll address your comments on AP specifically. So again, at a global basis, we expect overall trends to be relatively similar to where we're ending FY '24. And the situation in AP, so much of that has been driven by the macroeconomic conditions in China. And as we've consistently said, we don't forecast the economy. And so again, in the context of relatively stable drivers, we'll see how AP performs but again, it will really be dependent on the health of the overall economy."

            "name": "Ryan McInerney",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter results were very strong with $9.6 billion in net revenue, up 12% year-over-year and EPS up 16%. Our key business drivers were relatively stable compared to Q3. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year, U.S. payments volume grew 5% and international payments volume grew 10%. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 13%, and processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. As I reflect on this quarter and the full fiscal year, I am incredibly proud of the more than 31,000 Visa employees who have been focused on delivering our strategy and enabling our clients with compelling solutions, which resulted in the company's strong performance. We have continued to grow our consumer payments business through an intense focus on product design and innovation. In new flows, our targeted strategy for non-consumer payments is paying off. And in value-added services, we have deepened our relationships with our clients through multiple different solutions and continue to expand our services to non-Visa transactions. We have done all this while further increasing our suite of solutions. Now let's dive into some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and the year. In consumer payments, we continued to increase credentials and acceptance. We have over 4.6 billion credentials, up 7% year-over-year and 11.5 billion tokens with more than 30% of our total transactions tokenized. Global merchant locations crossed 150 million. The Olympics and Paralympics certainly helped, with more than 7 million Paris 2024 branded cards issued and more than 130,000 merchant locations added in Europe. And I am particularly excited about new acceptance use cases. For example, we renewed an agreement with Canelo, a leading provider of self-service commerce across sectors such as food and beverage automated retail with over 1 million active devices globally and more than 1 billion transactions annually. And in the Netherlands, we reached an agreement with the country's largest grocer, Albert Heijn to expand in-store acceptance to all Visa products. We also recently renewed our agreement with AppFolio in the U.S. for rental payments acceptance. AppFolio is one of the largest software providers in the property management space and services 8 million-plus units across more than 20,000 clients. Throughout the year, we have continued to innovate in order to expand Visa's capabilities to non-card payments. This quarter, we announced Visa A2A, bringing the power of Visa's brand, infrastructure, and rules as well as consumer protections to enable simpler, safer and more secure account-to-account payments. We are excited to be collaborating with several banks, including NatWest and Nationwide Building Society and several leading fintechs, including Modulr to deliver an industry-driven solution to unlock the full potential of account-to-account transactions in the UK. And Visa A2A is open, open to any eligible bank, open banking provider, and verified biller. Initially, this is targeted at bill payments and we plan to launch in 2025 in the UK. We are very excited to bring this to market. In prior quarters, I've mentioned our account-to-account fraud risk scoring solution, Visa Protect for A2A payments. It was recently announced as Juniper Research's Platinum Winner for Fraud and Security Innovation of the Year Award, and we will be piloting on 10 new RTP networks in 2025. We're also seeing very strong interest in our new Flexible Credential, which enables multiple payment options from one Visa credential. We have hundreds of issuers in the pipeline and several launches planned for 2025 in the U.S., Asia Pacific, Europe, and CEMEA. Last quarter, I mentioned the expansion of tapping use cases on a mobile device. Tap to add card is now enabled by issuers in more than 15 countries across our 5 regions. We know that transit is a key activator for tapping and global tap-to-ride transactions exceeded 2 billion for the first time in fiscal year 2024, up 25% year-over-year. We added more than 110 new transit systems throughout the year in cities such as Boston, Athens, Beijing, Las Vegas, and Lima to total over 870 globally. And more than 40% of these new systems also use our value-added services acceptance solutions. Tap to Pay penetration globally, excluding the U.S., was at 82%, up 6 points from 2023. And in the U.S., it was at 54%, up 13 points from last year with 29 out of the top 30 U.S. merchants accepting Tap to Pay. Now pivoting to some deal highlights. We had some significant renewals this quarter around the globe: first, with one of our largest clients in Latin America, Grupo Promerica in credit, debit, and commercial across 8 countries; second, with our largest Asia Pacific client, SMCC across consumer and commercial credit; third, with our largest CEMEA client, Al Rajhi across consumer, commercial, and value-added services, including CyberSource and Visa Risk Manager, our network-agnostic risk product; and across both Asia Pacific and CEMEA, with Standard Chartered Bank, a credit renewal across key markets in Asia, a debit renewal with key markets in Africa as well as a new expansion in the Middle East for credit. In addition, they will continue to use our value-added services. In North America, we had three very important renewals: in Canada, we renewed our relationship with the country's top issuer, RBC across consumer credit and debit, small business credit, and commercial credit; in the U.S., we recently extended our long-standing partnership with US Bank to grow our relationship across their consumer and commercial portfolios. And we have renewed with USAA across both their consumer debit and credit portfolios. Finally, in Europe, building upon our strong relationship in Italy and across 11 other markets, we are pleased to have renewed the strategic agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo, expanding our collaboration in Italy with the largest bank in the country for innovative solutions amongst businesses and consumers. In addition, together, we will enable new value-added services for their Visa customers. Across all of our regions and all of our fintech partners from early stage to mature, we signed over 650 commercial partnerships, up 30% from last year. As you can see, we have continued to grow our businesses through active engagement with our clients and a relentless focus on new product innovations. Now moving to new flows, where our targeted strategy for capturing newer areas of growth is paying off. This quarter, new flows revenue grew 22% year-over-year in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions grew 38% for the quarter to 2.8 billion, and commercial volumes grew 5% year-over-year. We finished the year with almost 10 billion Visa Direct transactions and $1.7 trillion in commercial payments volume. Commercial credentials grew at 18% year-over-year, significantly faster than the 7% growth for total credentials that I mentioned earlier. We are very focused on growing B2B in new verticals such as travel. We are pleased to announce that we signed a virtual card issuing deal with JPMorgan Chase in Europe. This is a significant opportunity for Visa to further build on our strong issuing relationship in North America as well as further grow in the B2B travel vertical. Additionally, in Europe, we will be partnering with Adyen so that they can offer online travel agencies, or OTAs, Visa virtual cards as part of their B2B travel solution. Another area of focus is the cross-border B2B space, where we offer significant value for complex payments through both card and Visa B2B Connect. For Visa B2B Connect, we increased the number of banks that have signed on by almost 40% year-over-year, and the number of transacting banks is up nearly 60%. In Korea, we reached two agreements with Hana Card. The first is a commercial and consumer credit and debit issuance partnership, with enhanced multicurrency capabilities targeted towards the cross-border needs of its customers. The second is an agreement with Hana Card and the Government Trade Agency, KOTRA, so that small business exporters can receive cross-border B2B payments via card. In Canada, we are very pleased to have won the multicurrency credit issuance with fintech Loop, a cross-border banking platform for Canadian-based SMBs. In addition, our cross-border capabilities through Currencycloud will provide FX solutions across accounts, digital wallets and international payments. In Australia, we reached a multicurrency commercial debit agreement with OFX, a leading global money transfer company that offers foreign exchange services, international payment, and spend management controls. Now moving to Visa Direct, where we have continued to grow through new and expanded relationships. In Europe, we expanded our existing cross-border P2P partnership with Revolut to now allow real-time card transfers for their business customers via the Visa Direct platform in over 78 countries supporting over 50 currencies. In the U.S., we are excited about an expanded partnership with DailyPay, whose users are currently accessing earnings on demand via Visa Direct to now seamlessly send those earnings as international remittances to friends and family around the world. In Brazil, we reached a new agreement with Travelex Banco de Cambio, one of the largest foreign exchange banks in the country and the first to specialize in FX operations regulated by the Central Bank. The client will use Visa Direct for import and export payments and for remittances to a broad range of destinations. So across our new flows, we have seen our specific strategies succeeding in the marketplace. And now on to value-added services, where revenue was up 22% in the fourth quarter and full year in constant dollars. Let's look at the progress we have made across our value-added services. In our issuing solutions, our core banking and issuer processing platform, Pismo has a good pipeline and its solutions are resonating with clients with nearly 12 billion API calls a month. Recently, Pismo renewed its agreement with Itau in Brazil. And in 2025, we plan to expand Pismo's offerings to clients in more than 5 countries across four regions. In Risk and Identity Solutions, we recently announced our intent to acquire Featurespace, a developer of real-time artificial intelligence payments protection technology. It will enable Visa to provide enhanced fraud prevention tools to our clients and protect consumers in real-time across various payment methods. And Worldline, already a Visa partner and leading European acquirer, will soon be launching an optimized fraud management solution, utilizing Decision Manager to provide businesses with AI-based e-commerce fraud detection capabilities. In acceptance, food delivery platform, Foodpanda, has been a long-standing CyberSource client in Asia across several markets. They will also soon be using our AI-powered data token solution, which we announced earlier this year, enabling customers to control how their data is used to experience tailored shopping experiences. In Advisory Services, Visa Consulting and Analytics delivered more than 3,000 consulting engagements during the year, and we estimate that we helped clients realize over $5 billion of incremental revenue as a result. So our value-added services have continued to show strong momentum across both Visa and non-Visa transactions and nonpayment value-added services. Before I close, I wanted to make a few comments on the recent lawsuit by the Department of Justice. We believe the lawsuit is meritless and shows a clear lack of understanding of the payments ecosystem in the United States. We will defend ourselves vigorously and are confident in our ability to demonstrate that Visa competes for every transaction in a thriving debit space that continues to grow and see new entrants. In closing, I am proud of our team and all that we have accomplished. We delivered on our financial expectations while also investing in Visa's future through important product innovation. Back at 2020 at our Investor Day, we set a goal for new flows and value-added services revenue to represent more than 30% of net revenue by the end of 2024. I am pleased to say that we have exceeded that goal. And we will be hosting another Investor Day on February 20, 2025, here in San Francisco when we can talk more about our strategy to continue growing value-added services, new flows, and consumer payments. I see tremendous opportunity ahead and feel confident in our plans to get us there. Now over to Chris. Yeah, thanks for the question. As you note, a lot going on not just in the U.S. but all over the world. I think regulators appropriately are looking at the payments ecosystem and want to ensure that there's fair competition, that there's multiple options, both for consumers and merchants. And that's a process of engagement that we have in the U.S. to your question, but also with regulators, elected officials all around the world. And we feel very good about our ability to manage through that complexity. We feel very good about the ability to continue to run and grow our business. And we feel very good about the ability to continue to innovate and to continue to serve our clients. In terms of revenue exposure, that's not something that we disclose as it relates to U.S. debit or other parts of the business like that. But in terms of our ability to compete, we feel really, really good about it. Yeah, there's a lot going on with account-to-account payments in the U.S. and around the world as you know it as well. Pay by bank is not a new capability. It's not a new capability in the United States. It's not a new capability for Walmart. Actually, I think as of today, you can load three different bank accounts into your Walmart.com wallet to pay for things. And as you alluded to, they've also put some news out that they're going to have a new partnership that I think is going to further enhance that. We expect that account-to-account payments will continue to proliferate here and around the world. We think there's a lot that we can add in terms of value to account-to-account payments. I mentioned some of those things in my prepared remarks. But as I've talked about several times on this call, it's a very, very competitive environment in which we operate. But we feel very, very good about our products, our innovation, our ability to provide value to end users in terms of buyers and also sellers, and therefore, our ability to continue to grow the business. Yeah, thank you. In short, I see it as both but let me unpack a couple of things that you said. First, in terms of Featurespace, we're very excited about the opportunity to close on the Featurespace acquisition. As I travel around the world, financial crime, fraud is at the top of mind of clients, partners, regulators all around the world. And Featurespace is a world leader in providing AI-driven solutions to combat that fraud, to reduce that fraud, to enable our clients and partners to continue to serve their customers in a safe way. So we're very excited about that. As it relates more broadly to especially Generative AI at Visa, I see it really in two different buckets. The first is we are adopting it aggressively across our company to drive productivity. And we've seen some great results from everywhere to our engineering teams, to our accounting teams, to our sales teams, our client service teams. And we're still in the early stages of, I think, the very significant impact this will have on the productivity of our business. I also see it as a real differentiator to the products and services that we're putting in market. You've heard me talk about some of the new risk capabilities, risk management capabilities, for example, that we've deployed in the account-to-account space, which are all enabled with generative AI. You mentioned Featurespace. We've had some really good success in other parts of both our value-added services business and the broader consumer payments business as well. And we've got a product pipeline that is very heavily tilted towards some, we think, very exciting Generative AI capabilities that hopefully you'll hear more from us on soon. One of those I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which was the data token that we're starting to pilot with Foodpanda, which is 1 example of that. My understanding is that the new rules that they, I guess, finalized are largely consistent with the CFPB's initial proposal. And we are strong advocates for consumers having more control and more access to the financial data but ensuring that it's in a safe and secure way. We're still evaluating all the details of the potential impacts from the more detailed regulations across the industry. But it goes without saying, our own capabilities will comply with the CFPB's rules as well as our clients' very high bar for security and privacy. Widening the aperture a little bit to the opportunities that it creates, I think in an environment that open banking is even more available in the United States, like it is in places like Europe, what we found is that the Visa brand can be a meaningful differentiator. The Visa brand can give confidence to end users and data providers, and that if we can bring our capabilities to market like we've done in Europe with Visa A2A, we can give more confidence to the whole ecosystem and help resolve a lot of the complexities that exist in open banking. So we remain excited about the opportunities to add value, especially in the U.S., where we're still in the pretty nascent stages of all this. We, too, are very excited about the consistent growth we've been able to deliver year after year with the value-added services businesses. And we deliver that through planning, sales planning, client planning, product road mapping, all the things that you would expect we do business by business, in the issuer solutions business, the acquirer solutions business, risk and advisory business, and so on and so forth. When you think about the opportunity, here's how I would encourage you to think about it, which is the same way we kind of plan to go to market. We deliver value-added services for Visa transactions. And these are offerings that are built to enable Visa to be the best way to pay and be paid market by market around the world. And we're continuing to invest to add new functionality to improve the payment success and the security on the network. So these are products and services like Visa Account Updater, the risk products that we talk a lot about like Visa Secure, the dispute tools that we deliver like Visa Resolve Online, the benefits that we offer. So that's kind of 1 component of the opportunity. The second part of the opportunity is services for non-Visa transactions. This is an area you've heard me and us talking a lot more about in recent quarters. This includes acceptance services like CyberSource, Authorize.net, Verifi, risk tools like Decision Manager, processing solutions like DPS, like Pismo, and again, these are all capabilities that we're bringing to market for our clients that add value for all different types of payment transactions. And then the third set of opportunities that we're going after are services beyond payments. This is a much broader category. It includes things like our consulting and analytics teams, our marketing services teams, open banking services such as Tink, we were talking about earlier in terms of their data aggregation solutions. We're now offering core banking platform services as part of the Pismo acquisition as well. So that hopefully gives you a sense of how we look at the opportunities, we look at the competitive sets, we build and deliver products, we build and deliver our sales motions and go-to-market and ultimately deliver the consistent growth that you referenced. Yeah, thanks for the question. We're super proud about the progress that we're making in DPS and CyberSource, DPS being primarily in the U.S. and CyberSource being a really at-scale global platform now. But we don't provide transaction volume growth or break out other metrics at that level of reporting. So I appreciate the interest. Sorry not to be able to provide any more detail. Bryan, yeah, as you noted and we've said many times, we price to value. So when we price to value, we have to ship products. We have to ship services. We have to deliver solutions that are adding value and increasing value to our clients. And our product pipeline in 2025 is a bit more backloaded, especially as we bring some new and exciting products and services to the market, and so that really drives the difference in pricing cadence in 2025. I'll take the first question and you can take the second question, Chris. On your first question, as I said on this call and earlier calls, we have an enormous set of opportunities that we're pursuing. And the way we're running the business day in and day out, quarter in and quarter out, year in and year out is we're going through the assessment of those opportunities, we're figuring out the product pipeline that we can deploy. We're looking at inorganic and organic opportunities. And we're putting together a plan that we think maximizes the long-term growth that we can deliver. That's the way we approach it. That's the way we think about it. And you see the results that we've delivered, and you heard what Chris's comments were in the guide for this year. So that's kind of where we are with that. Yeah. I mean, the largest component of our VAS revenue today is that first bucket of services I mentioned for Visa transactions, and obviously, we've been doing that the longest time. And just to comment on that, what that really does is it drives additional yield on top of our Visa transactions. So we're adding more value to the transaction. We're adding more value to the clients and ultimately driving additional yield on top of the Visa payments volume growth that we see. But as I said, we also see -- we've made meaningful progress building out our platforms to service non-Visa transactions. CyberSource I mentioned, Verifi I mentioned, Pismo I mentioned, Decision Manager I mentioned. These are all becoming meaningful platforms for us with meaningful opportunity. And you can just imagine the TAM that we're able to go after when we're not just delivering services for Visa transactions but we're able to work with clients to deliver services on top of a much broader array of payment transactions is just significant. So we remain very excited about both. Yeah, Darrin, I mean, I don't think we're going to get into like the outer years but I'd say a couple of things. One is we're winning, like we're winning region by region and market by market around the world. You look at the size and sophistication of some of those names that I mentioned in my prepared remarks and I've mentioned for the last couple of quarters. We are winning and we feel really good about that market by market around the world. Second thing is, as we've also talked about in the past, we can't necessarily predict the time of when these renewals are going to happen, when a competitive situation is going to happen to our client. We have to be ready at any given time to give our best and hopefully, ultimately win. And as you were alluding to, there's been kind of a string of those recently and more of them this quarter that we're excited about. So we'll continue to deploy a great product. We'll continue to -- we've got a great team that I acknowledged during the prepared remarks that's serving these clients, which is ultimately a big reason they choose to both continue to do business with us and expand the business that they're doing with us, expand the consumer business, expand in the commercial business, expand into new flows, and we feel really good about it."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\nJennifer Como: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. Our comments today regarding our financial results will reflect revenue on a GAAP basis and all other results on a non-GAAP nominal basis unless otherwise noted. The related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release and related materials available on our IR website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered strong third quarter results with $8.9 billion in net revenue, up 10% year-over-year, and EPS up 12%. Our key business drivers were relatively stable as compared to Q2, adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 7% year-over-year, U.S. payments volume grew 5%, and international payments volume grew 10%. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, rose 14%, and processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. We recently received the results from our annual Global Client Engagement Survey where Visa achieved a Global Net Promoter Score, or NPS, of 76, up three points from last year. We saw NPS increases across all of our client types, merchants, issuers, fintechs, and processors and across our regions, the results remain strong, with a notable 6-point NPS improvement in North America. I want to thank all of our 30,000 employees who helped deliver these fantastic results. And as I review some highlights from the quarter, you'll see how this focus on serving our clients by meeting their needs, innovating, and helping them grow is fueling our success across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Let's start with consumer payments, where we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity to capture cash, check, ACH, domestic schemes and other forms of electronic payment. In our client engagement survey, our clients ranked our strategic partnership and our brand as two of the most important factors to our successful relationships. I'll share some examples of how each of these played out this quarter. In strategic partnerships, we are constantly seeking ways to add more value and grow together with our clients. We are pleased to have been named the Preferred Network Partner by Lloyds Banking Group, renewing our debit relationship and significantly expanding our relationship in credit, winning 10 million additional credit credentials across the Group's consumer and commercial business. Also in the U.K., NatWest has launched a new Visa Travel Reward credit card, following the signing of our partnership last year. They will also be utilizing many value-added services, including transaction controls and card benefits. On the European continent, we worked with Raiffeisen Bank International AG, a leading bank in several markets. And recently, in the Czech Republic and Romania, we renewed our commercial business and expanded our consumer debit and credit business totaling over two million potential new credentials. In Korea, we deepened our partnership with leading issuer KB Kookmin Card. Already a user of Visa Direct cross-border money movement and a Visa consumer and commercial issuer, they will grow their consumer credit and debit portfolios with Visa and use value-added services, including consulting and marketing services. In Peru, we extended our partnership with leading issuer, Banco de Credito de Peru, across consumer and commercial portfolios with plans to launch additional new flows offerings and value-added services. In the U.S., we extended our agreement with Wells Fargo. This will allow us to continue to support Wells Fargo's strategy to reinvent their credit business and provide additional growth by leveraging key Visa assets like consulting and Visa sponsorships such as FIFA and the Olympic and Paralympic Games. On the brand front, with the Olympic Games opening ceremony later this week, it is exciting to see the engagement with the Visa brand and activation across the world in marketing campaigns, cardholder experiences and Olympic and Paralympic-branded Visa issuance, which I am happy to report in Europe is at nearly six million cards compared to the five million number I quoted just last quarter. We have also added nearly 100,000 new merchant locations in France in advance of the event. Our brand also plays an important role in winning co-brand partnerships. In India, growing credit issuance and reaching affluent and cross-border consumers remain areas of focus. We are excited about the launch of a co-brand card with Adani One and ICICI Bank as India's first co-branded credit card with rich airport-linked benefits for their target base of 400 million customers through the Adani One platform. We also signed an agreement to launch a new co-brand card with Tata Digital, along with an Indian banking partner, building on the success of our existing credit co-brand relationship. This new co-brand offering consists of a multicurrency prepaid foreign exchange card that will target travelers from India, also benefiting from the rewards of the Tata Digital Super App, Tata Neu. Across seven countries in Latin America, we will work with Unicomer, a major retailer and financial services provider with numerous brands to deliver a co-brand credit card in addition to using CyberSource. And in CEMEA, we reached a de novo co-brand arrangement with BinDawood, a leading grocer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with 88 outlets and over five million loyalty program members. On the travel side, we extended our relationship with Malaysia Airlines from a prepaid co-brand card targeting millennials and Gen Z customers to also launch a new co-brand credit card for the travel-minded affluent. And in the U.S., Turkish Airlines have chosen Visa to be their exclusive network partner for their new Miles and Smiles co-brand credit card. Our consumer payment strategy is focused on growing credentials as we are doing across all the partnerships I just mentioned and increasing acceptance locations. And wallets are a great example of where this comes together, where Visa can be a funding source, an embedded credential, and an accepted form of payment by wallet merchants. This increases the value proposition for wallet providers and their users. Two wallet highlights this quarter are in Peru and Vietnam. Yape is a Peruvian super app with more than 15 million users who already have a Visa credential that enables them to send money across P2P apps via Visa Direct. And just recently, they launched Tap to Phone functionality for their more than two million merchants to accept Visa. And in Vietnam, a country with approximately 50 million wallet users, the three leading digital wallets, MoMo, VNPAY, and ZaloPay are now enabling their users to utilize Visa cards as a funding source for transactions at over 500,000 QR acceptance points managed by these wallets. One additional area that we are very focused on is delivering simple, easy, and secure checkout experiences. Let me share a few recent examples. First, we are integrating Click to Pay and the Visa Payment Passkey Service, enabling a customer to authenticate themselves using biometrics. Already, we have hundreds of issuers enabled for passkeys in Europe and a number of issuers who represent more than 50% of our e-commerce payments volume in Europe piloting the solution. Second, we crossed 10 billion tokens this quarter, a significant milestone. And in 2023 alone, Visa tokens helped generate more than an estimated $40 billion in incremental e-commerce revenue for businesses globally and saved more than $600 million in fraud. Third is the ability to tap for more use cases on a mobile device. With tapping as one of the best in-person commerce experiences, we want to provide Visa users with more ways to tap, including Tap to Pay, tap to authenticate an identity, tap to add a card, or tap to send money to family or friends. And finally, this quarter, Tap to Pay grew four percentage points from last year to 80% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the U.S. In the U.S., we surpassed 50% and have 30 U.S. cities above 60% penetration. Now moving on to new flows. This quarter, new flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars with Visa Direct overall transactions growing 41% for the quarter to 2.6 billion and commercial volumes up 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. Let me provide some updates, starting with B2B, where we have focused on penetrating new verticals and delivering innovative products and solutions. In healthcare, we will work with AXA and Paysure to launch a commercial virtual card solution to simplify the claims processes for their customers worldwide. We have also expanded our virtual card acceptance with a key business services provider, Cintas, who offers uniform, safety, and fire protection services to over one million customers. Together with our partner, Billtrust, we will help Cintas streamline their payments, automate processes, and manage costs on Billtrust's Business Payments Network or BPN. We also just recently extended our long-standing BPN collaboration with Billtrust that connects suppliers and buyers to facilitate straight-through processing of virtual card payments with rich data that optimizes acceptance costs. Our products and solutions in B2B remain very important in winning and growing our business. One such solution is the enhanced B2B data that we can provide. In Brazil, together with Solero, a leading business financial management solution, we will provide issuers with enhanced visibility into small business spend by aggregating data across cards, bank accounts, boletos and more, enabling them to better manage their client relationships and offer compelling products. Another solution is Spend Clarity, which provides expense program management, including card issuance, controls, and reporting. Wells Fargo has white-labeled our solution called Wells One Expense Manager, which has now onboarded 6,000 corporate clients representing over one million users, providing access to their spend data. Now moving on to Visa Direct. We continued to grow our transactions through expanded and new relationships. Over the past year, total Visa Direct cross-border P2P transactions have nearly doubled, with Europe and CEMEA being the largest regions. In CEMEA, we are very excited to have renewed our Visa Direct relationship with fintech Monobank in addition to renewing their consumer and commercial credit, debit, and prepaid portfolios. In Asia Pacific, we are partnering with China Zhongsheng Bank on cross-border capabilities, including Visa Direct and Currencycloud, allowing the bank to support cross-border payments for their merchant clients. Canadian fintech Nuvei has extended its agreement with us for Visa Direct across all cross-border use cases in more than 30 countries for their merchant clients and recently became the first Visa Direct enabler in Colombia. We also executed our first global agreement with WorldRemit and Sendwave, enabling their customers to eventually send Visa Direct cross-border remittances from 50 countries to recipients in 130 countries. Quickly, a leading South Asian marketplace, has enabled Visa Direct cross-border remittance solutions for U.S. customers to send money to relatives and friends in India and the rest of South Asia. And in earned wage access, we reached an agreement with Weaver, a U.K.-based embedded finance provider. In addition to card issuance, they will be utilizing Visa Direct to enable Weaver's business clients to offer employee expense reimbursement, reward and recognition, and earned wage access. Earned wage access provider PayActiv, who serves 4,000 businesses has renewed its agreement with us and will enable Visa+ for payouts. Similarly, we expanded our relationship with enabler, Astra. In addition to domestic disbursements, Astra will now offer cross-border remittances, implement Visa+ to reach domestic wallets in the U.S., and expand to additional use cases, including payroll, earned wage access and marketplaces. Visa+ is still in the early stages but is fully rolled out and live for PayPal and Venmo users and more providers continue to join the platform. Wrapping up new flows, we also renewed an agreement with FIS, an important issuer processing partner to enable a suite of value-added services and new flows capabilities for their clients, including Visa Direct. And now on to value-added services, where revenue was up 23% in the third quarter in constant dollars. Let me highlight some of the progress we have made in driving adoption and growth among our value-added services portfolio. First in issuing solutions. One area of strong revenue growth this quarter was in card benefits, where we enable our clients to offer unique value propositions tailored to their customer base in travel, entertainment, restaurants, insurance and more. Strong issuance in premium cards across most of our regions has fueled this growth in the third quarter. For example, in Latin America, travel benefits have grown with over 370,000 unique visits to our Visa Infinite Airport Lounge in Brazil, representing customers from a number of leading issuers. In addition, since its launch in 2022, our Visa Infinite Fast Pass in Brazil, which allows cardholders to get through airport security more quickly, has screened over one million travelers. These are among the top five card benefits in Brazil and deliver value to customers, issuers and Visa. We continue to add more benefits like the recently launched partnership with OpenTable to offer eligible Visa cardholders access to coveted restaurant reservations and experiences in the U.S., with plans to expand into Canada and Mexico. In Acceptance Solutions, third quarter growth was driven by increasing utilization across both token and e-commerce-related services. In e-commerce, one such example is with iFood, the largest food delivery platform in Brazil who is utilizing our Verifi solution to help prevent disputes before they become chargebacks. In addition, they will be using our authentication solutions. In Risk & Identity Solutions, we continued to see strong adoption by new and existing clients, driven in part by growth in card-not-present transactions. In North America, acquirer Worldpay will be expanding their use of our authentication solutions from CardinalCommerce, fostering collaboration and real-time enhanced data exchange between Worldpay merchants and issuers during card-not-present transactions, reducing fraud and allowing more transactions to be properly authenticated and authorized securely. We are also pleased that the pilot of our account-to-account risk scoring solution Visa Protect with Pay.UK has had great results, showing an average 40% uplift in fraud detection over the 3-month pilot period. In addition, we are now launching Visa Protect in Argentina with a core payments technology company, Celsa after successfully piloting the solution there as well. The last two value-added services are open banking and advisory services. We continue to sign new partners with Tink in Europe and the U.S. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong growth in client demand for our consulting and marketing services, particularly around marquee events such as the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Our value-added services portfolio solutions is strong and is driving meaningful growth for our clients and for Visa. Before I close, I wanted to speak to the fact that the settlement reached for the injunctive relief class was rejected by the court. We are, of course, disappointed with this decision. We believe that the prior settlement provided meaningful relief to all merchants and we will continue to work towards another settlement. To close, so far this fiscal year, we have seen strong revenue and EPS growth as a result of relatively stable volume and transaction growth. I remain very excited about the opportunity that lies ahead of us. At Visa, we come to work in service of our clients and partners and are focused on building and deploying the best solutions possible across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Now over to Chris.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we had another strong quarter with relatively stable growth across payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions when compared to Q2, adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year and cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, was up 14% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Fiscal third quarter net revenue was up 10% in both GAAP and constant dollars, in line with our expectations. EPS was up 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant dollars. Now let's go into the details. In the U.S., payment volumes growth numbers were generally in line with Q2 adjusted for leap year, with total Q3 payments volume growing 5% year-over-year, with credit and debit also growing 5%. Card-present volume grew 2% and card-not-present volume grew 7%. In the U.S., while growth in the high spend consumer segment remained stable compared to prior quarters, we saw a slight moderation in the lower spend consumer segment. Moving to international markets. Total payments volume was up 10% in constant dollars, relatively stable with Q2 when adjusted for leap year. Payments volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions, with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe ex U.K. each growing more than 16% in constant dollars. Asia Pacific payments volume slowed to less than 0.5 point of year-over-year growth in constant dollars for the quarter, driven primarily by the macroeconomic environment, most notably in Mainland China. Now to cross-border volume, which I will speak to today in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 14% in Q3, relatively stable to Q2 adjusted for leap year. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, was in the mid-teens, helped by continued strength in retail. Cross-border travel volume growth was also up in the mid-teens or 157% indexed to 2019. This quarter, we saw the inbound Asia Pacific Index improve nine points at a similar pace to Q2 to 151% of 2019. The improvement in Asia Pacific outbound travel, however, slowed from Q2 with the index increasing by less than one point to 125% of 2019. We continue to see the same primary drivers as last quarter with some additional pressure from macroeconomic conditions. Now let's review our third quarter financial results. I'll start with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 8% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q2 constant dollar payments volume, with revenue yield improving sequentially and versus last year due to improving utilization of card benefit. Data processing revenue grew 9% versus 10% processed transaction growth with the revenue yield generally in line sequentially and versus last year. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 14% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping higher currency volatility from last year. Volatility levels remain consistent on average to last quarter. Other revenue grew 31%, primarily driven by strong consulting and marketing services revenue related to the Olympics and, to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 11%. Now on to our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transaction growth. New flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions grew 41% year-over-year, helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Commercial volumes rose 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Q3, value-added services revenue grew 23% in constant dollars to $2.2 billion, primarily driven by Issuing and Acceptance Solutions and Advisory Services. Operating expenses grew 14%, primarily due to increases in general and administrative personnel and marketing expenses, including spend related to the Olympics. FX was 0.5 point drag versus the 1.5 point benefit we expected. Pismo represented an approximately one point drag. Nonoperating income was $73 million. Our tax rate was 18.8% and EPS was $2.42, up 12% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 1.5 point drag from exchange rates and an approximately 0.5 point drag from Pismo. In Q3, we bought back approximately $4.8 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of June, we had $18.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in July through the 21st with volume growth in constant dollars. Cross-border is excluding intra-Europe. U.S. payments volume was up 4% with debit up 4% and credit up 3% year-over-year. The slight deceleration from Q3 does not appear to be from any one factor but likely a number of smaller factors such as weather, timing of promotional shopping events, and the technology outage, among others. Cross-border volume grew 13% year-over-year, below Q3 levels with travel-related volume growing slightly less, which continued to be impacted by Asia Pacific and card-not-present ex travel volume growing at similar levels to Q3. Processed transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excludes acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. Let's start with the fourth quarter. We expect payments volume and processed transactions to grow at a similar rate to Q3. For total cross-border volume growth, we are expecting to end up slightly below Q3. Currency volatility continues to average around 4-year lows through July 21. And as such, we are making an adjustment to currency volatility expectations for Q4, now assuming volatility will stay in line with Q3 levels. Incentives are expected to be at their lowest growth rate all year. Pulling it all together, we expect adjusted net revenue growth in the low double digits, which equates to a slight improvement from the 10% adjusted revenue growth rate in the third quarter. We expect our Q4 adjusted operating expenses to grow in the high single digits. Nonoperating income is expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 19% and 19.5% in Q4, which puts Q4 adjusted EPS growth rate in the high end of low double digits. Moving to the full year. With three quarters now complete, our expectations for full year adjusted net revenue growth remains unchanged from what we shared at the start of the year. Whilst absorbing the impact of lower currency volatility and the macroeconomic challenges in Asia, which have affected volumes, we still expect to reach low double-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the full year. Full year adjusted operating expense growth will be in the high single digit to low double digits, reflecting the less favorable impact of FX. This keeps full year adjusted EPS growth in the low teens. In closing, we delivered strong results this quarter, with new flows and value added services revenue growing faster than consumer payments. We extended our existing relationships, one new clients and invested to develop innovative products and solutions, all positioning us for continued growth into the future. But now Jennifer, it's time for some Q&A.\nJennifer Como: Thanks Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Hi, thanks guys. Look, let me just start. The U.S. volume growth rate obviously is a bit softer. And if you could help us distill what you consider structural versus cyclical, I think that'd be a good place to start. But adding on to it really is, just the ability for you to grow double-digit revenue with only four, five, six, mid-single-digit U.S. volume growth is, coming from value added services. It's coming from cross border. Can you help us understand if that kind of trend, you believe the company has that capability to grow those rates on revenues, even in this context of U.S. volume trends? Thanks guys.\nChris Suh: Yes. Hi Darrin. So let me start with the U.S. Let me start with the first part of your question, and then we'll maybe get into zoom out and talk about maybe the longer question. So in the U.S. in Q3, we did see stable drivers relative to Q2, once you adjust for leap year. That's 5% payment volumes growth in the third quarter. In the 21 days since in July, that number did tick down to 4%. Maybe I'll just sort of give you the full arc of what we're seeing. So 4%, we'll just level set on those numbers, 4% in the 21 days versus 5% in Q3. And so for that, we did stare at a lot of the drivers, the factors that impacted those three weeks. And there was a lot going on and I referenced a few of them on the call and maybe I'll expand on those a bit. First, we had a major hurricane, Hurricane Beryl, and it impacted Texas and other parts of the U.S. nearby. The second, I referenced the timing of promotional e-commerce events. Maybe I can expand on that a little bit. The timing this year was later and then e-commerce customers are billed, when the goods are shipped. And so, some of that shipping periods fell out of that 21 period. So we had a little bit of difference in the 21 day period, to the comparable year ago. And third, obviously the major tech outage that happened at the end of last week, that also had some impact. So, when we look at that, no single factor drove that one point of change from Q3, to the first part of July. But all things considered, we actually feel pretty good about the three week results. Now the second part of your question really was around sort of the low double-digits in the context of cross-border, VAS and CMS. I'll sort of back into the question. We've had consistent strong performance in VAS, over $2 billion of revenue, over 20% growth for many quarters consecutively. And we're seeing strength across the business in issuing solutions and acceptance and advisory. That's a business that we feel great about the momentum in. With our new flows business, 18% growth, as Ryan talked about, in the quarter, that's the second quarter in a row, where we're seeing growth in the teens, great execution, stable volumes, and visa direct transactions growing at a high level. As you know, that business also, quarter-to-quarter, can vary a little bit in the growth rates, as we saw in the first half of the year. But all in all, feel really good about the continued strength in that business. And then cross-border, well, cross-border, maybe I'll just zoom out a little bit and talk about cross-border and what we've seen over the course of time. If you recall, pre-pandemic, cross-border grew, travel grew in the high single-digits to low double-digits. And e-commerce, which was about a third of the business, grew into the teens, sometimes into the mid-teens. Obviously, the pandemic happened, travel really contracted, e-commerce grew faster. And since then, now post-pandemic, what we're seeing now is that e-commerce is roughly 40% of the business. And the growth rate has normalized. It's stabilized back to pre-pandemic levels. And so let's say, teens growth on e-commerce on 40% of the cross-border business. Travel after the post-pandemic run-up has normalized. It's a little hard to tell exactly where it's going to stabilize at, but we've seen high growth. We've seen it continue to normalize. But what we do know structurally, is that with e-commerce being a bigger portion of the business, that's a tail into the total cross-border growth. And so, we are confident that that will continue to be healthy relative to the domestic spend. I'll pause there and certainly if there's anything else to add, Ryan, or others, please jump in.\nRyan McInerney: No, nothing to add from me, Chris. Thanks, Darrin.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Jeffrey from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. Very impressive value-added services growth this quarter at 23%. And I think as you mentioned, Chris, it's approaching 25% of total revenue, so perhaps driving more than half your consolidated revenue growth. Can you talk a little bit about at what point we might expect value-added services to sort of bend up the growth curve of Visa consolidated?\nRyan McInerney: It's Ryan, Andrew. Thanks for the question. And yes, we're very excited about not only what we delivered, in terms of value-added services growth for the quarter. What we've been delivering consistently for several years now, since we shared with you all the strategy, and kind of became very purposeful about our go-to-market approach. I mean, you go back to I think it was 2021, we did about $5 billion in revenue, 2022, $6 billion. Last year was $7 billion. Like you said, we did $2.2 billion this quarter, up 23%. So I think what we've shown, is that we have delivered consistent growth quarter-after-quarter, and year-after-year in these businesses. And we're super optimistic about where we go from here. I mean, we think about the opportunities really in three different segments. The first is, we have a series of value-added services, some of which Chris outlined in his previous answer that, are very focused on enhancing value for Visa transactions. Risk products like Visa Secure, dispute tools like Visa Resolve Online, card benefits, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we've - that has historically been the largest part of our value-added services business. And we've shown that we can drive great growth in that area. Increasingly, we're building out a set of services that add value for non-Visa transactions. We've done some things in this space before. Some of our platforms like CyberSource, Authorize.Net, Verifi. But then you've heard me talk in the last couple of quarters about expanding our risk capabilities. For example, to not just other card networks, but also to RFCP and account-to-account services. And I mentioned the great results we've had in both the U.K. and in Argentina on that front. And then the third area of opportunity for us, is expanding our value-added services beyond payments. Historically, we've had things like Visa Consulting and Analytics and our marketing services And some of the open banking services delivered by Tink, but we're continuing to build out a portfolio of value-added services, for our clients and partners beyond payments things like the cyber protection capabilities that we've been bringing to market. So, we've demonstrated consistent growth. We believe we'll be able to continue to demonstrate consistent growth. We've got a product pipeline, and a go-to-market approach all over the world with a diverse set of clients, and we feel good about the opportunity.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys, good afternoon. Chris, just want to ask about incentives, being the lowest expectation will be for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about how much of that is volume-driven, versus the amount of renewals you're seeing? And just trying to think about, as we head into next fiscal year, just what kind of growth or sustainable growth should we think about for incentives? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Thanks for the question. I'll even take us back a little bit about the expectations that, we had for incentives coming into the fiscal year. As we ended fiscal '23, that was a high year for us in terms of volume of renewals, a little higher than our typical sort of normal cadence. That did impact how we thought about the incentive volumes in FY '24. And even last year, we had sort of a different growth rate in the first half and the second half of the year. And so as we looked across this year, we had a slightly lower volume of renewals this year. Obviously, year-to-date incentives have played out slightly differently, largely due to client performance, deal timing, things like that. And overall, it's been better than, as it's been lower, I guess, than what we anticipated. When we go into Q4, sort of the same trend applies. We still expect Q4 to benefit from the lapping of the high incentives that, we saw in the second half of last year, which informs, again, the growth rate that we anticipate in Q4. We don't have a lot to share about FY 2025 at this point, but we'll share plenty in the next earnings call.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Suchoski from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nKen Suchoski: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about VAS and I think the team has talked about, how some of the VAS revenue is correlated with transaction growth. But you also have parts of that business that are more recurring, or less recurring in nature. So can you just help us understand how, you think about the cyclicality of VAS, and how that business might perform in a lower volume growth environment? And I also think the team has talked about pricing, for value in VAS. So how much more room is left to go there? And how does that help with the resiliency of the business? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yes Ken, it's Ryan. On the second part of your question, our ability to price for value is a function of the value that we bring to the market, and we feel great about the value that we're bringing to the market. And I think you see it in our results. Across the various different areas of issuing solutions, Acceptance Solutions, Risk & Identity Solutions, Advisory. I mean, we just continue to bring products and services that are ultimately, helping our clients grow their business, helping our clients reduce fraud, grow authorizations, those types of things. And we believe we'll continue to do that, and we believe we'll be able to continue to price for value. As I think I was saying earlier, there is - the biggest portion of our value-added services, are a function of Visa transactions. And so obviously, Visa transactions, as they go up or down, have an impact on that, but so does our ability to sell more services. On previous calls, I've talked about the fact that we still have the majority of our clients that have yet to have the type of penetration and depth that, we've been able to achieve with others. So, as we continue to penetrate our clients, all around the world in the various markets that we deliver, as I was saying earlier, to the earlier question, I'm very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow this business as we have.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Just curious if you're - if you've updated your U.S. outlook here in the second half, are you still expecting transaction sizes to accelerate in the U.S., especially in the fourth quarter?\nChris Suh: Hi, Tien-Tsin. Thanks for the question. Yes, we had forecasted ATS, as you know, growth to improve throughout the pace of this year from quarter-to-quarter, and we did see that. We saw ATS improve in the third quarter. Specifically in the U.S., ATS was slightly better in Q3 than in Q2. It got to basically flat year-over-year in Q3. We saw improvement in a number of categories, sequentially, restaurant, QSR fuel, telecom, utilities, insurance, to name a few. And we do anticipate in Q4 that we'll continue to see, slight improvement sequentially again. The one thing - the one watch out I'll call out is the fuel prices could impact that trajectory and so, we'll watch that closely. So yes, it is playing out as we anticipated. The pace is slightly varied from what we anticipated, but it is continuing to improve. And I think that's the important thing.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gus Gala from Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Please go ahead.\nGus Gala: Hi, guys. Thank you. Can we talk a little bit about the contactless payments penetration? Can you maybe highlight maybe what the gap is in penetration rates, across maybe some of your older cardholders or young cardholders? Just trying to get around to what a terminal level of penetration could look like? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: You're asking - just so I heard, you're asking about Tap to Pay?\nGus Gala: Yes.\nRyan McInerney: I mean, yes, maybe just back up first in the big picture of things. The fact that outside of the United States, eight out of 10 of all the Visa face-to-face transactions around the entire planet are Tap to Pay now, I mean, that just tells you right there that it's all segments, all demographics, all use cases, all product types. I mean, we're at 80% overall around the world. We've got, I think, more than 55 countries that are now more than 90% contactless penetration. So increasingly, in most countries for most customers, for most products all around the world, that's just the default way that people are paying. And in the U.S., the curve is maturing exactly how we'd expect it based on what we've seen in 100-plus countries all around the world. As I said in my prepared remarks, now one out of every two transactions in the U.S. are taps. In a place like New York City, where many of you on the call spend time, we're above 75% now. So in New York City, where - which is one of the early adopters of transit, we're above, I think, 75%-plus of all face-to-face transactions. That's up from just 50% two years ago. So again, at that level of penetration in a market the size of New York City, it's across the board in terms of products and issuers, and segments and the like. So, I think as we continue to see this growth happen, buyers, sellers, they love tapping as a way to pay. And we're going to continue to see that growth accelerate in a place like the U.S.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nWill Nance: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. We've been getting a lot of questions around the litigation updates, and I totally understand the level of uncertainty is a lot higher now. But I guess the most common investor question that we're getting is, around the potential impacts to the overall ecosystem, if we see a much greater reduction in interchange rates from what was proposed. And I guess specifically how the production and interchange rates, could reverberate through renewal negotiations with issuers, and then longer term, how this may impact the trajectory of incentives and net yields. So just wondering if we could hear kind of your perspective, about the potential reduction, or a larger reduction in the overall size of sort of ecosystem revenue, and if that changes the direction of any of the key indicators that we're focused on over time? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Hi, Will. Thanks for the question. And you're asking about the MDL litigation. I guess I'll just back up. The first thing I would say is we strongly disagree with the judge's decision. We believe the settlement was fair. We believe the settlement provided meaningful relief to all merchants. The second thing, I would say is the decision failed to take into consideration a number of things, especially the complex multisided ecosystem that we operate in. The role that - the complicated role that many different players in the ecosystem delivered. So, but having said that, we're pursuing a revised settlement. It's too early to speculate on what that settlement is. So I just - I won't do that today. But I would ask everybody to keep in mind, a settlement can occur at any point before, during, or even after the trial. So just keep that in mind as the process plays out.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I want to hit on that at the same time tackles, both incentives and value-added services revenue. So it's the concept of value in-kind incentives. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether or not, these are becoming more prominent, meaning you're using them a little bit more in discussions with issuers. And then, if you could just briefly recap some of the mechanics around the revenue recognition, the contra revenue, the addition to deferred revenue. And then eventually, the value-added services revenue? Thanks a lot.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. I'll just give you the high level on this. The value in-kind is a great way for us to, as it says, to deliver value to our clients. And increasingly, our clients, as you see in our performance are preferring to buy our value-added services, versus just take incentives that might drop to the bottom line. So that is absolutely something that, our clients are asking for more of. It's something that is helping our clients grow their businesses. And I talked earlier about just the last several years about our product pipeline, how we've gone to market, how we built new products to solutions and services for our clients. And that's what's driving the demand. So that's kind of become a more important part of our client renewals and our client renewal discussions. And increasingly value-added services are becoming a way for us to differentiate ourselves with our clients, and grow our consumer payments business. Do you want to talk about the organics?\nChris Suh: Tim, to the second part of your question, maybe I'll just give you a high-level summary. I think you have sort of the pieces you called out. At a high level, when value in-kind is offered in lieu of a cash incentive, it can - it would be recognized as a contra revenue at the time that it's granted or earned, depending on the nature of the contract. And then on the other side, when the client is able to utilize that value in-kind for services from Visa, commonly in our value-added services business, that's then recognized as revenue and the associated costs are also recognized in our P&L.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to just ask a follow-up question on near-term trends. We've seen a little bit of further slowing in credit than in debit over the last couple of months, and in the past has been a little bit of an indication of consumer stress. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that. And it seems like you're looking for the rest of the September quarter that, there's a little bit of a re-acceleration, as we get past some of the issues that you identified in July. Just want to make sure that I'm understanding that correctly, and kind of how we should interpret a little bit of the divergence in credit and debit growth right now? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Let me just give a little context on it and then Chris, feel free to add or correct. Like Chris said, we're three weeks into the quarter. We had a hurricane. We had a tech outage across the country. We had a number of things happen. So, we're not kind of taking three weeks as a trend. We'll see kind of how things progress from here, in just terms kind of what happens for the rest of the quarter. I don't know if you want to talk about the credit-debit divergence.\nChris Suh: Yes. Well, I think I'll refer back to a little bit of a comment that we made, and we're seeing the July results. I also commented on the call that we are seeing a little bit of moderation in what I would call the lower spend band cohorts. And I think that's a little bit correlated, to some of the volume numbers that we're seeing in the quarter, related to credit versus debit. But all in all, when we look at it relative to, again, Q2 and Q3, we see it to be relatively stable once you factor in sort of the days mix with the leap year.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Wanted to ask on new flows here. So you had a nice acceleration in growth really over the last two quarters on consistent comps. Can you add more color on the particular areas of strength that have picked up? I know Visa Direct was one of those. I'm just curious if you think you could sustain that level of expansion, or may that moderate a bit?\nChris Suh: Yes. Thanks for the question. 18% growth, as I mentioned, feel really good about the execution and the momentum in the business. It is an enormous opportunity that we have in front of us, across both our commercial business and money movement with Visa Direct. I think you're familiar with the numbers, 41% growth in the transactions and stable commercial volumes as well. I think what - this acceleration that you're referring to, we had a unique situation in Q1 where we had some onetime items that really kind of depressed the growth, reported growth in Q1. And if you look at the last couple of quarters, it's more reflective, I think, of the underlying health in the business. That said, as we saw in Q1, that growth rate can vary from quarter-to-quarter, based on deal timing and terms and one-time items like the one that impacted Q1. And so overall, I'd say at the macro level, good momentum. The underlying business is healthy, and we're continuing to see that level of growth. And the growth rate should be healthier, and should continue to grow faster than consumer payments, with some normal expected variability quarter-to-quarter.\nRyan McInerney: And just to build on Chris' points, I think we're in the very early stages of Visa Direct growth. We spent many, many years investing and building the platform, the infrastructure, the connectivity, domestic cross-border, working with issuers and acquirers and processors. And now we're able to be out there selling all around the world, finding new use cases, some of which I highlighted in my prepared remarks. You go back to 2019, we did 2 billion Visa Direct transactions. We did 2.6 billion transactions this quarter. So this is just another great example of, when we go and we systematically identify the need in the market, we spend the time, we build the infrastructure. We build 8.5 billion end points, the connectivity, the reliability, the security, the fraud capabilities. I just think we're in the very early stages of what we're going to see, in terms of the growth of this business and the number of use cases and partners, many of which I highlighted in my prepared remarks that, are going to want to build their use cases on this platform.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. I guess most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just on that last point, Ryan, you were making, I'm just wondering, where are we in the evolution of yield there? Can those go higher as you continue to expand in some of those categories with Visa Direct? And then just in terms of Reg II, is the full impact of Reg II now in the run rate, or should we expect there be any uncertainties related to that? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. I'll take both of them. On the first one, we're still in the early evolution of the use cases. I mean, we weren't even talking about earned wage access a couple of years ago, Sanjay. And so as we've got - I think we've got 65 or so use cases now on the platform, our teams are finding new use cases all the time. So I think we're continuing to see the evolution of all of that and the economics of all that will play out. What I would point you back to, is what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the tremendous success we're having in cross-border. We've had great success in selling new use cases, and driving cross-border transaction growth in Visa Direct. As you know, the yields are higher in cross-border, given the value that we add. So again, feel good about all of that. Listen, I want to just emphasize in terms of Reg II, the e-commerce debit market is a very competitive market, and is going to be competitive for as far as we can see. So while Chris noted, I think noted that the impact has remained the same, we haven't seen any change in impact, and I don't - and we're not expecting any change in impact for the fourth quarter. It is a competitive business. We are out there with clients day in and day out, helping them understand the benefits of processing transactions on Visa. And there are a lot of them, which is why we feel good so far in the evolution of Reg II, about how we've been able to grow that business. We feel great about the capabilities that a Visa data transaction offers, many of which I've talked about on these calls in the past. So we're out there, we're competing, we're selling, we're delivering our products, and we feel good about our win rate.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks guys. So just a clarification on revenue, and then a question on volumes for this fiscal year. So it sounds like for Q4, you're looking for revenue growth of, call it, 11% to 12%. I think that would put you at the low end of the low double-digit guide, you're maintaining for the year. So that's what I wanted to clarify. And then just a question on volumes. I think you said Q4 should be in line with Q3, which I think would bring the full year to around 7%, versus the high single-digit updated guide last quarter. So just as we start to tune our models for next year, what are some of the potential accelerants off that 7% level we should be considering?\nChris Suh: Hi, Jason, let's unpack that. You had a couple of things in there, and I just want to - I think this is important, so we'll just be super clear. For Q4, my guidance, our guidance for our Q4 adjusted net revenue would be low double-digits. And sort of the directional guidance I also gave is it would be slightly above the Q3 level that we reported, which was the 10% growth in the quarter. And so sort of take that - take those two points and I would triangulate around that. And that would still get you sort of to the math of the low end of low double-digits, as you called it, for the full year. The second point was on drivers from Q3 to Q4. I did say that payment volume, payment transactions, we anticipate Q4 to be consistent with Q3. The one exception to that is in cross-border, where I did say it'd be slightly below the Q3 levels. And that really is based on the travel circumstances and situation in Asia that we've talked about extensively, with outbound travel in Asia, in particular, being impacted and recovering slower than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And so, those are the two variables in terms of the - to get the Q4 guidance consistent with the intent - that I communicated. And then as far as FY '25 goes, we're at the beginning end of planning, and as we always do, we'll share our expectations on '25 at the end of Q4.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. I guess more of a big picture question here, Ryan. So your AI and gen AI investment, you've talked about, I think at conferences, your desire to kind of build out your own large language model. So I'm wondering, one, where do those investments stand today? I guess, two, what would be your expectation for early use cases of those investments, and kind of the payback period? And then three, is there an opportunity to drive, like true incremental sales, or better outcomes for your merchant constituents as opposed to just the banks? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. Hi, Dan, thanks for the question on AI. First of all, to frame it is, we are all in on gen AI at Visa as we've been all in on predictive AI, for more than a decade. We're applying it in two broad-based different ways. One is, sort of adopting across the company to drive productivity, and we're seeing real results there. We're seeing great results, great adoption, great productivity increases from technology, to accounting to sales all across the company. The second is applying generative AI to enhance the entire payment ecosystem. And to the latter part of your question, absolutely. I guess I'd give you one set of examples or some of the risk tools and capabilities that we've been deploying in the market. I mentioned the risk products that we're using on RTP and account-to-account payments. That is an opportunity to reduce fraud, both for merchants and for issuers. I think I mentioned on a previous call, we have our Visa Provisioning Intelligence Service, which is using artificial intelligence to help predict token provisioning fraud before it happens. That also is a benefit to both issuers and merchants. And the list goes on. So, we are very optimistic about the positive impact that generative AI can have, not just on our own productivity, but on our ability to help drive increased sales and lower fraud across the ecosystem.\nJennifer Como: We'll do one more question, please.\nOperator: For our final question, we'll go to the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon. Ryan, Chris U.S. card volume growth of 5% in surface kind of suggests a little bit more of a mature market. Now I understand the category differences between card volume growth and DC growth, which influence the delta here. Ryan, you discussed your global down estimate of $20 trillion in consumer payments for Visa. How should we think about, the secular digitization opportunity and the growth algorithm for the U.S., which is your biggest market? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Okay. It was a little hard for us to hear you, Harshita, but I think I got the gist of your question around the growth algorithm for consumer payments, especially in mature markets. So as I've said before, we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity around the world. About a quarter of that is in the U.S., by the way. And that's cash, that's check, that's ACH, that's electronic transactions, that's cards that run on domestic networks and the like. And we're capturing that opportunity through a few different ways. One is continuing to expand acceptance and expand the places, where people can use cards. In the U.S., rent would be a great example. We've been having some really good success, penetrating the rent vertical. The second is making it easier to drive e-commerce growth and e-commerce transactions, which has an outsourced impact on our ability to drive growth on Visa, for those types of things. And third is just continuing to innovate with new products and services that, make our issuers want to issue Visa and consumers want to use them. We announced a full slate of new product innovations at our Visa Payments Forum this year. And those are the types of products that, we believe are going to help us win in the marketplace, and help us capture and digitize a big chunk of that opportunity on the Visa network.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, all, for participating in the Visa fiscal third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and please enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Suh",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we had another strong quarter with relatively stable growth across payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions when compared to Q2, adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year and cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, was up 14% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Fiscal third quarter net revenue was up 10% in both GAAP and constant dollars, in line with our expectations. EPS was up 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant dollars. Now let's go into the details. In the U.S., payment volumes growth numbers were generally in line with Q2 adjusted for leap year, with total Q3 payments volume growing 5% year-over-year, with credit and debit also growing 5%. Card-present volume grew 2% and card-not-present volume grew 7%. In the U.S., while growth in the high spend consumer segment remained stable compared to prior quarters, we saw a slight moderation in the lower spend consumer segment. Moving to international markets. Total payments volume was up 10% in constant dollars, relatively stable with Q2 when adjusted for leap year. Payments volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions, with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe ex U.K. each growing more than 16% in constant dollars. Asia Pacific payments volume slowed to less than 0.5 point of year-over-year growth in constant dollars for the quarter, driven primarily by the macroeconomic environment, most notably in Mainland China. Now to cross-border volume, which I will speak to today in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 14% in Q3, relatively stable to Q2 adjusted for leap year. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, was in the mid-teens, helped by continued strength in retail. Cross-border travel volume growth was also up in the mid-teens or 157% indexed to 2019. This quarter, we saw the inbound Asia Pacific Index improve nine points at a similar pace to Q2 to 151% of 2019. The improvement in Asia Pacific outbound travel, however, slowed from Q2 with the index increasing by less than one point to 125% of 2019. We continue to see the same primary drivers as last quarter with some additional pressure from macroeconomic conditions. Now let's review our third quarter financial results. I'll start with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 8% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q2 constant dollar payments volume, with revenue yield improving sequentially and versus last year due to improving utilization of card benefit. Data processing revenue grew 9% versus 10% processed transaction growth with the revenue yield generally in line sequentially and versus last year. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 14% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping higher currency volatility from last year. Volatility levels remain consistent on average to last quarter. Other revenue grew 31%, primarily driven by strong consulting and marketing services revenue related to the Olympics and, to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 11%. Now on to our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transaction growth. New flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions grew 41% year-over-year, helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Commercial volumes rose 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Q3, value-added services revenue grew 23% in constant dollars to $2.2 billion, primarily driven by Issuing and Acceptance Solutions and Advisory Services. Operating expenses grew 14%, primarily due to increases in general and administrative personnel and marketing expenses, including spend related to the Olympics. FX was 0.5 point drag versus the 1.5 point benefit we expected. Pismo represented an approximately one point drag. Nonoperating income was $73 million. Our tax rate was 18.8% and EPS was $2.42, up 12% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 1.5 point drag from exchange rates and an approximately 0.5 point drag from Pismo. In Q3, we bought back approximately $4.8 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of June, we had $18.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in July through the 21st with volume growth in constant dollars. Cross-border is excluding intra-Europe. U.S. payments volume was up 4% with debit up 4% and credit up 3% year-over-year. The slight deceleration from Q3 does not appear to be from any one factor but likely a number of smaller factors such as weather, timing of promotional shopping events, and the technology outage, among others. Cross-border volume grew 13% year-over-year, below Q3 levels with travel-related volume growing slightly less, which continued to be impacted by Asia Pacific and card-not-present ex travel volume growing at similar levels to Q3. Processed transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excludes acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. Let's start with the fourth quarter. We expect payments volume and processed transactions to grow at a similar rate to Q3. For total cross-border volume growth, we are expecting to end up slightly below Q3. Currency volatility continues to average around 4-year lows through July 21. And as such, we are making an adjustment to currency volatility expectations for Q4, now assuming volatility will stay in line with Q3 levels. Incentives are expected to be at their lowest growth rate all year. Pulling it all together, we expect adjusted net revenue growth in the low double digits, which equates to a slight improvement from the 10% adjusted revenue growth rate in the third quarter. We expect our Q4 adjusted operating expenses to grow in the high single digits. Nonoperating income is expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 19% and 19.5% in Q4, which puts Q4 adjusted EPS growth rate in the high end of low double digits. Moving to the full year. With three quarters now complete, our expectations for full year adjusted net revenue growth remains unchanged from what we shared at the start of the year. Whilst absorbing the impact of lower currency volatility and the macroeconomic challenges in Asia, which have affected volumes, we still expect to reach low double-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the full year. Full year adjusted operating expense growth will be in the high single digit to low double digits, reflecting the less favorable impact of FX. This keeps full year adjusted EPS growth in the low teens. In closing, we delivered strong results this quarter, with new flows and value added services revenue growing faster than consumer payments. We extended our existing relationships, one new clients and invested to develop innovative products and solutions, all positioning us for continued growth into the future. But now Jennifer, it's time for some Q&A. Yes. Hi Darrin. So let me start with the U.S. Let me start with the first part of your question, and then we'll maybe get into zoom out and talk about maybe the longer question. So in the U.S. in Q3, we did see stable drivers relative to Q2, once you adjust for leap year. That's 5% payment volumes growth in the third quarter. In the 21 days since in July, that number did tick down to 4%. Maybe I'll just sort of give you the full arc of what we're seeing. So 4%, we'll just level set on those numbers, 4% in the 21 days versus 5% in Q3. And so for that, we did stare at a lot of the drivers, the factors that impacted those three weeks. And there was a lot going on and I referenced a few of them on the call and maybe I'll expand on those a bit. First, we had a major hurricane, Hurricane Beryl, and it impacted Texas and other parts of the U.S. nearby. The second, I referenced the timing of promotional e-commerce events. Maybe I can expand on that a little bit. The timing this year was later and then e-commerce customers are billed, when the goods are shipped. And so, some of that shipping periods fell out of that 21 period. So we had a little bit of difference in the 21 day period, to the comparable year ago. And third, obviously the major tech outage that happened at the end of last week, that also had some impact. So, when we look at that, no single factor drove that one point of change from Q3, to the first part of July. But all things considered, we actually feel pretty good about the three week results. Now the second part of your question really was around sort of the low double-digits in the context of cross-border, VAS and CMS. I'll sort of back into the question. We've had consistent strong performance in VAS, over $2 billion of revenue, over 20% growth for many quarters consecutively. And we're seeing strength across the business in issuing solutions and acceptance and advisory. That's a business that we feel great about the momentum in. With our new flows business, 18% growth, as Ryan talked about, in the quarter, that's the second quarter in a row, where we're seeing growth in the teens, great execution, stable volumes, and visa direct transactions growing at a high level. As you know, that business also, quarter-to-quarter, can vary a little bit in the growth rates, as we saw in the first half of the year. But all in all, feel really good about the continued strength in that business. And then cross-border, well, cross-border, maybe I'll just zoom out a little bit and talk about cross-border and what we've seen over the course of time. If you recall, pre-pandemic, cross-border grew, travel grew in the high single-digits to low double-digits. And e-commerce, which was about a third of the business, grew into the teens, sometimes into the mid-teens. Obviously, the pandemic happened, travel really contracted, e-commerce grew faster. And since then, now post-pandemic, what we're seeing now is that e-commerce is roughly 40% of the business. And the growth rate has normalized. It's stabilized back to pre-pandemic levels. And so let's say, teens growth on e-commerce on 40% of the cross-border business. Travel after the post-pandemic run-up has normalized. It's a little hard to tell exactly where it's going to stabilize at, but we've seen high growth. We've seen it continue to normalize. But what we do know structurally, is that with e-commerce being a bigger portion of the business, that's a tail into the total cross-border growth. And so, we are confident that that will continue to be healthy relative to the domestic spend. I'll pause there and certainly if there's anything else to add, Ryan, or others, please jump in. Thanks for the question. I'll even take us back a little bit about the expectations that, we had for incentives coming into the fiscal year. As we ended fiscal '23, that was a high year for us in terms of volume of renewals, a little higher than our typical sort of normal cadence. That did impact how we thought about the incentive volumes in FY '24. And even last year, we had sort of a different growth rate in the first half and the second half of the year. And so as we looked across this year, we had a slightly lower volume of renewals this year. Obviously, year-to-date incentives have played out slightly differently, largely due to client performance, deal timing, things like that. And overall, it's been better than, as it's been lower, I guess, than what we anticipated. When we go into Q4, sort of the same trend applies. We still expect Q4 to benefit from the lapping of the high incentives that, we saw in the second half of last year, which informs, again, the growth rate that we anticipate in Q4. We don't have a lot to share about FY 2025 at this point, but we'll share plenty in the next earnings call. Hi, Tien-Tsin. Thanks for the question. Yes, we had forecasted ATS, as you know, growth to improve throughout the pace of this year from quarter-to-quarter, and we did see that. We saw ATS improve in the third quarter. Specifically in the U.S., ATS was slightly better in Q3 than in Q2. It got to basically flat year-over-year in Q3. We saw improvement in a number of categories, sequentially, restaurant, QSR fuel, telecom, utilities, insurance, to name a few. And we do anticipate in Q4 that we'll continue to see, slight improvement sequentially again. The one thing - the one watch out I'll call out is the fuel prices could impact that trajectory and so, we'll watch that closely. So yes, it is playing out as we anticipated. The pace is slightly varied from what we anticipated, but it is continuing to improve. And I think that's the important thing. Tim, to the second part of your question, maybe I'll just give you a high-level summary. I think you have sort of the pieces you called out. At a high level, when value in-kind is offered in lieu of a cash incentive, it can - it would be recognized as a contra revenue at the time that it's granted or earned, depending on the nature of the contract. And then on the other side, when the client is able to utilize that value in-kind for services from Visa, commonly in our value-added services business, that's then recognized as revenue and the associated costs are also recognized in our P&L. Yes. Well, I think I'll refer back to a little bit of a comment that we made, and we're seeing the July results. I also commented on the call that we are seeing a little bit of moderation in what I would call the lower spend band cohorts. And I think that's a little bit correlated, to some of the volume numbers that we're seeing in the quarter, related to credit versus debit. But all in all, when we look at it relative to, again, Q2 and Q3, we see it to be relatively stable once you factor in sort of the days mix with the leap year. Yes. Thanks for the question. 18% growth, as I mentioned, feel really good about the execution and the momentum in the business. It is an enormous opportunity that we have in front of us, across both our commercial business and money movement with Visa Direct. I think you're familiar with the numbers, 41% growth in the transactions and stable commercial volumes as well. I think what - this acceleration that you're referring to, we had a unique situation in Q1 where we had some onetime items that really kind of depressed the growth, reported growth in Q1. And if you look at the last couple of quarters, it's more reflective, I think, of the underlying health in the business. That said, as we saw in Q1, that growth rate can vary from quarter-to-quarter, based on deal timing and terms and one-time items like the one that impacted Q1. And so overall, I'd say at the macro level, good momentum. The underlying business is healthy, and we're continuing to see that level of growth. And the growth rate should be healthier, and should continue to grow faster than consumer payments, with some normal expected variability quarter-to-quarter. Hi, Jason, let's unpack that. You had a couple of things in there, and I just want to - I think this is important, so we'll just be super clear. For Q4, my guidance, our guidance for our Q4 adjusted net revenue would be low double-digits. And sort of the directional guidance I also gave is it would be slightly above the Q3 level that we reported, which was the 10% growth in the quarter. And so sort of take that - take those two points and I would triangulate around that. And that would still get you sort of to the math of the low end of low double-digits, as you called it, for the full year. The second point was on drivers from Q3 to Q4. I did say that payment volume, payment transactions, we anticipate Q4 to be consistent with Q3. The one exception to that is in cross-border, where I did say it'd be slightly below the Q3 levels. And that really is based on the travel circumstances and situation in Asia that we've talked about extensively, with outbound travel in Asia, in particular, being impacted and recovering slower than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And so, those are the two variables in terms of the - to get the Q4 guidance consistent with the intent - that I communicated. And then as far as FY '25 goes, we're at the beginning end of planning, and as we always do, we'll share our expectations on '25 at the end of Q4."

            "name": "Ryan McInerney",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered strong third quarter results with $8.9 billion in net revenue, up 10% year-over-year, and EPS up 12%. Our key business drivers were relatively stable as compared to Q2, adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 7% year-over-year, U.S. payments volume grew 5%, and international payments volume grew 10%. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, rose 14%, and processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. We recently received the results from our annual Global Client Engagement Survey where Visa achieved a Global Net Promoter Score, or NPS, of 76, up three points from last year. We saw NPS increases across all of our client types, merchants, issuers, fintechs, and processors and across our regions, the results remain strong, with a notable 6-point NPS improvement in North America. I want to thank all of our 30,000 employees who helped deliver these fantastic results. And as I review some highlights from the quarter, you'll see how this focus on serving our clients by meeting their needs, innovating, and helping them grow is fueling our success across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Let's start with consumer payments, where we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity to capture cash, check, ACH, domestic schemes and other forms of electronic payment. In our client engagement survey, our clients ranked our strategic partnership and our brand as two of the most important factors to our successful relationships. I'll share some examples of how each of these played out this quarter. In strategic partnerships, we are constantly seeking ways to add more value and grow together with our clients. We are pleased to have been named the Preferred Network Partner by Lloyds Banking Group, renewing our debit relationship and significantly expanding our relationship in credit, winning 10 million additional credit credentials across the Group's consumer and commercial business. Also in the U.K., NatWest has launched a new Visa Travel Reward credit card, following the signing of our partnership last year. They will also be utilizing many value-added services, including transaction controls and card benefits. On the European continent, we worked with Raiffeisen Bank International AG, a leading bank in several markets. And recently, in the Czech Republic and Romania, we renewed our commercial business and expanded our consumer debit and credit business totaling over two million potential new credentials. In Korea, we deepened our partnership with leading issuer KB Kookmin Card. Already a user of Visa Direct cross-border money movement and a Visa consumer and commercial issuer, they will grow their consumer credit and debit portfolios with Visa and use value-added services, including consulting and marketing services. In Peru, we extended our partnership with leading issuer, Banco de Credito de Peru, across consumer and commercial portfolios with plans to launch additional new flows offerings and value-added services. In the U.S., we extended our agreement with Wells Fargo. This will allow us to continue to support Wells Fargo's strategy to reinvent their credit business and provide additional growth by leveraging key Visa assets like consulting and Visa sponsorships such as FIFA and the Olympic and Paralympic Games. On the brand front, with the Olympic Games opening ceremony later this week, it is exciting to see the engagement with the Visa brand and activation across the world in marketing campaigns, cardholder experiences and Olympic and Paralympic-branded Visa issuance, which I am happy to report in Europe is at nearly six million cards compared to the five million number I quoted just last quarter. We have also added nearly 100,000 new merchant locations in France in advance of the event. Our brand also plays an important role in winning co-brand partnerships. In India, growing credit issuance and reaching affluent and cross-border consumers remain areas of focus. We are excited about the launch of a co-brand card with Adani One and ICICI Bank as India's first co-branded credit card with rich airport-linked benefits for their target base of 400 million customers through the Adani One platform. We also signed an agreement to launch a new co-brand card with Tata Digital, along with an Indian banking partner, building on the success of our existing credit co-brand relationship. This new co-brand offering consists of a multicurrency prepaid foreign exchange card that will target travelers from India, also benefiting from the rewards of the Tata Digital Super App, Tata Neu. Across seven countries in Latin America, we will work with Unicomer, a major retailer and financial services provider with numerous brands to deliver a co-brand credit card in addition to using CyberSource. And in CEMEA, we reached a de novo co-brand arrangement with BinDawood, a leading grocer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with 88 outlets and over five million loyalty program members. On the travel side, we extended our relationship with Malaysia Airlines from a prepaid co-brand card targeting millennials and Gen Z customers to also launch a new co-brand credit card for the travel-minded affluent. And in the U.S., Turkish Airlines have chosen Visa to be their exclusive network partner for their new Miles and Smiles co-brand credit card. Our consumer payment strategy is focused on growing credentials as we are doing across all the partnerships I just mentioned and increasing acceptance locations. And wallets are a great example of where this comes together, where Visa can be a funding source, an embedded credential, and an accepted form of payment by wallet merchants. This increases the value proposition for wallet providers and their users. Two wallet highlights this quarter are in Peru and Vietnam. Yape is a Peruvian super app with more than 15 million users who already have a Visa credential that enables them to send money across P2P apps via Visa Direct. And just recently, they launched Tap to Phone functionality for their more than two million merchants to accept Visa. And in Vietnam, a country with approximately 50 million wallet users, the three leading digital wallets, MoMo, VNPAY, and ZaloPay are now enabling their users to utilize Visa cards as a funding source for transactions at over 500,000 QR acceptance points managed by these wallets. One additional area that we are very focused on is delivering simple, easy, and secure checkout experiences. Let me share a few recent examples. First, we are integrating Click to Pay and the Visa Payment Passkey Service, enabling a customer to authenticate themselves using biometrics. Already, we have hundreds of issuers enabled for passkeys in Europe and a number of issuers who represent more than 50% of our e-commerce payments volume in Europe piloting the solution. Second, we crossed 10 billion tokens this quarter, a significant milestone. And in 2023 alone, Visa tokens helped generate more than an estimated $40 billion in incremental e-commerce revenue for businesses globally and saved more than $600 million in fraud. Third is the ability to tap for more use cases on a mobile device. With tapping as one of the best in-person commerce experiences, we want to provide Visa users with more ways to tap, including Tap to Pay, tap to authenticate an identity, tap to add a card, or tap to send money to family or friends. And finally, this quarter, Tap to Pay grew four percentage points from last year to 80% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the U.S. In the U.S., we surpassed 50% and have 30 U.S. cities above 60% penetration. Now moving on to new flows. This quarter, new flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars with Visa Direct overall transactions growing 41% for the quarter to 2.6 billion and commercial volumes up 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. Let me provide some updates, starting with B2B, where we have focused on penetrating new verticals and delivering innovative products and solutions. In healthcare, we will work with AXA and Paysure to launch a commercial virtual card solution to simplify the claims processes for their customers worldwide. We have also expanded our virtual card acceptance with a key business services provider, Cintas, who offers uniform, safety, and fire protection services to over one million customers. Together with our partner, Billtrust, we will help Cintas streamline their payments, automate processes, and manage costs on Billtrust's Business Payments Network or BPN. We also just recently extended our long-standing BPN collaboration with Billtrust that connects suppliers and buyers to facilitate straight-through processing of virtual card payments with rich data that optimizes acceptance costs. Our products and solutions in B2B remain very important in winning and growing our business. One such solution is the enhanced B2B data that we can provide. In Brazil, together with Solero, a leading business financial management solution, we will provide issuers with enhanced visibility into small business spend by aggregating data across cards, bank accounts, boletos and more, enabling them to better manage their client relationships and offer compelling products. Another solution is Spend Clarity, which provides expense program management, including card issuance, controls, and reporting. Wells Fargo has white-labeled our solution called Wells One Expense Manager, which has now onboarded 6,000 corporate clients representing over one million users, providing access to their spend data. Now moving on to Visa Direct. We continued to grow our transactions through expanded and new relationships. Over the past year, total Visa Direct cross-border P2P transactions have nearly doubled, with Europe and CEMEA being the largest regions. In CEMEA, we are very excited to have renewed our Visa Direct relationship with fintech Monobank in addition to renewing their consumer and commercial credit, debit, and prepaid portfolios. In Asia Pacific, we are partnering with China Zhongsheng Bank on cross-border capabilities, including Visa Direct and Currencycloud, allowing the bank to support cross-border payments for their merchant clients. Canadian fintech Nuvei has extended its agreement with us for Visa Direct across all cross-border use cases in more than 30 countries for their merchant clients and recently became the first Visa Direct enabler in Colombia. We also executed our first global agreement with WorldRemit and Sendwave, enabling their customers to eventually send Visa Direct cross-border remittances from 50 countries to recipients in 130 countries. Quickly, a leading South Asian marketplace, has enabled Visa Direct cross-border remittance solutions for U.S. customers to send money to relatives and friends in India and the rest of South Asia. And in earned wage access, we reached an agreement with Weaver, a U.K.-based embedded finance provider. In addition to card issuance, they will be utilizing Visa Direct to enable Weaver's business clients to offer employee expense reimbursement, reward and recognition, and earned wage access. Earned wage access provider PayActiv, who serves 4,000 businesses has renewed its agreement with us and will enable Visa+ for payouts. Similarly, we expanded our relationship with enabler, Astra. In addition to domestic disbursements, Astra will now offer cross-border remittances, implement Visa+ to reach domestic wallets in the U.S., and expand to additional use cases, including payroll, earned wage access and marketplaces. Visa+ is still in the early stages but is fully rolled out and live for PayPal and Venmo users and more providers continue to join the platform. Wrapping up new flows, we also renewed an agreement with FIS, an important issuer processing partner to enable a suite of value-added services and new flows capabilities for their clients, including Visa Direct. And now on to value-added services, where revenue was up 23% in the third quarter in constant dollars. Let me highlight some of the progress we have made in driving adoption and growth among our value-added services portfolio. First in issuing solutions. One area of strong revenue growth this quarter was in card benefits, where we enable our clients to offer unique value propositions tailored to their customer base in travel, entertainment, restaurants, insurance and more. Strong issuance in premium cards across most of our regions has fueled this growth in the third quarter. For example, in Latin America, travel benefits have grown with over 370,000 unique visits to our Visa Infinite Airport Lounge in Brazil, representing customers from a number of leading issuers. In addition, since its launch in 2022, our Visa Infinite Fast Pass in Brazil, which allows cardholders to get through airport security more quickly, has screened over one million travelers. These are among the top five card benefits in Brazil and deliver value to customers, issuers and Visa. We continue to add more benefits like the recently launched partnership with OpenTable to offer eligible Visa cardholders access to coveted restaurant reservations and experiences in the U.S., with plans to expand into Canada and Mexico. In Acceptance Solutions, third quarter growth was driven by increasing utilization across both token and e-commerce-related services. In e-commerce, one such example is with iFood, the largest food delivery platform in Brazil who is utilizing our Verifi solution to help prevent disputes before they become chargebacks. In addition, they will be using our authentication solutions. In Risk & Identity Solutions, we continued to see strong adoption by new and existing clients, driven in part by growth in card-not-present transactions. In North America, acquirer Worldpay will be expanding their use of our authentication solutions from CardinalCommerce, fostering collaboration and real-time enhanced data exchange between Worldpay merchants and issuers during card-not-present transactions, reducing fraud and allowing more transactions to be properly authenticated and authorized securely. We are also pleased that the pilot of our account-to-account risk scoring solution Visa Protect with Pay.UK has had great results, showing an average 40% uplift in fraud detection over the 3-month pilot period. In addition, we are now launching Visa Protect in Argentina with a core payments technology company, Celsa after successfully piloting the solution there as well. The last two value-added services are open banking and advisory services. We continue to sign new partners with Tink in Europe and the U.S. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong growth in client demand for our consulting and marketing services, particularly around marquee events such as the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Our value-added services portfolio solutions is strong and is driving meaningful growth for our clients and for Visa. Before I close, I wanted to speak to the fact that the settlement reached for the injunctive relief class was rejected by the court. We are, of course, disappointed with this decision. We believe that the prior settlement provided meaningful relief to all merchants and we will continue to work towards another settlement. To close, so far this fiscal year, we have seen strong revenue and EPS growth as a result of relatively stable volume and transaction growth. I remain very excited about the opportunity that lies ahead of us. At Visa, we come to work in service of our clients and partners and are focused on building and deploying the best solutions possible across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Now over to Chris. No, nothing to add from me, Chris. Thanks, Darrin. It's Ryan, Andrew. Thanks for the question. And yes, we're very excited about not only what we delivered, in terms of value-added services growth for the quarter. What we've been delivering consistently for several years now, since we shared with you all the strategy, and kind of became very purposeful about our go-to-market approach. I mean, you go back to I think it was 2021, we did about $5 billion in revenue, 2022, $6 billion. Last year was $7 billion. Like you said, we did $2.2 billion this quarter, up 23%. So I think what we've shown, is that we have delivered consistent growth quarter-after-quarter, and year-after-year in these businesses. And we're super optimistic about where we go from here. I mean, we think about the opportunities really in three different segments. The first is, we have a series of value-added services, some of which Chris outlined in his previous answer that, are very focused on enhancing value for Visa transactions. Risk products like Visa Secure, dispute tools like Visa Resolve Online, card benefits, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we've - that has historically been the largest part of our value-added services business. And we've shown that we can drive great growth in that area. Increasingly, we're building out a set of services that add value for non-Visa transactions. We've done some things in this space before. Some of our platforms like CyberSource, Authorize.Net, Verifi. But then you've heard me talk in the last couple of quarters about expanding our risk capabilities. For example, to not just other card networks, but also to RFCP and account-to-account services. And I mentioned the great results we've had in both the U.K. and in Argentina on that front. And then the third area of opportunity for us, is expanding our value-added services beyond payments. Historically, we've had things like Visa Consulting and Analytics and our marketing services And some of the open banking services delivered by Tink, but we're continuing to build out a portfolio of value-added services, for our clients and partners beyond payments things like the cyber protection capabilities that we've been bringing to market. So, we've demonstrated consistent growth. We believe we'll be able to continue to demonstrate consistent growth. We've got a product pipeline, and a go-to-market approach all over the world with a diverse set of clients, and we feel good about the opportunity. Yes Ken, it's Ryan. On the second part of your question, our ability to price for value is a function of the value that we bring to the market, and we feel great about the value that we're bringing to the market. And I think you see it in our results. Across the various different areas of issuing solutions, Acceptance Solutions, Risk & Identity Solutions, Advisory. I mean, we just continue to bring products and services that are ultimately, helping our clients grow their business, helping our clients reduce fraud, grow authorizations, those types of things. And we believe we'll continue to do that, and we believe we'll be able to continue to price for value. As I think I was saying earlier, there is - the biggest portion of our value-added services, are a function of Visa transactions. And so obviously, Visa transactions, as they go up or down, have an impact on that, but so does our ability to sell more services. On previous calls, I've talked about the fact that we still have the majority of our clients that have yet to have the type of penetration and depth that, we've been able to achieve with others. So, as we continue to penetrate our clients, all around the world in the various markets that we deliver, as I was saying earlier, to the earlier question, I'm very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow this business as we have. You're asking - just so I heard, you're asking about Tap to Pay? I mean, yes, maybe just back up first in the big picture of things. The fact that outside of the United States, eight out of 10 of all the Visa face-to-face transactions around the entire planet are Tap to Pay now, I mean, that just tells you right there that it's all segments, all demographics, all use cases, all product types. I mean, we're at 80% overall around the world. We've got, I think, more than 55 countries that are now more than 90% contactless penetration. So increasingly, in most countries for most customers, for most products all around the world, that's just the default way that people are paying. And in the U.S., the curve is maturing exactly how we'd expect it based on what we've seen in 100-plus countries all around the world. As I said in my prepared remarks, now one out of every two transactions in the U.S. are taps. In a place like New York City, where many of you on the call spend time, we're above 75% now. So in New York City, where - which is one of the early adopters of transit, we're above, I think, 75%-plus of all face-to-face transactions. That's up from just 50% two years ago. So again, at that level of penetration in a market the size of New York City, it's across the board in terms of products and issuers, and segments and the like. So, I think as we continue to see this growth happen, buyers, sellers, they love tapping as a way to pay. And we're going to continue to see that growth accelerate in a place like the U.S. Hi, Will. Thanks for the question. And you're asking about the MDL litigation. I guess I'll just back up. The first thing I would say is we strongly disagree with the judge's decision. We believe the settlement was fair. We believe the settlement provided meaningful relief to all merchants. The second thing, I would say is the decision failed to take into consideration a number of things, especially the complex multisided ecosystem that we operate in. The role that - the complicated role that many different players in the ecosystem delivered. So, but having said that, we're pursuing a revised settlement. It's too early to speculate on what that settlement is. So I just - I won't do that today. But I would ask everybody to keep in mind, a settlement can occur at any point before, during, or even after the trial. So just keep that in mind as the process plays out. Yes. I'll just give you the high level on this. The value in-kind is a great way for us to, as it says, to deliver value to our clients. And increasingly, our clients, as you see in our performance are preferring to buy our value-added services, versus just take incentives that might drop to the bottom line. So that is absolutely something that, our clients are asking for more of. It's something that is helping our clients grow their businesses. And I talked earlier about just the last several years about our product pipeline, how we've gone to market, how we built new products to solutions and services for our clients. And that's what's driving the demand. So that's kind of become a more important part of our client renewals and our client renewal discussions. And increasingly value-added services are becoming a way for us to differentiate ourselves with our clients, and grow our consumer payments business. Do you want to talk about the organics? Let me just give a little context on it and then Chris, feel free to add or correct. Like Chris said, we're three weeks into the quarter. We had a hurricane. We had a tech outage across the country. We had a number of things happen. So, we're not kind of taking three weeks as a trend. We'll see kind of how things progress from here, in just terms kind of what happens for the rest of the quarter. I don't know if you want to talk about the credit-debit divergence. And just to build on Chris' points, I think we're in the very early stages of Visa Direct growth. We spent many, many years investing and building the platform, the infrastructure, the connectivity, domestic cross-border, working with issuers and acquirers and processors. And now we're able to be out there selling all around the world, finding new use cases, some of which I highlighted in my prepared remarks. You go back to 2019, we did 2 billion Visa Direct transactions. We did 2.6 billion transactions this quarter. So this is just another great example of, when we go and we systematically identify the need in the market, we spend the time, we build the infrastructure. We build 8.5 billion end points, the connectivity, the reliability, the security, the fraud capabilities. I just think we're in the very early stages of what we're going to see, in terms of the growth of this business and the number of use cases and partners, many of which I highlighted in my prepared remarks that, are going to want to build their use cases on this platform. Yes. I'll take both of them. On the first one, we're still in the early evolution of the use cases. I mean, we weren't even talking about earned wage access a couple of years ago, Sanjay. And so as we've got - I think we've got 65 or so use cases now on the platform, our teams are finding new use cases all the time. So I think we're continuing to see the evolution of all of that and the economics of all that will play out. What I would point you back to, is what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the tremendous success we're having in cross-border. We've had great success in selling new use cases, and driving cross-border transaction growth in Visa Direct. As you know, the yields are higher in cross-border, given the value that we add. So again, feel good about all of that. Listen, I want to just emphasize in terms of Reg II, the e-commerce debit market is a very competitive market, and is going to be competitive for as far as we can see. So while Chris noted, I think noted that the impact has remained the same, we haven't seen any change in impact, and I don't - and we're not expecting any change in impact for the fourth quarter. It is a competitive business. We are out there with clients day in and day out, helping them understand the benefits of processing transactions on Visa. And there are a lot of them, which is why we feel good so far in the evolution of Reg II, about how we've been able to grow that business. We feel great about the capabilities that a Visa data transaction offers, many of which I've talked about on these calls in the past. So we're out there, we're competing, we're selling, we're delivering our products, and we feel good about our win rate. Yes. Hi, Dan, thanks for the question on AI. First of all, to frame it is, we are all in on gen AI at Visa as we've been all in on predictive AI, for more than a decade. We're applying it in two broad-based different ways. One is, sort of adopting across the company to drive productivity, and we're seeing real results there. We're seeing great results, great adoption, great productivity increases from technology, to accounting to sales all across the company. The second is applying generative AI to enhance the entire payment ecosystem. And to the latter part of your question, absolutely. I guess I'd give you one set of examples or some of the risk tools and capabilities that we've been deploying in the market. I mentioned the risk products that we're using on RTP and account-to-account payments. That is an opportunity to reduce fraud, both for merchants and for issuers. I think I mentioned on a previous call, we have our Visa Provisioning Intelligence Service, which is using artificial intelligence to help predict token provisioning fraud before it happens. That also is a benefit to both issuers and merchants. And the list goes on. So, we are very optimistic about the positive impact that generative AI can have, not just on our own productivity, but on our ability to help drive increased sales and lower fraud across the ecosystem. Okay. It was a little hard for us to hear you, Harshita, but I think I got the gist of your question around the growth algorithm for consumer payments, especially in mature markets. So as I've said before, we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity around the world. About a quarter of that is in the U.S., by the way. And that's cash, that's check, that's ACH, that's electronic transactions, that's cards that run on domestic networks and the like. And we're capturing that opportunity through a few different ways. One is continuing to expand acceptance and expand the places, where people can use cards. In the U.S., rent would be a great example. We've been having some really good success, penetrating the rent vertical. The second is making it easier to drive e-commerce growth and e-commerce transactions, which has an outsourced impact on our ability to drive growth on Visa, for those types of things. And third is just continuing to innovate with new products and services that, make our issuers want to issue Visa and consumers want to use them. We announced a full slate of new product innovations at our Visa Payments Forum this year. And those are the types of products that, we believe are going to help us win in the marketplace, and help us capture and digitize a big chunk of that opportunity on the Visa network."

Today's conference is being recorded. If you object, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to your host Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed on this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release and related materials available on our IR website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered strong second quarter results with $8.8 billion in net revenue up 10%, GAAP EPS up 12% and non-GAAP EPS up 20%. For our key business drivers, we saw relative stability. Overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year in constant dollars, US payment volume grew 6% year-over-year and international payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume excluding Intra-Europe rose 16% year-over-year and process transactions grew 11%. Visa's business performance demonstrates our strategy at work in consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Furthermore, across all of these growth levers, tremendous opportunity remains. I'll spend a few moments on each growth lever. Let's start with consumer payments. The opportunity in consumer payments is enormous. Based on the latest public data from calendar year 2022 and our analysis, we estimate that the total global purchase personal consumption expenditure or PPCE excluding Russia and China was approximately $40 trillion. Within that $40 trillion, our addressable opportunity is more than $20 trillion. This includes three components. One, cash and check, which is about half of the addressable opportunity. Tap-to-pay is a great example of how we are converting small ticket cash transactions to Visa credentials. Two, ACH and other electronic transactions. We have many examples in this space, including the work we are doing to extend Visa as a bill pay method in acceptance categories like rent, education and loan repayments. And three, cards that run primarily on domestic networks. We have been focused on converting these domestic based cards to Visa credentials in countries around the world and I'll share a good example from Europe in a moment. There is a very long runway ahead and I remain excited about Visa's future growth opportunity in consumer payments. We continue to capture that growth by delivering innovative and secure payment solutions for buyers and sellers, including new credentials and issuance, tap-to-pay and e-commerce. I'll briefly talk about each. First, we're making great progress in expanding the number of Visa credentials. We have added over 100 million credentials from September to December for a year-over-year growth rate of 6%. One area of focus is in Europe. With the UK growing credentials at its fastest rate since 2016, driven in part by strong growth from fintech clients. In addition, from 2018 to 2023, we converted more than 20 million credentials in Europe that primarily ran on domestic networks to Visa debit credentials with millions more in the process of being migrated. This is a great example of the opportunity I mentioned a moment ago. We're particularly excited as we prepare for the Paris Olympics, which are less than 100 days away. We have close to 300 clients across 85 countries globally working with Visa to activate our Olympic sponsorship for marketing campaigns and cardholder engagements such as credential issuance and onsite cardholder events. And in Europe alone, we expect our clients to have issued over 5 million Olympic and Paralympic branded Visa credentials before the start of the games. Also this quarter in Europe, we renewed our relationship with Caixa Geral de Depositos in Portugal across consumer credit, debit and prepaid and commercial credit and debit as well as a suite of value-added services, including risk solutions and analytics. Another area of strength is our co-brand issuance. Visa is the primary network partner for eight of the top 10 co-brand partnerships in the US today and we are pleased that Visa has finalized a multi-year extension of our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio that benefits from a loyal customer base and high cross-border usage. We have also had significant co-brand momentum in CEMEA. First, we launched a new co-brand card in partnership with Qatar Airways, British Airways and the National Bank of Kuwait. Second, we expanded our strong global Marriott relationship to launch Qatar's first hospitality co-branded card with Qatar Islamic Bank. Across the United Arab Emirates, we now have exclusive agreements with all the leading airlines marked by a recent agreement with Emirates Skywards. And we also signed an inaugural Airline co-brand agreement in Morocco with Royal Air Maroc. Now newer digital issuers are equally important to our future growth in consumer payments. And in Saudi Arabia, fintech stc pay, which has over 12 million customers is transitioning from a digital wallet to a full digital bank and expanding its Visa prepay business into Visa debit and credit. Digital Bank Maya in the Philippines has chosen Visa to offer its millions of mobile wallet users and bank depositors access to consumer credit cards with new issuance of affluent products. In the US, we signed a newly expanded credit deal with brokerage platform Robinhood, including the launch of a new Robinhood Gold Card, which offers 3% cashback for all purchases. In Europe, broker and savings platform Trade Republic has launched a new Visa card that combines spending and savings for their 4 million customers across 17 markets. Over 1 million people joined the waitlist for the card in just a few weeks. As I've mentioned in the past, we feel great about our products, our value-added services, our new flows capabilities, our brand, and our people, all coming together to deepen and expand our partnerships with our clients around the world. As we think about Visa's growth, tap-to-pay and e-commerce are key drivers in the digitization of payments. This quarter, tap-to-pay grew five percentage points from last year to 79% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the US. Of note, Japan nearly doubled its penetration since last year to almost 30%. In the US, in the second quarter, we're nearing 50% penetration with New York City at over 75%. The first US city to reach this milestone up from 50% two years ago, demonstrating the impact that transit and our focused issuance and acceptance have on accelerating growth. On the e-commerce front, we continued to see Visa's US e-commerce payments volume grow several points faster year-over-year than face-to-face spend. And the same is true in many key countries around the world, including Canada, Brazil, Australia and India. And this matters to Visa's growth because in the e-commerce space, cash is not usually an option. And although e-commerce payments are a highly competitive environment, we believe our capabilities and our focus on safety, security, reliability, and user experience position us very well. Adding to the potential for growth is tokenization, which brings several benefits to the ecosystem, especially in e-commerce, including reducing fraud, improving authorization rates and therefore making it easier for a customer to purchase a good or service. As of the second quarter, we have over 9.5 billion tokens globally and have surpassed a milestone of 1 billion tokens in Asia-Pacific joining the ranks of the US and Europe. We continue to be focused across all of these efforts in addition to seeking new areas of acceptance and spending. Now moving to new flows. We mentioned last quarter that we see $200 trillion of opportunity excluding Russia and China and we are delivering Visa's commercial and money movement solutions to help digitize these flows. This quarter, new flows revenue growth improved to 14% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis with Visa Direct overall transactions growing 31% for the quarter to $2.3 billion and commercial volumes up 8% year-over-year in constant dollars. Throughout the quarter, we remain focused on our Visa Direct strategy across several areas of growth, including through new use cases, expansion to new geographies and enablers. One recent example is our expanded agreement with Thunes, which increased the number of countries in which Visa Direct can enable push-to-wallet from 78 to 108. In addition, Thunes is implementing Visa Direct's push-to-card capability to enable payouts made to eligible Visa cards and accounts. We have also expanded earned wage access in Canada through an agreement with Payfare and have brought our first Visa Direct cross-border capability into Taiwan with Taishin Bank. On the enabler front, we are pleased that our long-time partner JPMorgan Payments will be seamlessly integrating Visa Direct into their acquiring operations to offer their business clients faster push payments capabilities. In addition, we continued to deepen our relationship with Chase in the small business market with investment and enhancements in products and services. And in accounts receivable and payable, we renewed and expanded our multi-year agreement with Bill on their accounts payable, spend and expense management platforms. We have also reached a global partnership with Taulia, an SAP company and a leading provider of working capital management solutions. The collaboration will incorporate Visa's digital payments technology into Taulia's virtual cards, a solution that integrates with SAP ERP solutions and business applications to make embedded finance accessible for businesses through a seamless and streamlined payments experience for buyers and suppliers. One vertical in new flows that has immense potential is government payments, representing over $15 trillion in annual payments volume opportunity, where we are in a strong position to combine many of our new flows offerings. A recent example is in Kenya, where we signed an agreement with Pesaflow, a technology partner for the government of Kenya to expand card payments on eCitizen, the government's electronic platform with over 12 million users. We achieved this by bringing together Visa Virtual credentials and Visa Direct into the platform. Now let me move on to value-added services, where revenue was up 23% in the second quarter in constant dollars. The growth and opportunity in value-added services continue to be significant and broad-based. In Acceptance Solutions, we signed an agreement with Millicom International Cellular in Latin America for cybersource gateway, decision manager and token management solutions. As it relates to open banking, just about two years ago, we acquired Tink as we saw the opportunity in open banking to enable the movement of data and money and to provide consumers with control over their financial data. Over those two years, we have been expanding our presence in Europe, winning deals with such as Adyen and Revolut. We're now expanding open banking solutions through Tink into the United States having signed several data access agreements, including with Capital One, Fiserv, and Jack Henry, so that their customers may share data with Tink. We've also signed partnerships on the fintech and merchant side including Dwolla and Max Rewards. And across our risk offerings, we continue to bolster them through our technology, innovation and AI expertise and are expanding their utility beyond the Visa network. Recently, we announced three such capabilities in our Visa Protect offering. The first is the expansion of our signature solutions Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager for non-VISA card payments making them network agnostic. This allows issuers to simplify their fraud operations into a single fraud detection solution. The second is the release of Visa Protect for account-to-account payments, our first fraud prevention solution built specifically for real-time payments, including P2P digital wallets, account-to-account transactions and Central Bank's instant payment systems. Powered by AI-based fraud detection models, this new service provides a real-time risk score that can be used to identify fraud on account-to-account payments. We've been piloting both of these in a number of countries and our strong results thus far have informed our decision to roll these out globally. The third solution is Visa Deep Authorization. It is a new transaction risk scoring solution tailored specifically to the US market to better manage e-commerce payments powered by a world-class deep learning recurrent neural network model and petabytes of contextual data. We also continue to make our offerings available through third-party platforms. We mentioned ServiceNow last quarter and we are excited to have recently joined the AWS Partner Network to help seamlessly provide our clients running systems in the cloud access to Visa's solutions, initially starting with Currencycloud, now known as Visa Cross-Border Solutions and Pismo. We also signed an agreement with Stripe for them to distribute Verify solutions through a self-service dispute management platform for their merchants. All of these efforts are part of our strategy to build and offer our solutions for both Visa and our network of networks. Before I hand it to Chris, I wanted to note that we have commenced the exchange offer for Visa's Class B1 common stock that is set to expire at the end of next week. I also wanted to highlight that this quarter, after nearly 20 years of litigation, we have agreed to a landmark settlement with US merchants, more than 90% of which are small businesses, lowering credit interchange rates and capping those rates into 2030 once approved by the court. The injunctive relief class settlement also provides updates to several key network rules, giving merchants more choice in how they accept digital payments. Last, let me share a few closing thoughts on the quarter and beyond. First, our second quarter was marked by stable results and strengthened relationships with clients across the globe. Second, as we head into the back half of our fiscal year and beyond, new flows and value-added services remain key areas of focus. We also see significant opportunity in consumer payments by digitizing cash and check, enhancing our capabilities in e-commerce, and building new solutions for our network of networks. I could not be more excited for what lies ahead. Finally, all of this is possible because of the 30,000 Visa employees who come to work every day in service of our clients and partners, I am grateful for everything that you do, thank you. And now over to Chris.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q2 was a strong quarter with relatively stable growth across payments volume, process transactions, and cross-border volume. Looking at our drivers, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year and process transactions grew 11% year-over-year. Cross-border volume growth excluding Intra-Europe was up 16% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal second quarter net revenue was up 10% in nominal and constant dollars, which was slightly above our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives and better-than-expected value-added services revenue that collectively more than offset lower-than-expected currency volatility. GAAP EPS was up 12% and non-GAAP EPS was up 20% in nominal and 21% in constant dollars. So let's go into the details, starting with total payments volume. Global payments volume growth in Q2 was 8%, consistent with Q1 growth. There are a couple of things I'd like to highlight when comparing Q2 to Q1. First, the extra day for the leap year was a benefit to the quarter. This was offset primarily by slowing payments volume growth in Asia-Pacific mostly due to macroeconomic weakness in Mainland China. When we adjust for Asia and some other smaller factors, we see second quarter global payments volume growth generally in line with the first quarter. Now on to the US. US payments volume grew 6% year-over-year, credit grew 6% and debit grew 6%. Card present spend grew 4% and card not present volume grew 8%. Reg II had a similar modest impact in Q2 as we saw in Q1. When we normalize for leap year, we see relatively stable US payments volume growth. Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments. Moving to international markets, where total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars. Payments volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe, ex-UK, each growing more than 19% in constant dollars. Normalized for leap year and weakness in Mainland China, total international payments volume growth was relatively stable to the first quarter. As a reminder, domestic volumes in Mainland China drive a very small amount of revenue and therefore the impact to our financial statements is not significant. Now to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding Intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volumes were up a healthy 16% in Q2 generally in line with our expectations. Cross-border card not present volume growth, excluding travel and adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases was in the mid-teens, stronger than expected. Cross-border travel volume was up 17% or 152% indexed to 2019. Consistent with our expectations for the year, we continue to see strong travel volume growth in and out of LAC, Europe, and CEMEA and out of the US ranging from 158% to 192% of 2019 levels. The US inbound travel volume has continued to recover within our expectations up several points from Q1 versus 2019 levels. Asia-Pacific travel volume continues to recover, but the pace has been slower than we anticipated. Travel volume into Asia indexed at 142% of 2019 levels for the quarter, up eight points from Q1, while travel volume out of Asia was up two points to 124% of 2019. We see the primary drivers being one, macroeconomic weakness in key markets like Australia and Mainland China two, weakness in some Asia-Pacific currencies, which is impacting consumer purchasing power, particularly for Japan and three, airline capacity that is still below 2019 levels, particularly the Mainland China and North American corridor. Altogether, we're pleased with our total cross-border volume growth with e-commerce growth generally offsetting the travel weakness in Asia and this is a great testament to the strength and diversification of our model. Now let's review our second quarter financial results starting with the revenue components. Both service revenue and data processing revenue grew generally in line with their underlying drivers, which resulted in their respective revenue yields remaining relatively consistent to the first quarter. Service revenue grew 7% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q1 constant dollar payments volume. Data processing revenue grew 12% versus the 11% process transaction growth. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe, impacted by lapping strong currency volatility from last year. As volatility reached lows that we haven't seen in about four years, the revenue growth was lower than we expected. Other revenue grew 37%, primarily driven by strong consulting and marketing services revenue growth and to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 12%, lower than we expected due to client performance and deal timing. Across our three growth engines, consumer payments growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volume. New flows revenue improved as expected to 14% year-over-year growth in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions improved to 31% year-over-year growth helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Commercial volumes rose 8% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Q2, value-added services revenue grew 23% in constant dollars to $2.1 billion, primarily driven by issuing and acceptance solutions and advisory services. GAAP operating expenses increased 29% driven by increases in the litigation provision and G&A expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 11% primarily due to increases in G&A and personnel expenses. FX and Pismo each represented an approximately half point headwind. Excluding net losses from our equity investments of $30 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $189 million. Our GAAP tax rate was 15.4% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 16% due to the resolution of some non-US tax matters. GAAP EPS was $2.29 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.51, up 20% over last year, inclusive of an almost one point drag from exchange rates and an approximately half point drag from Pismo. In Q2, we bought back approximately 2.7 billion in stock and distributed over 1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of March, we had 23.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now, let's move to what we've seen so far in April through the 21st. US payments volume was up 4% with debit up 4% and credit up 5% year-over-year, down from March, primarily due to Easter timing. Process transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe grew 15% year-over-year. Travel-related cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe grew 15% year-over-year in constant dollars or 151% indexed to 2019. And cross-border card not present ex-travel grew 15% in constant dollars. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentations for more detail. Let's start with the full year. We are reaffirming our prior year guidance for the full year for adjusted net revenue and operating expense growth in the low-double-digits and EPS growth in the low-teens. As for drivers, things are progressing generally as we expected, except for the trends in Asia that we discussed. Accordingly, we are making a small adjustment to our outlook for total payments volume growth to the high-single-digits from the low-double-digits. Total cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe is expected to continue to grow strongly in the mid-teens with the strength in e-commerce generally offsetting weakness in Asia travel. Remember that our drivers assume no recession or no further increase in Reg II impacts. Currency volatility remains low and we are assuming volatility in the third quarter continues at a similar rate to the second quarter and adjusts up slightly in the fourth quarter. Now on to the third quarter expectations. We expect adjusted net revenue growth in the low-double-digits, generally in line to the adjusted second quarter growth rate. Adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter are expected to grow in the low-teens, driven primarily by Olympic-related marketing expense due to the strong client engagement that Ryan referenced. Non-operating income is expected to be between $50 million and $60 million and the tax rate is expected to be between 19% and 19.5% in Q3 with the full year unchanged. This puts third-quarter adjusted EPS growth in the high end of low-double-digits. For the third quarter, Pismo is expected to have minimal benefit to net revenue growth and an approximately one point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense and an approximately half point drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. FX for the third quarter is expected to have an approximately one point drag to net revenue growth and approximately one and a half point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and an approximately half point drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. In summary, we had another solid quarter in Q2 with relatively stable underlying drivers and strong financial results. We feel good about the momentum in our business as we head into the second half across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. We remain thoughtful with our spending plans as we continue to balance between short and long-term considerations in the context of a changing environment. So now, Jennifer, let's do some Q&A.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Holly.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first caller is Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Chris, a clarification question. You mentioned Easter was mainly affecting the quarter-to-date trends. Is it fair to assume that the growth rate would be commensurate with the last quarter if you adjust it for that? And then just on a related matter, did the tax refund timings have any impact later in the quarter or in the quarter or into the quarter-to-date trends? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So April volumes, as I said on the call, through the first three weeks were lower than March -- the month of March. This was due to the timing of Easter, which again was in March this year and April of last year. And so once you factor that into March and April growth rates, the change between the months are -- the change in growth rate is not meaningful. As far as tax payments at this point, I don't really have an update. Largely they've been consistent at this point year-to-date.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Our next caller is Timothy Chiodo with UBS. You may go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. There were some helpful comments around the e-commerce strength within cross-border offsetting some of the travel weakness. When we think about the components of overall cross-border, clearly, there's the traditional travel, so card present and card not present. And then there's the traditional e-commerce, right, so retail e-commerce. But there are other faster growing but smaller portions, whether it be the remittances or marketplace payouts or you gave the Thunes example earlier. I was wondering if you could maybe size the, in aggregate, how large some of those other maybe faster growing portions of cross-border have become as a part of the overall mix?\nChris Suh: Yeah, sure. Why don't I start? Yeah, we don't have specifics to break-out. As we talked about, the e-commerce business has been strong. It continues to grow above what we expected. The yields across our entire cross-border business are positive and accretive to Visa overall. And so we're happy with all flavors of cross-border, but I don't have a further breakout for you in terms of the pieces that you were asking about.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Our next caller is Craig Maurer with FT Partners. You may go ahead .\nCraig Maurer: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question on US debit trends. April continued the trend of weakening that we've seen -- that we saw also in March and basically since February. I wanted to know to what degree your guidance for both third quarter and the year embeds continued weakening in US debit. It seems if we look at the restaurant data released by the likes of Darden that the lower-income portion of the US is significantly reducing spend in certain areas. So curious about commentary there. Thanks.\nChris Suh: Yeah. As we talked about on the call, we see quite stable -- relatively stable volumes in the US across credit and debit, normalizing for the things that I talked about. And so in addition, as I talked about Reg II, the impact remains stable as well. And so from our perspective, our data indicates stable volume growth in the US.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Our next caller is Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. You may go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on new flows, so a nice recovery there in growth. Can you give a comment on what areas were most pronounced in the underlying growth recovery relative to what you saw last quarter?\nChris Suh: Yeah. Let me talk about Q2 growth. The two pieces of information that we gave you in terms of Q2 growth. We saw commercial volume growth globally 8%, stable to Q1 and in fact, stable over the last several quarters. And we saw very strong growth in Visa direct transactions, growing 31% for the quarter. New flows revenue in total growing 14%, which was in line with our expectations that we shared with you at the start of the year. I think the recovery that you're referencing to was because Q1 growth was lower and that was really due to some lapping issues that were one-time and non-recurring, which we passed at this point.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Our next caller is Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nWill Nance: Hey, guys. I appreciate you taking the question. A bit of a dual-part question on just some of the prior guidance commentary you made around first-half versus second-half dynamics and some of the drivers of acceleration over the course of the year. And I guess specifically, I guess, incentives, you talked about a step-down in the growth rate from first half to second half. Is that still your expectation despite that coming in a lot lower in the most recent quarter? And then for the similar question on the volume growth trends, I guess, I hear you on the Asia trends, but I guess overall, you had some kind of upbeat commentary on ticket sizes over the course of the year and kind of easing inflation in comps, it seems like gas prices might help that as well. So just any commentary on ticket sizes and specifically the negative ticket sizes you've seen in the US? Any commentary on kind of what's structural versus kind of more environmental there? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Yeah. Okay. Let me start first with incentives, the first part of your question. So, as you all have seen from quarter-to-quarter, incentive growth can vary based on a number of factors, client performance, deal timing, which is what caused half one to come in lower than anticipated. For our outlook for the second half of the year, our expectations remain largely unchanged. We still expect year-over-year growth to be lower in the second half than in the first half as we lap the higher incentives that we saw starting in the second half of last year. And we do expect the Q4 incentive growth rate will be the lowest growth quarter of the year. So expectations for half two are unchanged. To your second question on ATS, let me -- there's a lot of moving parts in here. And so maybe I'm just going to kind of go through it in detail and unpack bit by bit. Globally, Q2 ATS year-over-year growth was down slightly, which is consistent with the growth that we saw in Q1. Breaking that apart between the US and international. In the US, ticket size growth actually continued to improve from Q1 to Q2, still slightly negative, but the trend improved from Q1 to Q2. And looking ahead in the US, this is something that we've spoken to previously, we do continue to expect ATS will turn positive in the second half of this year as we lap the lower ticket sizes in the second half of last year. Internationally, outside of Asia-Pacific, let's set that aside for a second, we saw improvement in several regions, including the impact from higher inflation in several markets. And so overall, excluding Asia, we still expect ATS to turn positive in the second half based on the expected improvements in the US with the impact of Asia factored in, global ATS will be slightly negative and that was factored into the revised payment volume outlook that I gave for the full year.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Our next caller is Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. You may go ahead.\nMoshe Katri: Hey, thanks for taking my question. It seems that there was a pretty significant uptick sequentially in growth for value-added services. Is there anything to call out there? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: I mean, I'll talk about the business just for a minute, Moshe. Thanks for the question and then, Chris, you can add any specific callouts. As I think I said in my prepared remarks, the business is really hitting its strides in a lot of different areas in terms of the product we're bringing to market, the success our sales teams are having around the world, we're really focused on three big areas of trying to drive growth. One is just deepening the penetration of products we have with existing clients. That's -- if you think about it is the most near-term opportunity that we have and we've got metrics, client-by-client all around the world, what are they using, what are they not using. We're arming our sales teams with that. We're building case studies on how we can help them and we're driving progress in terms of deepening the relationship we have with our existing clients. And then we're building new products that we're bringing to market. I mentioned a few of those in my prepared remarks today, both in the risk and fraud space as well as in the open banking space and then driving geographic expansion. I mentioned I think just one cybersource deal in my prepared remarks, but cybersource has been a great example of a platform where we've been having success growing in markets where we hadn't traditionally been as deep. AP is actually a positive example of that in the cybersource space. So those are a couple of call-outs, Moshe, in terms of kind of how we're just seeing the broader business.\nJennifer Como: Next question.\nOperator: Our next caller is Cris Kennedy with William Blair. You may go ahead.\nCristopher Kennedy: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about bringing Tink into the US. Can you talk about the open banking opportunity in the US relative to Europe? Thank you.\nChris Suh: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. I think Europe is the most developed open banking market in the world. We bought Tink two years ago believing that it was the best platform in Europe and I think that's proven true over the couple of years that we've had a chance to own it. On the client side, in Europe, we've been making great progress. I think I mentioned a couple in my prepared remarks, we've been -- we've been winning business and winning share with both fintechs as well as more traditional banks, merchants, and others, both in the payment side of things and in the account information side of things. I would describe the US market as less developed as Europe. And so I think it's an opportunity for us to take the learnings that we've had in the much more developed Europe market as well as the success we've had with our clients, the products, the services, the wins and the losses and bring all of that to the US market. So we're excited to do that. And as I mentioned, I think the US market is still at the very early stages of its development. So I think it's a good time for us to be a competitor in the market. And we're hopeful that over the coming quarters and years, we'll have a chance to share with you a lot of the success that we have in the US market.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next caller is Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nDaniel Perlin: Thanks. Ryan, I just wanted to ask a question on the Visa Deep Authorization commentary and kind of that market there. I just want to make sure I understand, are you -- are you doing this as a means with which to like equalize kind of e-commerce across the market for authorization rates, so that like acquirers need to be partnered with you more specifically and therefore, they're not competing maybe shows individually on kind of author rates within e-commerce or is there something different within this platform? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Hey, Dan. Let me backup. I think this is a little different than what you were describing. What we found in the US e-commerce market is that it's the most -- on the one hand, it's the most developed e-commerce market on the planet. On the other hand, it's become the place of the most sophisticated fraud and attack vectors that we see anywhere in the world. And so what we were bringing -- we are bringing to market with Visa Deep Authorization is an e-commerce transaction risk scoring platform and capability that is specifically tailored and built for the unique sets of attack vectors that we're seeing in the US. So it's -- as I was mentioning in my prepared remarks, it's built on deep learning technology that's specifically tuned to some of the sequential and contextual view of accounts that we've had in the US market. And the whole goal is what we do with a lot of our fraud and authorization products. We want to -- we want to make it a better buyer and seller experience. We want to reduce fraud rates, increase authorization rates, increase shopping conversion for our merchant partners. And we think Visa Deep Authorization is going to be yet another tool that will help do that.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next caller is Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks so much. It sounded like the Middle East deal activity is in a good place here. I believe Emirates is a takeaway for you. I'm just curious if there's something new going on there from a pipeline perspective. It sounds like maybe some investing. Is this the growth market we should be paying more attention to maybe? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. I think what you're seeing is good execution from our sales team, doing what we do when we do it best, which is in with our clients, listening, learning, obsessing about what's important to them and then bringing them products and value propositions that are helping meet their needs and drive their strategies and really just kudos to our team on the ground there and the great work that they're doing.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next caller is Trevor Williams with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nTrevor Williams: Great. Thanks a lot. This one is for Ryan. Just wanted to go back to the merchant settlement in the US, clearly you guys aren't directly impacted by lower interchange, but I'm just curious kind of what you're expecting the downstream impact to be on Visa, the relationships between you and your issuing banks. And if you think it in any way kind of changes the competitive dynamics at all within the US credit market? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Thanks, Trevor. I think the good news on this front is it brings clarity and stability to the market. This is litigation that's been out there for the better part of 20 years or so. I think there's been a lot of great work that's been done to bring this to a resolution. Just to remind everyone what the main planks of the resolution are. It really is two different sets of things. One is it will reduce interchange for US -- for credit cards in the US market for both Visa and Mastercard and it will have no increases in interchange for the five years of the agreement. And then the second set of things are tools that give merchants more flexibility to how they manage payments significant -- specifically as it relates to surcharging and things like that. I think, overall, it's what I said, Trevor, which is clarity and stability that lets everybody who operates in the US market move on and move on continuing to grow the digitization of this great payments ecosystem that we've all collectively built in the United States.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. You may go ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon. So, Ryan, I want to follow up on value-added services, such an important part of your growth story. I know you've talked about the five types of services you offer and how your top 250 clients use almost 2x the number of services versus the rest of your client base. Can you give us some sense on how these penetration numbers have evolved over time? And finally as you kind of think about pricing for these services, to what extent it's a bundle pricing along with core versus kind of a separately priced service? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Okay. You have a great memory. As we've said, our top 265 clients or so use on average about 22 of our value-added services. We don't talk about like how that's moved quarter-to-quarter, but the opportunity is enormous just when you think about the number of clients we have around the planet. And so as I was mentioning earlier kind of what we've done is we've armed our frontline teams with kind of client-by-client, what are they using, what are they not using, what are the opportunities to create value for the client by putting value-added services A, B, C or D to work for them and we're having great success and you see that in the numbers. In terms of the pricing, it's -- it's different pricing models for different products and different suites of solutions in different places around the world. We're always trying to come up with the right product pricing mix that's going to work best for our products in the market. And we have a portfolio of value-added services that span from issuing to acceptance to risk and identity to advisory into open banking and the competitive sets are deep and different in all of those markets. So we're bringing different pricing approaches to each and every market around the world to help meet the best that we can for our clients.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next caller is Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. You may go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about one of the consumer payment opportunities that Ryan called out, namely taking share from domestic card networks. How do you drive that? Is it just a question of getting banks to issue more of your cards or is it more on the acceptance or consumer side? What are the levers that you have to basically speed that up?\nChris Suh: Yeah. Thanks for the question. On the -- it's really the first of the things that you mentioned. Now, of course, we need to have great acceptance. We need to have great capabilities and all those types of things, which we do in every market we operate around the planet. So then it becomes sitting down with clients, helping them understand the value of, for example, a Visa debit card versus a card that runs primarily on domestic schemes. And then you get into e-commerce capabilities that Visa Debit is able to provide their clients that maybe they don't get the same type of capabilities from the domestic scheme. You get to cross-border travel opportunities that their customers would have if they were using a Visa card versus one of those domestic schemes that I mentioned. You also get into the risk and fraud prevention capabilities that I mentioned earlier and the ability to have more transactions approved and lower fraud rates, tokenization, I mean, all these kind of benefits, you've heard us talk about over and over again, those are what our teams can sit down with the clients and explain to them. Often the clients will do some pilots and some tests, they'll see the results, they'll see higher spend, they'll see higher client satisfaction. And then ultimately the decision to issue Visa cards to their clients becomes a very clear decision for them.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next caller is Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. You may go ahead.\nJames Friedman: Hi. I was wondering if you could share some color on how Prosa is doing so far and how you view the opportunity in Mexico as you start to press and productize into the Mexican market. Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Yeah. Thanks, Jamie. We view the Mexican opportunity as a very significant one. And coincidentally, I was just down there a couple of weeks ago meeting with clients and meeting with the Prosa team as well. So as I think I explained on one of these calls, today, because we don't process transactions domestically in Mexico, we're not able to deliver a lot of the value-added services that I've mentioned over the course of this call to our clients. And so first and foremost, our clients are very excited about us having the opportunity to have a majority ownership stake in Prosa and then bring these world class capabilities that we've built to the Mexican market, the things I mentioned earlier, tokenization or the risk scoring algorithms that I mentioned or the e-commerce capabilities that I mentioned those types of things. Now Prosa itself is a great asset. It's been operating for 50 years in Mexico has deep processing experience, it has scale. They do more than 10 billion transactions annually. They have a great base of clients. So it's really the combination of both Prosa's experience and deep footprint in the Mexican market combined with our experience, our technology, our track record in bringing a lot of these services to market, the combination of those two things gives us a lot of confidence and our clients a lot of confidence that we can digitize the significant amount of cash and check and electronic payments that exist today in Mexico.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Schmidt with Citi. You may go ahead.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hey, Ryan. Hey, Chris. Thanks for having me on the call here. I wanted to go back to cross-border for a second. Obviously, a part of the back-half growth is the narrowing of the spread between cross-border revs and volumes. Maybe if you could talk a little about how, whether those assumptions have changed at all with FX volumes coming down or if there's other puts and takes we should consider there? Thanks a lot.\nChris Suh: Yeah, sure. Yeah, I spoke at length about volatility. So we had -- in Q2 we saw volatility -- currency volatility at multiyear lows. This one is hard to predict. In Q3, our assumption, what's embedded in the guidance for Q3 is that the currency volatility levels remain at this low level. We do have, again, embedded in our forecast. We do anticipate that Q4 improves slightly. That's generally in line with market expectations. But, yeah, that is our view of currency volatility. That said, the underlying health of our business as we enter the second half of the year, we feel really good about across consumer payments, across new flows, across value-added services. And so volatility is sort of the variable and we'll have to see how it comes in.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you, guys. Can you talk about your second half expectations for new flows and VAS revenue growth as well as cross-border travel volume growth? Thanks.\nChris Suh: Sure. Let me unpack that a little bit. From a -- as you heard us, we reaffirmed our prior year guide for the full year, adjusted net revenue growth, OpEx, EPS. And within that, I spoke about the fact that volatility is going to cause our currency volatility -- treasury revenues in international to be lower than we anticipated in Q3. But again full year unchanged within that. Our expectations for new flows in that are consistent with the ones that we shared at the beginning of the year, which we anticipated. For the full year, new flows will grow faster than consumer payments with weighted toward faster growth in the second half of the year. We're seeing that with the 14% growth in Q2. We anticipate continuing to see a good growth in the second half of the year. Value-added services has grown over 20% in each of the first two quarters. The momentum there is pretty evident. The second part of your question was, I think, around cross-border travel of volumes in total. So we did make a little bit of adjustment. You heard me talk about based on half-one trends. And so again, this is one with a couple of parts, so let's just go through it in detail. First of all, we feel really good, feel great about our first-half total cross-border performance, 16% growth in Q2, in line with our expectations, and within that, travel was 17% and e-commerce growth mid-teens better than expected. And so that unpacking travel a bit, we've seen most of our travel volume expectations play out actually as we planned at the beginning of the year, which continues to be strong and healthy in most regions LAC, Europe, CEMEA and all the ones that I talked about on the call, with Asia being the exception to that, which again continues to improve with the pace of recovery being slower than expected, offset again by strength in the e-commerce cross-border business, which is performing better than we expected.So we expect these trends to continue into the second half and thus, we've moderated our outlook for travel due to AP and upped our expectations on e-commerce. So putting that all together, overall, our view is that total cross-border volumes remain strong, growing in the mid-teens in the second half, which is frankly the better measure in relation to our financial performance given the strong yields across both travel and e-commerce.\nJennifer Como: Next question, please.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. You may go ahead.\nKenneth Suchoski: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of my questions have been asked. I just want to ask about the service yields, though, because they came in a little bit lighter than we were expecting. So can you just talk about what drove that? It looks like the service yield declined year-over-year, but maybe there's some offset with client incentives also coming a little bit lower in the quarter. So any detail there would be helpful. Any thoughts on how to think about the year-over-year change in that yield going forward? Thanks.\nChris Suh: As we talked about both service revenue and data processing revenue grew generally in line with the underlying drivers, service revenue at 7% versus the 8% in constant dollar PV, Q1 constant dollar PV that's impacted by a number of smaller things, none of which I would call out as a single thing. Data processing revenue grew a little bit above processed transactions, 1.12 versus 11 and that was helped aided a little bit by pricing. From a yield perspective, I think the thing that's important is that our second quarter yields remained consistent with Q1 and consistent with the average over the last several quarters. And so we're seeing very stable yields across the business and we're pleased to see that. And even more broadly, our net revenue yield across the whole company remained quite stable.\nJennifer Como: Great. And last question please, Holly.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital. You may go ahead.\nPaul Golding: Thanks so much. Ryan, you were talking about the addressable opportunity of $20 trillion of which cash and check was half. I was wondering if you can give any thought to quantifying the ACH versus the domestic network conversion and where you think you are in that opportunity capture for each of those. Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yeah, thanks. We're having great success in all three. I gave you examples. Some of our teams are ahead of others in different parts of the world and domestic schemes are more prevalent in some parts of the world than others like I mentioned Europe as an example. But the opportunity is enormous in all three of these areas and we've been having really good success in all three of the areas.\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our Investor Relations team. Thanks again and have a great day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Suh",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q2 was a strong quarter with relatively stable growth across payments volume, process transactions, and cross-border volume. Looking at our drivers, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year and process transactions grew 11% year-over-year. Cross-border volume growth excluding Intra-Europe was up 16% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal second quarter net revenue was up 10% in nominal and constant dollars, which was slightly above our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives and better-than-expected value-added services revenue that collectively more than offset lower-than-expected currency volatility. GAAP EPS was up 12% and non-GAAP EPS was up 20% in nominal and 21% in constant dollars. So let's go into the details, starting with total payments volume. Global payments volume growth in Q2 was 8%, consistent with Q1 growth. There are a couple of things I'd like to highlight when comparing Q2 to Q1. First, the extra day for the leap year was a benefit to the quarter. This was offset primarily by slowing payments volume growth in Asia-Pacific mostly due to macroeconomic weakness in Mainland China. When we adjust for Asia and some other smaller factors, we see second quarter global payments volume growth generally in line with the first quarter. Now on to the US. US payments volume grew 6% year-over-year, credit grew 6% and debit grew 6%. Card present spend grew 4% and card not present volume grew 8%. Reg II had a similar modest impact in Q2 as we saw in Q1. When we normalize for leap year, we see relatively stable US payments volume growth. Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments. Moving to international markets, where total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars. Payments volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe, ex-UK, each growing more than 19% in constant dollars. Normalized for leap year and weakness in Mainland China, total international payments volume growth was relatively stable to the first quarter. As a reminder, domestic volumes in Mainland China drive a very small amount of revenue and therefore the impact to our financial statements is not significant. Now to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding Intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volumes were up a healthy 16% in Q2 generally in line with our expectations. Cross-border card not present volume growth, excluding travel and adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases was in the mid-teens, stronger than expected. Cross-border travel volume was up 17% or 152% indexed to 2019. Consistent with our expectations for the year, we continue to see strong travel volume growth in and out of LAC, Europe, and CEMEA and out of the US ranging from 158% to 192% of 2019 levels. The US inbound travel volume has continued to recover within our expectations up several points from Q1 versus 2019 levels. Asia-Pacific travel volume continues to recover, but the pace has been slower than we anticipated. Travel volume into Asia indexed at 142% of 2019 levels for the quarter, up eight points from Q1, while travel volume out of Asia was up two points to 124% of 2019. We see the primary drivers being one, macroeconomic weakness in key markets like Australia and Mainland China two, weakness in some Asia-Pacific currencies, which is impacting consumer purchasing power, particularly for Japan and three, airline capacity that is still below 2019 levels, particularly the Mainland China and North American corridor. Altogether, we're pleased with our total cross-border volume growth with e-commerce growth generally offsetting the travel weakness in Asia and this is a great testament to the strength and diversification of our model. Now let's review our second quarter financial results starting with the revenue components. Both service revenue and data processing revenue grew generally in line with their underlying drivers, which resulted in their respective revenue yields remaining relatively consistent to the first quarter. Service revenue grew 7% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q1 constant dollar payments volume. Data processing revenue grew 12% versus the 11% process transaction growth. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe, impacted by lapping strong currency volatility from last year. As volatility reached lows that we haven't seen in about four years, the revenue growth was lower than we expected. Other revenue grew 37%, primarily driven by strong consulting and marketing services revenue growth and to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 12%, lower than we expected due to client performance and deal timing. Across our three growth engines, consumer payments growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volume. New flows revenue improved as expected to 14% year-over-year growth in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions improved to 31% year-over-year growth helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Commercial volumes rose 8% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Q2, value-added services revenue grew 23% in constant dollars to $2.1 billion, primarily driven by issuing and acceptance solutions and advisory services. GAAP operating expenses increased 29% driven by increases in the litigation provision and G&A expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 11% primarily due to increases in G&A and personnel expenses. FX and Pismo each represented an approximately half point headwind. Excluding net losses from our equity investments of $30 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $189 million. Our GAAP tax rate was 15.4% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 16% due to the resolution of some non-US tax matters. GAAP EPS was $2.29 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.51, up 20% over last year, inclusive of an almost one point drag from exchange rates and an approximately half point drag from Pismo. In Q2, we bought back approximately 2.7 billion in stock and distributed over 1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of March, we had 23.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now, let's move to what we've seen so far in April through the 21st. US payments volume was up 4% with debit up 4% and credit up 5% year-over-year, down from March, primarily due to Easter timing. Process transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe grew 15% year-over-year. Travel-related cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe grew 15% year-over-year in constant dollars or 151% indexed to 2019. And cross-border card not present ex-travel grew 15% in constant dollars. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentations for more detail. Let's start with the full year. We are reaffirming our prior year guidance for the full year for adjusted net revenue and operating expense growth in the low-double-digits and EPS growth in the low-teens. As for drivers, things are progressing generally as we expected, except for the trends in Asia that we discussed. Accordingly, we are making a small adjustment to our outlook for total payments volume growth to the high-single-digits from the low-double-digits. Total cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe is expected to continue to grow strongly in the mid-teens with the strength in e-commerce generally offsetting weakness in Asia travel. Remember that our drivers assume no recession or no further increase in Reg II impacts. Currency volatility remains low and we are assuming volatility in the third quarter continues at a similar rate to the second quarter and adjusts up slightly in the fourth quarter. Now on to the third quarter expectations. We expect adjusted net revenue growth in the low-double-digits, generally in line to the adjusted second quarter growth rate. Adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter are expected to grow in the low-teens, driven primarily by Olympic-related marketing expense due to the strong client engagement that Ryan referenced. Non-operating income is expected to be between $50 million and $60 million and the tax rate is expected to be between 19% and 19.5% in Q3 with the full year unchanged. This puts third-quarter adjusted EPS growth in the high end of low-double-digits. For the third quarter, Pismo is expected to have minimal benefit to net revenue growth and an approximately one point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense and an approximately half point drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. FX for the third quarter is expected to have an approximately one point drag to net revenue growth and approximately one and a half point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and an approximately half point drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. In summary, we had another solid quarter in Q2 with relatively stable underlying drivers and strong financial results. We feel good about the momentum in our business as we head into the second half across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. We remain thoughtful with our spending plans as we continue to balance between short and long-term considerations in the context of a changing environment. So now, Jennifer, let's do some Q&A. Yeah. Thanks for the question. So April volumes, as I said on the call, through the first three weeks were lower than March -- the month of March. This was due to the timing of Easter, which again was in March this year and April of last year. And so once you factor that into March and April growth rates, the change between the months are -- the change in growth rate is not meaningful. As far as tax payments at this point, I don't really have an update. Largely they've been consistent at this point year-to-date. Yeah, sure. Why don't I start? Yeah, we don't have specifics to break-out. As we talked about, the e-commerce business has been strong. It continues to grow above what we expected. The yields across our entire cross-border business are positive and accretive to Visa overall. And so we're happy with all flavors of cross-border, but I don't have a further breakout for you in terms of the pieces that you were asking about. Yeah. As we talked about on the call, we see quite stable -- relatively stable volumes in the US across credit and debit, normalizing for the things that I talked about. And so in addition, as I talked about Reg II, the impact remains stable as well. And so from our perspective, our data indicates stable volume growth in the US. Yeah. Let me talk about Q2 growth. The two pieces of information that we gave you in terms of Q2 growth. We saw commercial volume growth globally 8%, stable to Q1 and in fact, stable over the last several quarters. And we saw very strong growth in Visa direct transactions, growing 31% for the quarter. New flows revenue in total growing 14%, which was in line with our expectations that we shared with you at the start of the year. I think the recovery that you're referencing to was because Q1 growth was lower and that was really due to some lapping issues that were one-time and non-recurring, which we passed at this point. Yeah. Okay. Let me start first with incentives, the first part of your question. So, as you all have seen from quarter-to-quarter, incentive growth can vary based on a number of factors, client performance, deal timing, which is what caused half one to come in lower than anticipated. For our outlook for the second half of the year, our expectations remain largely unchanged. We still expect year-over-year growth to be lower in the second half than in the first half as we lap the higher incentives that we saw starting in the second half of last year. And we do expect the Q4 incentive growth rate will be the lowest growth quarter of the year. So expectations for half two are unchanged. To your second question on ATS, let me -- there's a lot of moving parts in here. And so maybe I'm just going to kind of go through it in detail and unpack bit by bit. Globally, Q2 ATS year-over-year growth was down slightly, which is consistent with the growth that we saw in Q1. Breaking that apart between the US and international. In the US, ticket size growth actually continued to improve from Q1 to Q2, still slightly negative, but the trend improved from Q1 to Q2. And looking ahead in the US, this is something that we've spoken to previously, we do continue to expect ATS will turn positive in the second half of this year as we lap the lower ticket sizes in the second half of last year. Internationally, outside of Asia-Pacific, let's set that aside for a second, we saw improvement in several regions, including the impact from higher inflation in several markets. And so overall, excluding Asia, we still expect ATS to turn positive in the second half based on the expected improvements in the US with the impact of Asia factored in, global ATS will be slightly negative and that was factored into the revised payment volume outlook that I gave for the full year. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. I think Europe is the most developed open banking market in the world. We bought Tink two years ago believing that it was the best platform in Europe and I think that's proven true over the couple of years that we've had a chance to own it. On the client side, in Europe, we've been making great progress. I think I mentioned a couple in my prepared remarks, we've been -- we've been winning business and winning share with both fintechs as well as more traditional banks, merchants, and others, both in the payment side of things and in the account information side of things. I would describe the US market as less developed as Europe. And so I think it's an opportunity for us to take the learnings that we've had in the much more developed Europe market as well as the success we've had with our clients, the products, the services, the wins and the losses and bring all of that to the US market. So we're excited to do that. And as I mentioned, I think the US market is still at the very early stages of its development. So I think it's a good time for us to be a competitor in the market. And we're hopeful that over the coming quarters and years, we'll have a chance to share with you a lot of the success that we have in the US market. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. I think what you're seeing is good execution from our sales team, doing what we do when we do it best, which is in with our clients, listening, learning, obsessing about what's important to them and then bringing them products and value propositions that are helping meet their needs and drive their strategies and really just kudos to our team on the ground there and the great work that they're doing. Yeah. Thanks for the question. On the -- it's really the first of the things that you mentioned. Now, of course, we need to have great acceptance. We need to have great capabilities and all those types of things, which we do in every market we operate around the planet. So then it becomes sitting down with clients, helping them understand the value of, for example, a Visa debit card versus a card that runs primarily on domestic schemes. And then you get into e-commerce capabilities that Visa Debit is able to provide their clients that maybe they don't get the same type of capabilities from the domestic scheme. You get to cross-border travel opportunities that their customers would have if they were using a Visa card versus one of those domestic schemes that I mentioned. You also get into the risk and fraud prevention capabilities that I mentioned earlier and the ability to have more transactions approved and lower fraud rates, tokenization, I mean, all these kind of benefits, you've heard us talk about over and over again, those are what our teams can sit down with the clients and explain to them. Often the clients will do some pilots and some tests, they'll see the results, they'll see higher spend, they'll see higher client satisfaction. And then ultimately the decision to issue Visa cards to their clients becomes a very clear decision for them. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I spoke at length about volatility. So we had -- in Q2 we saw volatility -- currency volatility at multiyear lows. This one is hard to predict. In Q3, our assumption, what's embedded in the guidance for Q3 is that the currency volatility levels remain at this low level. We do have, again, embedded in our forecast. We do anticipate that Q4 improves slightly. That's generally in line with market expectations. But, yeah, that is our view of currency volatility. That said, the underlying health of our business as we enter the second half of the year, we feel really good about across consumer payments, across new flows, across value-added services. And so volatility is sort of the variable and we'll have to see how it comes in. Sure. Let me unpack that a little bit. From a -- as you heard us, we reaffirmed our prior year guide for the full year, adjusted net revenue growth, OpEx, EPS. And within that, I spoke about the fact that volatility is going to cause our currency volatility -- treasury revenues in international to be lower than we anticipated in Q3. But again full year unchanged within that. Our expectations for new flows in that are consistent with the ones that we shared at the beginning of the year, which we anticipated. For the full year, new flows will grow faster than consumer payments with weighted toward faster growth in the second half of the year. We're seeing that with the 14% growth in Q2. We anticipate continuing to see a good growth in the second half of the year. Value-added services has grown over 20% in each of the first two quarters. The momentum there is pretty evident. The second part of your question was, I think, around cross-border travel of volumes in total. So we did make a little bit of adjustment. You heard me talk about based on half-one trends. And so again, this is one with a couple of parts, so let's just go through it in detail. First of all, we feel really good, feel great about our first-half total cross-border performance, 16% growth in Q2, in line with our expectations, and within that, travel was 17% and e-commerce growth mid-teens better than expected. And so that unpacking travel a bit, we've seen most of our travel volume expectations play out actually as we planned at the beginning of the year, which continues to be strong and healthy in most regions LAC, Europe, CEMEA and all the ones that I talked about on the call, with Asia being the exception to that, which again continues to improve with the pace of recovery being slower than expected, offset again by strength in the e-commerce cross-border business, which is performing better than we expected.So we expect these trends to continue into the second half and thus, we've moderated our outlook for travel due to AP and upped our expectations on e-commerce. So putting that all together, overall, our view is that total cross-border volumes remain strong, growing in the mid-teens in the second half, which is frankly the better measure in relation to our financial performance given the strong yields across both travel and e-commerce. As we talked about both service revenue and data processing revenue grew generally in line with the underlying drivers, service revenue at 7% versus the 8% in constant dollar PV, Q1 constant dollar PV that's impacted by a number of smaller things, none of which I would call out as a single thing. Data processing revenue grew a little bit above processed transactions, 1.12 versus 11 and that was helped aided a little bit by pricing. From a yield perspective, I think the thing that's important is that our second quarter yields remained consistent with Q1 and consistent with the average over the last several quarters. And so we're seeing very stable yields across the business and we're pleased to see that. And even more broadly, our net revenue yield across the whole company remained quite stable."

            "name": "Ryan McInerney",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered strong second quarter results with $8.8 billion in net revenue up 10%, GAAP EPS up 12% and non-GAAP EPS up 20%. For our key business drivers, we saw relative stability. Overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year in constant dollars, US payment volume grew 6% year-over-year and international payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume excluding Intra-Europe rose 16% year-over-year and process transactions grew 11%. Visa's business performance demonstrates our strategy at work in consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Furthermore, across all of these growth levers, tremendous opportunity remains. I'll spend a few moments on each growth lever. Let's start with consumer payments. The opportunity in consumer payments is enormous. Based on the latest public data from calendar year 2022 and our analysis, we estimate that the total global purchase personal consumption expenditure or PPCE excluding Russia and China was approximately $40 trillion. Within that $40 trillion, our addressable opportunity is more than $20 trillion. This includes three components. One, cash and check, which is about half of the addressable opportunity. Tap-to-pay is a great example of how we are converting small ticket cash transactions to Visa credentials. Two, ACH and other electronic transactions. We have many examples in this space, including the work we are doing to extend Visa as a bill pay method in acceptance categories like rent, education and loan repayments. And three, cards that run primarily on domestic networks. We have been focused on converting these domestic based cards to Visa credentials in countries around the world and I'll share a good example from Europe in a moment. There is a very long runway ahead and I remain excited about Visa's future growth opportunity in consumer payments. We continue to capture that growth by delivering innovative and secure payment solutions for buyers and sellers, including new credentials and issuance, tap-to-pay and e-commerce. I'll briefly talk about each. First, we're making great progress in expanding the number of Visa credentials. We have added over 100 million credentials from September to December for a year-over-year growth rate of 6%. One area of focus is in Europe. With the UK growing credentials at its fastest rate since 2016, driven in part by strong growth from fintech clients. In addition, from 2018 to 2023, we converted more than 20 million credentials in Europe that primarily ran on domestic networks to Visa debit credentials with millions more in the process of being migrated. This is a great example of the opportunity I mentioned a moment ago. We're particularly excited as we prepare for the Paris Olympics, which are less than 100 days away. We have close to 300 clients across 85 countries globally working with Visa to activate our Olympic sponsorship for marketing campaigns and cardholder engagements such as credential issuance and onsite cardholder events. And in Europe alone, we expect our clients to have issued over 5 million Olympic and Paralympic branded Visa credentials before the start of the games. Also this quarter in Europe, we renewed our relationship with Caixa Geral de Depositos in Portugal across consumer credit, debit and prepaid and commercial credit and debit as well as a suite of value-added services, including risk solutions and analytics. Another area of strength is our co-brand issuance. Visa is the primary network partner for eight of the top 10 co-brand partnerships in the US today and we are pleased that Visa has finalized a multi-year extension of our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio that benefits from a loyal customer base and high cross-border usage. We have also had significant co-brand momentum in CEMEA. First, we launched a new co-brand card in partnership with Qatar Airways, British Airways and the National Bank of Kuwait. Second, we expanded our strong global Marriott relationship to launch Qatar's first hospitality co-branded card with Qatar Islamic Bank. Across the United Arab Emirates, we now have exclusive agreements with all the leading airlines marked by a recent agreement with Emirates Skywards. And we also signed an inaugural Airline co-brand agreement in Morocco with Royal Air Maroc. Now newer digital issuers are equally important to our future growth in consumer payments. And in Saudi Arabia, fintech stc pay, which has over 12 million customers is transitioning from a digital wallet to a full digital bank and expanding its Visa prepay business into Visa debit and credit. Digital Bank Maya in the Philippines has chosen Visa to offer its millions of mobile wallet users and bank depositors access to consumer credit cards with new issuance of affluent products. In the US, we signed a newly expanded credit deal with brokerage platform Robinhood, including the launch of a new Robinhood Gold Card, which offers 3% cashback for all purchases. In Europe, broker and savings platform Trade Republic has launched a new Visa card that combines spending and savings for their 4 million customers across 17 markets. Over 1 million people joined the waitlist for the card in just a few weeks. As I've mentioned in the past, we feel great about our products, our value-added services, our new flows capabilities, our brand, and our people, all coming together to deepen and expand our partnerships with our clients around the world. As we think about Visa's growth, tap-to-pay and e-commerce are key drivers in the digitization of payments. This quarter, tap-to-pay grew five percentage points from last year to 79% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the US. Of note, Japan nearly doubled its penetration since last year to almost 30%. In the US, in the second quarter, we're nearing 50% penetration with New York City at over 75%. The first US city to reach this milestone up from 50% two years ago, demonstrating the impact that transit and our focused issuance and acceptance have on accelerating growth. On the e-commerce front, we continued to see Visa's US e-commerce payments volume grow several points faster year-over-year than face-to-face spend. And the same is true in many key countries around the world, including Canada, Brazil, Australia and India. And this matters to Visa's growth because in the e-commerce space, cash is not usually an option. And although e-commerce payments are a highly competitive environment, we believe our capabilities and our focus on safety, security, reliability, and user experience position us very well. Adding to the potential for growth is tokenization, which brings several benefits to the ecosystem, especially in e-commerce, including reducing fraud, improving authorization rates and therefore making it easier for a customer to purchase a good or service. As of the second quarter, we have over 9.5 billion tokens globally and have surpassed a milestone of 1 billion tokens in Asia-Pacific joining the ranks of the US and Europe. We continue to be focused across all of these efforts in addition to seeking new areas of acceptance and spending. Now moving to new flows. We mentioned last quarter that we see $200 trillion of opportunity excluding Russia and China and we are delivering Visa's commercial and money movement solutions to help digitize these flows. This quarter, new flows revenue growth improved to 14% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis with Visa Direct overall transactions growing 31% for the quarter to $2.3 billion and commercial volumes up 8% year-over-year in constant dollars. Throughout the quarter, we remain focused on our Visa Direct strategy across several areas of growth, including through new use cases, expansion to new geographies and enablers. One recent example is our expanded agreement with Thunes, which increased the number of countries in which Visa Direct can enable push-to-wallet from 78 to 108. In addition, Thunes is implementing Visa Direct's push-to-card capability to enable payouts made to eligible Visa cards and accounts. We have also expanded earned wage access in Canada through an agreement with Payfare and have brought our first Visa Direct cross-border capability into Taiwan with Taishin Bank. On the enabler front, we are pleased that our long-time partner JPMorgan Payments will be seamlessly integrating Visa Direct into their acquiring operations to offer their business clients faster push payments capabilities. In addition, we continued to deepen our relationship with Chase in the small business market with investment and enhancements in products and services. And in accounts receivable and payable, we renewed and expanded our multi-year agreement with Bill on their accounts payable, spend and expense management platforms. We have also reached a global partnership with Taulia, an SAP company and a leading provider of working capital management solutions. The collaboration will incorporate Visa's digital payments technology into Taulia's virtual cards, a solution that integrates with SAP ERP solutions and business applications to make embedded finance accessible for businesses through a seamless and streamlined payments experience for buyers and suppliers. One vertical in new flows that has immense potential is government payments, representing over $15 trillion in annual payments volume opportunity, where we are in a strong position to combine many of our new flows offerings. A recent example is in Kenya, where we signed an agreement with Pesaflow, a technology partner for the government of Kenya to expand card payments on eCitizen, the government's electronic platform with over 12 million users. We achieved this by bringing together Visa Virtual credentials and Visa Direct into the platform. Now let me move on to value-added services, where revenue was up 23% in the second quarter in constant dollars. The growth and opportunity in value-added services continue to be significant and broad-based. In Acceptance Solutions, we signed an agreement with Millicom International Cellular in Latin America for cybersource gateway, decision manager and token management solutions. As it relates to open banking, just about two years ago, we acquired Tink as we saw the opportunity in open banking to enable the movement of data and money and to provide consumers with control over their financial data. Over those two years, we have been expanding our presence in Europe, winning deals with such as Adyen and Revolut. We're now expanding open banking solutions through Tink into the United States having signed several data access agreements, including with Capital One, Fiserv, and Jack Henry, so that their customers may share data with Tink. We've also signed partnerships on the fintech and merchant side including Dwolla and Max Rewards. And across our risk offerings, we continue to bolster them through our technology, innovation and AI expertise and are expanding their utility beyond the Visa network. Recently, we announced three such capabilities in our Visa Protect offering. The first is the expansion of our signature solutions Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager for non-VISA card payments making them network agnostic. This allows issuers to simplify their fraud operations into a single fraud detection solution. The second is the release of Visa Protect for account-to-account payments, our first fraud prevention solution built specifically for real-time payments, including P2P digital wallets, account-to-account transactions and Central Bank's instant payment systems. Powered by AI-based fraud detection models, this new service provides a real-time risk score that can be used to identify fraud on account-to-account payments. We've been piloting both of these in a number of countries and our strong results thus far have informed our decision to roll these out globally. The third solution is Visa Deep Authorization. It is a new transaction risk scoring solution tailored specifically to the US market to better manage e-commerce payments powered by a world-class deep learning recurrent neural network model and petabytes of contextual data. We also continue to make our offerings available through third-party platforms. We mentioned ServiceNow last quarter and we are excited to have recently joined the AWS Partner Network to help seamlessly provide our clients running systems in the cloud access to Visa's solutions, initially starting with Currencycloud, now known as Visa Cross-Border Solutions and Pismo. We also signed an agreement with Stripe for them to distribute Verify solutions through a self-service dispute management platform for their merchants. All of these efforts are part of our strategy to build and offer our solutions for both Visa and our network of networks. Before I hand it to Chris, I wanted to note that we have commenced the exchange offer for Visa's Class B1 common stock that is set to expire at the end of next week. I also wanted to highlight that this quarter, after nearly 20 years of litigation, we have agreed to a landmark settlement with US merchants, more than 90% of which are small businesses, lowering credit interchange rates and capping those rates into 2030 once approved by the court. The injunctive relief class settlement also provides updates to several key network rules, giving merchants more choice in how they accept digital payments. Last, let me share a few closing thoughts on the quarter and beyond. First, our second quarter was marked by stable results and strengthened relationships with clients across the globe. Second, as we head into the back half of our fiscal year and beyond, new flows and value-added services remain key areas of focus. We also see significant opportunity in consumer payments by digitizing cash and check, enhancing our capabilities in e-commerce, and building new solutions for our network of networks. I could not be more excited for what lies ahead. Finally, all of this is possible because of the 30,000 Visa employees who come to work every day in service of our clients and partners, I am grateful for everything that you do, thank you. And now over to Chris. I mean, I'll talk about the business just for a minute, Moshe. Thanks for the question and then, Chris, you can add any specific callouts. As I think I said in my prepared remarks, the business is really hitting its strides in a lot of different areas in terms of the product we're bringing to market, the success our sales teams are having around the world, we're really focused on three big areas of trying to drive growth. One is just deepening the penetration of products we have with existing clients. That's -- if you think about it is the most near-term opportunity that we have and we've got metrics, client-by-client all around the world, what are they using, what are they not using. We're arming our sales teams with that. We're building case studies on how we can help them and we're driving progress in terms of deepening the relationship we have with our existing clients. And then we're building new products that we're bringing to market. I mentioned a few of those in my prepared remarks today, both in the risk and fraud space as well as in the open banking space and then driving geographic expansion. I mentioned I think just one cybersource deal in my prepared remarks, but cybersource has been a great example of a platform where we've been having success growing in markets where we hadn't traditionally been as deep. AP is actually a positive example of that in the cybersource space. So those are a couple of call-outs, Moshe, in terms of kind of how we're just seeing the broader business. Hey, Dan. Let me backup. I think this is a little different than what you were describing. What we found in the US e-commerce market is that it's the most -- on the one hand, it's the most developed e-commerce market on the planet. On the other hand, it's become the place of the most sophisticated fraud and attack vectors that we see anywhere in the world. And so what we were bringing -- we are bringing to market with Visa Deep Authorization is an e-commerce transaction risk scoring platform and capability that is specifically tailored and built for the unique sets of attack vectors that we're seeing in the US. So it's -- as I was mentioning in my prepared remarks, it's built on deep learning technology that's specifically tuned to some of the sequential and contextual view of accounts that we've had in the US market. And the whole goal is what we do with a lot of our fraud and authorization products. We want to -- we want to make it a better buyer and seller experience. We want to reduce fraud rates, increase authorization rates, increase shopping conversion for our merchant partners. And we think Visa Deep Authorization is going to be yet another tool that will help do that. Thanks, Trevor. I think the good news on this front is it brings clarity and stability to the market. This is litigation that's been out there for the better part of 20 years or so. I think there's been a lot of great work that's been done to bring this to a resolution. Just to remind everyone what the main planks of the resolution are. It really is two different sets of things. One is it will reduce interchange for US -- for credit cards in the US market for both Visa and Mastercard and it will have no increases in interchange for the five years of the agreement. And then the second set of things are tools that give merchants more flexibility to how they manage payments significant -- specifically as it relates to surcharging and things like that. I think, overall, it's what I said, Trevor, which is clarity and stability that lets everybody who operates in the US market move on and move on continuing to grow the digitization of this great payments ecosystem that we've all collectively built in the United States. Okay. You have a great memory. As we've said, our top 265 clients or so use on average about 22 of our value-added services. We don't talk about like how that's moved quarter-to-quarter, but the opportunity is enormous just when you think about the number of clients we have around the planet. And so as I was mentioning earlier kind of what we've done is we've armed our frontline teams with kind of client-by-client, what are they using, what are they not using, what are the opportunities to create value for the client by putting value-added services A, B, C or D to work for them and we're having great success and you see that in the numbers. In terms of the pricing, it's -- it's different pricing models for different products and different suites of solutions in different places around the world. We're always trying to come up with the right product pricing mix that's going to work best for our products in the market. And we have a portfolio of value-added services that span from issuing to acceptance to risk and identity to advisory into open banking and the competitive sets are deep and different in all of those markets. So we're bringing different pricing approaches to each and every market around the world to help meet the best that we can for our clients. Yeah. Thanks, Jamie. We view the Mexican opportunity as a very significant one. And coincidentally, I was just down there a couple of weeks ago meeting with clients and meeting with the Prosa team as well. So as I think I explained on one of these calls, today, because we don't process transactions domestically in Mexico, we're not able to deliver a lot of the value-added services that I've mentioned over the course of this call to our clients. And so first and foremost, our clients are very excited about us having the opportunity to have a majority ownership stake in Prosa and then bring these world class capabilities that we've built to the Mexican market, the things I mentioned earlier, tokenization or the risk scoring algorithms that I mentioned or the e-commerce capabilities that I mentioned those types of things. Now Prosa itself is a great asset. It's been operating for 50 years in Mexico has deep processing experience, it has scale. They do more than 10 billion transactions annually. They have a great base of clients. So it's really the combination of both Prosa's experience and deep footprint in the Mexican market combined with our experience, our technology, our track record in bringing a lot of these services to market, the combination of those two things gives us a lot of confidence and our clients a lot of confidence that we can digitize the significant amount of cash and check and electronic payments that exist today in Mexico. Yeah, thanks. We're having great success in all three. I gave you examples. Some of our teams are ahead of others in different parts of the world and domestic schemes are more prevalent in some parts of the world than others like I mentioned Europe as an example. But the opportunity is enormous in all three of these areas and we've been having really good success in all three of the areas."

Consumer spending remained resilient with first-quarter year-over-year payments volume growth at 8%. U.S. payments volume grew 5% year-over-year. International payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe rose 16% year-over-year in constant dollars with cross-border travel at 142% of 2019 levels, up from 139% in the fourth quarter. Processed transactions rose 9%. Our net revenues increased 9% with GAAP EPS up 20% and non-GAAP EPS up 11%. As I reflect on the execution of our strategy this quarter across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, I wanted to highlight a few key themes. One, we remain obsessed about serving our customers including traditional bank partners, neobanks, fintechs, wallets, sellers, acquirers and everyone else. Our focus on clients has enabled us to deepen our relationships with partners across all three pillars of our strategy. Two, we continue to seek new partnerships, new use cases and new verticals to drive our business forward with a particular emphasis on cross-border. Three, we have gone to market with innovative solutions across our network of networks, seeking to add value for all transactions, no matter the network. And four, we are always looking for new and innovative ways to amplify our brand in service of our partners. With those themes in mind, let me provide some more details on the quarter. Let's start with consumer payments. We saw continued growth in credentials, acceptance and engagement. Credentials grew 6% and we now have more than 8.7 billion network tokens, up 55%. Acceptance locations grew 17%. And let me highlight two recent examples of where we have expanded acceptance. The first was in Brazil with Caixa for cash conversion at their over 10,000 lottery branches. They are now accepting Visa credit and debit cards to pay for utilities, tax collection, lotteries and voucher payments which are called boletos. Another example was in Asia-Pacific where we signed an agreement with Bcash, the largest mobile financial services player in Bangladesh. Already a client with Visa Direct, they now have enabled Visa's 15 million plus cardholders in the country to use their in-app QR code to pay at more than 550,000 Bcash merchants. These examples demonstrate our local approach to expanding our global acceptance footprint. Tap to pay grew five percentage points from last year to 77% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the U.S. In the U.S., we reached 45% penetration. One highlight from the first-quarter is that Lowe's has enabled tap to pay acceptance. We believe the tapping provides the best buyer and seller experience in the face-to-face environment and we've seen that play-out in the results. In a recent Visa study in the U.S., we saw on average two more transactions a month and spend lift of $70 a month for those who tap with a Visa debit card versus those who don't tap. Now on to some noteworthy updates from the quarter, which demonstrate our ability to deepen and expand partnerships as well as create new ones. In Europe, we renewed our agreement with isbank, the largest private bank in Turkey with 33 million cards for its consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. As part of that renewal, they will be issuing the first Olympic and Paralympic Games credit card in Europe outside of France, leveraging our sponsorship. In Poland, we signed a new issuing agreement with PKO Bank Polski, the largest issuer and acquirer in Poland and Central Eastern Europe for consumer and commercial debit. In Greece, we expanded our partnership with Piraeus Bank, the largest bank in the country to become their exclusive payment network across their consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. These are all fantastic examples of the attractive position and strong pipeline in Continental Europe I spoke about last quarter. In Japan, we expanded our credit issuance partnership with e-Pass, one of the fastest-growing issuers in the country, affiliated with department store Marui. They will use Visa Managed Services, which is a part of our advisory solutions where we embed Visa employees within a client organization to help execute against key initiatives. In Korea, we renewed and expanded our partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in the country for a consumer and commercial credit and debit. Shinhan has also committed to utilizing a suite of Visa's value-added services, including consulting and marketing to advance their business. In Mexico, we renewed our agreement with BBVA across consumer and commercial credit and debit along with value-added services, including risk, advisory and data tools. And last, in the U.S., we extended our agreement with Bank of America for multiple value-added services, including visas loyalty platform service, CardinalCommerce 3D secure service, Verifi Order Insight digital service and DPS debit processing. We also continue to be a partner of choice for fintechs around the world. First, in the U.S., we renewed with leading fintech chime, further debit and credit builder secured card portfolios as well as for Visa Direct. In Latin-America, we renewed our debit and credit contracts with Rappi, one of the largest fintech and merchant clients in the region with more than 30 million customers. They will also utilize numerous value-added services, including CyberSource and Decision Manager. And finally, we are excited about a new global partnership with HSBC for their fintech initiative Zing. Starting with the U.K., we are supporting the ambition to launch this multi-currency proposition in more than 30 markets. Visa's capabilities through Tink, currency cloud and our consumer payment solutions offer a powerful customer proposition and rapid deployment for Zing and HSBC. Through these renewals and new partnerships, you can see how we are focused on building a deep relationship across all the capabilities Visa offers. Now moving to new flows. We have updated our sizing of the new flows opportunity using the latest market data available. Excluding Russia and China, we see $200 trillion of opportunity annually across B2B, B2C, P2P and G2C, certainly an enormous number. We are working with our clients to deliver Visa's commercial and money movement solutions to help digitize these flows on our network of networks. Starting with Visa Direct. Total transactions this quarter grew 20% to $2.2 billion. And on the P2P cross-border front, transactions grew more than 65% year-over-year. In terms of client highlights for this quarter, we have been developing partnerships for new use cases in verticals and we are continuing to drive cross-border volumes. First, in new use cases, in addition to our existing P2P partnership in the U.S., we have expanded our Visa Direct relationship with Meta, launching the ability for content creators on Meta's family of apps to cash out their earnings to a debit card. This launch, now live in the U.S., U.K., France and Italy, allows for creators to receive their payout quickly and safely. Second, on cross-border volumes, we have continued to make progress in enabling global money movement across our 8.5 billion endpoints in nearly 200 countries and territories. Western Union is a great example. We just signed a long-term global partnership agreement with Western Union covering issuance, Visa Direct and other services across 40 countries in five regions. This long-term collaboration will bring product innovations and digital-first customer experiences to enhance cross-border money movement. We also expanded our relationship with Remitly to enable customers from 30 countries to send cross-border payments to eligible debit cards and bank accounts in over 100 countries globally. In Canada, we recently announced our agreement with CIBC and Simplii to provide millions of clients the ability to send money to digital wallets in key remittance destinations including the Philippines, China and Bangladesh. On to the commercial side, total payments volume grew 8% in constant dollars. And throughout the quarter, we continued to focus on new verticals. Let me highlight a few specific areas. First, in the cross-border travel vertical, we recently expanded our agreement with Singapore based B2B platform Nium. Their virtual card B2B travel program will expand from the U.S. and Europe into Australia, Singapore, Hong-Kong and Japan. Also in B2B travel, we signed a new virtual card agreement with Worldline, a leading global payment provider for travel intermediaries to pay their suppliers more quickly. In the contractor vertical, we recently signed an agreement with United Overseas Bank and Doxa, a Singapore fintech for contractors. In partnership with Visa, the Doxa platform has further been enhanced to provide embedded financing capabilities. Subcontractors will be given the option to be paid for their services through UOB virtual cards. And also with UOB, we renewed and expanded our commercial relationship across commercial debit and credit including the enablement of payment flows for the Singapore government. Let me move on to value-added services. Our network of networks strategy is also playing a key role in value-added services. As a reminder, this has three components. One, moving money to all end-points and to all form factors. Two, using all available networks and being a single connection point for our partners. And three, providing our value-added services on all transactions, no matter the network. We have continued to develop and expand our value-added services as part of this strategy. Let me cover three recent examples. Processing capabilities for RTP networks, Pismo and Prosa. Last quarter, I noted that Visa is becoming a certified service provider for FedNow, enabling financial institutions to receive funds through the FedNow service. We have now enabled the ability to also send funds. The second example is Pismo, which we just closed last week. As I talk to clients around the world, particularly issuing clients, there are two priorities that are increasingly on the minds of CEOs. The first is for many of our issuing clients, they've either recently embarked on or they're considering embarking on a transformation of their tech-stack from their legacy infrastructure to cloud-native API-based tech stacks. The second is that many clients, whether they'd be traditional issuers or fintechs, are increasingly looking to rapidly expand their issuance to new regions and countries, especially the more developing markets around the world. Our clients are looking to Visa to help them with both of these priorities. And with Pismo, we will be able to deliver to our clients the best cloud-native issuer processor in core banking platform in the world. Pismo offers global core banking and multi-product issuer processing covering credit, debit and commercial with connectivity to local payment networks such as Pix. Our goal is for Pismo to be the platform of choice for our issuing partners around the world, enabling them to accelerate their global expansion and transition to cloud-native platforms. And the third example of our network of networks is our announcement to acquire a majority interest in Prosa, a payments processor in Mexico. A couple things about the Mexican market. One, cash and check represent more than 50% of personal consumption expenditures. And two, today Visa has limited ability to process domestically. We believe we can bring enhanced technology infrastructure and lay the groundwork to develop new innovative ways for consumers, small businesses and local issuers and acquirers in Mexico to pay and be paid. This includes improving safety, security and reliability and providing better experiences through our value-added services such as tokenization, risk products and more. We can also bring our innovation and commitment to continued investment for both face-to-face and online transactions. Together, these efforts will help further digitize payments in the country. The investment is subject to regulatory review and we hope to close in the second-half of calendar year 2024. And finally, I want to highlight the opportunities to drive further growth in value-added services via the development of new partnerships. These enable us to enhance our overall offering and distribution reach. Yesterday, we announced an agreement with digital workflow leader ServiceNow to build solutions and distribute Visa's products and solutions to joint customers. To start, ServiceNow will launch in end-to-end disputes management solution for issuers with plans to expand to additional segments and products over-time. This partnership showcases the demand for our value-added services and provides a compelling distribution channel to reach more customers around the globe. So, across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, you can see the enormous opportunity as well as Visa strong relationships, commitments to our clients and innovation in new ways to pay and be paid. What helps to amplify all of these efforts is our brand. We recently renewed our long-standing partnership with FIFA, creating a powerful opportunity to drive business for both Visa and our clients, improve brand lift and maximize global reach. Not to mention, providing an opportunity to showcase and implement Visa's innovative payment technology. We're also launching our first new global sports sponsorship in more than 15 years with the Red Bull Formula One teams. The partnership aligns our brand with two teams within Formula One which is one of the fastest-growing sports on the planet, providing another opportunity to drive business for our clients. As we look ahead this year, we're excited to be activating our brand with our clients across all of these partnerships as well as the Olympic and Paralympic games in Paris. Before I hand it over to Chris, I wanted to mention that we hold our Annual Meeting on Tuesday. All of the proposals that the Board recommended past including the exchange offer program proposal. As such, we will be moving promptly to file an S-4 with the SEC relating to the initial exchange offer. I also wanted to give a special thanks to my colleague, partner and friend, Alf Kelly, as Tuesday he officially retired as Executive Chairman. Alf, on behalf of the entire Visa family, thank you for your exceptional leadership. You led this business to incredible heights, while also driving innovation, deepening our client relationships and strengthening our culture in so many ways. Your impact on Visa will be visible for generations. In closing, in the first-quarter, Visa once again demonstrated the effective execution of our strategy across the globe. While uncertainty seems to be the norm, Visa has the experience and discipline to manage through the challenging environments and I remain optimistic and confident about our future. Now over to Chris.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q1 was a solid quarter with relative stable-growth in overall payments volume and processed transactions and strong growth in cross-border volume. Looking at our drivers, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year and processed transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Cross-border volume growth excluding intra-Europe was up 16% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal first-quarter net revenues were up 9% in nominal and constant dollars, which was on the high-end of our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives and less FX drag. GAAP EPS was up 20% and non-GAAP EPS was up 11% in nominal and 10% in constant dollars. Now on to the details, starting with the U.S. U.S. payment volumes grew 5% year-over-year, credit grew 6% and debit grew 5%. Card-present spend grew 3% and card not present volume grew 7%. As we look at the monthly total U.S. payments volume growth rates throughout the quarter, we saw low in October and a peak in November with December in between. Putting it all together, the step-down of about 80 basis-points in total US payments volume growth from Q4 to Q1 was primarily due to a less favorable mix of weekends and weekdays compared to last year and a combination of a few small items, including a softer October and modest impact from Reg II. Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments. Moving to holiday spend, which is the period from November 1 to December 31. In the US, consumer holiday spend growth was in the mid-single-digits on a year-over-year basis. Consumer retail spending growth was similar to last year. However, retail spending growth on key shopping days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday was much stronger. E-commerce increased its share of retail spending versus last year. Moving to international markets, where total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars, stable to Q4. Payments' volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions of Latin-America, CEMEA and Europe ex-U.K. each growing about 20% in constant dollars. Now on to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 16% year-over-year. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth excluding travel grew slightly faster-than-expected in the low-teens adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases. Cross-border travel-related spend grew 19% year-over-year. The cross-border travel volume index to 2019 increased from 139% in Q4 to 142% in Q1. Travel volume into Asia indexed at 132% of 2019 levels for the quarter, up three points from Q4, while travel volume out of Asia was up four points to 118%. This was lower than last quarter's expansion, primarily due to relative weakness in Australia and Japan. Travel in and out of Mainland China continued to improve, but both remain below 2019 levels. U.S. travel inbound continued to improve several points from Q4 versus 2019 levels. And we continued to see healthy travel volumes in and out of LAC, Europe and CEMEA and out-of-the US, ranging from 145% to 170% of 2019 levels. Now let's review our first-quarter financial results, starting with the revenue components. First, as any new pricing usually goes into effect in April and October, this quarter, each of our revenue components benefited as a result and the growth rates were either further enhanced or offset by the additional factors as follows. Service revenues grew 11% year-over-year versus the 9% growth in Q4 constant dollar payments volume with some additional help from card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 14% versus 9% processed transaction growth, helped by business mix and value-added services. International transaction revenues were up 8% versus the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping strong currency volatility from last year. Other revenues grew 18% with strong consulting revenue growth, but impacted by lapping 31% growth from 2023, primarily from FIFA related value-added services revenue. Client incentives grew 20%, but ended-up lower-than-expected due to client performance and deal timing. Across our three growth engines, consumer payments growth was driven by relative stability in payments volume growth and processed transactions as well as strong growth in cross-border volume. This quarter, in new flows, the underlying drivers remained relatively stable. Commercial volumes rose 8% year-over-year in constant dollars and Visa Direct transactions grew 20%. Total new flows revenue grew in the low-single-digits year-over-year in constant dollars due to several one-time items and business mix impact. As you know, for any given period, there can be puts and takes, but most importantly drivers are stable and we continue to expect full-year 2024 new flows revenue to grow faster than consumer payments revenue. In Q1, value-added services revenue grew 20% in constant dollars to $2.1 billion with strength and issuing and acceptance solutions. GAAP operating expenses declined 6%. The decrease in expenses was driven by a decrease in the litigation provision, somewhat offset by an increase in personnel expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 7%, primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses. Excluding net gains from our equity investments of $4 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $84 million. Our GAAP tax-rate was 19.1% and our non-GAAP was 19%, helped by larger-than-expected tax benefits. GAAP EPS was $2.39; non-GAAP EPS was $2.41, up 11% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 0.5 point benefit from exchange rates. In Q1, we bought back approximately $3.4 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of December, we had $26.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in January through to the 21st. U.S. payment volume was up 4% with debit up 3% and credit up 4% year-over-year, down from December, largely due to severe weather conditions in parts of the U.S. Process transactions grew 8% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 16% year-over-year. Travel-related cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, grew 16% year-over-year or 146% indexed to 2019; and cross-border card-not-present ex travel grew 16%. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollar and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. For the full year, we have no material changes to our prior outlook for drivers, adjusted net revenues or EPS growth. Remember that our drivers assume no recession or a further increase in Reg II impacts. Pismo is expected to have minimal benefit to full year net revenue growth and an approximately 0.5 point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense and EPS growth. FX is expected to have an approximately 0.5 point drag to net revenues growth and approximately 1 point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and a minimal drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. Non-GAAP non-operating income is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million, with nearly half in Q2 due to the resolution of some non-U.S. tax matters. Putting it all together, adjusted net revenues growth is unchanged at low-double-digits, adjusted operating expense growth is updated to low double digits, and adjusted EPS growth is unchanged at low-teens. For the second quarter, similar to the full-year, Pismo is expected to have a minimal benefit to net revenues growth and an approximately 0.5 point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense and EPS growth. FX is expected to have minimal drag to net revenues growth and an approximately 0.5 point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and minimal benefit to non-GAAP EPS growth. We expect adjusted net revenues growth in the upper mid to high-single-digits and adjusted operating expense growth in the low-double-digits, north of 10%. Nonoperating income is expected to be highest in Q2 due to the resolution of some tax matters, as I noted earlier. As such, the tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 16.5% in Q2 with the full-year unchanged. This puts second quarter adjusted EPS growth in the high-teens. In summary, we're off to a solid start in the first quarter. The fundamental drivers remain relatively stable, and with no material changes to our full year guidance, we remain focused on the execution of our growth strategy for the rest of 2024. As always, if the environment changes and there's an event that impacts our business, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans. We remain thoughtful on balancing between short- and long-term considerations. And now Jennifer, let's go to Q&A.\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Chris, and with that, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks so much. Just want a clarification and a bigger question here. Just on the clarification, the new flows up low single digits versus mid-teens last quarter. How did that come in versus plan? Were there some onetime issues? Because it sounds like the other metrics were in line. And then my question was just on U.S. volume running in the mid-single-digits here, it's pretty tight to PCE. I know there are a lot of factors like gas and e-com and Reg II, but just can you clarify your view on U.S. volume here in relation to PCE growth in the short to mid-term? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney: Tien-Tsin, it's Ryan. Why don't I start on the second part of your question and then Chris can answer the first part and add or correct any on the second part. I think let's back way up for a second in the U.S. U.S. remains a significant opportunity for us in consumer payments. I mean, there's still a lot of cash, a lot of checks, a lot of ACH. We're having great work with fintechs and banks to bring more people in on the carded front. We're doing work to expand acceptance, the service industry, whether it's plumbers or contractors, charities, vending, parking, tap to pay. I mean, we continue to be very, very excited about the U.S. market. I think as you said, and Chris can add some detail, in the quarter, there's some Visa-specific factors on the growth rate in the U.S. as it relates to PCE, like you were talking about. But as we look forward, it continues to be a big opportunity for us. We continue to be excited about it. Chris, do you want to take the first part of Tien-Tsin's question and add anything on the second?\nChris Suh: Sure. Yes, in new flows, so the underlying fundamentals of our commercial business remain sound. Commercial payment volumes grew 8% and Visa Direct transactions grew 20%. And importantly, the new flows business continues to be a growth engine for Visa. We do expect the full-year revenue growth to exceed consumer revenue growth. Now specific to your question around the first quarter, it was impacted by a couple of factors: first, the mix of business, with cross-border volume growth slowing in Q1 as travel continued to normalize; and second, the growth was also impacted by a few onetime items that happened to be larger than we might typically see in any given quarter. But all in all, we feel great about the business and the long-term growth trajectory ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Cool, that's helpful. Thank you both.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question around the new partnerships within value-added services. Ryan, it sounds like, as part of the priorities, you want to get value-added services on all the networks. And I think you were alluding to the fact that this is going to be maybe a bigger shared responsibility with this partnership growth, and ServiceNow is obviously a great example. But I'm just trying to reconcile kind of how we should be thinking about Visa maybe opening up those opportunities with these two partnerships and what that may do at some point to the financial picture of the company? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney: Yes. Again, if I back up before I answer to the specific question about ServiceNow and partners, we're very excited about the progress that we've made on our value-added services strategy. We're excited about the momentum that we're seeing kind of in the market. We're excited to see our sales efforts really driving success and performance across issuing, acceptance, risk and identity, advisory and open banking. And it's exactly as you were saying with partners like ServiceNow. What we're finding is we can have great efforts selling to our partners directly around the world. But we're also getting a lot of demand from various different platforms that already have relationship with thousands or tens of thousands or, in some cases, more customers in any one country or region. And they're very excited to sell through our value-added services as a way of differentiating their platform and deepening relationships with their users and their customers. And so in the example of ServiceNow, they had been talking to their bank clients, and their bank clients had asked for and been interested in some of the dispute services that we provide. And so we're going to market first, as I said in my prepared remarks, with our dispute services via ServiceNow. We've got a pipeline of other products and services that we're working with them on. And we're deep in discussions with other platforms around the world about bringing our money movement solutions and our value-added services solutions as a way to differentiate their platform and add value to their users.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Your line is open.\nJennifer Como: Craig, are you there?\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Sorry, can you hear me?\nJennifer Como: We sure can.\nCraig Maurer: Okay. Great. I wanted to ask if you can be a little bit more detailed in the comments around Reg II and how you're seeing volume move perhaps off your network. And second, if you can just add some detail around the onetime items that impacted Visa in the U.S. in the quarter, I'd appreciate it.\nRyan McInerney: So let me talk a little bit about the business aspect of Reg II, and then Chris, you can hit both of those specific questions, the Reg II and the onetime items. I think it's important at this point to just observe. We're 6 months in now since Reg II in the U.S. And we've had a chance to really engage with our clients and partners on the merchant side of what we do. And we're having really good discussions, really good dialogues. It's been a great opportunity for us to highlight our products, our services and especially the various different things that differentiate a Visa debit transaction from other alternatives. And to be honest, we're getting the chance to have conversations at more senior levels in the organization about the details of our products than we've ever had before, which is great. And so far, we're having great success. The sales conversations have been positive. The results client by client that we're finding as we're able to talk to them about the features and benefits of Visa Direct are great so far and feel really good about our results 6 months into this so far. So Chris, you want to hit the two pieces specifically?\nChris Suh: Yes, will do. So yes, on Reg II, so as we indicated, we did see some modest impact in the U.S. Payment volumes growth in the U.S. was down about 80 basis points from Q4 to Q1. And that slowdown was primarily due to a couple of things. One is the mix of spend days, but also there were a few smaller things, a softer October and the modest impact from Reg II that we're talking about. So a couple of things. It's important to note, we've actually not seen any meaningful changes to volumes being routed away since October. So all in all, the impact is modest, really hasn't changed over the past quarter, and that's actually what we have assumed and we shared for the rest of the year. Now to your second part of your question about one-time items, I talked a little bit about the things in the U.S., Reg II and the slow October. The other place where I talked about onetime items was in the new flows business. As I said, the revenue growth was impacted by a couple of things. One, I talked about the cross-border normalization as on travel. And then secondly, there were these one-time items, and I'll give you an example of one. In the normal course of our business, we regularly true up or true down our incentive and rebates with our clients based on their reported metrics. And in the first quarter, the net impact of these adjustments ended up being larger than we might typically see in a quarter. But all in all, it's not something that gives us concern. The underlying business fundamentals remain healthy. It doesn't change our expectations for full year growth for new flows revenue, which will continue to outpace consumer revenue.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks, good evening. I guess just a question on the slower volumes year-to-date, on the severe weather. I'm just curious if there's been any softness beyond that. And then maybe, do you expect that spending to sort of reaccelerate because the weather has gotten better? Or maybe you can just speak about that a little bit.\nChris Suh: Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. Yes, we did see that growth slowdown in the first week of January. And we've looked really closely at it, and it's directly correlated to the extreme cold weather that's hit in many parts of the U.S. I'll give you a few examples. For anyone in Kansas City, they know this. We went from 45 degrees in the last week of December to negative 10 in the first few weeks of January. And so no one was out and about, and we saw growth in Kansas City go from mid-single digits growing to declining mid-single digits. To take another example, in San Diego, those that are lucky enough to be there, 60 degrees, and we've seen stable mid-single-digit volume growth into January. And maybe a third example that highlights the swings that we saw, in Dallas, it was nearly 60 in the first two weeks of January and then dropped to below 20 degrees in the third week, and we saw the exact same pattern following with our card-present volumes in that third week. And so to the second part of your question, the good news is we've seen these type of weather-related patterns before. They tend to be short blips, and over the course of the quarter, tend to get smoothed back out.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nKen Suchoski: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the EPS growth outlook. It looks like you're guiding to high-teens EPS growth in fiscal 2Q, which I think implies a mid-single-digit decline in the share count quarter-over-quarter. But I'm just trying to figure out why that doesn't flow through to the full year EPS growth figure where you're guiding it to low-teens growth. So if you can help us reconcile that, that would be great. Maybe there's some tax, certain OpEx impacts in the back half of the year that we're not accounting for.\nChris Suh: Yes. It is specific to Q2. I think I mentioned on the call, there were some tax matters that were resolved outside of the U.S. that brought our tax rate down in Q2 into the 16% range. That same matter also had some benefit that hit the NOI line, which also then helped the high-teens growth rate on EPS in Q2 specifically. For the full-year, it doesn't change the tax rate. It doesn't change our prior outlook for EPS growth.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon. I want to follow-up on services. Given how increasingly important these are to your revenue growth, can you give us some insights, quantification on the composition of your value-added services, DPS, CyberSource, risk, et cetera? And maybe also expand about the growth drivers here with regards to attach rates, processing penetration, geo expansion. They're growing almost 2 times faster than your card volumes' overall services, so we are trying to just have a clear guidance here.\nRyan McInerney: Yes, thank you. As I was saying earlier, I think the strategy is really firing on all cylinders. Our execution is firing on all cylinders. The client demand remains strong. The TAMs are large, as you were saying. Last year, we generated about $7 billion in revenue in the value-added services business. I think we said in the quarter, it was a little more than $2 billion and up 20% in constant dollars. Those are great results. To get in a little bit into the details of your question, I mean, we run these businesses segment by segment. In issuing solutions, we're having great success with our network products around the world. DPS continues to have great success with clients in the U.S. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had renewed with Bank of America. That's one of our, as you might expect, largest clients in DPS, a fantastic partner, as well as a number of the other value-added services I mentioned. In the acceptance solutions business, CyberSource continues to have great success around the world, both with their omnichannel services as well as some of the value-added services they have, like token management service and the like. Our disputes business beyond just what I mentioned earlier around ServiceNow is having great success. Verifi is really firing on all cylinders, especially as it expands outside the U.S. Our risk and identity solutions business is really proving to be very resilient and high growth, both our Advanced Authorization Platform, Visa Risk Manager, Visa Secure, all the various different products that we've been bringing to market. And then our advisory services continue to do well. I mentioned in a few of the client wins in my prepared remarks, the success we've had with our managed services platforms where we're embedding teams of Visa employees in our clients, working shoulder to shoulder with our client partners day in and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out, helping them drive their business forward. I mean, that drives revenue growth. That diversifies our revenue. But more importantly than any of that, that embeds us in the building with our clients, helping them grow their businesses, makes our core business even more sticky. So yes, it's execution, it's product pipeline, it's delivery, and we feel really good about the results. Thanks for the question.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Just wanted to get a couple of clarifications. I think last quarter, Chris, you talked about growth would be at a low point in the first quarter, and then you would see that trough accelerate going forward. Just a nuance of the guide is mid to high single digits, so just trying to make sure if there was anything else new to report on Q2 versus Q1 being the trough. And then secondly, just a slightly higher operating expense in constant currency from, I think, it was high single to low double, just the low double now. Was there anything to factor in for that?\nChris Suh: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, so just backing up to your point, going into Q1, you outlined the guidance that I gave. We set an expectation at that time, similar language, high to mid-single digits to high -- sorry, mid- to high single digits, and we did come in at the high end of that range, which was, again, largely benefiting from timing of incentive performance. We have a similar expectation in terms of the range of growth in Q2, but many of the variables that I talked about in terms of the half one versus half two a quarter ago, which was lapping high volatility, lapping high cross-border performance from a year ago and lapping lower incentive growth from a year ago, those, we continue to believe, hold true. And we do anticipate that growth will accelerate into the second half of the year. In terms of your question on OpEx, yes, the changes that you picked up in terms of the full year guide primarily have to do with two things. One is we're now including the impact of the acquisition of Pismo into the guide for OpEx, and there's been some slight updates based on FX, the current FX rates.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. Ryan, I wanted to dig in a little bit on the impressive 17% merchant acceptance growth. It sounds like that really highlights the possibility or the opportunity for continued volume growth even in markets maybe where the secular growth rate is slowing a little bit. Is that sustainable? Should we continue to think about that kind of mid-teens acceptance growth as being a key driver of overall volume expansion?\nRyan McInerney: Listen, when I'm talking to our sales teams around the world, I'm pushing them for as much as possible and more. I mean, if you travel around the world, there are still hundreds of millions of small businesses that aren't on our network. And then you add to that, Andrew, you add to that kind of the creator economy and what's happening there. You literally can think about the acceptance opportunity in billions. So our sales teams around the world are out there working hard, getting creative, figuring out different ways around the world that we can serve those 100-plus million small and micro businesses and ultimately, 1 billion, 2 billion, 3-plus billion individuals around the world that all ultimately could become acceptors of our products as you think about things like Tap to Phone rolling out at scale. I mean, you can imagine a world where every handheld device becomes a tap acceptor, and every device is a tap to pay opportunity where we can not only penetrate further into the C2B space but the P2P space and others. So we felt really good, as you were alluding to, for the last -- I think the last several quarters, we've been 17%, 18%, 19% growth in acceptance locations. I tried, in my prepared remarks, just to give you a little bit of color of the type of things that we're out there doing with players like bKash and Caixa. And we'll be pushing hard to continue to light up all those other opportunities in emerging markets and developed markets around the world.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Thank you. I wanted to touch on the cross-border travel volume growth. It looks like it slowed from roughly 25% to maybe 16% to 17% in January. And back when you're kind of outlining your assumptions for fiscal '24, you thought it would be in the low-20%, and we see a 4 to 5 percentage point improvement compared to 2019. Just wondering how we should think about that as an assumption going forward. Do you think we'll bounce back to that low 20s? Or do you think something closer to where you've seen in January makes more sense? Now this is an area that sometimes you have at least some forward visibility, so trying to get a sense of where we should be thinking about that component?\nChris Suh: Yes. Great. Thanks, James. We had a really good quarter in Q1 to start the year on our cross-border business. Cross-border volumes, as you said, was up 16%. We feel great about that; and as you click into those, e-com growth in the low teens and 19% growth in travel, with the index going from 139% to 142%. And I'll just clarify one thing you said in terms of the guidance that we had provided into the low 20s, that was related to the travel portion of that, which came in at 19% or almost 20%. I do think when understanding the composition by region of our performance, and some of this is a little repetitious but I think important to go through, looking at it region by region is helpful. In LAC, CEMEA, Europe and U.S. outbound, strong results, indexing between 145% to 170% relative to the 2019 levels; second, U.S. inbound, which up until Q4 had lagged 2019, also continued to improve in Q1 and in line with our expectations; in AP, we did see continued expansion in and out of AP but a little bit slower than we saw in Q4, and that was specific to Australia and Japan. And it's probably also worth mentioning, well, not necessarily a large number, the war in the Middle East did have some impact on the cross-border numbers as well. But again, stepping back, we feel really good about our cross-border business in total. The Q1 results were strong, 16% growth; healthy growth for both travel and e-com. And we feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year.\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Hey, Ryan. Chris, Jen, how are you? I just want to drill down into sort of expectations or implied expectations for second half of fiscal '24 given Q1 results, upper single digits; Q2 expectations around growth, mid- to high single digits, so there's an acceleration that's implied. And the question is, what drives it?\nChris Suh: Yes. Thanks. I'm going to break that down into two questions because, one, you said how do we feel about the revenue guide and then I think the second question implied there was on drivers. And so let me talk to those because they are a little bit different. And maybe I'll even start with the second part first, which is with drivers. We're 1 quarter into the fiscal year. It was a solid quarter, stable trends from Q4. And importantly, the consumer has remained resilient. As we look into the rest of the year, we do anticipate drivers to continue to tick up slightly in the second half of the year for two reasons: one, average ticket sizes should improve, in particular, as we lap lower ticket sizes in the second half of last year in the U.S. and we see continued inflation in certain international regions; and second, we're continuing to execute against our growth initiatives in our global markets, for example, the processing wins that we've seen in LAC that we've shared progress about previously. So that's sort of the underlying drivers. And then your first question actually was on revenue. We had a solid start for the year, a really good Q1, stable Q4 trends. Today, we've reaffirmed our full year guide on net revenue in constant dollars, and that includes the modest impact of Reg II that we talked about. So we feel good about Q1. We feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year, and we'll continue to focus on execution.\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig into Pismo a little bit. The website talks about large banks, marketplaces and fintechs. And you mentioned earlier the movement away from the legacy systems into more modern cores. I want to talk a little bit about the ambitions and the potential in terms of the bank sizing. And also, these core conversions, are they for new product and sort of sidecar cores, if you will? Or are we talking about the potential for your core kind of issuing clients in the U.S., midsized banks, to be moving their legacy core potentially over to something offered by Pismo in the future?\nRyan McInerney: So let me step back and talk a bit about how we found Pismo and then answer your question directly, Timothy. I mentioned in my prepared remarks these narratives and these priorities that we've been hearing from CEOs of banks all over the world, in the U.S. and all over the world, medium-sized, big-sized banks, which is, one, they're trying to make this transition from their legacy tech stacks to the cloud; and the second is they want to expand, especially in emerging markets where they don't have enough options of issuer processors to help them. That led us, hearing that over and over and over again, to go search the world for what we thought was the best cloud-based processor and core bank provider that we could find. And that led us to Pismo. And so while Pismo is based down in Brazil, their platform is global. Their clients today are a mix of some of the biggest and most sophisticated banks in the world as well as medium-sized banks and fintechs. So they already today have a mix of different client types. And our ambitions, our ambitions are what I said in my prepared remarks, which is we want this to be the preferred provider of banks around the world. You asked specifically about midsized banks in the U.S. for their core banking platform, the short answer is absolutely. As you think about large banks and their issuer processing capabilities not just for debit, which we have today in the U.S., but for debit, credit, prepaid, commercial, not just in the U.S. but globally, we think Pismo is absolutely a solution that our issuers could be using around the world. So yes, it is a global platform. We have global ambitions. Given the relationships that we have, the privileged relationships that we have with banks, big and small, in the U.S. and around the world, we feel good about our ability to distribute the product to them.\nJennifer Como: Last question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you. Just wanted to ask if we're still comfortable with low double-digit process volume and transaction growth for this year. I know both of those started off kind of in the high-single-digit range, ticked down a little bit in January. And also, any change in your thoughts around fiscal '24 incentive guidance? I think we were looking for modestly less dollar growth than in F '23, but you did a little better than expected in Q1. Thanks.\nChris Suh: Yes. Thanks, Jason. I think I answered some of the driver questions, but I'll just recap very quickly at a summary level. We're reaffirming the outlook for the full-year on drivers, second half benefiting from average ticket sizes in the U.S. and inflation in certain international regions and continuing to executing a number of our growth initiatives in global markets. Processing wins in LAC is the example that I used a minute ago. And so yes to your first question about reaffirming the guide on drivers. And then sorry, repeat your second question for me.\nJason Kupferberg: Just on the incentive guide.\nChris Suh: Incentives, yes. On incentives, yes, also no change in outlook for the full year. As you know, we manage the business to net revenue growth. That's where we're focused. We've updated our guidance for the full-year and Q2 on that. And we'll continue to, like I said, focus on execution.\nJennifer Como: Great. And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Suh",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q1 was a solid quarter with relative stable-growth in overall payments volume and processed transactions and strong growth in cross-border volume. Looking at our drivers, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year and processed transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Cross-border volume growth excluding intra-Europe was up 16% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal first-quarter net revenues were up 9% in nominal and constant dollars, which was on the high-end of our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives and less FX drag. GAAP EPS was up 20% and non-GAAP EPS was up 11% in nominal and 10% in constant dollars. Now on to the details, starting with the U.S. U.S. payment volumes grew 5% year-over-year, credit grew 6% and debit grew 5%. Card-present spend grew 3% and card not present volume grew 7%. As we look at the monthly total U.S. payments volume growth rates throughout the quarter, we saw low in October and a peak in November with December in between. Putting it all together, the step-down of about 80 basis-points in total US payments volume growth from Q4 to Q1 was primarily due to a less favorable mix of weekends and weekdays compared to last year and a combination of a few small items, including a softer October and modest impact from Reg II. Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments. Moving to holiday spend, which is the period from November 1 to December 31. In the US, consumer holiday spend growth was in the mid-single-digits on a year-over-year basis. Consumer retail spending growth was similar to last year. However, retail spending growth on key shopping days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday was much stronger. E-commerce increased its share of retail spending versus last year. Moving to international markets, where total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars, stable to Q4. Payments' volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions of Latin-America, CEMEA and Europe ex-U.K. each growing about 20% in constant dollars. Now on to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 16% year-over-year. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth excluding travel grew slightly faster-than-expected in the low-teens adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases. Cross-border travel-related spend grew 19% year-over-year. The cross-border travel volume index to 2019 increased from 139% in Q4 to 142% in Q1. Travel volume into Asia indexed at 132% of 2019 levels for the quarter, up three points from Q4, while travel volume out of Asia was up four points to 118%. This was lower than last quarter's expansion, primarily due to relative weakness in Australia and Japan. Travel in and out of Mainland China continued to improve, but both remain below 2019 levels. U.S. travel inbound continued to improve several points from Q4 versus 2019 levels. And we continued to see healthy travel volumes in and out of LAC, Europe and CEMEA and out-of-the US, ranging from 145% to 170% of 2019 levels. Now let's review our first-quarter financial results, starting with the revenue components. First, as any new pricing usually goes into effect in April and October, this quarter, each of our revenue components benefited as a result and the growth rates were either further enhanced or offset by the additional factors as follows. Service revenues grew 11% year-over-year versus the 9% growth in Q4 constant dollar payments volume with some additional help from card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 14% versus 9% processed transaction growth, helped by business mix and value-added services. International transaction revenues were up 8% versus the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping strong currency volatility from last year. Other revenues grew 18% with strong consulting revenue growth, but impacted by lapping 31% growth from 2023, primarily from FIFA related value-added services revenue. Client incentives grew 20%, but ended-up lower-than-expected due to client performance and deal timing. Across our three growth engines, consumer payments growth was driven by relative stability in payments volume growth and processed transactions as well as strong growth in cross-border volume. This quarter, in new flows, the underlying drivers remained relatively stable. Commercial volumes rose 8% year-over-year in constant dollars and Visa Direct transactions grew 20%. Total new flows revenue grew in the low-single-digits year-over-year in constant dollars due to several one-time items and business mix impact. As you know, for any given period, there can be puts and takes, but most importantly drivers are stable and we continue to expect full-year 2024 new flows revenue to grow faster than consumer payments revenue. In Q1, value-added services revenue grew 20% in constant dollars to $2.1 billion with strength and issuing and acceptance solutions. GAAP operating expenses declined 6%. The decrease in expenses was driven by a decrease in the litigation provision, somewhat offset by an increase in personnel expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 7%, primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses. Excluding net gains from our equity investments of $4 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $84 million. Our GAAP tax-rate was 19.1% and our non-GAAP was 19%, helped by larger-than-expected tax benefits. GAAP EPS was $2.39; non-GAAP EPS was $2.41, up 11% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 0.5 point benefit from exchange rates. In Q1, we bought back approximately $3.4 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of December, we had $26.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in January through to the 21st. U.S. payment volume was up 4% with debit up 3% and credit up 4% year-over-year, down from December, largely due to severe weather conditions in parts of the U.S. Process transactions grew 8% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 16% year-over-year. Travel-related cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, grew 16% year-over-year or 146% indexed to 2019; and cross-border card-not-present ex travel grew 16%. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollar and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. For the full year, we have no material changes to our prior outlook for drivers, adjusted net revenues or EPS growth. Remember that our drivers assume no recession or a further increase in Reg II impacts. Pismo is expected to have minimal benefit to full year net revenue growth and an approximately 0.5 point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense and EPS growth. FX is expected to have an approximately 0.5 point drag to net revenues growth and approximately 1 point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and a minimal drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. Non-GAAP non-operating income is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million, with nearly half in Q2 due to the resolution of some non-U.S. tax matters. Putting it all together, adjusted net revenues growth is unchanged at low-double-digits, adjusted operating expense growth is updated to low double digits, and adjusted EPS growth is unchanged at low-teens. For the second quarter, similar to the full-year, Pismo is expected to have a minimal benefit to net revenues growth and an approximately 0.5 point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense and EPS growth. FX is expected to have minimal drag to net revenues growth and an approximately 0.5 point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and minimal benefit to non-GAAP EPS growth. We expect adjusted net revenues growth in the upper mid to high-single-digits and adjusted operating expense growth in the low-double-digits, north of 10%. Nonoperating income is expected to be highest in Q2 due to the resolution of some tax matters, as I noted earlier. As such, the tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 16.5% in Q2 with the full-year unchanged. This puts second quarter adjusted EPS growth in the high-teens. In summary, we're off to a solid start in the first quarter. The fundamental drivers remain relatively stable, and with no material changes to our full year guidance, we remain focused on the execution of our growth strategy for the rest of 2024. As always, if the environment changes and there's an event that impacts our business, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans. We remain thoughtful on balancing between short- and long-term considerations. And now Jennifer, let's go to Q&A. Sure. Yes, in new flows, so the underlying fundamentals of our commercial business remain sound. Commercial payment volumes grew 8% and Visa Direct transactions grew 20%. And importantly, the new flows business continues to be a growth engine for Visa. We do expect the full-year revenue growth to exceed consumer revenue growth. Now specific to your question around the first quarter, it was impacted by a couple of factors: first, the mix of business, with cross-border volume growth slowing in Q1 as travel continued to normalize; and second, the growth was also impacted by a few onetime items that happened to be larger than we might typically see in any given quarter. But all in all, we feel great about the business and the long-term growth trajectory ahead. Yes, will do. So yes, on Reg II, so as we indicated, we did see some modest impact in the U.S. Payment volumes growth in the U.S. was down about 80 basis points from Q4 to Q1. And that slowdown was primarily due to a couple of things. One is the mix of spend days, but also there were a few smaller things, a softer October and the modest impact from Reg II that we're talking about. So a couple of things. It's important to note, we've actually not seen any meaningful changes to volumes being routed away since October. So all in all, the impact is modest, really hasn't changed over the past quarter, and that's actually what we have assumed and we shared for the rest of the year. Now to your second part of your question about one-time items, I talked a little bit about the things in the U.S., Reg II and the slow October. The other place where I talked about onetime items was in the new flows business. As I said, the revenue growth was impacted by a couple of things. One, I talked about the cross-border normalization as on travel. And then secondly, there were these one-time items, and I'll give you an example of one. In the normal course of our business, we regularly true up or true down our incentive and rebates with our clients based on their reported metrics. And in the first quarter, the net impact of these adjustments ended up being larger than we might typically see in a quarter. But all in all, it's not something that gives us concern. The underlying business fundamentals remain healthy. It doesn't change our expectations for full year growth for new flows revenue, which will continue to outpace consumer revenue. Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. Yes, we did see that growth slowdown in the first week of January. And we've looked really closely at it, and it's directly correlated to the extreme cold weather that's hit in many parts of the U.S. I'll give you a few examples. For anyone in Kansas City, they know this. We went from 45 degrees in the last week of December to negative 10 in the first few weeks of January. And so no one was out and about, and we saw growth in Kansas City go from mid-single digits growing to declining mid-single digits. To take another example, in San Diego, those that are lucky enough to be there, 60 degrees, and we've seen stable mid-single-digit volume growth into January. And maybe a third example that highlights the swings that we saw, in Dallas, it was nearly 60 in the first two weeks of January and then dropped to below 20 degrees in the third week, and we saw the exact same pattern following with our card-present volumes in that third week. And so to the second part of your question, the good news is we've seen these type of weather-related patterns before. They tend to be short blips, and over the course of the quarter, tend to get smoothed back out. Yes. It is specific to Q2. I think I mentioned on the call, there were some tax matters that were resolved outside of the U.S. that brought our tax rate down in Q2 into the 16% range. That same matter also had some benefit that hit the NOI line, which also then helped the high-teens growth rate on EPS in Q2 specifically. For the full-year, it doesn't change the tax rate. It doesn't change our prior outlook for EPS growth. Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, so just backing up to your point, going into Q1, you outlined the guidance that I gave. We set an expectation at that time, similar language, high to mid-single digits to high -- sorry, mid- to high single digits, and we did come in at the high end of that range, which was, again, largely benefiting from timing of incentive performance. We have a similar expectation in terms of the range of growth in Q2, but many of the variables that I talked about in terms of the half one versus half two a quarter ago, which was lapping high volatility, lapping high cross-border performance from a year ago and lapping lower incentive growth from a year ago, those, we continue to believe, hold true. And we do anticipate that growth will accelerate into the second half of the year. In terms of your question on OpEx, yes, the changes that you picked up in terms of the full year guide primarily have to do with two things. One is we're now including the impact of the acquisition of Pismo into the guide for OpEx, and there's been some slight updates based on FX, the current FX rates. Yes. Great. Thanks, James. We had a really good quarter in Q1 to start the year on our cross-border business. Cross-border volumes, as you said, was up 16%. We feel great about that; and as you click into those, e-com growth in the low teens and 19% growth in travel, with the index going from 139% to 142%. And I'll just clarify one thing you said in terms of the guidance that we had provided into the low 20s, that was related to the travel portion of that, which came in at 19% or almost 20%. I do think when understanding the composition by region of our performance, and some of this is a little repetitious but I think important to go through, looking at it region by region is helpful. In LAC, CEMEA, Europe and U.S. outbound, strong results, indexing between 145% to 170% relative to the 2019 levels; second, U.S. inbound, which up until Q4 had lagged 2019, also continued to improve in Q1 and in line with our expectations; in AP, we did see continued expansion in and out of AP but a little bit slower than we saw in Q4, and that was specific to Australia and Japan. And it's probably also worth mentioning, well, not necessarily a large number, the war in the Middle East did have some impact on the cross-border numbers as well. But again, stepping back, we feel really good about our cross-border business in total. The Q1 results were strong, 16% growth; healthy growth for both travel and e-com. And we feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year. Yes. Thanks. I'm going to break that down into two questions because, one, you said how do we feel about the revenue guide and then I think the second question implied there was on drivers. And so let me talk to those because they are a little bit different. And maybe I'll even start with the second part first, which is with drivers. We're 1 quarter into the fiscal year. It was a solid quarter, stable trends from Q4. And importantly, the consumer has remained resilient. As we look into the rest of the year, we do anticipate drivers to continue to tick up slightly in the second half of the year for two reasons: one, average ticket sizes should improve, in particular, as we lap lower ticket sizes in the second half of last year in the U.S. and we see continued inflation in certain international regions; and second, we're continuing to execute against our growth initiatives in our global markets, for example, the processing wins that we've seen in LAC that we've shared progress about previously. So that's sort of the underlying drivers. And then your first question actually was on revenue. We had a solid start for the year, a really good Q1, stable Q4 trends. Today, we've reaffirmed our full year guide on net revenue in constant dollars, and that includes the modest impact of Reg II that we talked about. So we feel good about Q1. We feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year, and we'll continue to focus on execution. Yes. Thanks, Jason. I think I answered some of the driver questions, but I'll just recap very quickly at a summary level. We're reaffirming the outlook for the full-year on drivers, second half benefiting from average ticket sizes in the U.S. and inflation in certain international regions and continuing to executing a number of our growth initiatives in global markets. Processing wins in LAC is the example that I used a minute ago. And so yes to your first question about reaffirming the guide on drivers. And then sorry, repeat your second question for me. Incentives, yes. On incentives, yes, also no change in outlook for the full year. As you know, we manage the business to net revenue growth. That's where we're focused. We've updated our guidance for the full-year and Q2 on that. And we'll continue to, like I said, focus on execution."

            "name": "Ryan McInerney",
            "content": "Hi, everyone. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. We are off to a solid start in 2024. Consumer spending remained resilient with first-quarter year-over-year payments volume growth at 8%. U.S. payments volume grew 5% year-over-year. International payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe rose 16% year-over-year in constant dollars with cross-border travel at 142% of 2019 levels, up from 139% in the fourth quarter. Processed transactions rose 9%. Our net revenues increased 9% with GAAP EPS up 20% and non-GAAP EPS up 11%. As I reflect on the execution of our strategy this quarter across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, I wanted to highlight a few key themes. One, we remain obsessed about serving our customers including traditional bank partners, neobanks, fintechs, wallets, sellers, acquirers and everyone else. Our focus on clients has enabled us to deepen our relationships with partners across all three pillars of our strategy. Two, we continue to seek new partnerships, new use cases and new verticals to drive our business forward with a particular emphasis on cross-border. Three, we have gone to market with innovative solutions across our network of networks, seeking to add value for all transactions, no matter the network. And four, we are always looking for new and innovative ways to amplify our brand in service of our partners. With those themes in mind, let me provide some more details on the quarter. Let's start with consumer payments. We saw continued growth in credentials, acceptance and engagement. Credentials grew 6% and we now have more than 8.7 billion network tokens, up 55%. Acceptance locations grew 17%. And let me highlight two recent examples of where we have expanded acceptance. The first was in Brazil with Caixa for cash conversion at their over 10,000 lottery branches. They are now accepting Visa credit and debit cards to pay for utilities, tax collection, lotteries and voucher payments which are called boletos. Another example was in Asia-Pacific where we signed an agreement with Bcash, the largest mobile financial services player in Bangladesh. Already a client with Visa Direct, they now have enabled Visa's 15 million plus cardholders in the country to use their in-app QR code to pay at more than 550,000 Bcash merchants. These examples demonstrate our local approach to expanding our global acceptance footprint. Tap to pay grew five percentage points from last year to 77% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the U.S. In the U.S., we reached 45% penetration. One highlight from the first-quarter is that Lowe's has enabled tap to pay acceptance. We believe the tapping provides the best buyer and seller experience in the face-to-face environment and we've seen that play-out in the results. In a recent Visa study in the U.S., we saw on average two more transactions a month and spend lift of $70 a month for those who tap with a Visa debit card versus those who don't tap. Now on to some noteworthy updates from the quarter, which demonstrate our ability to deepen and expand partnerships as well as create new ones. In Europe, we renewed our agreement with isbank, the largest private bank in Turkey with 33 million cards for its consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. As part of that renewal, they will be issuing the first Olympic and Paralympic Games credit card in Europe outside of France, leveraging our sponsorship. In Poland, we signed a new issuing agreement with PKO Bank Polski, the largest issuer and acquirer in Poland and Central Eastern Europe for consumer and commercial debit. In Greece, we expanded our partnership with Piraeus Bank, the largest bank in the country to become their exclusive payment network across their consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. These are all fantastic examples of the attractive position and strong pipeline in Continental Europe I spoke about last quarter. In Japan, we expanded our credit issuance partnership with e-Pass, one of the fastest-growing issuers in the country, affiliated with department store Marui. They will use Visa Managed Services, which is a part of our advisory solutions where we embed Visa employees within a client organization to help execute against key initiatives. In Korea, we renewed and expanded our partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in the country for a consumer and commercial credit and debit. Shinhan has also committed to utilizing a suite of Visa's value-added services, including consulting and marketing to advance their business. In Mexico, we renewed our agreement with BBVA across consumer and commercial credit and debit along with value-added services, including risk, advisory and data tools. And last, in the U.S., we extended our agreement with Bank of America for multiple value-added services, including visas loyalty platform service, CardinalCommerce 3D secure service, Verifi Order Insight digital service and DPS debit processing. We also continue to be a partner of choice for fintechs around the world. First, in the U.S., we renewed with leading fintech chime, further debit and credit builder secured card portfolios as well as for Visa Direct. In Latin-America, we renewed our debit and credit contracts with Rappi, one of the largest fintech and merchant clients in the region with more than 30 million customers. They will also utilize numerous value-added services, including CyberSource and Decision Manager. And finally, we are excited about a new global partnership with HSBC for their fintech initiative Zing. Starting with the U.K., we are supporting the ambition to launch this multi-currency proposition in more than 30 markets. Visa's capabilities through Tink, currency cloud and our consumer payment solutions offer a powerful customer proposition and rapid deployment for Zing and HSBC. Through these renewals and new partnerships, you can see how we are focused on building a deep relationship across all the capabilities Visa offers. Now moving to new flows. We have updated our sizing of the new flows opportunity using the latest market data available. Excluding Russia and China, we see $200 trillion of opportunity annually across B2B, B2C, P2P and G2C, certainly an enormous number. We are working with our clients to deliver Visa's commercial and money movement solutions to help digitize these flows on our network of networks. Starting with Visa Direct. Total transactions this quarter grew 20% to $2.2 billion. And on the P2P cross-border front, transactions grew more than 65% year-over-year. In terms of client highlights for this quarter, we have been developing partnerships for new use cases in verticals and we are continuing to drive cross-border volumes. First, in new use cases, in addition to our existing P2P partnership in the U.S., we have expanded our Visa Direct relationship with Meta, launching the ability for content creators on Meta's family of apps to cash out their earnings to a debit card. This launch, now live in the U.S., U.K., France and Italy, allows for creators to receive their payout quickly and safely. Second, on cross-border volumes, we have continued to make progress in enabling global money movement across our 8.5 billion endpoints in nearly 200 countries and territories. Western Union is a great example. We just signed a long-term global partnership agreement with Western Union covering issuance, Visa Direct and other services across 40 countries in five regions. This long-term collaboration will bring product innovations and digital-first customer experiences to enhance cross-border money movement. We also expanded our relationship with Remitly to enable customers from 30 countries to send cross-border payments to eligible debit cards and bank accounts in over 100 countries globally. In Canada, we recently announced our agreement with CIBC and Simplii to provide millions of clients the ability to send money to digital wallets in key remittance destinations including the Philippines, China and Bangladesh. On to the commercial side, total payments volume grew 8% in constant dollars. And throughout the quarter, we continued to focus on new verticals. Let me highlight a few specific areas. First, in the cross-border travel vertical, we recently expanded our agreement with Singapore based B2B platform Nium. Their virtual card B2B travel program will expand from the U.S. and Europe into Australia, Singapore, Hong-Kong and Japan. Also in B2B travel, we signed a new virtual card agreement with Worldline, a leading global payment provider for travel intermediaries to pay their suppliers more quickly. In the contractor vertical, we recently signed an agreement with United Overseas Bank and Doxa, a Singapore fintech for contractors. In partnership with Visa, the Doxa platform has further been enhanced to provide embedded financing capabilities. Subcontractors will be given the option to be paid for their services through UOB virtual cards. And also with UOB, we renewed and expanded our commercial relationship across commercial debit and credit including the enablement of payment flows for the Singapore government. Let me move on to value-added services. Our network of networks strategy is also playing a key role in value-added services. As a reminder, this has three components. One, moving money to all end-points and to all form factors. Two, using all available networks and being a single connection point for our partners. And three, providing our value-added services on all transactions, no matter the network. We have continued to develop and expand our value-added services as part of this strategy. Let me cover three recent examples. Processing capabilities for RTP networks, Pismo and Prosa. Last quarter, I noted that Visa is becoming a certified service provider for FedNow, enabling financial institutions to receive funds through the FedNow service. We have now enabled the ability to also send funds. The second example is Pismo, which we just closed last week. As I talk to clients around the world, particularly issuing clients, there are two priorities that are increasingly on the minds of CEOs. The first is for many of our issuing clients, they've either recently embarked on or they're considering embarking on a transformation of their tech-stack from their legacy infrastructure to cloud-native API-based tech stacks. The second is that many clients, whether they'd be traditional issuers or fintechs, are increasingly looking to rapidly expand their issuance to new regions and countries, especially the more developing markets around the world. Our clients are looking to Visa to help them with both of these priorities. And with Pismo, we will be able to deliver to our clients the best cloud-native issuer processor in core banking platform in the world. Pismo offers global core banking and multi-product issuer processing covering credit, debit and commercial with connectivity to local payment networks such as Pix. Our goal is for Pismo to be the platform of choice for our issuing partners around the world, enabling them to accelerate their global expansion and transition to cloud-native platforms. And the third example of our network of networks is our announcement to acquire a majority interest in Prosa, a payments processor in Mexico. A couple things about the Mexican market. One, cash and check represent more than 50% of personal consumption expenditures. And two, today Visa has limited ability to process domestically. We believe we can bring enhanced technology infrastructure and lay the groundwork to develop new innovative ways for consumers, small businesses and local issuers and acquirers in Mexico to pay and be paid. This includes improving safety, security and reliability and providing better experiences through our value-added services such as tokenization, risk products and more. We can also bring our innovation and commitment to continued investment for both face-to-face and online transactions. Together, these efforts will help further digitize payments in the country. The investment is subject to regulatory review and we hope to close in the second-half of calendar year 2024. And finally, I want to highlight the opportunities to drive further growth in value-added services via the development of new partnerships. These enable us to enhance our overall offering and distribution reach. Yesterday, we announced an agreement with digital workflow leader ServiceNow to build solutions and distribute Visa's products and solutions to joint customers. To start, ServiceNow will launch in end-to-end disputes management solution for issuers with plans to expand to additional segments and products over-time. This partnership showcases the demand for our value-added services and provides a compelling distribution channel to reach more customers around the globe. So, across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, you can see the enormous opportunity as well as Visa strong relationships, commitments to our clients and innovation in new ways to pay and be paid. What helps to amplify all of these efforts is our brand. We recently renewed our long-standing partnership with FIFA, creating a powerful opportunity to drive business for both Visa and our clients, improve brand lift and maximize global reach. Not to mention, providing an opportunity to showcase and implement Visa's innovative payment technology. We're also launching our first new global sports sponsorship in more than 15 years with the Red Bull Formula One teams. The partnership aligns our brand with two teams within Formula One which is one of the fastest-growing sports on the planet, providing another opportunity to drive business for our clients. As we look ahead this year, we're excited to be activating our brand with our clients across all of these partnerships as well as the Olympic and Paralympic games in Paris. Before I hand it over to Chris, I wanted to mention that we hold our Annual Meeting on Tuesday. All of the proposals that the Board recommended past including the exchange offer program proposal. As such, we will be moving promptly to file an S-4 with the SEC relating to the initial exchange offer. I also wanted to give a special thanks to my colleague, partner and friend, Alf Kelly, as Tuesday he officially retired as Executive Chairman. Alf, on behalf of the entire Visa family, thank you for your exceptional leadership. You led this business to incredible heights, while also driving innovation, deepening our client relationships and strengthening our culture in so many ways. Your impact on Visa will be visible for generations. In closing, in the first-quarter, Visa once again demonstrated the effective execution of our strategy across the globe. While uncertainty seems to be the norm, Visa has the experience and discipline to manage through the challenging environments and I remain optimistic and confident about our future. Now over to Chris. Tien-Tsin, it's Ryan. Why don't I start on the second part of your question and then Chris can answer the first part and add or correct any on the second part. I think let's back way up for a second in the U.S. U.S. remains a significant opportunity for us in consumer payments. I mean, there's still a lot of cash, a lot of checks, a lot of ACH. We're having great work with fintechs and banks to bring more people in on the carded front. We're doing work to expand acceptance, the service industry, whether it's plumbers or contractors, charities, vending, parking, tap to pay. I mean, we continue to be very, very excited about the U.S. market. I think as you said, and Chris can add some detail, in the quarter, there's some Visa-specific factors on the growth rate in the U.S. as it relates to PCE, like you were talking about. But as we look forward, it continues to be a big opportunity for us. We continue to be excited about it. Chris, do you want to take the first part of Tien-Tsin's question and add anything on the second? Yes. Again, if I back up before I answer to the specific question about ServiceNow and partners, we're very excited about the progress that we've made on our value-added services strategy. We're excited about the momentum that we're seeing kind of in the market. We're excited to see our sales efforts really driving success and performance across issuing, acceptance, risk and identity, advisory and open banking. And it's exactly as you were saying with partners like ServiceNow. What we're finding is we can have great efforts selling to our partners directly around the world. But we're also getting a lot of demand from various different platforms that already have relationship with thousands or tens of thousands or, in some cases, more customers in any one country or region. And they're very excited to sell through our value-added services as a way of differentiating their platform and deepening relationships with their users and their customers. And so in the example of ServiceNow, they had been talking to their bank clients, and their bank clients had asked for and been interested in some of the dispute services that we provide. And so we're going to market first, as I said in my prepared remarks, with our dispute services via ServiceNow. We've got a pipeline of other products and services that we're working with them on. And we're deep in discussions with other platforms around the world about bringing our money movement solutions and our value-added services solutions as a way to differentiate their platform and add value to their users. So let me talk a little bit about the business aspect of Reg II, and then Chris, you can hit both of those specific questions, the Reg II and the onetime items. I think it's important at this point to just observe. We're 6 months in now since Reg II in the U.S. And we've had a chance to really engage with our clients and partners on the merchant side of what we do. And we're having really good discussions, really good dialogues. It's been a great opportunity for us to highlight our products, our services and especially the various different things that differentiate a Visa debit transaction from other alternatives. And to be honest, we're getting the chance to have conversations at more senior levels in the organization about the details of our products than we've ever had before, which is great. And so far, we're having great success. The sales conversations have been positive. The results client by client that we're finding as we're able to talk to them about the features and benefits of Visa Direct are great so far and feel really good about our results 6 months into this so far. So Chris, you want to hit the two pieces specifically? Yes, thank you. As I was saying earlier, I think the strategy is really firing on all cylinders. Our execution is firing on all cylinders. The client demand remains strong. The TAMs are large, as you were saying. Last year, we generated about $7 billion in revenue in the value-added services business. I think we said in the quarter, it was a little more than $2 billion and up 20% in constant dollars. Those are great results. To get in a little bit into the details of your question, I mean, we run these businesses segment by segment. In issuing solutions, we're having great success with our network products around the world. DPS continues to have great success with clients in the U.S. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had renewed with Bank of America. That's one of our, as you might expect, largest clients in DPS, a fantastic partner, as well as a number of the other value-added services I mentioned. In the acceptance solutions business, CyberSource continues to have great success around the world, both with their omnichannel services as well as some of the value-added services they have, like token management service and the like. Our disputes business beyond just what I mentioned earlier around ServiceNow is having great success. Verifi is really firing on all cylinders, especially as it expands outside the U.S. Our risk and identity solutions business is really proving to be very resilient and high growth, both our Advanced Authorization Platform, Visa Risk Manager, Visa Secure, all the various different products that we've been bringing to market. And then our advisory services continue to do well. I mentioned in a few of the client wins in my prepared remarks, the success we've had with our managed services platforms where we're embedding teams of Visa employees in our clients, working shoulder to shoulder with our client partners day in and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out, helping them drive their business forward. I mean, that drives revenue growth. That diversifies our revenue. But more importantly than any of that, that embeds us in the building with our clients, helping them grow their businesses, makes our core business even more sticky. So yes, it's execution, it's product pipeline, it's delivery, and we feel really good about the results. Thanks for the question. Listen, when I'm talking to our sales teams around the world, I'm pushing them for as much as possible and more. I mean, if you travel around the world, there are still hundreds of millions of small businesses that aren't on our network. And then you add to that, Andrew, you add to that kind of the creator economy and what's happening there. You literally can think about the acceptance opportunity in billions. So our sales teams around the world are out there working hard, getting creative, figuring out different ways around the world that we can serve those 100-plus million small and micro businesses and ultimately, 1 billion, 2 billion, 3-plus billion individuals around the world that all ultimately could become acceptors of our products as you think about things like Tap to Phone rolling out at scale. I mean, you can imagine a world where every handheld device becomes a tap acceptor, and every device is a tap to pay opportunity where we can not only penetrate further into the C2B space but the P2P space and others. So we felt really good, as you were alluding to, for the last -- I think the last several quarters, we've been 17%, 18%, 19% growth in acceptance locations. I tried, in my prepared remarks, just to give you a little bit of color of the type of things that we're out there doing with players like bKash and Caixa. And we'll be pushing hard to continue to light up all those other opportunities in emerging markets and developed markets around the world. So let me step back and talk a bit about how we found Pismo and then answer your question directly, Timothy. I mentioned in my prepared remarks these narratives and these priorities that we've been hearing from CEOs of banks all over the world, in the U.S. and all over the world, medium-sized, big-sized banks, which is, one, they're trying to make this transition from their legacy tech stacks to the cloud; and the second is they want to expand, especially in emerging markets where they don't have enough options of issuer processors to help them. That led us, hearing that over and over and over again, to go search the world for what we thought was the best cloud-based processor and core bank provider that we could find. And that led us to Pismo. And so while Pismo is based down in Brazil, their platform is global. Their clients today are a mix of some of the biggest and most sophisticated banks in the world as well as medium-sized banks and fintechs. So they already today have a mix of different client types. And our ambitions, our ambitions are what I said in my prepared remarks, which is we want this to be the preferred provider of banks around the world. You asked specifically about midsized banks in the U.S. for their core banking platform, the short answer is absolutely. As you think about large banks and their issuer processing capabilities not just for debit, which we have today in the U.S., but for debit, credit, prepaid, commercial, not just in the U.S. but globally, we think Pismo is absolutely a solution that our issuers could be using around the world. So yes, it is a global platform. We have global ambitions. Given the relationships that we have, the privileged relationships that we have with banks, big and small, in the U.S. and around the world, we feel good about our ability to distribute the product to them."
