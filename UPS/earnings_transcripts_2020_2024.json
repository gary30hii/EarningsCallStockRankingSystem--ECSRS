I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And after the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nScott Childress: Good morning and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO and Brian Newman, our CFO. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we will make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2019 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP results included a non-cash, after-tax, mark-to-market pension charge of $4.9 billion and after-tax transformation charge of $114 million and an after-tax impairment charge of $545 million related to the Company’s decision to sell UPS Freight. The after-tax total for these items is $5.6 billion, an impact to the fourth quarter of 2020 EPS of $6.38 per diluted share. The mark-to-market pension charge of $4.9 billion included a benefit from higher-than-anticipated asset returns, which did not fully offset the negative impact of lower discount rates. It also included the remainder of our current best estimate of potential Central States coordinating benefits as of December 31st, 2020. Additional details regarding the year-end pension charges will be available in a presentation posted to our Investor Relations website later today. Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude the year-end pension charges, transformation cost and non-cash impairment charge. The webcast of today’s call along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available on UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions] And now, I will turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Scott. We have a lot to cover with you this morning. We were very busy in the fourth quarter. I will review our peak season and then provide an update on our strategic progress. Brian will cover the financial details for the quarter and then finish with an outlook for 2021. Let me begin with a huge thank you to our more than 540,000 UPSers for not only delivering one of the best peaks in our Company history, but also for their extraordinary efforts throughout 2020. UPSers are essential workers and I could not be more proud of the team. In a year unlike any other, they delivered what matters. Looking at the fourth quarter, our results were strong and considerably better than we expected. Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 21% from last year to $24.9 billion and operating profit grew 26% from last year to $2.9 billion. This is the highest quarterly operating profit in the Company’s history with record profit produced in each segment. For the year, UPS generated record revenue of $84.6 billion with growth in all three segments. We increased operating profit by 7% to $8.7 billion and we generated diluted earnings per share of $8.23, an increase of 9.3%. Turning back to the fourth quarter, let me address our holiday peak performance. The environment was very dynamic, largely due to market demand exceeding market supply, but we were ready. Our early collaboration with customers and a disciplined approach to executing our peak plans proved to be very successful. We delivered industry leading service levels, which in turn accelerated new customer requests for our services. As peak holiday approached, we saw SMBs, our small and medium-sized businesses increasingly turn to UPS. In the U.S., in the fourth quarter, SMB volume grew 28.5%, outpacing our larger customers, which grew by 4%. By running the network with more discipline and through the deployment of new tools, we reduced what we refer to as chaos costs, or costs associated with bottlenecks and over time pay. Additionally, SurePost redirect reached a new record in December. Nearly 50% of SurePost volume was delivered by UPS drivers, optimizing our network. And just a comment about peak outside of the U.S., it was a very peaky peak with the highest volume in our history, delivered with excellent service levels. And while this peak was one of our best, we know that we can do even better. We have identified additional areas for improvement and are including them in our peak 2021 planning. During the height of the peak season, the FDA and other health authorities approved the use of COVID-19 vaccines. We were ready for this, as we have reserve capacity in our network. We have been in the healthcare logistics business for more than 15-years. Our expertise in cold chain logistics positions us well and thus far, we have provided above 99% service for vaccine delivery. Looking back to 2020, we laid a strong foundation for future success. On my first earnings call in July, I mentioned that we were operationalizing our strategy; customer first, people led, innovation-driven, through a better not bigger framework. We are making solid progress. From a customer first perspective, speed and enabling capabilities are very important. Our goal is to provide the best digital experience powered by our smart global logistics network and we’re targeting our solutions to high-yielding sectors like SMBs, among others. We’ve moved the needle on speed. For the year, weekend ground volume was, up 93.9% over last year. And SMB volume on our fastest ground ever lanes grew by 40% in the fourth quarter since we improved these lanes. We now have more than 700,000 accounts in DAP, which is our digital access program and revenue from that program grew more than 360% in 2020. We expect our DAP revenues to reach $1 billion in 2021. People-led focuses on building a better workplace for our people. Over the past several months, we’ve addressed some of the pain points here and early feedback has been very positive. In fact, we have seen a 13 percentage point improvement in likelihood to recommend, the primary metric we use to measure progress on our people led initiative. As Brian will detail, during the quarter, we accelerated certain annual bonus awards that were paying out over 5 years. Going forward, our annual management incentive plan will pay out in one year and will include targets for return on invested capital. Further, we are simplifying our sales incentive programs and incorporating profitability targets into those programs. These changes better align employee performance to the interests of all shareowners. People led also means creating fewer, but more impactful jobs and lowering our non-operating costs. Brian will provide you with an update on our transformation activities. Innovation-driven means driving higher returns on the capital we deploy using new tools, processes and technologies. Driving higher returns starts by improving our revenue quality and here our efforts are working. In the fourth quarter, U.S. domestic revenue per piece was up 7.8%, the highest growth we’ve seen in more than 10-years. While this year-over-year growth rate reflects peak surcharges, it also reflects a change in mix, as SMBs accounted for 64% of U.S. average daily volume growth in the quarter. We also saw solid SMB volume growth outside of the U.S. Lastly we have tightened the linkage between our investments and returns. As I mentioned back in July, with the exception of our five core principles, everything else is under review. Last week, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell UPS Freight, our LTL business unit. UPS Freight is a capital-intensive low returning business. We do not need to own this business to provide an LTL solution for our customers. With the disposition of UPS Freight, we will be smaller, but we will be better, as without it, we will see an improvement in our operating margins and return on invested capital. Being better not bigger also means de-risking our balance sheet. We will use the proceeds from the sale of UPS Freight to pay down long-term debt. Looking ahead, uncertainty remains. While we are optimistic about the future, we don’t know the pace of the vaccine rollout or the impact that a continuing pandemic will have on the global economy. On the other hand, we don’t think e-commerce sales as a percentage of retail sales will decline, which means continued supply and demand imbalances. This scenario supports our efforts to improve revenue quality, while optimizing our existing network. These efforts coupled with a relentless focus on productivity and effective capital allocation should result in both operating margin expansion and higher return on invested capital in 2021. But until we have more certainty with the economic environment, we are not providing revenue or earnings per share guidance. Let me close with a note of reflection. I have been in the CEO chair since June 1 and has been an honor and a privilege to serve especially this year, a year the world won’t forget. UPS is a purpose-driven company with a proud past and an even brighter future. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover four areas: starting with high level macroeconomic trends; then the results for each of our business segments; next, I’ll review full year cash and shareowner returns; and lastly, I’ll wrap up with some color on our 2021 outlook, including full-year guidance for capital allocation. Let’s start with the macro, which can be best described as dynamic and has created both opportunities and obstacles pushing business activity in multiple directions. Global GDP for the fourth quarter is expected to finish down 1.7%, a slight improvement versus the third quarter. In the U.S., reported consumer sentiment in December was 80.7, up 3.8 points from November and consumers continued to shop online with year-over-year growth for non-store retail sales, up 24.3% to finish at 20.9% of all U.S. retail sales in the fourth quarter. On the commercial side of the U.S. economy, growth in industrial production during the fourth quarter remained negative at minus 4.7% year-over-year, but improved 180 basis points from the third quarter. Overall, macro conditions are weak. However, the shift in buying patterns generated elevated residential demand. Moving to performance, for the quarter, consolidated revenue, profit and EPS were all up more than 20%. UPS consolidated revenue increased 21% to $24.9 billion and operating profit totaled $2.9 billion, 26% higher than last year. The operating margin for the company expanded to 11.5%, which was 40 basis points above last year and diluted earnings per share was $2.66, up 26.1% from the same period last year. Our strong fourth quarter financial results provide a glimpse into our strategic progress and what is possible. Moving into the segments, in U.S. domestic, our success was driven by our revenue quality efforts and a disciplined approach to executing our peak plans. As expected, average daily volume increased 8.9% year-over-year to a total of 25.2 million packages per day. More importantly, customer mix improved, SMB volume growth accelerated 980 basis points sequentially, going from 18.7% growth in the third quarter to 28.5% in the fourth. Both SMBs and our larger customers grew residential shipments across air and ground products. Overall, B2C shipments increased 19.9% year-over-year and represented 67% of total volume. Conversely, both SMBs and large customers shipped fewer B2B packages on a year-over-year basis. B2B average daily volume finished down 8.3%. Healthcare and automotive were bright spots and delivered single-digit B2B growth. However, they were unable to offset weakness in retail and high-tech. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated its highest ever quarterly revenue, up 17.4% to $15.7 billion, driven by growth in ground products. We are extremely pleased with our revenue quality efforts, which were well above our expectations. More specifically, SMB growth accelerated and we had higher-than-anticipated peak season surcharge revenue. As a result, reported revenue per piece grew 7.8% year-over-year with ground revenue per piece, up 11.2%. Turning to costs, expenses were up 17.7% over the fourth quarter of last year and cost per piece was up 8.2%. Our expenses grew faster than revenue, due to several factors: first, in 2019, we had $150 million in expense reductions from alternative fuel tax credits and lower management incentives that did not repeat; second, total delivery stops increased by 15.7%, due to high growth in single piece shipments and lower delivery density increased cost by $185 million; third, in the quarter, we had higher benefit expenses of $100 million related to the employees hired early in 2020; and finally, as Carol mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we elected to accelerate the vesting of certain previous compensation awards, a one-time expense impact of $129 million. If you ignore the impact of the accelerated vesting of awards, we would have leveraged expense in the quarter. When we look specifically at our peak period, despite the complexities, our operators and engineers executed extremely well. Together, with the sales teams, we controlled volume that entered the network avoiding chaos costs, while delivering best-in-class service. As one example, over time hours in our operations in December went down 7.7%, compared to last year. Pulling it all together, in the fourth quarter, the U.S. generated $1.4 billion in operating profit, an increase of 14.3%, compared to last year. Moving to international, the segment delivered another quarter of record operating profit. We exceeded our volume expectation with total average daily volume, up 21.9%, driven by export and domestic volume growth in all regions. We added 365 flights above our normal schedules to support high market demand for our export services. In fact, total exports grew 27.8% on a year-over-year basis, led by Asia exports, up 45% and Europe exports, up 30.7%. B2C average daily volume grew 104.1%, while B2B was up 2%, the first quarterly B2B growth in 2020. For the quarter, international revenue was up 26.8% to $4.8 billion. Revenue per piece was up 3.8% and cost per piece was, up 0.3% year-over-year, which generated positive operating leverage in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, International delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion, an increase of 43.4% and operating margin expanded 280 basis points to 24.3%. Operating profit and margin are both record highs for the segment. Looking at supply chain and freight, the segment results were excellent, with revenue, up 29% to $4.4 billion. Strong market demand drove revenue and profit growth in almost all business units. Forwarding had another great quarter, led by elevated demand out of Asia. Our LTL business grew operating profit by focusing on revenue quality efforts and healthcare had its best quarterly top line and bottom line growth ever, driven by outbound direct-to-patient shipments, all while providing near-perfect service in late December for COVID-19 vaccine deliveries. Overall in supply chain and freight, operating profit was $331 million, an increase of 26.3% year-over-year. Walking down our income statement, we had $175 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $327 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 23.2%. Now, let’s turn to cash and shareowner returns. Our cash flow was strong throughout the year. We generated $10.5 billion in cash from operations, which included a benefit of $1.1 billion related to the CARES Act federal payroll tax deferral offset by pension contributions, totaling $3.1 billion. Capital investments totaled $5.6 billion, which includes 16 new aircraft; 16,000 new vehicles; and 18 facilities added to our Smart Global Logistics Network. All of which resulted in free cash flow for 2020 of $5.1 billion. In 2020, UPS distributed $3.6 billion in dividends, which represents a 5.2% increase on a per share basis over 2019. Moving to our outlook for 2021, as Carol mentioned, due to the continuing economic uncertainty, we are not providing revenue or diluted earnings per share guidance at this time. But I do want to give you some color as you think about 2021. First, let me update you on what we have been calling Transformation 2.0. Through a combination of various programs, we plan to reduce our non-operating expenses by more than $500 million in 2021. As Carol mentioned, we are focused on creating fewer, but more impactful jobs; second, we expect the sale of UPS Freight will close during the second quarter of 2021. So, you will want to adjust your models accordingly; third, we are gaining traction on our revenue quality initiatives. As a result, we would expect our small package revenue in 2021 to grow faster than our average daily volume. As we further evaluate the year, one of our wildly important initiatives is to review our network design and look at alternatives for how we expand capacity. And finally, because of our revenue quality initiatives, along with our actions to drive higher levels of productivity and take costs out, we expect operating margin and return on invested capital to expand. And just to comment on the first half of the year, we will face more difficult comps in the second quarter of 2021 than in the first quarter. As a result, we anticipate much stronger year-over-year financial results in the first quarter relative to the second quarter. While it is early in the quarter now, we are pleased with how the year has begun. Looking at full year capital allocation in 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion with 40% allocated to maintenance CapEx, 50% for both technology initiatives and network capabilities in 2021 with over half of this investment being deployed to international and healthcare. And the remaining 10% for growth projects that will come online after 2021. Dividends are expected to grow subject to Board approval. And to further strengthen the balance sheet, we will payoff $2.5 billion of funded debt. We have no plans to repurchase shares or access the debt capital markets. And lastly, our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5%. Before I wrap up, I would like to confirm that we will host an Investor Meeting on June 9th, where we will share multi-year financial targets and our specific plans for how we will achieve those targets. In closing, we are laser focused on executing our strategy and leaning into the best market opportunities to improve the financial performance of the company, provide the best customer experience and benefit our shareowners. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on the good results. Brian, just on your margin comment just wondering if you can clarify in the second quarter, if you expect margins to be up year-over-year in the second quarter? I understand the tougher comp I am just trying to get a sense of how you are thinking about on a year-over-year basis? And then I was just hoping also you can help us think about yield and cost per package. As we progress through 2021, yield progress has been great, but just wondering if that’s something you can continue to sustain or build upon in 2021? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Yes, Amit, happy to take that. So, from a yield perspective, very happy with the progress, particularly in the U.S. business, we went from Q2 yield was minus 4%, 4.4%, we are flat in Q3 and up 7.8% in Q4. So, I think you’ve heard us talk about the revenue quality actions we’ve been implementing. It’s a combination of mix; it’s a combination of surcharges and customer actions. So, I think the progress speaks for itself. In terms of op margins for 2021, as I mentioned, we’re committed to expanding our domestic op margin in the year. I won’t get into Q1 versus Q2. We’ll certainly give you some more guidance and clarity when we get together in June to talk about the second half of the year. But suffice it to say, the combination of revenue quality and cost actions will expand domestic margins in year.\nAmit Mehrotra: But just one quick related to that, the cost per package inflation was pretty high in the quarter and you obviously called out with some specific items. As we look at the progression over this year, the yield dynamics look sticky, maybe cost per package can come down, at least the inflation and cost per package can come down, especially as you get B2B recovery. Is that a fair way to think about the spread between cost – pricing cost per piece as we progress through the year relative to obviously what it was in the fourth quarter?\nBrian Newman: Yes. Amit, I think we talked on the last quarter about some of the headwinds we are walking into in the fourth quarter of ‘20. We had 40,000 employees coming on, which was about $100 million headwind, we are investing in fastest ground ever. I guess, what I would call your attention to, if you’re looking for margin progression and progress, we made an attentional decision as Carol mentioned to accelerate the vesting of some awards. And if you back that out, that was worth about 80 basis points. So, we would have actually generated positive leverage in Q4. So, as you think about that relationship, we would have seen positive leverage if we chose not to pull that forward. Hopefully, that answers.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes, got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nBrian Newman: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead, sir.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. Wanted to give you I guess another angle on the domestic package margin. Congratulations on the strong results as well I should say that first. How do you think about the, kind of, the factors that may be drive stronger or weaker performance in domestic package margin improvement as you kind of look on a – 2021? Is it how well B2B recovers? Is it’s kind of your cost initiatives and do we think about, kind of, a building as you look out in quarters and even look further out in the pace of margin improvement? So, I guess just a couple things, trying to get more of a sense, not a number. I know you don’t want to give that, but how we think about the levers and whether that improvement is something that accelerates maybe beyond the second quarter comment you gave?\nCarol Tome: Maybe, I will start Brian and then turn it to you. We look at Q4 as a turning point in our company where our revenue grew faster than our ADB and that was driven really by three factors in the U.S. We were – beat our U.S. expectations on the top line by nearly $850 million and it was driven by higher peak surcharges. It was driven by a change in mix as we called out with that increase in SMB, almost 29% and it was driven by the actions that we started last year to optimize our network all along the better not bigger framework and we think this has proved positive that better not bigger will work. And in the face of the demand capacity constraints, we believe that will continue. So, as we look forward to 2021, we expect our revenue to grow faster than our ADB, which provides leveraging opportunities, but it doesn’t stop at the top line. It also means continued productivity on the bottom line. So, Brian called out our actions to take out $500 million of costs. That’s cost being eliminated from our company and then we are driving productivity in our operations expense lines as well. So, it’s a combination of better revenue quality and productivity that will lead to margin expansion not just in 2021, but beyond. Now we’re going to lay this out for you in great detail at our Investor Conference in June. So, I hate to kick the can to June, but we’re going to kick the can to June a bit because we’ve got some more work to do. Brian, anything you want to add to that?\nBrian Newman: Just Tom, on the Q4 the inflection Carol referenced, I think, if you look back the last decade or so, we were – we are used to seeing peak in Q4 margins actually decelerate, go down from Q3. This was actually an inflection point where we actually saw an 8.6% go to an 8.8% on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis. So, I think the levers we’re pulling on revenue, the levers we’re pulling on cost that Carol referenced, we’re looking for the right glide path, but we’ll give you more clarity on that.\nTom Wadewitz: Great, thank you.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask you about the capital intensity of growth. I think Brian, you mentioned you’re looking at network design and expanding some capacities. So, maybe you can clarify if that’s in the U.S. Domestic or more broadly speaking across the whole network? And then, just when you think about automation, how much more investment do you think you need to do there to, to sort of get this sort of leverage that you’re talking about, if we still see a pretty big step up in B2C and e-commerce throughout the next year?\nCarol Tome: Well, I’ll talk – take the automation question. By the end of 2021, we expect that 88% of our packages will go through an automated assort. So, we’re reaching sort of where we wanted to be in that regard. That doesn’t though talk about robots and what we are doing with robot application inside of our domestic business. We’ve got some interesting pilots underway that are actually starting to take traction, particularly as it relates to label applications and we’ll be happy to share with you more information in that regard too. It’s pretty exciting when I think about what we can do from that perspective longer term. In terms of how we’re spending our capital this year, Brian, you might want to talk about that.\nBrian Newman: Sure. So, we’ve – we pivoted a little bit the buildings and auto piece is going to represent about $2 billion of the $4 billion. We do have about $1.6 billion of maintenance that we need to continue to invest in the business and we’re reserving the balance for growth. I think the shift towards higher return, we’re going for shorter-term paybacks in areas like international and healthcare and technology. Those are areas that we’re pivoting to, to generate capture the growth in high return areas.\nCarol Tome: Maybe a little bit more specificity here. We’ll expand or retrofit about 7 buildings in 2021, it’s about 2 million square feet that will be added, 130,000 packages per hour. We are adding 11 new aircraft, which will certainly help support the demand that we’re seeing outside of the United States. So, we’re planning to grow. So, we are planning to grow smartly. It’s about being better not bigger.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, ma’am.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good morning. So, just sort of wanted to ask another question about domestic revenues growing faster than volume, obviously you’re focusing on SMBs and other high-margin sectors. But how do we think about just broadly growth at the largest customers? Are you taking any specific actions, price or otherwise to materially reduce exposure to some of the low margin, but high-volume business? And then lastly, if you could just speak to your thoughts on the sustainability of the SMB growth rate? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: So, let’s just address the elephant in the room, which is our largest customer. We have over 19 million customers. Amazon is our largest customer, we enjoyed growth with that customer in 2020. If you look at total revenues for our company in ‘20, Amazon now makes up about 13.3% of our total revenues, up from 11.6% last year. But we had growth in other customers as well. As we look at our large enterprise customers, in the fourth quarter alone, we had enterprise customers, who were growing at 80% year-on-year. Full-year, we had enterprise customers, who were growing 100% year-on-year. So, we see growth across the board. To your question, Allison about the stickiness of the SMB customer, we are laser-focused here, because this is such an important customer to us and when we think values are end-to-end network. So, we have 16 customer journeys that we are investing into – to improve the customer experience. Now it started with our fastest ground ever initiative and we made good progress in that regard, but we are not done, we know there’s more we can do to invest in that – at that experience, because speed really matters for this customer, but it’s also about a frictionless digital experience. And I’ll just give you one example of our 16 customer journeys, that’s our billing system. If you look at our billing system for our SMB customers, compared to our competitors and if you did a Harvey ball comparison, you would see that many of our Harvey balls are empty, which means our capabilities are well at a competitive disadvantage. This is a system that was built by UPS years ago, god’s sake, I don’t know how long ago, but years ago. We are replacing that system with a new SaaS provided software application and when you do the capability comparison against what we will have against our competitors, lower best-in-class. That matters to this customer, because the billing system can be personalized for their experience and every SMB customer is different. Now we can’t have this in every country around the world, because some countries require paper still today, but in many countries, we can install this billing system and we believe that will result in stickiness, it’s also about the solutions that we provide. When we provide solutions to our customers, we see they stick with us. And the numbers are quite impressive in terms of the stickiness, if they have a solution and don’t have a solution. So, we continue to invest in that. And at our June 9th Investor Conference, we’re going to unpack this in pretty good detail for you, so you can get a sense of what we’re talking about. The one other data point that I will share with you is churn and I think we talked about churn on my first earnings call didn’t we. We’ve got laser focus on SMB churn. What we saw in December is our churn improved for the company year-over-year, the first month this year and we think that’s really in large part, because of the customer journeys we’re investing in and our fastest ground ever. And as a reminder, every point of churn improvement in the United States is about $170 million of revenue.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, ma’am.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just turning back to the commercial customer within that B2B segment, clearly the industrial production has been on a positive trend line. Is that something you’re seeing within your business as well? Any thoughts from your customers in that segment in terms of how they’re thinking about 2021, any color on that segment?\nCarol Tome: Well, to your point Allison, the trends are certainly encouraging in terms of what we’re seeing from a production perspective. Our largest commercial account is actually retail and it’s related to the stores and how product flows to stores. So, until we see more store openings, we think our commercial business could be under some pressure, but we did see some gross signs that Brian you called out some signs of growth, didn’t you?\nBrian Newman: Yes, we saw in the industrial side, Allison, that healthcare and auto were positive. Also, if we look internationally, we actually saw Asia and Europe contribute with a high-tech in international, in particular, we saw 2% positive B2B growth in the quarter in international, that was the first positive sign in 2020. So hopefully, the B2B translate about the same, down 8% in the U.S., but hopefully with – as the sectors come back and as Carol mentioned, as retail opens back up, we can grow that as well.\nCarol Tome: There is just still so much uncertainty isn’t there? Because until we get this pandemic under control, it’s a little bit walking [indiscernible]\nAllison Poliniak: I understood. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning and solid results. Just, Brian, can you clarify that margin comment? That was just domestic or were you talking overall? And then I guess my question would be on the $500 million transformation, is that the employee reductions that you’ve already done or are there other projects in the Transformation 2.0? I don’t know, if you also want to detail what was in the charges that you had this quarter? Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Yes. So on those two, Ken, the margin comment I was referring to was domestic, where we’re looking to expand that on a year-over-year basis and committing to do that. The Transformation 2.0, I called out $500 million of benefit in 2021, that’s related specifically to what we call Transformation 2.0, the non-operating spend. The gross number on it was actually $750 million. So, net of some investments, it was $500 million for the year. But please remember, when we talked about Transformation, this was a non-op initiative, we’re reducing our non-op spend by about 8%. So, that’s a good first step. We’re going to move into Transformation 3.0 and get after the operating cost inside the business, which is the next wave and I think we’ll provide more detail and clarity on that as we get to June.\nKen Hoexter: Just to clarify, so you’re commenting on domestic, but you’re not sending any target for international, right or would you commit to it being up as well?\nBrian Newman: So, from a margin perspective, my reference was that domestic would expand, we’re going to talk to you about the full-year margins when we get to June 9, Ken. So, there’s a lot of volatility going on right now, Asia, Europe, etcetera so, more clarity to come on that.\nCarol Tome: If you’re trying to build a model, I think we could help you if you’re trying to build a model that you should plan for operating profit to grow outside of the United States.\nKen Hoexter: Yes, yes.\nCarol Tome: The margin question is highly dependent on supply and demand and whether or not surcharges will be maintained. We are holding today. The question is, will they hold for the balance of the year? We’ll have much more clarity on that in June.\nKen Hoexter: Thank you, Carol, Brian. Appreciate the time.\nBrian Newman: Yes. Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Next up, we have David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning. A question for you on the topic around surcharges and holding your surcharges, as you’re looking out at renegotiating contracts and talking to your customers, given the tightness of last year’s market, can you give us some color on the receptivity of customers to be working with you either through taking rate increases or working to help drive efficiencies at the edges of the network that would help, kind of, make the customer base either a little bit stickier or more profitable as we get into ‘21 or ‘22?\nCarol Tome: We are very pleased with the relationships that we have with our good customers. This has been a challenging year for all of us. We have all exceeded this or enjoy this unprecedented demand, which is candidly pressure, but as we work through it, we’ve been able to land really I think very favorable contracts for us and for our customers. It’s really about optimizing the network, leaning into the customer segments that values our end-to-end network.\nDavid Vernon: And are those surcharges going to be re-based into today’s rates or how do we see that playing out?\nCarol Tome: The way you should think about it is very different than in the past. We’re moving to more personalized pricing.\nDavid Vernon: Thank you.\nCarol Tome: You’re welcome.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi, just a quick follow-up on some of the density and productivity around the domestic front. I know that may still be to come on transformation. But can you maybe talk a little bit assuming e-commerce obviously remains elevated, residential remains elevated. There are a couple things you could point to that may be improve like stops per house or improve that delivery density, which you mentioned was a financial impact in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, just a quick follow-up when you mentioned the financial outlook for the second – first quarter as being better than the second quarter, I’m assuming you’re talking about year-over-year profit growth on that front? Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Let me take the second. So yes, Jordan, you’re right. On a year-over-year profit growth, certainly the margins, we’re lapping lower domestic margins in the U.S. Those ramp up to about 9.3% in the second quarter. So, I was referring to – for profit growth on that.\nCarol Tome: If we look at our productivity results, I’m pleased with what I’m seeing in our feed, I’m pleased with what I’m seeing in our assort, I’m pleased with what I’ve seen in our hubs. I’m not pleased what I’ve seen in our pre-load and Nando and team are really looking at how they can drive productivity on pre-load and clearly, we’ve got some density opportunities. Now, we’ve been trying to drive synthetic density through our access points in our UPS Stores. We have 22,000 access points and you have UPS Stores that we are trying to utilize to drive delivery density. It’s not working, as well as we thought quite candidly. So, as a team we’ve taken this as a strategic imperative and we’re going to talk about other ideas we have to improve density, given that you can’t really change the demand pattern, but there are things that we can do internally we believe to drive productivity. So, more to come, this will certainly be something that we’ll be unpacking on June 9.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning. Carol, you said in your prepared remarks that you do not expect e-commerce of the percentage of retail sales decline in 2021. Can you just unpack that comment a little more for us? What are your large retail customers telling you if and when hopefully stores reopen again in a post-pandemic world back half of the year? Do they expect traffic to return to stores or not? And what does that do to your e-commerce volumes?\nCarol Tome: So, they are all hoping that their stores will reopen, because they’ve got a huge investment in that real estate, of course, but from a demand perspective, there is no one out there that thinks that demand is going to change. We are in a new normal. Even my relatives, who are older are shopping online, before they would never do that. So, they’re all telling us they don’t expect demand to go back. There has been a step change in the demand patterns, which then translates into capacity shortfall candidly. So, if you think about what happened in peak of this year, there was about a 3 million ADB shortfall in terms of the demand. And if you look forward into 2021, you would expect that shortfall to consist, which just gives us an opportunity to continue to optimize our network.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you.\nOperator: David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Ross: Yes, thank you very much. Carol just wanted to talk a little bit about the labor issues fourth quarter and the peak you guys handled exceedingly well and were able to demonstrate profitability. How much of a headwind was managing through this period of absences, rescheduling, pilots calling out sick, that kind of stuff that normally doesn’t happen during peak? You actually had a normal environment where somebody didn’t just call up and say, I am out for the next 2 weeks at last minute. How much would that have helped?\nCarol Tome: You’re right in that this is a very difficult environment, one that we’ve never been faced with before, but the team did a masterful job of managing through it. A few things were different than this peak than last peak. One was the use of PVDs or Personal Vehicle Drivers. We’ve used them in the past, but this year we really lean into it. So, in the United States, this year, we had 39,000 PVD drivers and they delivered 69 million packages. That we believe drove $92 million of benefit in the quarter. So, this is something that really worked very well and we’re going to lean into this as we think about peaks of the future. We were also able to use our dream tool, which is a dispatch tool to give our team store drivers, who worked so hard, give them some time with their families, which hasn’t been the case in prior season. So, we were happy to be able to deliver that. We were also pleased with our ability to redirect our SurePost volume back into our network. We saw in December alone 50% of the SurePost volume was redirected back into the network delivered by our UPS drivers. That resulted in productivity savings as well of about $44 million. Now, was there money left on the table? Sure. We had disruption with pilots in part of the world like Shanghai for sure, we had some money left on the table, but I would say, we had more good news than bad news coming out of the challenges in the fourth quarter.\nDavid Ross: That’s excellent, thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead, sir.\nBascome Majors: Yes. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Carol, you’ve made a lot of progress very fast here. One thing that comes to mind is dealing with organized labor, which really wasn’t an issue at your prior employer. I mean, you have a change in Washington that should be more labor sympathetic. You’re going to have a change at the head of the Teamsters Union this year. Can you talk about your strategy for that relationship and finding a happy medium that takes care of your employees, the union and your shareholders over the next 3 to 5 years?\nCarol Tome: Yes. Well, as you know, we employ more Teamsters than any other company and we love our Teamsters employees, so UPSers first, Teamsters, second. As we think about labor, our contract comes due in the United States, it comes due in 2023, and we think about mutually beneficial outcome for both our Teamsters and UPS, as we prepare for that contract, reviewing labor as a strategic imperative. We want to keep those jobs. We want to grow jobs. So, we’re going to be speaking with the union representation about how we do that going forward. We’re also candidly excited about what new administration could mean for pension reform and pension reform would be good for us and would be good for our Teamsters. So, we will continue to work that agenda, because we think it’s in the best interest of all parties.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Morning. So I want to ask on balance sheet cash flow. Carol, do you think this is the new, sort of, new normal for CapEx? How much do you want to improve the balance sheet before you start buying back stock? If you are – we are at this inflection in margins, why not buyback stock now and maybe just any thoughts around pension contributions for this year and pension impact? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Scott. Brian, why don’t you take that question?\nBrian Newman: Yes, I’m sure, Scott. So look, we’re focused on strengthening the balance sheet. I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about for modeling purposes assume no buybacks in 2021. We think by reinvesting in the business in areas that are driving higher cash returns, strengthening the balance sheet, Scott, we’ll end up with a one of Carol’s five imperatives, a strong credit rating as we go forward, which gives us optionality to evaluate opportunities organic and inorganic.\nCarol Tome: From my perspective, we have ample room to allocate capital back into the business and back to the shareholders. We just want to make sure that we generate the right return on that. And to your point – I haven’t been in the seat for that long, and it’s been, it’s a big company to try to get your hands around, but as we look at the opportunities to invest, we are going to have opportunities to invest. We just want to make sure that every dollar that we invest generates a higher return on capital. That’s our goal and the share buybacks will come. We thought for modeling purposes, it was just helpful to say no buybacks. If we change our mind on that, we’ll tell you what we’re doing and you can put it into your model.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks, good morning. Hey, Carol, a decisive move with the sale of UPS Freight, just wanted to hear in this forum, just some puts and takes in the decision making process. And then just to get a little more granularity. Could you discuss the UPS Freight around with freight pricing program where TFI will act as reseller? And then some thoughts on how the divestiture will impact TFI’s ability to serve the e-commerce market for heavier goods? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: So, the question was a bit muffled, but I think it was on UPS Freight and the rationale for the decision behind UPS Freight and then the go-forward commercial agreement. So, as I mentioned back in July, my first earnings call, other than our five core principles, everything in the business was under review and I immediately looked at UPS Freight. I was on the UPS Board for a long time, I went on the UPS Board in 2003. So, I was on the Board when we acquired overnight back in 2005. I have been laser-focused on this asset, because we had to impair it shortly after we bought it and it’s never turned out to be what we thought it would be. It’s a capital-intensive low margin business that we don’t need to own to offer this solution. So, we are like if we can get a price where this asset is worth more to someone else than it is to us, shouldn’t we move on that asset, but keep the commercial agreement, so that we can serve our customers and that’s where we landed. We couldn’t be happier with this announced acquisition that should close I think the beginning of the second quarter. I’m thrilled for our freight UPSers, because they’re going to be now part of a big freight company. So, from a career perspective, I think the opportunities for personal growth will be better for them. I’m thrilled for our shareowners and I’m thrilled for our customers, because the commercial agreement will be a great agreement and by the way there’s margin on that that’s going to flow to our U.S. small pack business as well. So, I think it’s a win-win-win. Anything else, Brian?\nBrian Newman: Yes, no, it’s – there is some CapEx avoidance on a low-margin business and we expect a positive improvement to our margins and ROIC, which our core focus. So, I think it’s a win-win.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Great, thank you. And just following up on that point, are there may be some other non-core businesses, Carol that maybe have come into the company through acquisitions over the last 10 or 15 years that could also be a target for potential divestitures or is it just sort of a one-off here with UPS Freight? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Well, Jack, as you can appreciate, it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to speculate on assets that might be available for sale, but everything is under review.\nOperator: Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, could we come back to the pension impact and how that’s positively impacting cash flows this year. And I’m not sure, but did you guys reserve another charge-off for Central States here too?\nBrian Newman: Yes. Brandon, so we had a $6.5 billion mark. There is actually a deck that will provide you the details on it, but the discount rate change, a little – was a little over $4 billion and in Central States, we took what we believe to be the last reserve for that which was a little over $2 billion. So, those were the two elements that made up the mark. In terms of headwinds for up on the service cost side, if that’s what you’re asking about, from a pension perspective, we have a similar headwind to what we had in 2020. It’s about $300 million related to service cost in the U.S. business.\nCarol Tome: And Brandon, we made some cash contributions in pension assets in 2020. We’re not planning that in 2021.\nBrian Newman: Right. So, we pulled forward, about $1.7 billion in contributions into December of 2020 and don’t anticipate having those in 2021, Carol.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Yes.\nOperator: David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Vernon: Hey guys. Thanks for coming back. Hey, Brian, I just wanted to clarify, the $500 million non-op expense reduction we’re expecting this year. That’s a net of cost to implement number? I mean, I just want to make sure there aren’t any other sort of non-typical inflationary cost that we should be kind of budgeting for or thinking about when we’re building an outlook here for 2021?\nBrian Newman: We’ve got – $750 million was the gross program. We reinvested to get to a net $500 million. We do have transformation charges associated with severance that will show up in the guidance that we give you.\nDavid Vernon : That will be adjusted out of results, right?\nBrian Newman: That will be non-core, so it will adjust it out and we’ll shine a light on that for you.\nDavid Vernon : I mean, and nothing like…\nBrian Newman: Sorry. But the return on those investments, are kind of 7 to 8 months. So, we are looking for better returns. I think you’ll find that the investment in the transformation charges is non-core are good paybacks.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then there is nothing like the investment in the speeding up the network, the faster ground network sort of stuff? Are we going to be recreating any of those sort of like operational investments in the ‘21 period?\nBrian Newman: No. So, it will be – the majority will be related to the Transformation 2.0 programs we talked to you about.\nDavid Vernon: Alright. Thanks again for the time.\nBrian Newman: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: We have Jairam of Daiwa. Please go ahead.\nJairam Nathan: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, I was just wanted to refer to your CapEx plan and you talked about 130,000 packages per hour increase that’s at a low at 29 million packages daily volume, it’s probably about 7%. And so – and then on top of that, you’ve got the revenue quality. So, is that kind of a run rate capacity increase we should expect and about maybe I don’t know, load – like close to double-digit increase in revenue that is possible that it’s a potential here longer term?\nCarol Tome: If you’re looking for a longer-term answer, we’re going to punt to June 9, because on June 9, we’re going to lay out our longer-term plan and we can answer that question in great detail.\nJairam Nathan: Okay. And just if I could follow up, you talked about the 3 million shortage at peak, how do you make sure that you don’t attract new in new and trends into the market with this strategy here? Like nature find always a way, I guess market also find a way somewhere.\nCarol Tome: So, there are a number of regional players. There are a number of new entrants that are coming in the market. Our job is to provide the best end-to-end experience, so the customers that we are bringing into our network are those customers, who value what we have to offer. In many ways, it’s about leaning into segments like healthcare, like SMBs and other high-growth areas that value our end-to-end network. And just on healthcare, if I could make a comment on vaccines, because we haven’t talked about it, but thought I just might sure what we’re doing in the vaccine solution here, as you know, it’s a complicated supply chain. There is upstream supply chain where the raw materials are delivered to the manufacturers. Then there is a place where we play, which is delivering vaccines from the manufacturers to the dosing locations. And then there’s the administration of the vaccines by the dosing locations. As it relates to the space that we play manufacturers to the dosing locations, we’ve delivered about 225,000 shipments, about 36.5 million vaccines at service levels at 99.99%. So, our healthcare logistics team is just doing a – just a really great job of moving these vaccines forward and couldn’t be more proud of that team.\nJairam Nathan: Okay, thank you. That’s all I had. Thank you.\nScott Childress: Well, Steven, thank you very much for hosting us and introducing. We appreciate all the comments we got and all the investors that joined us today. And that concludes the UPS fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover four areas: starting with high level macroeconomic trends; then the results for each of our business segments; next, I'll review full year cash and shareowner returns; and lastly, I'll wrap up with some color on our 2021 outlook, including full-year guidance for capital allocation. Let's start with the macro, which can be best described as dynamic and has created both opportunities and obstacles pushing business activity in multiple directions. Global GDP for the fourth quarter is expected to finish down 1.7%, a slight improvement versus the third quarter. In the U.S., reported consumer sentiment in December was 80.7, up 3.8 points from November and consumers continued to shop online with year-over-year growth for non-store retail sales, up 24.3% to finish at 20.9% of all U.S. retail sales in the fourth quarter. On the commercial side of the U.S. economy, growth in industrial production during the fourth quarter remained negative at minus 4.7% year-over-year, but improved 180 basis points from the third quarter. Overall, macro conditions are weak. However, the shift in buying patterns generated elevated residential demand. Moving to performance, for the quarter, consolidated revenue, profit and EPS were all up more than 20%. UPS consolidated revenue increased 21% to $24.9 billion and operating profit totaled $2.9 billion, 26% higher than last year. The operating margin for the company expanded to 11.5%, which was 40 basis points above last year and diluted earnings per share was $2.66, up 26.1% from the same period last year. Our strong fourth quarter financial results provide a glimpse into our strategic progress and what is possible. Moving into the segments, in U.S. domestic, our success was driven by our revenue quality efforts and a disciplined approach to executing our peak plans. As expected, average daily volume increased 8.9% year-over-year to a total of 25.2 million packages per day. More importantly, customer mix improved, SMB volume growth accelerated 980 basis points sequentially, going from 18.7% growth in the third quarter to 28.5% in the fourth. Both SMBs and our larger customers grew residential shipments across air and ground products. Overall, B2C shipments increased 19.9% year-over-year and represented 67% of total volume. Conversely, both SMBs and large customers shipped fewer B2B packages on a year-over-year basis. B2B average daily volume finished down 8.3%. Healthcare and automotive were bright spots and delivered single-digit B2B growth. However, they were unable to offset weakness in retail and high-tech. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated its highest ever quarterly revenue, up 17.4% to $15.7 billion, driven by growth in ground products. We are extremely pleased with our revenue quality efforts, which were well above our expectations. More specifically, SMB growth accelerated and we had higher-than-anticipated peak season surcharge revenue. As a result, reported revenue per piece grew 7.8% year-over-year with ground revenue per piece, up 11.2%. Turning to costs, expenses were up 17.7% over the fourth quarter of last year and cost per piece was up 8.2%. Our expenses grew faster than revenue, due to several factors: first, in 2019, we had $150 million in expense reductions from alternative fuel tax credits and lower management incentives that did not repeat; second, total delivery stops increased by 15.7%, due to high growth in single piece shipments and lower delivery density increased cost by $185 million; third, in the quarter, we had higher benefit expenses of $100 million related to the employees hired early in 2020; and finally, as Carol mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we elected to accelerate the vesting of certain previous compensation awards, a one-time expense impact of $129 million. If you ignore the impact of the accelerated vesting of awards, we would have leveraged expense in the quarter. When we look specifically at our peak period, despite the complexities, our operators and engineers executed extremely well. Together, with the sales teams, we controlled volume that entered the network avoiding chaos costs, while delivering best-in-class service. As one example, over time hours in our operations in December went down 7.7%, compared to last year. Pulling it all together, in the fourth quarter, the U.S. generated $1.4 billion in operating profit, an increase of 14.3%, compared to last year. Moving to international, the segment delivered another quarter of record operating profit. We exceeded our volume expectation with total average daily volume, up 21.9%, driven by export and domestic volume growth in all regions. We added 365 flights above our normal schedules to support high market demand for our export services. In fact, total exports grew 27.8% on a year-over-year basis, led by Asia exports, up 45% and Europe exports, up 30.7%. B2C average daily volume grew 104.1%, while B2B was up 2%, the first quarterly B2B growth in 2020. For the quarter, international revenue was up 26.8% to $4.8 billion. Revenue per piece was up 3.8% and cost per piece was, up 0.3% year-over-year, which generated positive operating leverage in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, International delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion, an increase of 43.4% and operating margin expanded 280 basis points to 24.3%. Operating profit and margin are both record highs for the segment. Looking at supply chain and freight, the segment results were excellent, with revenue, up 29% to $4.4 billion. Strong market demand drove revenue and profit growth in almost all business units. Forwarding had another great quarter, led by elevated demand out of Asia. Our LTL business grew operating profit by focusing on revenue quality efforts and healthcare had its best quarterly top line and bottom line growth ever, driven by outbound direct-to-patient shipments, all while providing near-perfect service in late December for COVID-19 vaccine deliveries. Overall in supply chain and freight, operating profit was $331 million, an increase of 26.3% year-over-year. Walking down our income statement, we had $175 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $327 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 23.2%. Now, let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. Our cash flow was strong throughout the year. We generated $10.5 billion in cash from operations, which included a benefit of $1.1 billion related to the CARES Act federal payroll tax deferral offset by pension contributions, totaling $3.1 billion. Capital investments totaled $5.6 billion, which includes 16 new aircraft; 16,000 new vehicles; and 18 facilities added to our Smart Global Logistics Network. All of which resulted in free cash flow for 2020 of $5.1 billion. In 2020, UPS distributed $3.6 billion in dividends, which represents a 5.2% increase on a per share basis over 2019. Moving to our outlook for 2021, as Carol mentioned, due to the continuing economic uncertainty, we are not providing revenue or diluted earnings per share guidance at this time. But I do want to give you some color as you think about 2021. First, let me update you on what we have been calling Transformation 2.0. Through a combination of various programs, we plan to reduce our non-operating expenses by more than $500 million in 2021. As Carol mentioned, we are focused on creating fewer, but more impactful jobs; second, we expect the sale of UPS Freight will close during the second quarter of 2021. So, you will want to adjust your models accordingly; third, we are gaining traction on our revenue quality initiatives. As a result, we would expect our small package revenue in 2021 to grow faster than our average daily volume. As we further evaluate the year, one of our wildly important initiatives is to review our network design and look at alternatives for how we expand capacity. And finally, because of our revenue quality initiatives, along with our actions to drive higher levels of productivity and take costs out, we expect operating margin and return on invested capital to expand. And just to comment on the first half of the year, we will face more difficult comps in the second quarter of 2021 than in the first quarter. As a result, we anticipate much stronger year-over-year financial results in the first quarter relative to the second quarter. While it is early in the quarter now, we are pleased with how the year has begun. Looking at full year capital allocation in 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion with 40% allocated to maintenance CapEx, 50% for both technology initiatives and network capabilities in 2021 with over half of this investment being deployed to international and healthcare. And the remaining 10% for growth projects that will come online after 2021. Dividends are expected to grow subject to Board approval. And to further strengthen the balance sheet, we will payoff $2.5 billion of funded debt. We have no plans to repurchase shares or access the debt capital markets. And lastly, our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5%. Before I wrap up, I would like to confirm that we will host an Investor Meeting on June 9th, where we will share multi-year financial targets and our specific plans for how we will achieve those targets. In closing, we are laser focused on executing our strategy and leaning into the best market opportunities to improve the financial performance of the company, provide the best customer experience and benefit our shareowners. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines. Yes, Amit, happy to take that. So, from a yield perspective, very happy with the progress, particularly in the U.S. business, we went from Q2 yield was minus 4%, 4.4%, we are flat in Q3 and up 7.8% in Q4. So, I think you've heard us talk about the revenue quality actions we've been implementing. It's a combination of mix; it's a combination of surcharges and customer actions. So, I think the progress speaks for itself. In terms of op margins for 2021, as I mentioned, we're committed to expanding our domestic op margin in the year. I won't get into Q1 versus Q2. We'll certainly give you some more guidance and clarity when we get together in June to talk about the second half of the year. But suffice it to say, the combination of revenue quality and cost actions will expand domestic margins in year. Yes. Amit, I think we talked on the last quarter about some of the headwinds we are walking into in the fourth quarter of ‘20. We had 40,000 employees coming on, which was about $100 million headwind, we are investing in fastest ground ever. I guess, what I would call your attention to, if you're looking for margin progression and progress, we made an attentional decision as Carol mentioned to accelerate the vesting of some awards. And if you back that out, that was worth about 80 basis points. So, we would have actually generated positive leverage in Q4. So, as you think about that relationship, we would have seen positive leverage if we chose not to pull that forward. Hopefully, that answers. Yes. Just Tom, on the Q4 the inflection Carol referenced, I think, if you look back the last decade or so, we were – we are used to seeing peak in Q4 margins actually decelerate, go down from Q3. This was actually an inflection point where we actually saw an 8.6% go to an 8.8% on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis. So, I think the levers we're pulling on revenue, the levers we're pulling on cost that Carol referenced, we're looking for the right glide path, but we'll give you more clarity on that. Sure. So, we've – we pivoted a little bit the buildings and auto piece is going to represent about $2 billion of the $4 billion. We do have about $1.6 billion of maintenance that we need to continue to invest in the business and we're reserving the balance for growth. I think the shift towards higher return, we're going for shorter-term paybacks in areas like international and healthcare and technology. Those are areas that we're pivoting to, to generate capture the growth in high return areas. Yes, we saw in the industrial side, Allison, that healthcare and auto were positive. Also, if we look internationally, we actually saw Asia and Europe contribute with a high-tech in international, in particular, we saw 2% positive B2B growth in the quarter in international, that was the first positive sign in 2020. So hopefully, the B2B translate about the same, down 8% in the U.S., but hopefully with – as the sectors come back and as Carol mentioned, as retail opens back up, we can grow that as well. Yes. So on those two, Ken, the margin comment I was referring to was domestic, where we're looking to expand that on a year-over-year basis and committing to do that. The Transformation 2.0, I called out $500 million of benefit in 2021, that's related specifically to what we call Transformation 2.0, the non-operating spend. The gross number on it was actually $750 million. So, net of some investments, it was $500 million for the year. But please remember, when we talked about Transformation, this was a non-op initiative, we're reducing our non-op spend by about 8%. So, that's a good first step. We're going to move into Transformation 3.0 and get after the operating cost inside the business, which is the next wave and I think we'll provide more detail and clarity on that as we get to June. So, from a margin perspective, my reference was that domestic would expand, we're going to talk to you about the full-year margins when we get to June 9, Ken. So, there's a lot of volatility going on right now, Asia, Europe, etcetera so, more clarity to come on that. Yes. Thanks, Ken. Let me take the second. So yes, Jordan, you're right. On a year-over-year profit growth, certainly the margins, we're lapping lower domestic margins in the U.S. Those ramp up to about 9.3% in the second quarter. So, I was referring to – for profit growth on that. Yes, I'm sure, Scott. So look, we're focused on strengthening the balance sheet. I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about for modeling purposes assume no buybacks in 2021. We think by reinvesting in the business in areas that are driving higher cash returns, strengthening the balance sheet, Scott, we'll end up with a one of Carol's five imperatives, a strong credit rating as we go forward, which gives us optionality to evaluate opportunities organic and inorganic. Yes, no, it's – there is some CapEx avoidance on a low-margin business and we expect a positive improvement to our margins and ROIC, which our core focus. So, I think it's a win-win. Yes. Brandon, so we had a $6.5 billion mark. There is actually a deck that will provide you the details on it, but the discount rate change, a little – was a little over $4 billion and in Central States, we took what we believe to be the last reserve for that which was a little over $2 billion. So, those were the two elements that made up the mark. In terms of headwinds for up on the service cost side, if that's what you're asking about, from a pension perspective, we have a similar headwind to what we had in 2020. It's about $300 million related to service cost in the U.S. business. Right. So, we pulled forward, about $1.7 billion in contributions into December of 2020 and don't anticipate having those in 2021, Carol. Yes. We've got – $750 million was the gross program. We reinvested to get to a net $500 million. We do have transformation charges associated with severance that will show up in the guidance that we give you. That will be non-core, so it will adjust it out and we'll shine a light on that for you. Sorry. But the return on those investments, are kind of 7 to 8 months. So, we are looking for better returns. I think you'll find that the investment in the transformation charges is non-core are good paybacks. No. So, it will be – the majority will be related to the Transformation 2.0 programs we talked to you about. Yes, thanks."

            "name": "Carol Tome",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. We have a lot to cover with you this morning. We were very busy in the fourth quarter. I will review our peak season and then provide an update on our strategic progress. Brian will cover the financial details for the quarter and then finish with an outlook for 2021. Let me begin with a huge thank you to our more than 540,000 UPSers for not only delivering one of the best peaks in our Company history, but also for their extraordinary efforts throughout 2020. UPSers are essential workers and I could not be more proud of the team. In a year unlike any other, they delivered what matters. Looking at the fourth quarter, our results were strong and considerably better than we expected. Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 21% from last year to $24.9 billion and operating profit grew 26% from last year to $2.9 billion. This is the highest quarterly operating profit in the Company's history with record profit produced in each segment. For the year, UPS generated record revenue of $84.6 billion with growth in all three segments. We increased operating profit by 7% to $8.7 billion and we generated diluted earnings per share of $8.23, an increase of 9.3%. Turning back to the fourth quarter, let me address our holiday peak performance. The environment was very dynamic, largely due to market demand exceeding market supply, but we were ready. Our early collaboration with customers and a disciplined approach to executing our peak plans proved to be very successful. We delivered industry leading service levels, which in turn accelerated new customer requests for our services. As peak holiday approached, we saw SMBs, our small and medium-sized businesses increasingly turn to UPS. In the U.S., in the fourth quarter, SMB volume grew 28.5%, outpacing our larger customers, which grew by 4%. By running the network with more discipline and through the deployment of new tools, we reduced what we refer to as chaos costs, or costs associated with bottlenecks and over time pay. Additionally, SurePost redirect reached a new record in December. Nearly 50% of SurePost volume was delivered by UPS drivers, optimizing our network. And just a comment about peak outside of the U.S., it was a very peaky peak with the highest volume in our history, delivered with excellent service levels. And while this peak was one of our best, we know that we can do even better. We have identified additional areas for improvement and are including them in our peak 2021 planning. During the height of the peak season, the FDA and other health authorities approved the use of COVID-19 vaccines. We were ready for this, as we have reserve capacity in our network. We have been in the healthcare logistics business for more than 15-years. Our expertise in cold chain logistics positions us well and thus far, we have provided above 99% service for vaccine delivery. Looking back to 2020, we laid a strong foundation for future success. On my first earnings call in July, I mentioned that we were operationalizing our strategy; customer first, people led, innovation-driven, through a better not bigger framework. We are making solid progress. From a customer first perspective, speed and enabling capabilities are very important. Our goal is to provide the best digital experience powered by our smart global logistics network and we're targeting our solutions to high-yielding sectors like SMBs, among others. We've moved the needle on speed. For the year, weekend ground volume was, up 93.9% over last year. And SMB volume on our fastest ground ever lanes grew by 40% in the fourth quarter since we improved these lanes. We now have more than 700,000 accounts in DAP, which is our digital access program and revenue from that program grew more than 360% in 2020. We expect our DAP revenues to reach $1 billion in 2021. People-led focuses on building a better workplace for our people. Over the past several months, we've addressed some of the pain points here and early feedback has been very positive. In fact, we have seen a 13 percentage point improvement in likelihood to recommend, the primary metric we use to measure progress on our people led initiative. As Brian will detail, during the quarter, we accelerated certain annual bonus awards that were paying out over 5 years. Going forward, our annual management incentive plan will pay out in one year and will include targets for return on invested capital. Further, we are simplifying our sales incentive programs and incorporating profitability targets into those programs. These changes better align employee performance to the interests of all shareowners. People led also means creating fewer, but more impactful jobs and lowering our non-operating costs. Brian will provide you with an update on our transformation activities. Innovation-driven means driving higher returns on the capital we deploy using new tools, processes and technologies. Driving higher returns starts by improving our revenue quality and here our efforts are working. In the fourth quarter, U.S. domestic revenue per piece was up 7.8%, the highest growth we've seen in more than 10-years. While this year-over-year growth rate reflects peak surcharges, it also reflects a change in mix, as SMBs accounted for 64% of U.S. average daily volume growth in the quarter. We also saw solid SMB volume growth outside of the U.S. Lastly we have tightened the linkage between our investments and returns. As I mentioned back in July, with the exception of our five core principles, everything else is under review. Last week, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell UPS Freight, our LTL business unit. UPS Freight is a capital-intensive low returning business. We do not need to own this business to provide an LTL solution for our customers. With the disposition of UPS Freight, we will be smaller, but we will be better, as without it, we will see an improvement in our operating margins and return on invested capital. Being better not bigger also means de-risking our balance sheet. We will use the proceeds from the sale of UPS Freight to pay down long-term debt. Looking ahead, uncertainty remains. While we are optimistic about the future, we don't know the pace of the vaccine rollout or the impact that a continuing pandemic will have on the global economy. On the other hand, we don't think e-commerce sales as a percentage of retail sales will decline, which means continued supply and demand imbalances. This scenario supports our efforts to improve revenue quality, while optimizing our existing network. These efforts coupled with a relentless focus on productivity and effective capital allocation should result in both operating margin expansion and higher return on invested capital in 2021. But until we have more certainty with the economic environment, we are not providing revenue or earnings per share guidance. Let me close with a note of reflection. I have been in the CEO chair since June 1 and has been an honor and a privilege to serve especially this year, a year the world won't forget. UPS is a purpose-driven company with a proud past and an even brighter future. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Maybe, I will start Brian and then turn it to you. We look at Q4 as a turning point in our company where our revenue grew faster than our ADB and that was driven really by three factors in the U.S. We were – beat our U.S. expectations on the top line by nearly $850 million and it was driven by higher peak surcharges. It was driven by a change in mix as we called out with that increase in SMB, almost 29% and it was driven by the actions that we started last year to optimize our network all along the better not bigger framework and we think this has proved positive that better not bigger will work. And in the face of the demand capacity constraints, we believe that will continue. So, as we look forward to 2021, we expect our revenue to grow faster than our ADB, which provides leveraging opportunities, but it doesn't stop at the top line. It also means continued productivity on the bottom line. So, Brian called out our actions to take out $500 million of costs. That's cost being eliminated from our company and then we are driving productivity in our operations expense lines as well. So, it's a combination of better revenue quality and productivity that will lead to margin expansion not just in 2021, but beyond. Now we're going to lay this out for you in great detail at our Investor Conference in June. So, I hate to kick the can to June, but we're going to kick the can to June a bit because we've got some more work to do. Brian, anything you want to add to that? Thank you. Well, I'll talk – take the automation question. By the end of 2021, we expect that 88% of our packages will go through an automated assort. So, we're reaching sort of where we wanted to be in that regard. That doesn't though talk about robots and what we are doing with robot application inside of our domestic business. We've got some interesting pilots underway that are actually starting to take traction, particularly as it relates to label applications and we'll be happy to share with you more information in that regard too. It's pretty exciting when I think about what we can do from that perspective longer term. In terms of how we're spending our capital this year, Brian, you might want to talk about that. Maybe a little bit more specificity here. We'll expand or retrofit about 7 buildings in 2021, it's about 2 million square feet that will be added, 130,000 packages per hour. We are adding 11 new aircraft, which will certainly help support the demand that we're seeing outside of the United States. So, we're planning to grow. So, we are planning to grow smartly. It's about being better not bigger. So, let's just address the elephant in the room, which is our largest customer. We have over 19 million customers. Amazon is our largest customer, we enjoyed growth with that customer in 2020. If you look at total revenues for our company in ‘20, Amazon now makes up about 13.3% of our total revenues, up from 11.6% last year. But we had growth in other customers as well. As we look at our large enterprise customers, in the fourth quarter alone, we had enterprise customers, who were growing at 80% year-on-year. Full-year, we had enterprise customers, who were growing 100% year-on-year. So, we see growth across the board. To your question, Allison about the stickiness of the SMB customer, we are laser-focused here, because this is such an important customer to us and when we think values are end-to-end network. So, we have 16 customer journeys that we are investing into – to improve the customer experience. Now it started with our fastest ground ever initiative and we made good progress in that regard, but we are not done, we know there's more we can do to invest in that – at that experience, because speed really matters for this customer, but it's also about a frictionless digital experience. And I'll just give you one example of our 16 customer journeys, that's our billing system. If you look at our billing system for our SMB customers, compared to our competitors and if you did a Harvey ball comparison, you would see that many of our Harvey balls are empty, which means our capabilities are well at a competitive disadvantage. This is a system that was built by UPS years ago, god's sake, I don't know how long ago, but years ago. We are replacing that system with a new SaaS provided software application and when you do the capability comparison against what we will have against our competitors, lower best-in-class. That matters to this customer, because the billing system can be personalized for their experience and every SMB customer is different. Now we can't have this in every country around the world, because some countries require paper still today, but in many countries, we can install this billing system and we believe that will result in stickiness, it's also about the solutions that we provide. When we provide solutions to our customers, we see they stick with us. And the numbers are quite impressive in terms of the stickiness, if they have a solution and don't have a solution. So, we continue to invest in that. And at our June 9th Investor Conference, we're going to unpack this in pretty good detail for you, so you can get a sense of what we're talking about. The one other data point that I will share with you is churn and I think we talked about churn on my first earnings call didn't we. We've got laser focus on SMB churn. What we saw in December is our churn improved for the company year-over-year, the first month this year and we think that's really in large part, because of the customer journeys we're investing in and our fastest ground ever. And as a reminder, every point of churn improvement in the United States is about $170 million of revenue. Well, to your point Allison, the trends are certainly encouraging in terms of what we're seeing from a production perspective. Our largest commercial account is actually retail and it's related to the stores and how product flows to stores. So, until we see more store openings, we think our commercial business could be under some pressure, but we did see some gross signs that Brian you called out some signs of growth, didn't you? There is just still so much uncertainty isn't there? Because until we get this pandemic under control, it's a little bit walking [indiscernible] Thank you. If you're trying to build a model, I think we could help you if you're trying to build a model that you should plan for operating profit to grow outside of the United States. The margin question is highly dependent on supply and demand and whether or not surcharges will be maintained. We are holding today. The question is, will they hold for the balance of the year? We'll have much more clarity on that in June. We are very pleased with the relationships that we have with our good customers. This has been a challenging year for all of us. We have all exceeded this or enjoy this unprecedented demand, which is candidly pressure, but as we work through it, we've been able to land really I think very favorable contracts for us and for our customers. It's really about optimizing the network, leaning into the customer segments that values our end-to-end network. The way you should think about it is very different than in the past. We're moving to more personalized pricing. You're welcome. If we look at our productivity results, I'm pleased with what I'm seeing in our feed, I'm pleased with what I'm seeing in our assort, I'm pleased with what I've seen in our hubs. I'm not pleased what I've seen in our pre-load and Nando and team are really looking at how they can drive productivity on pre-load and clearly, we've got some density opportunities. Now, we've been trying to drive synthetic density through our access points in our UPS Stores. We have 22,000 access points and you have UPS Stores that we are trying to utilize to drive delivery density. It's not working, as well as we thought quite candidly. So, as a team we've taken this as a strategic imperative and we're going to talk about other ideas we have to improve density, given that you can't really change the demand pattern, but there are things that we can do internally we believe to drive productivity. So, more to come, this will certainly be something that we'll be unpacking on June 9. So, they are all hoping that their stores will reopen, because they've got a huge investment in that real estate, of course, but from a demand perspective, there is no one out there that thinks that demand is going to change. We are in a new normal. Even my relatives, who are older are shopping online, before they would never do that. So, they're all telling us they don't expect demand to go back. There has been a step change in the demand patterns, which then translates into capacity shortfall candidly. So, if you think about what happened in peak of this year, there was about a 3 million ADB shortfall in terms of the demand. And if you look forward into 2021, you would expect that shortfall to consist, which just gives us an opportunity to continue to optimize our network. You're right in that this is a very difficult environment, one that we've never been faced with before, but the team did a masterful job of managing through it. A few things were different than this peak than last peak. One was the use of PVDs or Personal Vehicle Drivers. We've used them in the past, but this year we really lean into it. So, in the United States, this year, we had 39,000 PVD drivers and they delivered 69 million packages. That we believe drove $92 million of benefit in the quarter. So, this is something that really worked very well and we're going to lean into this as we think about peaks of the future. We were also able to use our dream tool, which is a dispatch tool to give our team store drivers, who worked so hard, give them some time with their families, which hasn't been the case in prior season. So, we were happy to be able to deliver that. We were also pleased with our ability to redirect our SurePost volume back into our network. We saw in December alone 50% of the SurePost volume was redirected back into the network delivered by our UPS drivers. That resulted in productivity savings as well of about $44 million. Now, was there money left on the table? Sure. We had disruption with pilots in part of the world like Shanghai for sure, we had some money left on the table, but I would say, we had more good news than bad news coming out of the challenges in the fourth quarter. Yes. Yes. Well, as you know, we employ more Teamsters than any other company and we love our Teamsters employees, so UPSers first, Teamsters, second. As we think about labor, our contract comes due in the United States, it comes due in 2023, and we think about mutually beneficial outcome for both our Teamsters and UPS, as we prepare for that contract, reviewing labor as a strategic imperative. We want to keep those jobs. We want to grow jobs. So, we're going to be speaking with the union representation about how we do that going forward. We're also candidly excited about what new administration could mean for pension reform and pension reform would be good for us and would be good for our Teamsters. So, we will continue to work that agenda, because we think it's in the best interest of all parties. Yes. Thank you, Scott. Brian, why don't you take that question? From my perspective, we have ample room to allocate capital back into the business and back to the shareholders. We just want to make sure that we generate the right return on that. And to your point – I haven't been in the seat for that long, and it's been, it's a big company to try to get your hands around, but as we look at the opportunities to invest, we are going to have opportunities to invest. We just want to make sure that every dollar that we invest generates a higher return on capital. That's our goal and the share buybacks will come. We thought for modeling purposes, it was just helpful to say no buybacks. If we change our mind on that, we'll tell you what we're doing and you can put it into your model. So, the question was a bit muffled, but I think it was on UPS Freight and the rationale for the decision behind UPS Freight and then the go-forward commercial agreement. So, as I mentioned back in July, my first earnings call, other than our five core principles, everything in the business was under review and I immediately looked at UPS Freight. I was on the UPS Board for a long time, I went on the UPS Board in 2003. So, I was on the Board when we acquired overnight back in 2005. I have been laser-focused on this asset, because we had to impair it shortly after we bought it and it's never turned out to be what we thought it would be. It's a capital-intensive low margin business that we don't need to own to offer this solution. So, we are like if we can get a price where this asset is worth more to someone else than it is to us, shouldn't we move on that asset, but keep the commercial agreement, so that we can serve our customers and that's where we landed. We couldn't be happier with this announced acquisition that should close I think the beginning of the second quarter. I'm thrilled for our freight UPSers, because they're going to be now part of a big freight company. So, from a career perspective, I think the opportunities for personal growth will be better for them. I'm thrilled for our shareowners and I'm thrilled for our customers, because the commercial agreement will be a great agreement and by the way there's margin on that that's going to flow to our U.S. small pack business as well. So, I think it's a win-win-win. Anything else, Brian? Well, Jack, as you can appreciate, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to speculate on assets that might be available for sale, but everything is under review. And Brandon, we made some cash contributions in pension assets in 2020. We're not planning that in 2021. If you're looking for a longer-term answer, we're going to punt to June 9, because on June 9, we're going to lay out our longer-term plan and we can answer that question in great detail. So, there are a number of regional players. There are a number of new entrants that are coming in the market. Our job is to provide the best end-to-end experience, so the customers that we are bringing into our network are those customers, who value what we have to offer. In many ways, it's about leaning into segments like healthcare, like SMBs and other high-growth areas that value our end-to-end network. And just on healthcare, if I could make a comment on vaccines, because we haven't talked about it, but thought I just might sure what we're doing in the vaccine solution here, as you know, it's a complicated supply chain. There is upstream supply chain where the raw materials are delivered to the manufacturers. Then there is a place where we play, which is delivering vaccines from the manufacturers to the dosing locations. And then there's the administration of the vaccines by the dosing locations. As it relates to the space that we play manufacturers to the dosing locations, we've delivered about 225,000 shipments, about 36.5 million vaccines at service levels at 99.99%. So, our healthcare logistics team is just doing a – just a really great job of moving these vaccines forward and couldn't be more proud of that team."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Steven. I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours. \nScott Childress: Good morning and welcome to the UPS third quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance for operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainty, which are described in detail in our 2019 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. During the quarter, GAAP results included a pretax charge of $44 million, equivalent to $0.04 on an earnings per share basis. The charge resulted from transformation-related activities, primarily in the International and U.S. Domestic segments. In the prior year period, GAAP results included a pretax charge for transformation cost of $63 million, equivalent to $0.06 on diluted earnings per share. Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which excludes transformation cost. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Please ask only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now, I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you, Scott. We are moving quickly and operationalizing our strategy under the better, not bigger framework. We're leaning in on the wildly important areas of our business and tackling challenges head on. This morning, I'm pleased to discuss our achievements and the opportunities we see before us. One thing is certain, everything we accomplish is the result of our winning people and culture. We have everyday heroes at UPS, who are keeping the world supply chains moving and delivering what matters, from essential household items to critical healthcare needs, UPSers are making a positive difference in the world. And for that, I am so very proud of this team and want to thank them for their hard work and efforts. During the quarter, we continued to flex our network to capture market opportunities and better position UPS for the long term. Our performance was better than we expected even amid the challenges from the pandemic. Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 15.9% from last year to $21.2 billion and operating profit grew 9.9% from last year to $2.4 billion. While our commercial business remained under pressure due to the economic downturn, during the quarter we began to optimize our network and captured share in SMB or small and medium-sized businesses. As a result, we saw revenue per piece improved sequentially in the U.S. from what we reported in the first two quarters of this year. Further, revenue growth in our International and Supply Chain and Freight segments was the highest quarterly growth we've seen in nearly three years. Brian will share more details about the quarter in a moment. Over the past few months, we've intensified the focus on executing our strategy: customer first, people led, innovation driven. From a customer-first perspective, there has been a step change in the composition of retail sales, as e-commerce sales are now projected to make up more than 20% of all U.S. retail sales this year. We don't think the penetration of e-commerce retail sales will decline, even after the pandemic, but it isn't just retail. Our customers across all business segments are reinventing the ways they do business. We've heard from customers that speed and ease are most important, so we are focused on delivering the capabilities that matter most to our customers. Let's start with speed. In the U.S. we completed our weekend expansion ahead of schedule, enabling broader market coverage, as we are the only carrier that provides both commercial and residential pickup and delivery services on Saturdays as a general service offering. And next week, we will complete our Fastest Ground Ever initiative eight months ahead of plan. We have improved ground transit times between millions of ZIP codes and we will be at parity or better than the competition in 20 of the 25 most populated U.S. markets and customers have noticed. Weekend ground volume is up 161% versus last year. And SMB volume on our Fastest Ground Ever lanes has grown 25.7% since we made the improvement. Moving to ease. It's all about removing friction from the customer experience and serving customers the way they want to be served. For SMBs, we are highly focused on our Digital Access Program, which we refer to as DAP. Through platform partnerships, we are making it easier for SMBs to open a UPS account and access the world's largest small package network. Revenue growth from our DAP program exceeded our expectations, as we added 150,000 new accounts and several new partners in the quarter. Our fastest ground ever weekend services and DAP complement each other enabling our customers to deliver what matters to their customers, speed and a better experience. Our efforts in the United States are having a positive impact. In the third quarter, total U.S. SMB volume grew 18.7%, outpacing our larger customers and was the highest growth rate we've experienced with SMBs in 16 years. We are seeing strong results in the International segment too with international SMB volume up 9.9% during the quarter. Another area that we are leaning into is healthcare logistics. UPS Healthcare spans all reporting segments has world-class technology deep expertise and the most sophisticated suite of services in the industry. We are significantly expanding our freezer farm capacity by installing validated freezers that range from negative 20 to negative 80 degrees Celsius. These farms are strategically located in Louisville Kentucky and Venlo The Netherlands and are good distribution practice certified. And for added control during transit, UPS Premier our next-generation package sensor technology offers priority handling, real-time monitoring, and continuous visibility. We understand that healthcare logistics isn't just about the package. It's about the patient. Our mark in healthcare team is supporting clinical trials across all stages for COVID-19 vaccines. Early involvement gives us valuable data and insights to design commercial distribution plans and manage the logistics for these complex products. We have a great opportunity, and frankly a great responsibility to serve the world when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. When that time comes, our global network, cold chain solutions and our people will be ready. Moving to the second element of our strategy people-led. We know successful outcomes are built from a strong culture of teamwork respect, trust and empowerment. We are enabling our people to move the business forward by giving them more decision-making authority and we're identifying, which activities add value and stopping those that don't. We are also investing in training on topics including unconscious bias and diversity and inclusion, to ensure our actions match our values. In the past, we have talked to you about Transformation 1.0. We are on track to deliver the more than $1 billion of benefit we identified when we kicked it off in 2018. In September of this year, we began Transformation 2.0 by announcing a voluntary separation allowance program. To the UPSers, who will take this offer, I thank you for your service to our company. Transformation 2.0 is about creating fewer, but more impactful jobs. We will share more details with you as we finalize our plan. The final piece of our strategy innovation-driven comes down to being better not bigger. Now that doesn't mean UPS is not going to grow because we are. It means that we will lean into growth from the right opportunities like SMBs, international, global freight forwarding, and other high-yielding sectors, and we will grow from our revenue quality initiatives. We are on a journey to optimize the volume that flows through our network. Additionally, our approach calls for greater efficiency and requires that we lower our cost to serve. Our transformation efforts are vitally important to our ongoing success. While we are finishing Transformation 1.0, we've already begun Transformation 2.0 and we are road mapping Transformation 3.0 in preparation to launch next year. Transformation 3.0 will focus on decreasing core operating expense. Further to improve our return on invested capital, we are applying greater scrutiny to capital spending and ensuring clear linkage to cash returns. You should expect our 2021 capital spending to be significantly lower from what we are spending in 2020. Since being named CEO, I've immersed myself in our business and spent lots of Zoom hours with our people. I've also helped our team build out a value-creating strategic and financial framework. As a reminder from our last call, outside of our five core principles everything else is under review. I've spent a lot of time looking at the risks and opportunities facing our business, including an evaluation of our business portfolio. We are an opportunity-rich company. We are making progress but given the size of our business, it will take time to optimize our network, to stop processes that have added cost and no customer value and to fully reach our potential.  Now moving on to the upcoming holiday season. Peak is extremely important to our customers so it's extremely important to us. We have been operating in a peak-like environment globally for many months which is helping us prepare for the elevated demand ahead. 2020 peak will have two more operating days than last year and two full weeks between Cyber week and Christmas week. We are projecting a pretty picky peak, but there are some industry capacity constraints as Brian will detail. As a result we expect to see solid volume growth year-over-year. But sequentially the quarterly growth rate in the U.S. will moderate in the fourth quarter. Our peak preparation starts with ensuring the safety of our people and our customers. From that we are employing two key strategies. First, we will continue to collaborate with our customers to help them time their promotions and match their needs to our available capacity. Second we will leverage proven and some new tools to ensure flexibility, control and visibility across the network. This year we added automated sort capacity and greatly expanded our weekend operations. We sped up our ground network and are using more real-time data to better manage the expected increase in volume. From my involvement in our peak preparations, I will tell you that while we expect this holiday season to have its challenges, we are ready to deliver a successful peak. As you can see in our results we are making progress against the better not bigger framework we outlined in July. We have more work to do and plan to provide additional detail about our actions during an Investor Day we will host in 2021 once the environment is more stable. And with that I'll turn the call over to Brian. \nBrian Newman: Thanks Carol and good morning. Overall we are pleased with our results in the quarter. As I share the details you'll see early indications that our actions are having a positive impact on our operating performance and financial returns. I'll also share the trends we are seeing as we approach year-end. Starting with the macro environment. The global economy continue to feel the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Global trade has generally improved with Asia outbound leading other geographies. However both global and U.S. real GDP growth rates in the third quarter are estimated to be down 3.7%. In the U.S. consumer confidence has held up well. However industrial production remains mixed. Auto manufacturing has fully recovered, but it will take more time for all industrial production to return to pre-COVID levels. So what does this mean for our business? We see no signs that the structural market shift to e-commerce will slow anytime soon. In fact forecasters estimate the e-commerce share of retail has been advanced by two to three years due to the pandemic. And at the same time, we expect the commercial side of our business to face continued softness extending into 2021. During the quarter, we adjusted our network and took deliberate actions to better position UPS for the future. Three key items underscored our performance. First, both the International and Supply Chain and Freight segments delivered record profits. We executed extremely well within a tight capacity market and we're able to meet high demand out of Asia. Next in the U.S. SMB growth accelerated and our revenue quality actions began yielding results. And lastly, we faced both planned and unplanned expense pressures in the U.S. Domestic segment. For the quarter consolidated revenue increased 15.9% to $21.2 billion. Operating profit totaled $2.4 billion or 9.9% higher than last year. The operating margin for the company was 11.3% which was 70 basis points below last year. Diluted earnings per share was $2.28, up 10.1% from the same period last year. Moving into the segments. In U.S. Domestic average daily volume increased 13.8% year-over-year to a total of 20.4 million packages per day. The SMB volume growth rate accelerated by 820 basis points going from 10.5% in the second quarter to 18.7% in the third quarter. B2C shipments increased 33.4% year-over-year and represented 61% of total volume. Conversely B2B average daily volume was down 7.8% year-over-year, but has improved from the second quarter. While we saw positive B2B growth in healthcare and automotive that growth was not able to offset weakness in other industrial sectors. For the quarter U.S. Domestic revenue was up 15.5% to $13.2 billion driven by the strength in ground and deferred air products, as well as the impact of one additional operating day. While reported revenue per piece was flat year-over-year excluding the negative impacts from fuel and SurePost revenue per piece grew both sequentially and year-over-year. Lower fuel prices reduced revenue per piece growth by 130 basis points and elevated SurePost volume reduced revenue per piece growth by 230 basis points. As a reminder SurePost is a higher return on invested capital product. The underlying improvement in revenue per piece indicates that our revenue quality actions are beginning to have a positive impact. Turning to costs. Expenses were up 18.4% over the third quarter of last year and grew faster than volume and revenue. Cost per piece excluding fuel increased $0.37 or 4.4% over last year. Several items drove expense deleverage in the quarter. First, our initiatives to expand weekend operations and speed up the ground network; second, benefit expenses from the additional employees we hired in the second quarter; and third, lower productivity gains than we planned and lower delivery density. For the quarter, the U.S. generated $1.1 billion in operating profit, a decline of 8.8% compared to last year. Operating margin was down 220 basis points year-over-year. We are focused on improving revenue and reducing cost in the U.S. Domestic business and we are pleased with our early revenue progress. Additionally, we see the opportunities to decrease our cost structure as we optimize our network and implement transformation initiatives. Moving over to International. The segment delivered another quarter of record operating profit with double-digit positive year-over-year growth. The flexibility of our global network and winning solutions allowed us to lean into the most profitable areas of elevated demand. Volume increased globally by double-digits year-over-year. Asia outbound average daily volume growth was 37.6%. With air capacity in tight supply, we added 268 flights above our normal schedules to meet the high demand. And Europe continued to see elevated cross-border B2C with export average daily volume up 15.5%. We saw growth across customer segments with SMB volume growing in all regions. B2C mix moderated to 31% of total volume and B2B improved, but was still down 3.2% year-over-year. For the quarter, international revenue was up 17% to $4.1 billion. Revenue per piece was up 2.7% and included a decline of 260 basis points from fuel and a benefit of 140 basis points from currency. On the expense side, cost per piece declined 2.3% year-over-year, primarily due to lower fuel costs. For the third quarter, International generated operating profit of $972 million, an increase of 40.3%, led by elevated demand out of Asia. And finally, our international operating margin expanded 400 basis points. Looking at Supply Chain and Freight. The segment results were excellent. Elevated demand drove revenue up 16.5% to $3.9 billion and we generated record quarterly profit. Market capacity remained tight, while economic activity picked up in the quarter. Slowing demand for PPE was offset by inventory replenishment. More specifically, we saw high air and ocean freight forwarding demand out of Asia led by the high tech, retail and industrial sectors. Our LTL business improved efficiency and productivity, while at the same time advancing the revenue quality in our freight businesses. Revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel increased 7.2% in the quarter. Conversely, performance in our truckload brokerage unit had a negative impact to profit on a year-over-year basis due to continued market challenges. Operating profit was $302 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year with multiple units contributing and which highlights the diversity within the Supply Chain and Freight portfolio. Looking at the overall enterprise. In the third quarter, UPS generated operating profit of $2.4 billion, up 9.9%. A few notable items on the income statement include other pension income was $327 million, driven by last year's 17.6% return on pension assets and the discount rate was 90 basis points below last year. We had $176 million of interest expense, which is above last year due to our $3.5 billion debt issuance in March. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.5% compared to last year's third quarter tax rate of 20.8%, reflecting certain discrete tax items that did not repeat this year. Now let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. Our cash flow remains very strong. For the first 9 months of the year, we generated $9.3 billion in cash from operations and about $5.9 billion in adjusted free cash flow. This includes $725 million from the CARES Act federal payroll tax deferral offset by a $1 billion discretionary contribution to pension plans. Capital investments totaled $3.4 billion through September, and we expect full year CapEx of $5.6 billion and remain on track with our automation targets for 2020. So far this year, UPS has distributed $2.7 billion in dividends, which represents a 5.2% increase on a per share basis over the same period last year. Now I'll make a few comments regarding the balance of the year. We expect strong consumer demand during peak. As Carol mentioned, in the U.S. we will have 2 additional operating days between Thanksgiving and December 31 compared to last year, which helps our operations. We anticipate some industry capacity constraints through the period. In response, we're working closely with customers to pull demand ahead of the traditional peak period. In fact many large retailers ran e-commerce sales events in mid-October and our network performed well during this period with high service levels and good productivity. Looking ahead our peak plans, volume management, and surcharge approach will also help promote a more optimized volume mix. We will also leverage our technology to control the volume we bring into the network, utilize available capacity, and efficiently operate during peak. While we are not providing consolidated revenue or diluted earnings per share guidance, I want to provide some color to help frame up the fourth quarter. In the U.S., average daily volume is anticipated to increase by high single-digits and revenue growth to be above volume growth. Working against us are difficult year-over-year comps and known expenses that will pressure operating margin. They include an increase in benefits expense between $150 million and $200 million due to additional union headcounts over last year including the new employees we hired in the second quarter. Next, new legislation in 2019 for alternative fuel tax credits and reductions in management incentives which together lowered operating expense last year by about $150 million are not expected to repeat and the acceleration of our time and transit and weekend operations initiatives. Working in our favor are the positive effects from our revenue quality efforts and growth from SMBs. In our International segment, we expect the year-over-year profit growth rate to be in the high teens. And in Supply Chain and Freight, we expect operating profit growth to be relatively flat given the anticipated market dynamics, particularly in the truckload brokerage business. In summary, while macro conditions remain dynamic and the recovery uncertain, market demand continues to be elevated. We are laser-focused on improving cash generation by executing our strategy under the better not bigger framework. Thank you and operator please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: -- the call and to ask the question. Carol I think it's still early days with respect to transform -- transfer -- the Transformation 2.0, 3.0. But the facts as it relates to the third quarter the profits in the domestic business were down over $100 million from the prior period revenues were up almost $2 billion. When does that equation could shift? And when do you think you'll be able to maybe report more positive operating leverage and margin expansion in the business? \nCarol Tomé: Well, Amit, thank you very much for your question and let's just unpack the performance on the expense line a little bit more than Brian did. Brian called out three drivers of deleverage in the U.S. business in the third quarter the first of which was our decision to speed up our fastest ground ever initiative. That decision cost us $179 million in the quarter. It was the right thing to do because you saw the market share gains that we enjoyed with our SMB business. So, it was the right thing to do but it certainly puts some pressure on the expense line. If you back that out our expenses -- our operating profit would have grown year-on-year. The other line item that was a deleverage in the quarter was productivity below our expectations. And here we have a real opportunity as we turn that around looking past the fourth quarter of this year and into 2021 and 2022. One reason for the decline in productivity is the fact that we had 40,000 new UPSers and higher turnover this year than we did last year. Turnover is a function of many things including COVID candidly. But when you have a lot of new people in your operations, sadly we just weren't as productive as we should have been. We have a new leader over our U.S. Domestic small package business. Nando is all over this and productivity is going to be a laser focus of Transformation 3.0. And it's not just about putting more packages through our facilities on a per hour basis. It's about how we get better at running the business better at keeping our people, so we lower our cost of turnover; better at keeping our people safe, so we lower our casualty reserves. There's a real opportunity here to just get better in running the business without a lot of investment actually. So, we are building our 2021 financial plan as we speak. We're road mapping three years and once that plan is finalized, we will share with you our actions that we are taking to grow the operating margin in the U.S. small package business. \nAmit Mehrotra: Yes, I appreciate that Carol. But I mean just to make sure that I understand your comment. Are you saying that starting in the fourth quarter because of some of the idiosyncratic cost in the third quarter that the business will return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter and that will extend into 2021? Is that what you're saying if I'm understanding you correctly?\nCarol Tomé: That is not what I'm saying. The turn won't happen until 2021 because of expense pressures that Brian carefully called out in the fourth quarter. And Brian you might just want to remind Amit what those expense pressures are in the fourth quarter.\nBrian Newman: Yes. As we look forward to the fourth quarter Amit, we do have the underlying benefits as Carol said of optimizing volume and improving pricing. But there are three in particular, that Q4 headwinds. We've got the seasonality, which you know, year-over-year we normally go about down 200 basis points on a sequential Q3 to Q4 standpoint because of peak, so there's that natural seasonality impact. We've got benefits, ranging in $150 million to $200 million that will be impacting Q4. And then, we're lapping last year, we had some legislation around alternative fuel tax as well as a low management incentive number last year. Together, those are about $150 million lap. So those combined with the fastest ground ever that we'll finish off in Q4 investments that's going to put pressure on the fourth quarter as we look forward.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay.\nCarol Tomé: Now, at the end of the second quarter, we said that we thought that the operating margin for the back half of the year could be 100 basis points lower than the operating margin in the first half of the year. Because of our outperformance in the third quarter and because of the revenue quality that we are enjoying in the U.S. business, we now think the operating margin in the back half of the year will be higher than the first half of the year. So hopefully, that's helpful to you as you build your models.\nAmit Mehrotra: That’s very helpful. Thank you, Carol. Thank you, Brian. Appreciate it.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Amit.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey. Thanks and good morning. Carol, you talked about CapEx on the call, and I thought that was kind of interesting. I think the comment was significantly lower than 2020, which I think is running just under -- or maybe I guess $5.6 billion. Can you talk with a little bit more specificity about, what that significantly means and sort of where you potentially see that savings? It seems like there's a lot of growth out there, so I want to get a sense of kind of the order of magnitude we might be talking about.\nCarol Tomé: Well, we are finalizing our capital plans as we speak. But for modeling purposes, I would use $4 billion. So that's a significant reduction from what we're running today, and it's really a reduction across all major categories of our capital. As we've unpeeled the layers of the onion, we've discovered an opportunity to sweat our assets in a more efficient way. We have over 500 hub sorting facilities in our U.S. business over 1,000 delivery facilities. And as I look at the capacity utilization in those facilities, we've got opportunities. Now clearly we need to work with our customers to optimize the fixed investments that we've made, but we clearly have opportunities here to sweat the assets. The same is true with the airlines. As we think about where the demand is going for next-day air in the United States versus where the demand is exploding outside of the United States, we have an opportunity to optimize our aircraft globally. So, that's enabling us to take our capital down. Brian, any color you want to add there?\nBrian Newman: Yeah, just a little bit. Chris, as you shape next year and we think about pulling the buildings, buildings represent about 50% of our CapEx we spend. We've made those investments in capacity, so you'd expect to see that come down, the airline to likely come down. And it's this pivot to international healthcare digital that's where, we're pivoting the capital spend.\nChris Wetherbee: Great, thank you very much. Appreciate.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Allison Poliniak, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just turning to the SMB initiatives, clearly gaining some share there. There's a lot of expense noise in the quarter. But when you put that aside, is the incremental pull-through from those volumes that you're getting on SMB, where you thought they'd be at this point of the cycle, the investment cycle for you? Are they better? Any color on that?\nCarol Tomé: Yeah, happy to give you some color on the SMB volume. We were so pleased to see 18.7% growth, the highest in 16 years. If I think about SMB, as a percentage of our total business in the United States, it's grown from 23% last year to now 24% this year. So we're shifting the penetration, which is really about how we want to drive revenue quality in our business. If you unpeel the layer of the onions for our SMB business in the quarter, we see that they're figuring it out. The commercial side of SMB was down, call it, 7% in the quarter, but the residential piece of SMB was up 62%. So they're figuring out how to go to market and they're using our end-to-end network to drive that. So if you then say, Okay. Carol is that flowing down to the bottom line? Well, we were very pleased with what we saw in that regard too. So, we will continue to invest in this customer segment. You've heard us talk about fastest ground ever. It doesn't just stop with that. I think last time, I talked about how we break apart our customer segments within SMB, and I told you it was D1 through D4, and I didn't really know what that meant. Well, the team has done a really great job of defining what it means. So now when you think about our SMB customers think of them as medium, small, micro and platform. And when you think of those customers, think of it like a pyramid. So, at the top of the pyramid are our medium-sized customers and those are several thousands of accounts. And as you go down the pyramid, the customer base will expand dramatically. From a revenue perspective, flip the pyramid upside down. So the bulk of the revenue is at the top and the smallest piece of the business is at the bottom. But interestingly, when we looked at the performance of SMBs across all four of those segments, we saw each of them grow. And the growth came from our medium-sized businesses as well as our platform businesses. And within platform or the platform segment that's where GAAP falls. And yes, GAAP is small, but it's growing. In fact, we expect our revenue on our GAAP accounts to grow 400% this year, and that is a very profitable segment for us.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ross: Yes. Good morning, Carol. Good morning, Brian.\nBrian Newman: Good morning.\nDavid Ross: Carol you made a comment in one of your interviews about green dots and red dots and coming in and looking at initiatives to see what you should stop doing and what were wildly important. Could you just add some more color specifically mainly around some of the red dots that you guys came up with?\nCarol Tomé: Yeah. So – well, thanks for the question. It was such an interesting exercise because when we started it all the green dots went up, but it was really hard to put red dots up, because initiatives you love them, you fall in love with them you find themselves they sound like they're really value creating but the truth is not so much. So I can give you an example of one. We have this initiative called UPS Next and UPS Next was all about driving innovation in the company. Well, when we looked at what the UPS Next team was working on, they were working on exactly the same projects as other groups within the company, so we put the red dot on UPS Next. And all those people who were working on that project, well, they are either gone or they'd be reassigned to additional work. So that gives you a sense of what we mean by stopping work. We are so opportunity rich. Let me give you another example. We haven't stopped this yet but we're going to. So I asked Nando. I said, Nando how many reports do we ask our operators to work every week? Because I had familiarity with this in my previous line where we tend to put too much work on our operators and they couldn't focus on things like productivity. So Nando came back and said, Carol we send 462 reports to our operators every week to work. So you can appreciate what that means. It means none of that is being worked. That's work that's going to stop. And think about the overhead here at the UPS headquarter that's producing those reports. So that's all being streamlined to those widely important metrics that matter for the customer experience for productivity and the rest is just going to get stopped.\nDavid Ross: Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: You're welcome.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, Carol. Thanks for the time. I just wanted to, kind of, maybe talk about a similar thing. As you think about changing those behaviors inside of the company and stopping those activities, you're coming into the CEO seat from the Board level, what surprised you about that transition? And how long do you think it will be before those changes you're making concern into the tangible operating leverage that the Street is so desperately looking for inside of the domestic business?\nCarol Tomé: Well, as a Board member, I was always so very impressed by how UPSers respond to a crisis. In many ways UPSers are first responder. They're always there to help the communities and customers that we serve. Coming into the company I was blown away by our reaction to COVID. UPSers are essential workers and I'm just so proud of them for what they do every day. They actually -- we all work, but they're actually going to work. They're putting on uniforms and they're flying planes and driving package cars and delivering packages and sorting packages and I'm just so proud of them. What I didn't understand is how we went about what we do. UPS is a 113-year old company and many 113-year old companies they layer in bureaucracy and processes that are fine but actually slow you down. So -- what I didn't know when I came on board is that we had 21 committees that were meeting to make decisions about the business. 21 committees take -- just the amount of calendaring time to meet and discuss and recommendations would be held until the committee meeting occurred. And that's not a way to run the business or effect change quickly. So we took those 21 committees down to six. And the fantastic thing is that the UPSers are -- they're energized by this. I was really worried about being rejected. That's not happened. The UPSers are embracing me. They're embracing change. They're excited about what we can do together as a company. And what this allows us to do actually is to without debate or controversy talk about the real opportunities to move and to get movement on the U.S. operating margin. And part of that is about controlling our own destiny by improving the revenue quality in our business, working with our customers to enable that to happen to look at the root cause of why we've been deleveraging and going after that in a meaningful way. In the past, we did it by increments. We're now doing it in a meaningful way, in a meaningful way. So if I told you that our casualty reserves that are driven by both workers' comp and either all the liability, Brian they stand at how much?\nBrian Newman: Today we're over $1 billion.\nCarol Tomé: We're over $1 billion in casualty reserves. You get a 10% reduction in that because you have a safer operation that's $100 million. $100 million can move that U.S. operating margin in a meaningful way. If I talk to you about the cost of turnover, which I'm not going to do but the cost of turnover is high for our company. We've got 20% of that. It's another meaningful way to move the operating margin. If we improve delivery density, which we must do we have had ideas on the shelf to do that. We just haven't operationalized though. That's a meaningful way to improve the operating margin. So this is a big company. You just can't pull the band-aid off because you could hurt the customer experience and we don't want to do that. But as we start to pivot into this through the fourth quarter into 2021, we're going to be laying out tangible action plans that will show improvement in the operating margin. And then as we optimize our capital spending this will all translate into higher return on invested capital. \nOperator: We have a question from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nAllison Landry: Good morning. Thanks. So Carol, you've talked about a focus on what customers are willing to pay for and optimizing the volumes that flow through the network. And clearly you're starting to see that with the step-up in SMB growth. But should we also interpret this as a signal that you might de-market some volume from large customers that aren't meeting the return thresholds? And if that's the case, over what timeframe can you drive enough profitable share gains from SMBs that would allow you to walk from some of the lower-margin business? So if you could just speak to how you're balancing this and while at the same time trying to maximize asset utilization? Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Yes. So as you know, there is a capacity constraint in the industry. It doesn't matter what supply chain you are there's a capacity constraint in the industry. And if we took all the volume that was available to us we would end up with a customer experience that wouldn't be good for us or our customers and we would end up with what we call chaos costs. So we've actually been controlling the volume since July and we're doing that in a number of different ways. We work with our customers to help them rethink their operations via buy online pick-up in store different timing for their promotions a different availability of their packages so a number of alternatives and options that we've been working through a solution-based approach with our customers. When you have tight capacity, it also means that prices tighten. And as prices tighten there is a shift in certain customers who are more price-sensitive than others. We're okay with that if we're losing non-nutritive sales. We're okay with that. It's not about volume share growth. It's about value share growth. So that's how we'd like you to think about us at least in the short-term value share growth. Now clearly the U.S. small package business is going to grow. It's estimated, I think the volume ADV was something like $58 million in 2019. It should double by 2025. Of course, we're going to be growing to service that growth. But right now it's all about value share. \nOperator: We have a question from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. \nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. I wanted to focus a little bit on international very strong in the quarter acceleration export volume growth third quarter from second quarter. Just wanted to discuss kind of the trends through year end you think. And maybe beyond how sustainable is this strength in international? And Brian -- I missed what you said about -- you said had high teens. I didn't know if that was profit growth or margin in fourth quarter, but if you could elaborate a little bit on sustainability and margin in that segment? Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Scott for the question. So from an international perspective very happy with the Q3 performance. They continue to post double-digit top-line and profit growth and the real strength is coming out of Asia and Europe in particular. I was referencing operating profit growth in the high-teens Scott was what I had commented on. And the operating margin has come in about 23% for the last two quarters. A lot in the international side depends on the international backdrop. So obviously, we're watching that very closely. But the overall business is sound. Carol, I don't know if you have anything to add. \nCarol Tomé: Well, the one comment I would make on the margin which was outstanding and the profit growth in the third quarter we did have surcharge in the third quarter because the capacity is just so tight. So we've had about $120 million of surcharges in our international business in the third quarter. Whether or not that sustains is really a subject of market demand. Hopefully that's helpful to you. \nOperator: We have a question from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Carol, you highlighted big CapEx cuts coming next year. How do you make sure that you are kind of keeping pace with others who are investing significantly to grow their capacity? And kind of going back to what you just mentioned about value share is that something UPS can do by themselves if the rest of the industry is going to try to take share and kind of aggressively grow capacity and pursue that growth? \nCarol Tomé: So this is all about our better, but not bigger framework, which is a start of pivoting the business to position us for success in the future. Sweating the existing investments that we've made is a really good thing next year. Then we'll look at where we want to grow and how we want to grow. But for next year we're going to sweat the investments that we've made. Brian you might want to talk about that.\nBrian Newman: Yes. Ravi, it's a good question. If we look backwards first we put over $15 billion in the capacity in the U.S. over the last several years and that was needed. But now 85% or so of our ground volume is going through some sort of automated capacity and hub. So as we're looking at that, those investments I've watched the ROIC actually trend down. A real focus going forward is going to say \"How do we lower CapEx, ensure it's driving shorter-term paybacks to get better benefit\" and I talked about where we're going to shift to in terms of healthcare some specific to international markets thinking about digital. So it's a different type of spend going forward but I don't want to front-run the investor conference next year. We'll unpack that in more detail.\nCarol Tomé: And I would comment just on the technology front because that's such an important area of investment for us well for everybody actually. The customer wants a digital experience and so we can't move off of that digital experience. In fact, we need to lean into that. But that isn't necessarily a capital expenditure because software as a service as you know is paid through a license fee. So we're moving away from an internally developed IT solutions to software as a service. So you'll see line items differences happening. The other thing I would ask you to remember is as we grow outside of the United States, our International business tends to have an asset-light profile in most areas of the rest of the world and that asset-light profile will certainly help spur growth and generate higher returns.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to come back to the fourth quarter a second. Obviously, you mentioned, some puts and takes on the expense side balanced against sort of the revenue quality. And then you sort of highlighted a normal sequential domestic decline of a couple of hundred basis points. I mean, should we be thinking then in terms of the fourth quarter domestic margin on a base level sort of holding on to that first half margin of around 6.6%, 6.7%? I mean is that – when you put all the puts and takes together is that the baseline we should be thinking about?\nBrian Newman: Hey, Jordan, it's Brian. Thanks for the question. That's a fair baseline. We had some pressures in the third quarter which we discussed. But as you go forward, thinking about the $8.6 million that we posted in the third quarter, the first half of the year was 6.6%. So as you look to the back half of the year assuming a baseline of 6.6% is a fair assumption. And we're going to do everything we can to beat that. We're seeing improvement on the pricing and the revenue quality side. The challenge are the headwinds I outlined for the fourth quarter. So balancing those two is going to dictate where we land.\nJordan Alliger: Okay. Thanks very much.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Jordan.\nOperator: Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just curious if you could comment for a moment, given the surge in the virus that we've been seeing in Europe over the last several weeks, if that's had any impact on business trends there. Or just if you could comment broadly on if that's had an impact on the market in Europe\nCarol Tomé: So our business trends continued to be very strong coming out of our International business. There's a big watch out there because of COVID. We see cases spiking. It's concerning right because if we were to have disruption let's say in our pilots that would be a real problem. And we haven't seen that but we're just watching this very, very closely.\nOperator: Tom Wadewitz, UBS. Please go ahead. Mr. Wadewitz, your line is open.\nScott Childress: Stephen, do you want to move to the next caller?\nOperator: We will do. Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, you said revenue better than volume in the fourth quarter. Is that a sustained inflection or more of a one-off with the record surcharges? And then Carol you made – I had a great line last quarter about the Bs and referring to billions of cost savings. Just directionally should we be thinking $1 billion plus or potentially multiple billions of cost savings here? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: So, Scott I'll take the first piece of this in terms of the pricing. If you look at the underlying health of the price and the quality of overall revenue really it's more than just pricing. But as you look at the second quarter, you'll remember, I peeled out fuel and SurePost to give you a good read at the growth and we were 1.5% positive. That was the first time we saw a positive number there in quite some time. That would equate to 3.6 in the third quarter so you see that sustained momentum. We'd expect to see continued improvement there. The question then comes down to the balance in terms of B2B, B2C and SMB and how we flow through. So we're trying to pivot the business as we walk through. But I think you can look for underlying continued improvement in the RPP ex fuel and SurePost. Carol, do you want to comment on the B?\nCarol Tomé: Yes. So we've got Transformation 1.0 coming to a close. So we'll turn to Transformation 2.0, which the first wave of Transformation 2.0 was the VSAP that we announced this fall. We offered that VSAP in two waves to over 11,000 UPSers. Thus far we've had about 1,600 people apply. We'll land at something around there or maybe a little less. So you can do the math of what that might translate into savings, that's not $1 billion. That's several hundred million, but it's the first phase of Transformation 2.0. There are more activities that will come. We're just not going to tell you before we tell our people, but there are more activities that will come in Transformation 2.0. When you think about Transformation 2.0, think about that attacking non-operating expense, in other words general overhead. It's going after spans and layers, it's going after labor arbitrage that sort of opportunity. The real money and candidly our non-operating expense is about $6 billion on an annual basis. So the real opportunity to get billions out is in the operating side of our business, and this is all about productivity and going after those big buckets of costs that we need to turn down to add up to $1 billion. We're going to have an investor conference in 2021, when things calm down. I don't know Brian what we're thinking about? \nBrian Newman : Early June.\nCarol Tomé: Early June, okay. So, hopefully COVID settled down. We can do a good conference in June of 2021 and then we'll lay this all out for you. I just don't want to get ahead of my skis. It was a downhill race for a long, long time, and if you get ahead of our skis you tumble down the mountain. I just don't want to do that. So we're just going to be very, very thoughtful very planful about this. And then we'll lay that out for you, so that you can hold us accountable to what we said we're going to do.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Jairam Nathan of Daiwa. Please go ahead.\nJairam Nathan: Yeah. Thanks for your question. I wanted to -- a bit better than bigger theme. I wanted to understand how you're changing your incentive compensation in -- to align with that. And just one modeling your fuel expense was higher sequentially significantly. And was there anything in there that we should consider?\nBrian Newman: On the fuel side, Jairam, we saw about $60 million in benefit in the quarter, $30 million of that coming -- roughly half of it coming in domestic and half international. We'd expect that to moderate in the fourth quarter. So, it stepped down from Q2 to Q3 by about 50%. We'd expect that to continue to step down in the fourth quarter. Carol, do you want to…\nCarol Tomé: One of the widely important initiatives is people. And as we look at the people opportunities incentive compensation is certainly one of those opportunities. The design of our incentive compensation doesn't necessarily tie to the results that we want to achieve. So we're going to be resetting the goals to make that happen, to make them much more return focused. They were two line item focus if that makes any sense. So you get bonus off of revenue per piece. That's an incomplete look at the business, isn't it? Because it doesn't have the cost and it doesn't have the capital. So we'll be re-looking at the elements of both our short-term, which is our annual bonus as well as our long-term. Our long-term incentives do have a return characteristic to them, so that's good. But I really want to work on the short-term incentives. Also, we're going to redo our sales incentives for our sales team. They're so complicated. I tend to think I can understand math. I had a hard time figuring this out. So we're going to simplify this, so it's really easy for people to understand how they get paid and actually tie the incentives to better not bigger.\nScott Childress: Stephen, it's Scott. We've got time for one more question if you would.\nOperator: The last question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead. Tom maybe stuck on mute.\nScott Childress: One more question to the next caller please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski : Hey, everyone. Thanks for sneaking me on here. Carol, I guess thinking about not wanting to repeat mistakes of the past. If we go back two predecessors ago, CapEx came down a lot. And you do have independent contractor competition effectively doubling your growth rate right now. So how do you balance the need for productivity and growth as well as achieving that higher value with lower CapEx?\nCarol Tomé: Right. So to your point, it's a balance and we're well aware of the changing competitive environment and the changing customer environment and are thinking through how to best attack those opportunities in ways that are different than what we've done in the past. And that's just a hint of what's to come, but we'll be talking more about that next year.\nScott Childress: That concludes our call. And I want to thank everyone for participating on today's call and have a great day. Thank you.",

            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks Carol and good morning. Overall we are pleased with our results in the quarter. As I share the details you'll see early indications that our actions are having a positive impact on our operating performance and financial returns. I'll also share the trends we are seeing as we approach year-end. Starting with the macro environment. The global economy continue to feel the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Global trade has generally improved with Asia outbound leading other geographies. However both global and U.S. real GDP growth rates in the third quarter are estimated to be down 3.7%. In the U.S. consumer confidence has held up well. However industrial production remains mixed. Auto manufacturing has fully recovered, but it will take more time for all industrial production to return to pre-COVID levels. So what does this mean for our business? We see no signs that the structural market shift to e-commerce will slow anytime soon. In fact forecasters estimate the e-commerce share of retail has been advanced by two to three years due to the pandemic. And at the same time, we expect the commercial side of our business to face continued softness extending into 2021. During the quarter, we adjusted our network and took deliberate actions to better position UPS for the future. Three key items underscored our performance. First, both the International and Supply Chain and Freight segments delivered record profits. We executed extremely well within a tight capacity market and we're able to meet high demand out of Asia. Next in the U.S. SMB growth accelerated and our revenue quality actions began yielding results. And lastly, we faced both planned and unplanned expense pressures in the U.S. Domestic segment. For the quarter consolidated revenue increased 15.9% to $21.2 billion. Operating profit totaled $2.4 billion or 9.9% higher than last year. The operating margin for the company was 11.3% which was 70 basis points below last year. Diluted earnings per share was $2.28, up 10.1% from the same period last year. Moving into the segments. In U.S. Domestic average daily volume increased 13.8% year-over-year to a total of 20.4 million packages per day. The SMB volume growth rate accelerated by 820 basis points going from 10.5% in the second quarter to 18.7% in the third quarter. B2C shipments increased 33.4% year-over-year and represented 61% of total volume. Conversely B2B average daily volume was down 7.8% year-over-year, but has improved from the second quarter. While we saw positive B2B growth in healthcare and automotive that growth was not able to offset weakness in other industrial sectors. For the quarter U.S. Domestic revenue was up 15.5% to $13.2 billion driven by the strength in ground and deferred air products, as well as the impact of one additional operating day. While reported revenue per piece was flat year-over-year excluding the negative impacts from fuel and SurePost revenue per piece grew both sequentially and year-over-year. Lower fuel prices reduced revenue per piece growth by 130 basis points and elevated SurePost volume reduced revenue per piece growth by 230 basis points. As a reminder SurePost is a higher return on invested capital product. The underlying improvement in revenue per piece indicates that our revenue quality actions are beginning to have a positive impact. Turning to costs. Expenses were up 18.4% over the third quarter of last year and grew faster than volume and revenue. Cost per piece excluding fuel increased $0.37 or 4.4% over last year. Several items drove expense deleverage in the quarter. First, our initiatives to expand weekend operations and speed up the ground network; second, benefit expenses from the additional employees we hired in the second quarter; and third, lower productivity gains than we planned and lower delivery density. For the quarter, the U.S. generated $1.1 billion in operating profit, a decline of 8.8% compared to last year. Operating margin was down 220 basis points year-over-year. We are focused on improving revenue and reducing cost in the U.S. Domestic business and we are pleased with our early revenue progress. Additionally, we see the opportunities to decrease our cost structure as we optimize our network and implement transformation initiatives. Moving over to International. The segment delivered another quarter of record operating profit with double-digit positive year-over-year growth. The flexibility of our global network and winning solutions allowed us to lean into the most profitable areas of elevated demand. Volume increased globally by double-digits year-over-year. Asia outbound average daily volume growth was 37.6%. With air capacity in tight supply, we added 268 flights above our normal schedules to meet the high demand. And Europe continued to see elevated cross-border B2C with export average daily volume up 15.5%. We saw growth across customer segments with SMB volume growing in all regions. B2C mix moderated to 31% of total volume and B2B improved, but was still down 3.2% year-over-year. For the quarter, international revenue was up 17% to $4.1 billion. Revenue per piece was up 2.7% and included a decline of 260 basis points from fuel and a benefit of 140 basis points from currency. On the expense side, cost per piece declined 2.3% year-over-year, primarily due to lower fuel costs. For the third quarter, International generated operating profit of $972 million, an increase of 40.3%, led by elevated demand out of Asia. And finally, our international operating margin expanded 400 basis points. Looking at Supply Chain and Freight. The segment results were excellent. Elevated demand drove revenue up 16.5% to $3.9 billion and we generated record quarterly profit. Market capacity remained tight, while economic activity picked up in the quarter. Slowing demand for PPE was offset by inventory replenishment. More specifically, we saw high air and ocean freight forwarding demand out of Asia led by the high tech, retail and industrial sectors. Our LTL business improved efficiency and productivity, while at the same time advancing the revenue quality in our freight businesses. Revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel increased 7.2% in the quarter. Conversely, performance in our truckload brokerage unit had a negative impact to profit on a year-over-year basis due to continued market challenges. Operating profit was $302 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year with multiple units contributing and which highlights the diversity within the Supply Chain and Freight portfolio. Looking at the overall enterprise. In the third quarter, UPS generated operating profit of $2.4 billion, up 9.9%. A few notable items on the income statement include other pension income was $327 million, driven by last year's 17.6% return on pension assets and the discount rate was 90 basis points below last year. We had $176 million of interest expense, which is above last year due to our $3.5 billion debt issuance in March. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.5% compared to last year's third quarter tax rate of 20.8%, reflecting certain discrete tax items that did not repeat this year. Now let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. Our cash flow remains very strong. For the first 9 months of the year, we generated $9.3 billion in cash from operations and about $5.9 billion in adjusted free cash flow. This includes $725 million from the CARES Act federal payroll tax deferral offset by a $1 billion discretionary contribution to pension plans. Capital investments totaled $3.4 billion through September, and we expect full year CapEx of $5.6 billion and remain on track with our automation targets for 2020. So far this year, UPS has distributed $2.7 billion in dividends, which represents a 5.2% increase on a per share basis over the same period last year. Now I'll make a few comments regarding the balance of the year. We expect strong consumer demand during peak. As Carol mentioned, in the U.S. we will have 2 additional operating days between Thanksgiving and December 31 compared to last year, which helps our operations. We anticipate some industry capacity constraints through the period. In response, we're working closely with customers to pull demand ahead of the traditional peak period. In fact many large retailers ran e-commerce sales events in mid-October and our network performed well during this period with high service levels and good productivity. Looking ahead our peak plans, volume management, and surcharge approach will also help promote a more optimized volume mix. We will also leverage our technology to control the volume we bring into the network, utilize available capacity, and efficiently operate during peak. While we are not providing consolidated revenue or diluted earnings per share guidance, I want to provide some color to help frame up the fourth quarter. In the U.S., average daily volume is anticipated to increase by high single-digits and revenue growth to be above volume growth. Working against us are difficult year-over-year comps and known expenses that will pressure operating margin. They include an increase in benefits expense between $150 million and $200 million due to additional union headcounts over last year including the new employees we hired in the second quarter. Next, new legislation in 2019 for alternative fuel tax credits and reductions in management incentives which together lowered operating expense last year by about $150 million are not expected to repeat and the acceleration of our time and transit and weekend operations initiatives. Working in our favor are the positive effects from our revenue quality efforts and growth from SMBs. In our International segment, we expect the year-over-year profit growth rate to be in the high teens. And in Supply Chain and Freight, we expect operating profit growth to be relatively flat given the anticipated market dynamics, particularly in the truckload brokerage business. In summary, while macro conditions remain dynamic and the recovery uncertain, market demand continues to be elevated. We are laser-focused on improving cash generation by executing our strategy under the better not bigger framework. Thank you and operator please open the lines. Yes. As we look forward to the fourth quarter Amit, we do have the underlying benefits as Carol said of optimizing volume and improving pricing. But there are three in particular, that Q4 headwinds. We've got the seasonality, which you know, year-over-year we normally go about down 200 basis points on a sequential Q3 to Q4 standpoint because of peak, so there's that natural seasonality impact. We've got benefits, ranging in $150 million to $200 million that will be impacting Q4. And then, we're lapping last year, we had some legislation around alternative fuel tax as well as a low management incentive number last year. Together, those are about $150 million lap. So those combined with the fastest ground ever that we'll finish off in Q4 investments that's going to put pressure on the fourth quarter as we look forward. Thanks, Amit. Yeah, just a little bit. Chris, as you shape next year and we think about pulling the buildings, buildings represent about 50% of our CapEx we spend. We've made those investments in capacity, so you'd expect to see that come down, the airline to likely come down. And it's this pivot to international healthcare digital that's where, we're pivoting the capital spend. Good morning. Today we're over $1 billion. Thanks, Scott for the question. So from an international perspective very happy with the Q3 performance. They continue to post double-digit top-line and profit growth and the real strength is coming out of Asia and Europe in particular. I was referencing operating profit growth in the high-teens Scott was what I had commented on. And the operating margin has come in about 23% for the last two quarters. A lot in the international side depends on the international backdrop. So obviously, we're watching that very closely. But the overall business is sound. Carol, I don't know if you have anything to add. Yes. Ravi, it's a good question. If we look backwards first we put over $15 billion in the capacity in the U.S. over the last several years and that was needed. But now 85% or so of our ground volume is going through some sort of automated capacity and hub. So as we're looking at that, those investments I've watched the ROIC actually trend down. A real focus going forward is going to say \"How do we lower CapEx, ensure it's driving shorter-term paybacks to get better benefit\" and I talked about where we're going to shift to in terms of healthcare some specific to international markets thinking about digital. So it's a different type of spend going forward but I don't want to front-run the investor conference next year. We'll unpack that in more detail. Hey, Jordan, it's Brian. Thanks for the question. That's a fair baseline. We had some pressures in the third quarter which we discussed. But as you go forward, thinking about the $8.6 million that we posted in the third quarter, the first half of the year was 6.6%. So as you look to the back half of the year assuming a baseline of 6.6% is a fair assumption. And we're going to do everything we can to beat that. We're seeing improvement on the pricing and the revenue quality side. The challenge are the headwinds I outlined for the fourth quarter. So balancing those two is going to dictate where we land. Thanks, Jordan. So, Scott I'll take the first piece of this in terms of the pricing. If you look at the underlying health of the price and the quality of overall revenue really it's more than just pricing. But as you look at the second quarter, you'll remember, I peeled out fuel and SurePost to give you a good read at the growth and we were 1.5% positive. That was the first time we saw a positive number there in quite some time. That would equate to 3.6 in the third quarter so you see that sustained momentum. We'd expect to see continued improvement there. The question then comes down to the balance in terms of B2B, B2C and SMB and how we flow through. So we're trying to pivot the business as we walk through. But I think you can look for underlying continued improvement in the RPP ex fuel and SurePost. Carol, do you want to comment on the B? Early June. On the fuel side, Jairam, we saw about $60 million in benefit in the quarter, $30 million of that coming -- roughly half of it coming in domestic and half international. We'd expect that to moderate in the fourth quarter. So, it stepped down from Q2 to Q3 by about 50%. We'd expect that to continue to step down in the fourth quarter. Carol, do you want to..."

            "name": "Carol Tomé",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. We are moving quickly and operationalizing our strategy under the better, not bigger framework. We're leaning in on the wildly important areas of our business and tackling challenges head on. This morning, I'm pleased to discuss our achievements and the opportunities we see before us. One thing is certain, everything we accomplish is the result of our winning people and culture. We have everyday heroes at UPS, who are keeping the world supply chains moving and delivering what matters, from essential household items to critical healthcare needs, UPSers are making a positive difference in the world. And for that, I am so very proud of this team and want to thank them for their hard work and efforts. During the quarter, we continued to flex our network to capture market opportunities and better position UPS for the long term. Our performance was better than we expected even amid the challenges from the pandemic. Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 15.9% from last year to $21.2 billion and operating profit grew 9.9% from last year to $2.4 billion. While our commercial business remained under pressure due to the economic downturn, during the quarter we began to optimize our network and captured share in SMB or small and medium-sized businesses. As a result, we saw revenue per piece improved sequentially in the U.S. from what we reported in the first two quarters of this year. Further, revenue growth in our International and Supply Chain and Freight segments was the highest quarterly growth we've seen in nearly three years. Brian will share more details about the quarter in a moment. Over the past few months, we've intensified the focus on executing our strategy: customer first, people led, innovation driven. From a customer-first perspective, there has been a step change in the composition of retail sales, as e-commerce sales are now projected to make up more than 20% of all U.S. retail sales this year. We don't think the penetration of e-commerce retail sales will decline, even after the pandemic, but it isn't just retail. Our customers across all business segments are reinventing the ways they do business. We've heard from customers that speed and ease are most important, so we are focused on delivering the capabilities that matter most to our customers. Let's start with speed. In the U.S. we completed our weekend expansion ahead of schedule, enabling broader market coverage, as we are the only carrier that provides both commercial and residential pickup and delivery services on Saturdays as a general service offering. And next week, we will complete our Fastest Ground Ever initiative eight months ahead of plan. We have improved ground transit times between millions of ZIP codes and we will be at parity or better than the competition in 20 of the 25 most populated U.S. markets and customers have noticed. Weekend ground volume is up 161% versus last year. And SMB volume on our Fastest Ground Ever lanes has grown 25.7% since we made the improvement. Moving to ease. It's all about removing friction from the customer experience and serving customers the way they want to be served. For SMBs, we are highly focused on our Digital Access Program, which we refer to as DAP. Through platform partnerships, we are making it easier for SMBs to open a UPS account and access the world's largest small package network. Revenue growth from our DAP program exceeded our expectations, as we added 150,000 new accounts and several new partners in the quarter. Our fastest ground ever weekend services and DAP complement each other enabling our customers to deliver what matters to their customers, speed and a better experience. Our efforts in the United States are having a positive impact. In the third quarter, total U.S. SMB volume grew 18.7%, outpacing our larger customers and was the highest growth rate we've experienced with SMBs in 16 years. We are seeing strong results in the International segment too with international SMB volume up 9.9% during the quarter. Another area that we are leaning into is healthcare logistics. UPS Healthcare spans all reporting segments has world-class technology deep expertise and the most sophisticated suite of services in the industry. We are significantly expanding our freezer farm capacity by installing validated freezers that range from negative 20 to negative 80 degrees Celsius. These farms are strategically located in Louisville Kentucky and Venlo The Netherlands and are good distribution practice certified. And for added control during transit, UPS Premier our next-generation package sensor technology offers priority handling, real-time monitoring, and continuous visibility. We understand that healthcare logistics isn't just about the package. It's about the patient. Our mark in healthcare team is supporting clinical trials across all stages for COVID-19 vaccines. Early involvement gives us valuable data and insights to design commercial distribution plans and manage the logistics for these complex products. We have a great opportunity, and frankly a great responsibility to serve the world when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. When that time comes, our global network, cold chain solutions and our people will be ready. Moving to the second element of our strategy people-led. We know successful outcomes are built from a strong culture of teamwork respect, trust and empowerment. We are enabling our people to move the business forward by giving them more decision-making authority and we're identifying, which activities add value and stopping those that don't. We are also investing in training on topics including unconscious bias and diversity and inclusion, to ensure our actions match our values. In the past, we have talked to you about Transformation 1.0. We are on track to deliver the more than $1 billion of benefit we identified when we kicked it off in 2018. In September of this year, we began Transformation 2.0 by announcing a voluntary separation allowance program. To the UPSers, who will take this offer, I thank you for your service to our company. Transformation 2.0 is about creating fewer, but more impactful jobs. We will share more details with you as we finalize our plan. The final piece of our strategy innovation-driven comes down to being better not bigger. Now that doesn't mean UPS is not going to grow because we are. It means that we will lean into growth from the right opportunities like SMBs, international, global freight forwarding, and other high-yielding sectors, and we will grow from our revenue quality initiatives. We are on a journey to optimize the volume that flows through our network. Additionally, our approach calls for greater efficiency and requires that we lower our cost to serve. Our transformation efforts are vitally important to our ongoing success. While we are finishing Transformation 1.0, we've already begun Transformation 2.0 and we are road mapping Transformation 3.0 in preparation to launch next year. Transformation 3.0 will focus on decreasing core operating expense. Further to improve our return on invested capital, we are applying greater scrutiny to capital spending and ensuring clear linkage to cash returns. You should expect our 2021 capital spending to be significantly lower from what we are spending in 2020. Since being named CEO, I've immersed myself in our business and spent lots of Zoom hours with our people. I've also helped our team build out a value-creating strategic and financial framework. As a reminder from our last call, outside of our five core principles everything else is under review. I've spent a lot of time looking at the risks and opportunities facing our business, including an evaluation of our business portfolio. We are an opportunity-rich company. We are making progress but given the size of our business, it will take time to optimize our network, to stop processes that have added cost and no customer value and to fully reach our potential.  Now moving on to the upcoming holiday season. Peak is extremely important to our customers so it's extremely important to us. We have been operating in a peak-like environment globally for many months which is helping us prepare for the elevated demand ahead. 2020 peak will have two more operating days than last year and two full weeks between Cyber week and Christmas week. We are projecting a pretty picky peak, but there are some industry capacity constraints as Brian will detail. As a result we expect to see solid volume growth year-over-year. But sequentially the quarterly growth rate in the U.S. will moderate in the fourth quarter. Our peak preparation starts with ensuring the safety of our people and our customers. From that we are employing two key strategies. First, we will continue to collaborate with our customers to help them time their promotions and match their needs to our available capacity. Second we will leverage proven and some new tools to ensure flexibility, control and visibility across the network. This year we added automated sort capacity and greatly expanded our weekend operations. We sped up our ground network and are using more real-time data to better manage the expected increase in volume. From my involvement in our peak preparations, I will tell you that while we expect this holiday season to have its challenges, we are ready to deliver a successful peak. As you can see in our results we are making progress against the better not bigger framework we outlined in July. We have more work to do and plan to provide additional detail about our actions during an Investor Day we will host in 2021 once the environment is more stable. And with that I'll turn the call over to Brian. Well, Amit, thank you very much for your question and let's just unpack the performance on the expense line a little bit more than Brian did. Brian called out three drivers of deleverage in the U.S. business in the third quarter the first of which was our decision to speed up our fastest ground ever initiative. That decision cost us $179 million in the quarter. It was the right thing to do because you saw the market share gains that we enjoyed with our SMB business. So, it was the right thing to do but it certainly puts some pressure on the expense line. If you back that out our expenses -- our operating profit would have grown year-on-year. The other line item that was a deleverage in the quarter was productivity below our expectations. And here we have a real opportunity as we turn that around looking past the fourth quarter of this year and into 2021 and 2022. One reason for the decline in productivity is the fact that we had 40,000 new UPSers and higher turnover this year than we did last year. Turnover is a function of many things including COVID candidly. But when you have a lot of new people in your operations, sadly we just weren't as productive as we should have been. We have a new leader over our U.S. Domestic small package business. Nando is all over this and productivity is going to be a laser focus of Transformation 3.0. And it's not just about putting more packages through our facilities on a per hour basis. It's about how we get better at running the business better at keeping our people, so we lower our cost of turnover; better at keeping our people safe, so we lower our casualty reserves. There's a real opportunity here to just get better in running the business without a lot of investment actually. So, we are building our 2021 financial plan as we speak. We're road mapping three years and once that plan is finalized, we will share with you our actions that we are taking to grow the operating margin in the U.S. small package business. That is not what I'm saying. The turn won't happen until 2021 because of expense pressures that Brian carefully called out in the fourth quarter. And Brian you might just want to remind Amit what those expense pressures are in the fourth quarter. Now, at the end of the second quarter, we said that we thought that the operating margin for the back half of the year could be 100 basis points lower than the operating margin in the first half of the year. Because of our outperformance in the third quarter and because of the revenue quality that we are enjoying in the U.S. business, we now think the operating margin in the back half of the year will be higher than the first half of the year. So hopefully, that's helpful to you as you build your models. Well, we are finalizing our capital plans as we speak. But for modeling purposes, I would use $4 billion. So that's a significant reduction from what we're running today, and it's really a reduction across all major categories of our capital. As we've unpeeled the layers of the onion, we've discovered an opportunity to sweat our assets in a more efficient way. We have over 500 hub sorting facilities in our U.S. business over 1,000 delivery facilities. And as I look at the capacity utilization in those facilities, we've got opportunities. Now clearly we need to work with our customers to optimize the fixed investments that we've made, but we clearly have opportunities here to sweat the assets. The same is true with the airlines. As we think about where the demand is going for next-day air in the United States versus where the demand is exploding outside of the United States, we have an opportunity to optimize our aircraft globally. So, that's enabling us to take our capital down. Brian, any color you want to add there? Yeah, happy to give you some color on the SMB volume. We were so pleased to see 18.7% growth, the highest in 16 years. If I think about SMB, as a percentage of our total business in the United States, it's grown from 23% last year to now 24% this year. So we're shifting the penetration, which is really about how we want to drive revenue quality in our business. If you unpeel the layer of the onions for our SMB business in the quarter, we see that they're figuring it out. The commercial side of SMB was down, call it, 7% in the quarter, but the residential piece of SMB was up 62%. So they're figuring out how to go to market and they're using our end-to-end network to drive that. So if you then say, Okay. Carol is that flowing down to the bottom line? Well, we were very pleased with what we saw in that regard too. So, we will continue to invest in this customer segment. You've heard us talk about fastest ground ever. It doesn't just stop with that. I think last time, I talked about how we break apart our customer segments within SMB, and I told you it was D1 through D4, and I didn't really know what that meant. Well, the team has done a really great job of defining what it means. So now when you think about our SMB customers think of them as medium, small, micro and platform. And when you think of those customers, think of it like a pyramid. So, at the top of the pyramid are our medium-sized customers and those are several thousands of accounts. And as you go down the pyramid, the customer base will expand dramatically. From a revenue perspective, flip the pyramid upside down. So the bulk of the revenue is at the top and the smallest piece of the business is at the bottom. But interestingly, when we looked at the performance of SMBs across all four of those segments, we saw each of them grow. And the growth came from our medium-sized businesses as well as our platform businesses. And within platform or the platform segment that's where GAAP falls. And yes, GAAP is small, but it's growing. In fact, we expect our revenue on our GAAP accounts to grow 400% this year, and that is a very profitable segment for us. Yeah. So – well, thanks for the question. It was such an interesting exercise because when we started it all the green dots went up, but it was really hard to put red dots up, because initiatives you love them, you fall in love with them you find themselves they sound like they're really value creating but the truth is not so much. So I can give you an example of one. We have this initiative called UPS Next and UPS Next was all about driving innovation in the company. Well, when we looked at what the UPS Next team was working on, they were working on exactly the same projects as other groups within the company, so we put the red dot on UPS Next. And all those people who were working on that project, well, they are either gone or they'd be reassigned to additional work. So that gives you a sense of what we mean by stopping work. We are so opportunity rich. Let me give you another example. We haven't stopped this yet but we're going to. So I asked Nando. I said, Nando how many reports do we ask our operators to work every week? Because I had familiarity with this in my previous line where we tend to put too much work on our operators and they couldn't focus on things like productivity. So Nando came back and said, Carol we send 462 reports to our operators every week to work. So you can appreciate what that means. It means none of that is being worked. That's work that's going to stop. And think about the overhead here at the UPS headquarter that's producing those reports. So that's all being streamlined to those widely important metrics that matter for the customer experience for productivity and the rest is just going to get stopped. You're welcome. Well, as a Board member, I was always so very impressed by how UPSers respond to a crisis. In many ways UPSers are first responder. They're always there to help the communities and customers that we serve. Coming into the company I was blown away by our reaction to COVID. UPSers are essential workers and I'm just so proud of them for what they do every day. They actually -- we all work, but they're actually going to work. They're putting on uniforms and they're flying planes and driving package cars and delivering packages and sorting packages and I'm just so proud of them. What I didn't understand is how we went about what we do. UPS is a 113-year old company and many 113-year old companies they layer in bureaucracy and processes that are fine but actually slow you down. So -- what I didn't know when I came on board is that we had 21 committees that were meeting to make decisions about the business. 21 committees take -- just the amount of calendaring time to meet and discuss and recommendations would be held until the committee meeting occurred. And that's not a way to run the business or effect change quickly. So we took those 21 committees down to six. And the fantastic thing is that the UPSers are -- they're energized by this. I was really worried about being rejected. That's not happened. The UPSers are embracing me. They're embracing change. They're excited about what we can do together as a company. And what this allows us to do actually is to without debate or controversy talk about the real opportunities to move and to get movement on the U.S. operating margin. And part of that is about controlling our own destiny by improving the revenue quality in our business, working with our customers to enable that to happen to look at the root cause of why we've been deleveraging and going after that in a meaningful way. In the past, we did it by increments. We're now doing it in a meaningful way, in a meaningful way. So if I told you that our casualty reserves that are driven by both workers' comp and either all the liability, Brian they stand at how much? We're over $1 billion in casualty reserves. You get a 10% reduction in that because you have a safer operation that's $100 million. $100 million can move that U.S. operating margin in a meaningful way. If I talk to you about the cost of turnover, which I'm not going to do but the cost of turnover is high for our company. We've got 20% of that. It's another meaningful way to move the operating margin. If we improve delivery density, which we must do we have had ideas on the shelf to do that. We just haven't operationalized though. That's a meaningful way to improve the operating margin. So this is a big company. You just can't pull the band-aid off because you could hurt the customer experience and we don't want to do that. But as we start to pivot into this through the fourth quarter into 2021, we're going to be laying out tangible action plans that will show improvement in the operating margin. And then as we optimize our capital spending this will all translate into higher return on invested capital. Yes. So as you know, there is a capacity constraint in the industry. It doesn't matter what supply chain you are there's a capacity constraint in the industry. And if we took all the volume that was available to us we would end up with a customer experience that wouldn't be good for us or our customers and we would end up with what we call chaos costs. So we've actually been controlling the volume since July and we're doing that in a number of different ways. We work with our customers to help them rethink their operations via buy online pick-up in store different timing for their promotions a different availability of their packages so a number of alternatives and options that we've been working through a solution-based approach with our customers. When you have tight capacity, it also means that prices tighten. And as prices tighten there is a shift in certain customers who are more price-sensitive than others. We're okay with that if we're losing non-nutritive sales. We're okay with that. It's not about volume share growth. It's about value share growth. So that's how we'd like you to think about us at least in the short-term value share growth. Now clearly the U.S. small package business is going to grow. It's estimated, I think the volume ADV was something like $58 million in 2019. It should double by 2025. Of course, we're going to be growing to service that growth. But right now it's all about value share. Well, the one comment I would make on the margin which was outstanding and the profit growth in the third quarter we did have surcharge in the third quarter because the capacity is just so tight. So we've had about $120 million of surcharges in our international business in the third quarter. Whether or not that sustains is really a subject of market demand. Hopefully that's helpful to you. So this is all about our better, but not bigger framework, which is a start of pivoting the business to position us for success in the future. Sweating the existing investments that we've made is a really good thing next year. Then we'll look at where we want to grow and how we want to grow. But for next year we're going to sweat the investments that we've made. Brian you might want to talk about that. And I would comment just on the technology front because that's such an important area of investment for us well for everybody actually. The customer wants a digital experience and so we can't move off of that digital experience. In fact, we need to lean into that. But that isn't necessarily a capital expenditure because software as a service as you know is paid through a license fee. So we're moving away from an internally developed IT solutions to software as a service. So you'll see line items differences happening. The other thing I would ask you to remember is as we grow outside of the United States, our International business tends to have an asset-light profile in most areas of the rest of the world and that asset-light profile will certainly help spur growth and generate higher returns. So our business trends continued to be very strong coming out of our International business. There's a big watch out there because of COVID. We see cases spiking. It's concerning right because if we were to have disruption let's say in our pilots that would be a real problem. And we haven't seen that but we're just watching this very, very closely. Yes. So we've got Transformation 1.0 coming to a close. So we'll turn to Transformation 2.0, which the first wave of Transformation 2.0 was the VSAP that we announced this fall. We offered that VSAP in two waves to over 11,000 UPSers. Thus far we've had about 1,600 people apply. We'll land at something around there or maybe a little less. So you can do the math of what that might translate into savings, that's not $1 billion. That's several hundred million, but it's the first phase of Transformation 2.0. There are more activities that will come. We're just not going to tell you before we tell our people, but there are more activities that will come in Transformation 2.0. When you think about Transformation 2.0, think about that attacking non-operating expense, in other words general overhead. It's going after spans and layers, it's going after labor arbitrage that sort of opportunity. The real money and candidly our non-operating expense is about $6 billion on an annual basis. So the real opportunity to get billions out is in the operating side of our business, and this is all about productivity and going after those big buckets of costs that we need to turn down to add up to $1 billion. We're going to have an investor conference in 2021, when things calm down. I don't know Brian what we're thinking about? Early June, okay. So, hopefully COVID settled down. We can do a good conference in June of 2021 and then we'll lay this all out for you. I just don't want to get ahead of my skis. It was a downhill race for a long, long time, and if you get ahead of our skis you tumble down the mountain. I just don't want to do that. So we're just going to be very, very thoughtful very planful about this. And then we'll lay that out for you, so that you can hold us accountable to what we said we're going to do. One of the widely important initiatives is people. And as we look at the people opportunities incentive compensation is certainly one of those opportunities. The design of our incentive compensation doesn't necessarily tie to the results that we want to achieve. So we're going to be resetting the goals to make that happen, to make them much more return focused. They were two line item focus if that makes any sense. So you get bonus off of revenue per piece. That's an incomplete look at the business, isn't it? Because it doesn't have the cost and it doesn't have the capital. So we'll be re-looking at the elements of both our short-term, which is our annual bonus as well as our long-term. Our long-term incentives do have a return characteristic to them, so that's good. But I really want to work on the short-term incentives. Also, we're going to redo our sales incentives for our sales team. They're so complicated. I tend to think I can understand math. I had a hard time figuring this out. So we're going to simplify this, so it's really easy for people to understand how they get paid and actually tie the incentives to better not bigger. Right. So to your point, it's a balance and we're well aware of the changing competitive environment and the changing customer environment and are thinking through how to best attack those opportunities in ways that are different than what we've done in the past. And that's just a hint of what's to come, but we'll be talking more about that next year."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Steven, and I will be your facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host. Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nScott Childress: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we’ll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2019 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Q’s and other reports we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. During the quarter, GAAP results included a pretax charge of $112 million, equivalent to $0.10 on an earnings per share. The charge resulted from transformation-related activities in the international and U.S. domestic segments. In the prior year period, GAAP results included a pretax charge for transformation cost of $21 million, equivalent to $0.02 on an earnings per share. Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude transformation costs. The webcast of today’s call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, are available on UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions]  And now I’ll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you, Scott and good morning. I’m honored to be hosting my first UPS earnings call. Before I begin, I would like to thank David Abney, who after 46 years of service to UPS passed the baton to me on June 1. We wish David all the best. UPS is a special company with a unique culture powered by more than 528,000 UPSers around the world. Through this time of global pandemic and social unrest, UPS is keeping the world moving. We have taken measures to ensure the safety of our people, while delivering critical shipments and everyday essential, where and when they are needed. I am extremely proud of the efforts of our people to serve our customers, our communities, and each other. To all UPSers, thank you. During the quarter, our team did a great job adjusting the network to respond to the needs of our customers. At the beginning of the second quarter, we assumed demand would slow. Instead, we saw just the opposite. Due to ongoing COVID-related sheltering in place, retail store closures and changes in U.S. consumer spending fueled by the economic stimulus, we experienced unprecedented demand and record high volume levels. As a result, our second quarter performance was stronger than we expected. Consolidated revenue rose 13.4% from last year to $20.5 billion. Operating profit grew 7.4% from last year to $2.3 billion, led by outstanding results in the international segment, while our U.S. operating margin declined by 170 basis points from last year, largely due to certain expense items that Brian will explain. We were pleased with 580 basis points of sequential improvement from what we reported in the first quarter. Let me share with you how I’ve been spending my time since onboarding as CEO. I thought, I knew UPS after 17 years on the board, but I’ve been diving in and believe me, when you get to dive deeper, this company is even more impressive than I imagined. Our global network is best-in-class and our people are the hardest working people I’ve ever met. We also have many opportunities. In our 113 year history, UPS has become a trusted global logistics leader. But what got us where we are today will not get us to where we need to go in the future. Our customers are changing, our competitors are changing and the rate of change is accelerating. As we evaluate new market realities, we will be making decisions faster based on data and analytics with an emphasis on optimizing our existing network and the investments we’ve made. We will have a laser focus on creating value for our shareowners, with the goal of increasing the rates of return on the capital we invest. It’s all about becoming better, not bigger. We have five core UPS principles that underpin our actions. Our first principle is our values. These values were established by our Founder, Jim Casey, and give us an enduring foundation for success. Our values include integrity, safety, teamwork and service, and are the core of who we are and what we do. Our second principle is our dividend, which is a hallmark of our financial strength. We are committed to continuing nearly 50 years of stability and growth in the dividends we pay. Our third guiding principle is retaining a strong investment grade credit rating, ensuring that we have financial flexibility needed to competitively run our business. Next is brand relevance. And by relevance, we mean leading by example, taking actions to support our customers and communities, promote diversity and inclusion, sponsor racial equality and shape a healthier planet. And finally, our fifth principle is the importance of employee ownership, which supports valuable and lasting employee and retiree engagement. Outside of these five core principles, everything else in our portfolio is under review, and I mean everything. While it is early in the process, the good news is that we already have the right strategy in place. Customer first, people led, innovation driven. Customer first is about removing friction when doing business with UPS. Speeding up time and transit and improving the moments that matter. So we create greater loyalty to be measured by gains and our net promoter score. In support of this effort, we have accelerated our plans to improve time and transit, making the U.S. ground networks faster and thousands of the most important lanes by the end of this year. Further, we are continuing our expansion of weekend operations, including Sunday share post and our market leading Saturday commercial delivery and pickup services. Before our 2020 peak season, nearly 75% of the U.S. population will get Saturday ground residential service. By our estimate, both our time and transit and weekend enhancements drove roughly $100 million of incremental revenue in the second quarter. People led is at the core of our success, measure it through the employee experience and specifically how likely an employee is to recommend UPS as a place to work. We are focused on diversity and inclusion and fighting for racial justice and reform. I cannot say enough about the power of our people, including the nearly 40,000 new UPSers, we’ve added to our U.S. Small Package business in recent months. During this time, we’ve provided additional sick leave benefits to UPSers who may have been impacted by COVID-19. And to further invest in our full time management teams for their extraordinary efforts, we are providing additional financial incentives. Moving to the last leg of our strategic platform. Innovation driven will be measured by the value we create for our shareowners. We will leverage our technology and portfolio of services to drive greater cash generation and higher returns on invested capital. Today, we are focused on increasing network efficiency, as well as more permanent actions to improve revenue quality, including pricing that reflects the value we create. For example, on May 31, we introduced new surcharges of certain volumes. We are developing specific actions and metrics against our strategic efforts. And once finalized, we’ll share them with you, so that you can measure our progress. Looking to the back half of the year. Most scenarios suggest continued uncertainty, which is likely to yield a more gradual economic recovery. This is due in part to the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, new containment measures and the status of fiscal stimulus program. While we would expect continued strong B2C demand, it’s hard to know how our B2B demand will unfold. The recovery will continue to be extremely difficult to predict until the spread of the virus is better controlled and a vaccine is widely available. I’ve led through difficult economic cycles before, and I know the power of making the right decisions to pivot toward opportunity. Our leadership team is focused on enabling success for all UPSers and creating value for our shareowners. We will control what we can control, while taking action to write the next chapter of the UPS story. We look forward to updating you on our progress. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol and good morning. Today, I will discuss our quarterly performance and current trends in our business, which the teams are navigating well. Before I start, I want to point out the expanded disclosure in our web schedules. To improve transparency, we brought the 10-Q balance sheet and cash flow statements forward and have included them in the materials released today. Through the second quarter, we face challenges from the coronavirus pandemic and resulting recession. Global real GDP and global industrial production are estimated to be down 9.3% and 14.6% respectively. And in the U.S., real GDP and industrial production declined with unemployment reaching historic highs. In response, we adjusted our network to support our customers’ needs. We manage costs and leaned into three significant changes in demand in the markets we serve. First, our ability to shift air capacity to where it was needed enabled us to meet the strong demand out of Asia, using both our own assets and asset-light solutions. We met the demand for more capacity by flying about 635 extra flights using both brown tail and third-party aircraft. Next during the quarter, the U.S. e-commerce market jumped 34.4% and SMB is quickly adapted to participate. In fact, through our digital access program, we captured 120,000 new customer accounts, a significant increase from recent trends. And finally, our healthcare expertise and global portfolio of services enabled us to meet the urgent need for PPE and COVID-19 testing supplies, and provide support for vaccine and treatment studies. All of which, contributed to our results in each of our three segments. For the quarter, consolidated revenue increased 13.4% to $20.5 billion. Net income rose 8.8% to $1.9 billion and operating profit totaled $2.3 billion or 7.4% higher than last year. The operating margin for the company was 11.4% below last year by 60 basis points, diluted earnings per share was $2.13, up 8.7% from the same period last year. Now moving into the segments. In U.S. Domestic, market demand for residential delivery surged in the quarter, driving total average daily volume up to 21.1 million packages, an increase of 22.8%. SurePost increased 96.6% and represented 53% of our total U.S. Domestic volume growth. Volume approached peak like levels with May and June, significantly above April. The surge created some network constraints and some regional dips in service levels. However, the additional 39,000 employees, we hired together with our expanded weekend operations enabled us to process the increase in volume. Ground residential volume, excluding SurePost was up 63.8%, without exception, all industry sectors grew the residential volume. In fact, B2C volume jumped 65.2% year-over-year, which is 5.8 million additional pieces per day, and B2C represented 69% of total volume. Conversely, given the downturn in the industrial sector, B2B volume declined 21.9% or 1.8 million pieces per day from the same period last year. However, we did see B2B volume begin to recover in the quarter. As a percentage of total volume, B2B shipments were 27% in early May. And at the end of the quarter, B2B shipments had climbed to 37% of total U.S. volume. For some context, the full year 2019 split was 46% B2B. While average daily volume growth was led by many of our larger customers, SMBs rebounded over the quarter, from a decline of 7.2% in April to growth of 17.8% in May and 22.4% in June. Revenue was up 17.3% to $13 billion, driven primarily by ground products. Revenue per piece declined 4.4% or 440 basis points, driven by two significant factors, lower fuel prices, which were a negative impact of 180 basis points, and the magnitude of SurePost growth pulled revenue per piece down 410 basis points. Excluding SurePost and the fuel surcharge, revenue per piece was higher than last year, and was also a sequential improvement from the first quarter. Our expenses increased in the quarter by 19.5% and we’re in line with activity levels, including volume growth. Our expenses also includes several items that we did not have last year, which I’ll cover in a moment. Cost per piece was down 2.7% year-over-year and decreased sequentially 8.4%, driven by lower fuel costs and our ability to scale and flex the network as volume surged. The U.S. generated $1.2 billion in operating profit, which was $11 million or 0.9% below last year. Operating margin declined 170 basis points year-over-year. However, sequential margins improved 580 basis points. U.S. Domestic operating profit includes the following expense items, coronavirus direct expenses, minus the CARES Act, federal excise tax benefit lowered profit by $44 million. A lower pension discount rate decreased profit by $63 million. Additional employee incentives reduced profit by $51 million, and working in our favor were lower fuel cost for a net fuel benefit of $61 million. We are operating in a very difficult environment and we have more work ahead of us to increase profit per piece, which was down 19.3% on a year-over-year basis. Moving forward, our focus is on improving network efficiency, optimizing the volume we bring in and better aligning pricing with the value we provide. Moving to International, I’d like to take a moment to congratulate our entire international team for delivering a very strong quarter, despite a tough operating environment. Our performance demonstrates the agility of our global integrated network. Asia was the first region to face the pandemic and was also the first to reopen, which led to a strong increase in export volume and revenue as we came out of the first quarter. Asia outbound volume rose in April, peaked in May, and moderated in June. Overall, Asia outbound volume grew 46.8% in the quarter and went up by double digits to all major regions of the world. Total export volume grew 11.4% driven by two factors. First, we quickly leaned into the opportunity created by the reduction of passenger belly space. We also added capacity surcharges to help us manage demand. In total, we added 335 flights and utilized our higher capacity fleet of 747 aircrafts, which enabled us to handle more volume on fewer flights versus other carriers in the market. The second factor was the 95% increase in residential volume, led by cross border B2C in Europe, doubling our B2C volume, while expanding profits is an encouraging sign for the future. Revenue rose 5.7% to $3.7 billion. Revenue per piece was down 3.9% and included a decline of 480 basis points from fuel, and 100 basis points from currency. On the expense side, cost per piece declined 8.2%, primarily due to lower fuel costs and greater network efficiencies. International generated operating profit of $842 million, an increase of 26.6%, and our operating margin expanded 370 basis points. Looking at Supply Chain and Freight, results across the business units were mixed. Total revenue grew 8.5% to $3.7 billion, and expense rose 9.4% to $3.4 billion. Profit declined $6 million or 2.2%. In general, the parts of our business that aligned to sectors with elevated demand did very well. For example, air freight led the segment due to the surge in market rates out of Asia, sparked by the sharp decline in passenger belly space. The team was responsive to our customer’s needs, including FEMA and resourceful in securing about 300 charters out of Asia. We also saw gains from COVID testing in vaccine and treatment studies. The portions of the Supply Chain and Freight segment, more aligned to industrial activity saw weakness during the quarter. LTL and truckload brokerage faced excess capacity and reduce demand early in the quarter. Both markets began to see some recovery later in the quarter, but remain under pressure. Looking at the overall enterprise, UPS generated operating profit of $2.3 billion up 7.4%. A few other items on the income statement include, other pension income, which was $327 million driven by last year 17.5% return on pension assets and lower discount rates. We also had $183 million of interest expense. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 25% compared to 23.5% in the second quarter of last year and is higher mainly due to unfavorable changes in our uncertain tax positions. Now let’s turn to cash and shareholder returns. Our cash flow remains strong. For the first six months of the year, we generated $5.9 billion in cash from operations, and about $3.9 billion in free cash flow, included in our results is $370 million from the federal payroll tax deferral. Capital investments totaled $2.1 billion in the first half of the year. We expect full year CapEx of $5.6 billion and remain on track with our automation targets for this year. So far this year, UPS has distributed $1.8 billion in dividends, which represents a 5.2% increase on a per share basis over the same period last year. Now I’ll make a few comments regarding the back half of the year. First, we remain unable to predict the extent of the business impact or the duration of the coronavirus pandemic or reasonably estimate UPS 2020 revenue and diluted earnings per share. There are however, a few items that are likely to occur in the second half of the year that we want you to know about. U.S. Domestic average daily volume growth is expected to be lower than what we saw in the second quarter. We expect demand for residential packages will continue in the U.S. and around the world. We also expect Asia outbound demand and yields to be positive year-over-year, but we’ll continue to moderate versus the second quarter. For modeling purposes, our Teamster employees will get their annual wage increase in August. And in the third quarter of 2019, we had a $40 million gain on a land sale in the international segment that will not repeat. And in the second half of 2020, U.S. Domestic will face difficult year-over-year comps, including the impact of our new hires anticipated to receive full benefits, time and transit, and weekend operations expense, preceding the full run rate of revenue, and other gains from last year that will not repeat. The economic recovery remains uncertain. We are paying close attention to the consumer financial health, unemployment levels and the continuation of fiscal stimulus programs. Given all these factors, the U.S. Domestic margin could be lower in the second half of the year, relative to the first half. International, Supply Chain and Freight will continue to adapt to market dynamics. Meanwhile, as Carol said, we will focus on controlling what we control. Among the positive and negative effects ahead of us, we remain confident in our ability to improve U.S. margins on a long-term basis. Our liquidity is very strong. We ended the quarter with more than $8 billion in cash and equivalence on the balance sheet, which is enabling us to invest through this unique environment and navigate the economic uncertainty. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ross: And Carol, you’ve picked a good call to start off with.\nCarol Tomé: Good morning.\nDavid Ross: Wanted to see how you guys are thinking about peak season. In the quarter, you talked about a mini peak or peak-like conditions, where you had some network constraints. If some of that strength continues and then we have on top of that, a holiday surge, how are you talking about it with your customers? What are you thinking about it from a network investment standpoint, any bottlenecks that may emerge there?\nCarol Tomé: Yes. Thanks for the question on peak. As a leadership team, we’ve agreed, we are going to have an outstanding peak season. I participated in my first peak planning committee several weeks after I joined the company and very impressed by how we are planning to manage through, what could be a very peaky season, is about making sure that we’ve got our network aligned both on the high end and on the low end, because it’s uncertain out there. So we’re building an optionality, in terms of how we’re going to run the network. And then Kate with her team are talking to our customers customer-by-customer and how we will best manage through peak.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks and congrats, Carol. So first, if you can just clarify that the second half margin comment is that lower than the second quarter or lower than the full first half. And then just Carol, just bigger picture, I wanted to just get your perspective on how you’re thinking about the growth algorithm for UPS in the U.S. business. So the last few years, it’s been volume outpacing revenue and margins falling. Do you think we see more or less volume growth going forward than what we’ve seen? You’ve historically talked about 2% to 3% price. Does that meaningfully change? And then I guess, do you think you can – when do you think you can get back to a double digit margin? I know there’s lot there, but any perspective would be great. Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Yes. Absolutely happy to share some perspective. As Brian said, it’s – our operating margin in the U.S. domestic business could be lower in the back half of the year than what we reported in the first half of the year. Lot of uncertainty in the marketplace, of course, but we thought it was helpful for Brian to kick out some of the expense related items that we’re pretty sure will happen, because we’re not terribly sure about the demand side. Now longer term, this is where we’re very excited about what we’re going to do with our company. In my prepared remarks, I’ve talked about, it’s all about being better, not bigger. What do I mean by that? Well, just a couple of things. This may be a longer-winded answer then you’re looking for. But I’ll go ahead and take the opportunity to share with you, what I mean by that and what we mean by that. First, we are an engineering-driven company, you would expect us to be. But like any company who was 113 years old, we’ve over engineered much of what we’ve done. And I’ll give you an example of that, depending on how you define products, we have between 400 and 500 products. We kicked off a task force to say, really, are we selling all of those products? Because when you think about it, if you have between 400 and 500 products, you have to build systems and technology to support those products, you have to build accountants to account for those products. You have to have auditors who audit for those products. And then you have to have salespeople who sell those products. As we looked at it, and it’s very early days, we found that last year, there were over 100 of those products that we didn’t even sell. So we’re going to rationalize our product offering to make it simpler for our customers and reduce expense here. As we think about optimizing the network to your specific question on volume, it’s about being better, not bigger. What we have done in the past is built capacity or bought capacity, and the hope that demand would follow. And we would take demand at any cost or any price, if you will. Not necessarily nutritive demand. So let me give you an example of a change, that we’ve just launched this year. We love our air fleet and in fact, about 11% of our air fleet are wide-body planes, these are 747 planes. And we took advantage of those wide bodies in the second quarter. We were able to fly demand out of Asia at a very effective cost, because they’re wide bodies. We didn’t have to fly as many planes. So we had an opportunity to buy more of those 747s because they’re coming up production. And the question that we asked ourselves is, well, won’t that create excess capacity? And won’t we find that we’ll need to fill that capacity at perhaps non-nutritive ways. And the answer to that question was, yes. So we passed on that investment that in the past we might have made. So we’re going to really look to sweat the assets that we have to get more off of that investment that we’ve made over time. We will look to pivot the customer and the way we go-to-market to optimize the network. And I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, great. Thank you very much. I really wanted to kind of make sure I understood sort of how that answer pertains to sort of profit growth on the domestic side. So lots of revenue, lots of demand, as it stands right now. Is there a clear path and maybe the next couple of quarters, maybe not necessarily the third quarter, this heap profit growth in the context of the revenue growth that we’re seeing, because the revenue is obviously spectacular in the second quarter on the domestic side, we actually saw profits down a little bit? So just want to kind of get a sense of what are the sort of steps that you need to take to be able to get that profit, to grow in line with revenue or at least closer.\nCarol Tomé: Yes. The easy way to think about profit growth is of course with pricing increases. And as you know, we did take some short surcharge increases at the end of May, but it’s much more than pricing. It’s really about optimizing the network and leaning into the customer segments that value the end-to-end network that we offer. And one of those segments is small and medium-sized businesses. And you heard Brian talk about the growth that we saw in that space in the second quarter up 11%. As I look at our small and medium-size customer base, we divide it into four big segments D1 through D4, that’s based on customer size. D1 and D2 customer segments, we’ve got pretty good market share there. But in D3 and D4, we’re underpenetrated relative to our competitors. We have an opportunity to grow into that space, but we need some enabling capabilities. The number one enabling capability to grow into that space is time and transit. So when I came onto the company and I looked at our time and transit activities we used to call that Panthera. We now called our fastest time – our Fastest Ground Ever. I saw that, we were planning to conclude that investment in June of 2021. I asked the team, well, what’s getting in the way. What’s getting in the way of going faster and they said money, I’m like, well, we’ve got money. So we’ll accelerate the investment. We pull that investment into 2020. We will complete time and transit by October of this year. And that’s a big deal because 46% of our SMB customers or potential customers tell us, time and transit is the number one thing on their mind. When we’re done, we will be at parity or better in 20 of the 25 markets that matter in the U.S. We will reach 90% of the U.S. population in three days, 75% of the U.S. population will have Saturday delivery. And then of course, we have Sunday delivery through our SurePost product. This matters. And why am I focusing on SMB? Because the SMB customer values are end-to-end network and they pay us for it. As we think about leaning into SMBs, it’s not just about time and transit, however. It’s also about a better customer experience. This goes back to being better, not bigger. We had a couple of pilots that we launched to really understand that customer and what their wants, needs and desires were. We listened to them. We operationalized what they wanted. And in the pilots, we saw 2 percentage point reduction in churn. Now that matters because in this segment, for every reduction in churn, it’s $170 million in revenue. And that revenue is a much better quality than other revenue. So as we think about moving the U.S. operating margin up, there’s a real opportunity to lean into a different customer segment and to make sure that we’re getting value for the services we provide. That’s on the revenue side. But I must talk about the cost side too, for a moment, because we have opportunities there as well. We’ve talked to you in the past about Transformation 1.0. And we’re well down the path of Transformation 1.0. And in fact, if you look at it life to date, on a net basis after investing, we have delivered over $1 billion of savings in Transformation 1.0. That’s on a cumulative basis. If you tax effects that and use the outstanding shares, it’s about $0.95 of EPS on a cumulative basis. We’re not done. Productivity and efficiency must be the hallmark of UPS. So we have initial plans for Transformation 2.0 and 3.0, which when they are finalized, we will share those with you. We also are using technology to drive productivity and efficiency in our operations. And I can just give you a comment on how we’re seeing that perform. We’ve talked to you in the past about ORION. We have ORION 3.0 out. We’re seeing a reduction in the miles that our drivers are driving and a reduction in the per piece cost. Now this is virtuous, it’s continuous, but the combination of rightsizing the revenue and driving productivity and efficiency gives us a path to drive operating margin expansion in the U.S. This is a big company to turn. You can’t do it overnight, but if you look through 2020 into 2021 and beyond, you should expect the margin to start to go in the right direction.\nOperator: Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Thanks. International may have had a strongest margin quarter ever, and I know there are obviously outsize gains in Asia and what have you. I’m just curious, how do we think about the longer term margin in international, or maybe even as we move forward from here, given the strong performance in the second quarter? Thanks.\nCarol Tomé: We were thrilled with our performance in our international segments and we expect them to have a very good back half as well. That model is a very different model than the one we run in inside the United States. It’s an asset-light outside service provider model. So the margins will always be stronger outside of the United States than they are inside the United States. And we view that as a competitive opportunity for us, candidly. We’ve identified 10 growth markets that we will grow into. We’ll be updating you as those opportunities present themselves. In the second quarter, we did enter into an alliance with a firm in Mexico. We’re very excited about that, because that’s one of our top 10 growth markets and we will now have the leading capabilities in Mexico, both inside Mexico and exporting out. So look for good things to come out of our international.\nBrian Newman: And Jordan, if I can just add, the B2C growth in Europe in the quarter or in international in the quarter was up 95%. And so I think the combination of the shift towards B2C and their ability to expand margins was another proof point of why we’re confident in that model.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Carol, would love, if you could share any learnings or takeaways from your prior stent as CFO at an e-commerce/consumer retail focused company that it can bring to UPS? And also in the context of customer concentration, you have a pretty large number one customer, kind of what are your thoughts on that? And how do you see that evolving over time? Thanks.\nCarol Tomé: I’m happy to do so. First, let me talk about my learnings during the last recession, which was housing-led recession. And my former employer, we felt it hard. They lost 25% of the top line during that recession. Two key learnings during that time. One, invest through the crisis. No better opportunity, if you have the financial wherewithal to do so, to invest through the crisis. So that when things settle down, you are positioned to take share. And that’s what we’re doing with time and transit. Our time and transit investment this year is $750 million. We could have canceled that. But we said, no, we’re going to pull that board. And we’re going to invest through the crisis. My second learning is to invest in your people. Now it doesn’t mean that you don’t have a fewer people in a downturn, but for those people that you have, you need to invest in. And if you looked at our population of UPSers, actually we’re down in Supply Chain and Freight, as you would expect, because the demand softened up there. But for the people who are left behind, we are investing in them, because it creates loyalty and better experience and better service for our customers. So we’re investing in incentives for our people. We’ve been promoting people. It pays huge dividends if you stay true to your people. Those are very good learnings in a downturn. Learnings as a retailer, is that when cost increases come your way, if you are a large retailer, you can pass those costs increases across the SKU base, and the customers don’t know. So while retailers may squawk at price increases that come their way, large retailers have a way to spread that across. And nobody knows. So there’s an opportunity here on the pricing side to do what we need to do. From a customer concentration perspective, I looked at our top 20 customers and their performance in the second quarter and of those top 20 customers, all but one group, the only one that didn’t grow was government. And I can’t tell you why, but it didn’t grow. But if I look at our top 20 customers who are retailers, who were predominantly store-based retailers, who when their stores closed and demand shifted online, well for those customers, they had triple-digit growth in the second quarter. Our largest customer did not have triple-digit growth. So that gives you some perspective on how we manage through customer concentration and how we’re thinking about optimizing the portfolio long-term.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you.\nOperator: Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Good morning. You had mentioned or talked about a little bit about the mix between B2B and B2C. But within B2C, could you talk about any mixed challenges that you face in the quarter and how they may have progressed that could have hindered margins there as well?\nCarol Tomé: Well, maybe I’ll start. Brian, you can chime in. I just looked at our ground business and we break our ground business into four segments. There’s 100 weight in commercial, so that’s more industrial. Then there’s ground resi, which is going to be predominantly B2C and SurePost. If I look at the profitability of ground resi, which now makes up 44% of our total ground business in the U.S. The profitability was up year-on-year. We’re taking actions actually to drive profitability in the business. And Brian, do you want to add any more color to that?\nBrian Newman: Yes. I just say, as we peel that business apart, I think I had mentioned it in my script. But as we extract the SurePost product, it gives us some encouraging signs for the underlying pricing health of the business within B2C. Because pricing, if you exclude SurePost, Carol, and fuel, we were up 1.5%, and that’s better than the last three or four quarters. So it’s encouraging signs for how we’re managing B2C.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much, good morning. I’m curious, I know the visibility is not great, but specifically in B2B, U.S. and frankly, everywhere, just how did you see that evolve through the quarter? What are you seeing in this quarter? How are you managing and competitively positioning to try and be well positioned as hopefully that comes back. And then the discussion of end markets that are particularly strong or weak over in that category. Thank you.\nBrian Newman: So maybe I’ll take that one, Scott. And Carol can chime in. The B2B growth was down 22% in the quarter. In terms of the evolution, we actually saw that number get better. It was still down overall. But April, May, June, as it progressed, we started the quarter down 38%. Got a little better down 20%, finished June at down 8% in terms of how we’re seeing it play out in this next quarter that we’re holding at about the June levels down, 9-ish in the month of July, as we think about the B2B business. So SMBs, which we’re also very focused on, they were up 11% in the quarter. So as we think about our small and medium businesses, we’re seeing those June trends of growth continue into July in the high teens range. Carol, anything to add?\nCarol Tomé: I think the stability invest new, it’s not getting worse, not getting better, but it’s not getting worse on the pure B2B.\nOperator: Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just had one on capacity in U.S. domestic. With this type of volume, essentially at the same holiday peak because a couple of years ago, how close is the U.S. network to maxing out capacity? I know you said, you expect volumes to moderate a bit in the back half of the year. But can you focus on revenue quality to help some of that moderation? Or do you think there’s a multiyear potential capital investment program around the corner? And I guess in general, can you just talk about what you think of the capital intensity rather of incremental B2C from here in the U.S. Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: So again, our theme is better, not bigger, optimizing the capacity that we have. And we have capacity to handle the peak volume that we are anticipating this year. There are capacity constraints in the United States, which gives opportunity to manage through with pricing, also opportunities to manage with our customers. As a former retailer, I know this very well, how to manage through, when you have promotions, how long you have promotions, how you use your store base, how you use our access points. Don’t forget that we have over 15,000 access points that we can be used to address the capacity issues. So we are feeling very good about peak this year. And as we look forward, it’s about right-sizing optimizing the investments that we had before we think about continued investments in capital. It’s about being better, not bigger.\nBrian Newman: Carol, maybe I’ll just add on the CapEx piece. We spent the last three years building capacity in automation. And so we’re now reaching 85% in the U.S. system. So we feel pretty good about our ability to manage that volume. And as we’re not chasing any volume or any package at any price, we think we’ll be selective in terms of what goes through the network.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.\nBen Hartford: Hey, good morning. Carol, just interested in your perspective on the multiyear transformation efforts. What you may or may not change, what you like or don’t like about what’s been undertaken to date. And just the pathway as you kind of finish up here over the next year and a half. And related to that, maybe Brian, could you provide any perspective on the previous guidance that you had provided in terms of the incremental EPS benefit by 2022 of $1 to $1.20, where that may sit given some of the changes here particularly year to date, and what changes or improvements could come to affect that number? Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Well, on transformation 1.0, I think that’s what you’re referring to. We began that in 2018 and on a gross basis life to date, we recognized $2.5 billion of savings. We have reinvested a good piece of that. On a net basis $1.1 billion in savings and tax effected, it’s about $0.95 of EPS on a cumulative basis. That’s not enough, candidly. It’s great. Take credit for that. It’s not enough. We have initiatives underway, we’re calling it, Transformation 2.0 and 3.0 to drive continued productivity and efficiency in our company. Part of this will be enabled by technology. We are moving from my company as an example, that what was really stuck in a static business logic environment. And that resulted in a lot of overhead doing a lot of reports, looking through the rear view mirror to drive the company. We’re moving to analytical decisions science as Juan and his team, build out our digital factory, and that’s going to free up productivity. That will absolutely free up productivity. Until this year, believe it or not, we only had two IT releases a year. We now are moving into a continuous release as we move into a more agile environment. And that’s critically important in terms of taking costs out of this company. We used to code everything ourselves. We had every application running on a mainframe. We now only have four applications running on our mainframes, and we’re moving everything up to the cloud. We have 25 systems or applications in the cloud, another 20 in flight and more to do. This will get rid of some of the tech debt that we carry and free up expense dollars. There’s a lot going on. And the ability to transform the way we run our business. The thing that I’ve observed that haven’t quite cracked and we’re quite good at, we have absolutely no leverage in our [indiscernible] we need to drive more leverage and our payroll given it’s the largest expense that we have. Now, IT will help with that. And it certainly has helped, but we need to double down on how we can automate the inside of our facilities to drive more productivity. For example, I recently saw an automated label application by a robot. It was pretty cool. It’s not ready for prime time, the cost curve isn’t right. But it was pretty cool because the productivity of that arm was 50% higher than a human being. So imagine what we could do if we could drive some productivity and leverage in our payroll, it would be transformative. So expect to hear us talk about that over time.\nBrian Newman: And Ben just to follow-up, I think Carol answered it, the second half of your question on the $1 to $1.10. We’re approaching $1 we have a year left in that Transformation 1.0 program. So we’re on track to deliver. I think the more exciting focus now is Transformation 2.0 and 3.0, how do we really change the game on a profit per piece, linking back to the productivity.\nOperator: Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks operator. Good morning, everybody. Carol, congrats on the appointment as CEO. If this sounds like it’s TSR for UPS, which may be the case. Just in that context, I was hoping you can expand on the commentary of excess cost that can be removed. Is it $500 million, is it $1 billion, just any sense of how much is being left on the table, so to speak because of the over-engineering and whatever the commentary you just mentioned actually. And how fast can you adjust the cost structure, given the size and scope with UPS? And then also capacity and capital, it’s a big focus area for you. Should we expect near-term cuts in CapEx intensity? Capital spending for UPS is, I don’t need to tell. You have increased $5 billion in the last four years, but the domestic margins have contracted 500 basis points. So is that something we should also expect. Can you address those points, please?\nCarol Tomé: Yes. I’m happy to do so. TSR for UPS is the name of the game. We are all in. And as a leadership team, this is what we talk about as we get together on a weekly, hourly basis. How can we get more out of the assets that we have invested? So thank you for mentioning that, I came to UPS for a few reasons. One, because I love this company; two, because I want to make an impact on our people and three, I want to get the stock price moving. It’s all about creating value for our shareholders. And you do that through effective capital allocation. It starts with how you allocate capital. And I will say that we have not gotten the returns that we should have delivered on some of the capital investments that we made. For all whole kinds of reasons, and it’s not – we don’t need to look back for those reasons, but looking forward, it’s just we’re going to have a different lens on how we allocate capital. As we’ve talked this morning, I gave an example of not buying aircraft to have excess capacity, that would have been value destroying. So we opted not to make that capital investment. We will get the network righted before we think about investing more dollars in the network. That suggests lower capital intensity going forward. To your question about, well, okay, great, I get the capital, which is the denominator side. How do you fix the numerator? Or how much cost can you take out? How you’re going to fix the revenue? How are you going to get the cost out? I don’t like anything unless it starts with a B, because it’s just not worth our time. We’re focusing on the wildly important here. So if it’s not worth – if it doesn’t start with a B, we’re not doing it. So that gives you a sense of the cost that we’re looking to take out.\nOperator: Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAllison Landry: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask a little bit more of a follow-up question on the conversation of capital efficiency and specifically your thoughts on the returns on incremental invested capital. So you mentioned that at least for the near-term to mid-term you’re to try to more with less at an that should translate into perhaps some lower CapEx levels. But maybe you think about longer-term and what could be the requirements of the business for that technology or for something for speeding up the network. Do you think relative to what UPS has historically delivered from a return on incremental invested capital standpoint? Can you get back to maybe prior peak or that not the right way to think about that? So any thoughts on capital efficiency would be great. Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Well, Allison I’ll start that. From a return on invested capital, look, we’ve gone down about 400 basis points as we look back the last couple of years on ROIC. We’re very focused on moving that in the opposite direction, moving it up. We’re down in the low 20’s right now. I think you’re referring to the peak where we were in the high 20’s. It’ll take some time to get back in towards that trajectory. But there’s a base level of CapEx that we’re going to need to spend, call it $2.5 billion to $3 billion on maintenance and that’s ongoing. But everything above that that we’ve been spending on capacity and growth is getting looked at through a different lens. And Carol alluded to it, from a TSR we’re very focused on the cash returns and looking at the annual payback and how long the payback is. So I think you can look for us to drive improved ROIC. I think the pace will give you some more clarity on that when we come out with guidance. Carol, would you add anything?\nCarol Tomé: The only thing I would add is that value is defined by what the customer is willing to pay for. And if we’re spending on capital on enabling capabilities or services or products that they’re not willing to pay for, I don’t know why we would spend that capital. So we are bringing a different lens. It’s value defined by what the customer is willing to.\nAllison Landry: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning, Carol, again, congrats and welcome. And Brian, look forward to working with you both. You mentioned – just real quickly, you mentioned the weaker domestic in the second half. You mentioned some longer-term thoughts international. Did I hear you say that international will stay at these levels in the second half? I just want clarity on that. And then digging into the second half domestic margins, Brian, is that time in transit, is that – are these kind of the startup costs and that’s going away? Or are you looking maybe – Carol, your thoughts on your long-term thoughts on getting back to that double digit margin or is it beyond that given these moves you’re talking about?\nBrian Newman: So, Ken, thanks for the question. I’ll start with the domestic piece in terms of the back half. Yes, Carol alluded to the investments in time and transit, and we think that’s a critical investment to continue to invest to drive the service for our customers and speed up time and transit. We’ve got a handful of one-off items that I think I alluded to. There’s a land sale, fuel excise tax, management incentive. Those are all laps, but they add up to a couple hundred million dollars. So it’s a meaningful number. There’s also a benefit catch up in terms of expense. We put on about 40,000 heads to handle the volume surge in the second quarter. So that will be coming back in terms of benefits, if you’re full time, your benefits kick in at 30 days, if you’re part time, it kicks in about six months. So you’ll see those creep up. But that’s why I provided the caution on the back half of the year. Longer-term though, I think the steps we’re taking will drive the overall improvement in domestic margins. On the international side, I think you saw a large peak in the middle of the quarter coming out of Asia with the additional flights. And so I think that would moderate balance of the year. And Ken, as we’ve talked before, I think the focus in international it’s on EBIT dollars, because I think the team really have an opportunity to drive their share at those elevated margin levels. So margin may not stay at this level, but as you think about the future EBITDA will and there are certainly 2x the domestic margins, a very attractive growth. Carol, anything to add on domestic and international?\nCarol Tomé: Just perhaps on the growth side. Our volume will be up in the back half. It’s just the growth rates won’t be the same. And I just want to make sure we’re really clear on that. I don’t want to have any confusion there. And on the international side, I think our margin will be quite healthy in the back half.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Ken.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks. Appreciate that.\nOperator: Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Hey, good morning and thank you for taking my question. So I just wanted to focus on the growth that you’re seeing within B2B and e-commerce in your international markets. And maybe e-commerce adoption in the international markets as well. To what degree is this potentially a headwind to profitability and margins internationally as we sort of look forward, as we sort of see e-commerce and B2C grow there? Or are there some differences in terms of how that market is structured or how you’re network is structured that would make that not the case. Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Yes. Our international business is quite different than the domestic business. It’s an asset light outside service provider in many of the markets in which we serve. We actually like this cross border opportunity to grow B2C business, and the margins are quite healthy.\nScott Childress: This is Scott. We’ve got time for one more question before we wrap up.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Yes. Carol, in your 17 years on the UPS board, you’ve witnessed several substantial changes in the competitive landscape for the company. And you’ve been part of steering the board strategy to bring in some more outside perspectives and the senior management, which has certainly seemed to reach a new level, appointing you as CEO here. Can you give the investors some board level perspective on that evolution and thinking UPS is a storage strategy from promoting from within. And any thoughts on where the cultural shift that UPS has headed over the next several years with you at the helm? Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Yes. We’re a big believer as a board and the company’s culture, because we think it is a competitive point of differentiation. As the board looked at CEO succession, they came up with a qualification, if you will, of what the next CEO should possess in terms of experience, in terms of just knowledge in certain areas. And they map that up against both internal and external candidates. Obviously, I wasn’t part of that, but there was a search committee that was formed and they looked at, here are the qualifications of the next CEO. And they looked at our internal team as well as external team and decided to go outside for the role. And I was delighted that they asked me to take the role. It’s because of the time that we’re in. As I look to the future of UPS, my goal is to get CEO succession ready candidate. So then when it’s time for me to move on and actually retire, because I have been retired. But when it’s time for me to move on, we have ready now candidates inside the company to promote. The big believer and investing in people to help them get to their highest potential, whatever it may be. So don’t expect to see a big cultural shift just because I came in for this time. And I am delighted to be here. It’s an awesome leadership team. They’re in the room with me today, giving me support just for answering your questions. We really do appreciate all the thoughtful questions that came to Brian and me today. So thank you for that. And Scott, I’ll turn it back to you.\nScott Childress: Final comments, we just want to thank you for joining us today. We wish you a very good remainder of your day. And then we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. And that concludes the call. Thank you.",

            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol and good morning. Today, I will discuss our quarterly performance and current trends in our business, which the teams are navigating well. Before I start, I want to point out the expanded disclosure in our web schedules. To improve transparency, we brought the 10-Q balance sheet and cash flow statements forward and have included them in the materials released today. Through the second quarter, we face challenges from the coronavirus pandemic and resulting recession. Global real GDP and global industrial production are estimated to be down 9.3% and 14.6% respectively. And in the U.S., real GDP and industrial production declined with unemployment reaching historic highs. In response, we adjusted our network to support our customers' needs. We manage costs and leaned into three significant changes in demand in the markets we serve. First, our ability to shift air capacity to where it was needed enabled us to meet the strong demand out of Asia, using both our own assets and asset-light solutions. We met the demand for more capacity by flying about 635 extra flights using both brown tail and third-party aircraft. Next during the quarter, the U.S. e-commerce market jumped 34.4% and SMB is quickly adapted to participate. In fact, through our digital access program, we captured 120,000 new customer accounts, a significant increase from recent trends. And finally, our healthcare expertise and global portfolio of services enabled us to meet the urgent need for PPE and COVID-19 testing supplies, and provide support for vaccine and treatment studies. All of which, contributed to our results in each of our three segments. For the quarter, consolidated revenue increased 13.4% to $20.5 billion. Net income rose 8.8% to $1.9 billion and operating profit totaled $2.3 billion or 7.4% higher than last year. The operating margin for the company was 11.4% below last year by 60 basis points, diluted earnings per share was $2.13, up 8.7% from the same period last year. Now moving into the segments. In U.S. Domestic, market demand for residential delivery surged in the quarter, driving total average daily volume up to 21.1 million packages, an increase of 22.8%. SurePost increased 96.6% and represented 53% of our total U.S. Domestic volume growth. Volume approached peak like levels with May and June, significantly above April. The surge created some network constraints and some regional dips in service levels. However, the additional 39,000 employees, we hired together with our expanded weekend operations enabled us to process the increase in volume. Ground residential volume, excluding SurePost was up 63.8%, without exception, all industry sectors grew the residential volume. In fact, B2C volume jumped 65.2% year-over-year, which is 5.8 million additional pieces per day, and B2C represented 69% of total volume. Conversely, given the downturn in the industrial sector, B2B volume declined 21.9% or 1.8 million pieces per day from the same period last year. However, we did see B2B volume begin to recover in the quarter. As a percentage of total volume, B2B shipments were 27% in early May. And at the end of the quarter, B2B shipments had climbed to 37% of total U.S. volume. For some context, the full year 2019 split was 46% B2B. While average daily volume growth was led by many of our larger customers, SMBs rebounded over the quarter, from a decline of 7.2% in April to growth of 17.8% in May and 22.4% in June. Revenue was up 17.3% to $13 billion, driven primarily by ground products. Revenue per piece declined 4.4% or 440 basis points, driven by two significant factors, lower fuel prices, which were a negative impact of 180 basis points, and the magnitude of SurePost growth pulled revenue per piece down 410 basis points. Excluding SurePost and the fuel surcharge, revenue per piece was higher than last year, and was also a sequential improvement from the first quarter. Our expenses increased in the quarter by 19.5% and we're in line with activity levels, including volume growth. Our expenses also includes several items that we did not have last year, which I'll cover in a moment. Cost per piece was down 2.7% year-over-year and decreased sequentially 8.4%, driven by lower fuel costs and our ability to scale and flex the network as volume surged. The U.S. generated $1.2 billion in operating profit, which was $11 million or 0.9% below last year. Operating margin declined 170 basis points year-over-year. However, sequential margins improved 580 basis points. U.S. Domestic operating profit includes the following expense items, coronavirus direct expenses, minus the CARES Act, federal excise tax benefit lowered profit by $44 million. A lower pension discount rate decreased profit by $63 million. Additional employee incentives reduced profit by $51 million, and working in our favor were lower fuel cost for a net fuel benefit of $61 million. We are operating in a very difficult environment and we have more work ahead of us to increase profit per piece, which was down 19.3% on a year-over-year basis. Moving forward, our focus is on improving network efficiency, optimizing the volume we bring in and better aligning pricing with the value we provide. Moving to International, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate our entire international team for delivering a very strong quarter, despite a tough operating environment. Our performance demonstrates the agility of our global integrated network. Asia was the first region to face the pandemic and was also the first to reopen, which led to a strong increase in export volume and revenue as we came out of the first quarter. Asia outbound volume rose in April, peaked in May, and moderated in June. Overall, Asia outbound volume grew 46.8% in the quarter and went up by double digits to all major regions of the world. Total export volume grew 11.4% driven by two factors. First, we quickly leaned into the opportunity created by the reduction of passenger belly space. We also added capacity surcharges to help us manage demand. In total, we added 335 flights and utilized our higher capacity fleet of 747 aircrafts, which enabled us to handle more volume on fewer flights versus other carriers in the market. The second factor was the 95% increase in residential volume, led by cross border B2C in Europe, doubling our B2C volume, while expanding profits is an encouraging sign for the future. Revenue rose 5.7% to $3.7 billion. Revenue per piece was down 3.9% and included a decline of 480 basis points from fuel, and 100 basis points from currency. On the expense side, cost per piece declined 8.2%, primarily due to lower fuel costs and greater network efficiencies. International generated operating profit of $842 million, an increase of 26.6%, and our operating margin expanded 370 basis points. Looking at Supply Chain and Freight, results across the business units were mixed. Total revenue grew 8.5% to $3.7 billion, and expense rose 9.4% to $3.4 billion. Profit declined $6 million or 2.2%. In general, the parts of our business that aligned to sectors with elevated demand did very well. For example, air freight led the segment due to the surge in market rates out of Asia, sparked by the sharp decline in passenger belly space. The team was responsive to our customer's needs, including FEMA and resourceful in securing about 300 charters out of Asia. We also saw gains from COVID testing in vaccine and treatment studies. The portions of the Supply Chain and Freight segment, more aligned to industrial activity saw weakness during the quarter. LTL and truckload brokerage faced excess capacity and reduce demand early in the quarter. Both markets began to see some recovery later in the quarter, but remain under pressure. Looking at the overall enterprise, UPS generated operating profit of $2.3 billion up 7.4%. A few other items on the income statement include, other pension income, which was $327 million driven by last year 17.5% return on pension assets and lower discount rates. We also had $183 million of interest expense. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 25% compared to 23.5% in the second quarter of last year and is higher mainly due to unfavorable changes in our uncertain tax positions. Now let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. Our cash flow remains strong. For the first six months of the year, we generated $5.9 billion in cash from operations, and about $3.9 billion in free cash flow, included in our results is $370 million from the federal payroll tax deferral. Capital investments totaled $2.1 billion in the first half of the year. We expect full year CapEx of $5.6 billion and remain on track with our automation targets for this year. So far this year, UPS has distributed $1.8 billion in dividends, which represents a 5.2% increase on a per share basis over the same period last year. Now I'll make a few comments regarding the back half of the year. First, we remain unable to predict the extent of the business impact or the duration of the coronavirus pandemic or reasonably estimate UPS 2020 revenue and diluted earnings per share. There are however, a few items that are likely to occur in the second half of the year that we want you to know about. U.S. Domestic average daily volume growth is expected to be lower than what we saw in the second quarter. We expect demand for residential packages will continue in the U.S. and around the world. We also expect Asia outbound demand and yields to be positive year-over-year, but we'll continue to moderate versus the second quarter. For modeling purposes, our Teamster employees will get their annual wage increase in August. And in the third quarter of 2019, we had a $40 million gain on a land sale in the international segment that will not repeat. And in the second half of 2020, U.S. Domestic will face difficult year-over-year comps, including the impact of our new hires anticipated to receive full benefits, time and transit, and weekend operations expense, preceding the full run rate of revenue, and other gains from last year that will not repeat. The economic recovery remains uncertain. We are paying close attention to the consumer financial health, unemployment levels and the continuation of fiscal stimulus programs. Given all these factors, the U.S. Domestic margin could be lower in the second half of the year, relative to the first half. International, Supply Chain and Freight will continue to adapt to market dynamics. Meanwhile, as Carol said, we will focus on controlling what we control. Among the positive and negative effects ahead of us, we remain confident in our ability to improve U.S. margins on a long-term basis. Our liquidity is very strong. We ended the quarter with more than $8 billion in cash and equivalence on the balance sheet, which is enabling us to invest through this unique environment and navigate the economic uncertainty. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines. And Jordan, if I can just add, the B2C growth in Europe in the quarter or in international in the quarter was up 95%. And so I think the combination of the shift towards B2C and their ability to expand margins was another proof point of why we're confident in that model. Yes. I just say, as we peel that business apart, I think I had mentioned it in my script. But as we extract the SurePost product, it gives us some encouraging signs for the underlying pricing health of the business within B2C. Because pricing, if you exclude SurePost, Carol, and fuel, we were up 1.5%, and that's better than the last three or four quarters. So it's encouraging signs for how we're managing B2C. So maybe I'll take that one, Scott. And Carol can chime in. The B2B growth was down 22% in the quarter. In terms of the evolution, we actually saw that number get better. It was still down overall. But April, May, June, as it progressed, we started the quarter down 38%. Got a little better down 20%, finished June at down 8% in terms of how we're seeing it play out in this next quarter that we're holding at about the June levels down, 9-ish in the month of July, as we think about the B2B business. So SMBs, which we're also very focused on, they were up 11% in the quarter. So as we think about our small and medium businesses, we're seeing those June trends of growth continue into July in the high teens range. Carol, anything to add? Carol, maybe I'll just add on the CapEx piece. We spent the last three years building capacity in automation. And so we're now reaching 85% in the U.S. system. So we feel pretty good about our ability to manage that volume. And as we're not chasing any volume or any package at any price, we think we'll be selective in terms of what goes through the network. And Ben just to follow-up, I think Carol answered it, the second half of your question on the $1 to $1.10. We're approaching $1 we have a year left in that Transformation 1.0 program. So we're on track to deliver. I think the more exciting focus now is Transformation 2.0 and 3.0, how do we really change the game on a profit per piece, linking back to the productivity. Well, Allison I'll start that. From a return on invested capital, look, we've gone down about 400 basis points as we look back the last couple of years on ROIC. We're very focused on moving that in the opposite direction, moving it up. We're down in the low 20's right now. I think you're referring to the peak where we were in the high 20's. It'll take some time to get back in towards that trajectory. But there's a base level of CapEx that we're going to need to spend, call it $2.5 billion to $3 billion on maintenance and that's ongoing. But everything above that that we've been spending on capacity and growth is getting looked at through a different lens. And Carol alluded to it, from a TSR we're very focused on the cash returns and looking at the annual payback and how long the payback is. So I think you can look for us to drive improved ROIC. I think the pace will give you some more clarity on that when we come out with guidance. Carol, would you add anything? So, Ken, thanks for the question. I'll start with the domestic piece in terms of the back half. Yes, Carol alluded to the investments in time and transit, and we think that's a critical investment to continue to invest to drive the service for our customers and speed up time and transit. We've got a handful of one-off items that I think I alluded to. There's a land sale, fuel excise tax, management incentive. Those are all laps, but they add up to a couple hundred million dollars. So it's a meaningful number. There's also a benefit catch up in terms of expense. We put on about 40,000 heads to handle the volume surge in the second quarter. So that will be coming back in terms of benefits, if you're full time, your benefits kick in at 30 days, if you're part time, it kicks in about six months. So you'll see those creep up. But that's why I provided the caution on the back half of the year. Longer-term though, I think the steps we're taking will drive the overall improvement in domestic margins. On the international side, I think you saw a large peak in the middle of the quarter coming out of Asia with the additional flights. And so I think that would moderate balance of the year. And Ken, as we've talked before, I think the focus in international it's on EBIT dollars, because I think the team really have an opportunity to drive their share at those elevated margin levels. So margin may not stay at this level, but as you think about the future EBITDA will and there are certainly 2x the domestic margins, a very attractive growth. Carol, anything to add on domestic and international? Thanks, Ken."

            "name": "Carol Tomé",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott and good morning. I'm honored to be hosting my first UPS earnings call. Before I begin, I would like to thank David Abney, who after 46 years of service to UPS passed the baton to me on June 1. We wish David all the best. UPS is a special company with a unique culture powered by more than 528,000 UPSers around the world. Through this time of global pandemic and social unrest, UPS is keeping the world moving. We have taken measures to ensure the safety of our people, while delivering critical shipments and everyday essential, where and when they are needed. I am extremely proud of the efforts of our people to serve our customers, our communities, and each other. To all UPSers, thank you. During the quarter, our team did a great job adjusting the network to respond to the needs of our customers. At the beginning of the second quarter, we assumed demand would slow. Instead, we saw just the opposite. Due to ongoing COVID-related sheltering in place, retail store closures and changes in U.S. consumer spending fueled by the economic stimulus, we experienced unprecedented demand and record high volume levels. As a result, our second quarter performance was stronger than we expected. Consolidated revenue rose 13.4% from last year to $20.5 billion. Operating profit grew 7.4% from last year to $2.3 billion, led by outstanding results in the international segment, while our U.S. operating margin declined by 170 basis points from last year, largely due to certain expense items that Brian will explain. We were pleased with 580 basis points of sequential improvement from what we reported in the first quarter. Let me share with you how I've been spending my time since onboarding as CEO. I thought, I knew UPS after 17 years on the board, but I've been diving in and believe me, when you get to dive deeper, this company is even more impressive than I imagined. Our global network is best-in-class and our people are the hardest working people I've ever met. We also have many opportunities. In our 113 year history, UPS has become a trusted global logistics leader. But what got us where we are today will not get us to where we need to go in the future. Our customers are changing, our competitors are changing and the rate of change is accelerating. As we evaluate new market realities, we will be making decisions faster based on data and analytics with an emphasis on optimizing our existing network and the investments we've made. We will have a laser focus on creating value for our shareowners, with the goal of increasing the rates of return on the capital we invest. It's all about becoming better, not bigger. We have five core UPS principles that underpin our actions. Our first principle is our values. These values were established by our Founder, Jim Casey, and give us an enduring foundation for success. Our values include integrity, safety, teamwork and service, and are the core of who we are and what we do. Our second principle is our dividend, which is a hallmark of our financial strength. We are committed to continuing nearly 50 years of stability and growth in the dividends we pay. Our third guiding principle is retaining a strong investment grade credit rating, ensuring that we have financial flexibility needed to competitively run our business. Next is brand relevance. And by relevance, we mean leading by example, taking actions to support our customers and communities, promote diversity and inclusion, sponsor racial equality and shape a healthier planet. And finally, our fifth principle is the importance of employee ownership, which supports valuable and lasting employee and retiree engagement. Outside of these five core principles, everything else in our portfolio is under review, and I mean everything. While it is early in the process, the good news is that we already have the right strategy in place. Customer first, people led, innovation driven. Customer first is about removing friction when doing business with UPS. Speeding up time and transit and improving the moments that matter. So we create greater loyalty to be measured by gains and our net promoter score. In support of this effort, we have accelerated our plans to improve time and transit, making the U.S. ground networks faster and thousands of the most important lanes by the end of this year. Further, we are continuing our expansion of weekend operations, including Sunday share post and our market leading Saturday commercial delivery and pickup services. Before our 2020 peak season, nearly 75% of the U.S. population will get Saturday ground residential service. By our estimate, both our time and transit and weekend enhancements drove roughly $100 million of incremental revenue in the second quarter. People led is at the core of our success, measure it through the employee experience and specifically how likely an employee is to recommend UPS as a place to work. We are focused on diversity and inclusion and fighting for racial justice and reform. I cannot say enough about the power of our people, including the nearly 40,000 new UPSers, we've added to our U.S. Small Package business in recent months. During this time, we've provided additional sick leave benefits to UPSers who may have been impacted by COVID-19. And to further invest in our full time management teams for their extraordinary efforts, we are providing additional financial incentives. Moving to the last leg of our strategic platform. Innovation driven will be measured by the value we create for our shareowners. We will leverage our technology and portfolio of services to drive greater cash generation and higher returns on invested capital. Today, we are focused on increasing network efficiency, as well as more permanent actions to improve revenue quality, including pricing that reflects the value we create. For example, on May 31, we introduced new surcharges of certain volumes. We are developing specific actions and metrics against our strategic efforts. And once finalized, we'll share them with you, so that you can measure our progress. Looking to the back half of the year. Most scenarios suggest continued uncertainty, which is likely to yield a more gradual economic recovery. This is due in part to the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, new containment measures and the status of fiscal stimulus program. While we would expect continued strong B2C demand, it's hard to know how our B2B demand will unfold. The recovery will continue to be extremely difficult to predict until the spread of the virus is better controlled and a vaccine is widely available. I've led through difficult economic cycles before, and I know the power of making the right decisions to pivot toward opportunity. Our leadership team is focused on enabling success for all UPSers and creating value for our shareowners. We will control what we can control, while taking action to write the next chapter of the UPS story. We look forward to updating you on our progress. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Good morning. Yes. Thanks for the question on peak. As a leadership team, we've agreed, we are going to have an outstanding peak season. I participated in my first peak planning committee several weeks after I joined the company and very impressed by how we are planning to manage through, what could be a very peaky season, is about making sure that we've got our network aligned both on the high end and on the low end, because it's uncertain out there. So we're building an optionality, in terms of how we're going to run the network. And then Kate with her team are talking to our customers customer-by-customer and how we will best manage through peak. Yes. Absolutely happy to share some perspective. As Brian said, it's – our operating margin in the U.S. domestic business could be lower in the back half of the year than what we reported in the first half of the year. Lot of uncertainty in the marketplace, of course, but we thought it was helpful for Brian to kick out some of the expense related items that we're pretty sure will happen, because we're not terribly sure about the demand side. Now longer term, this is where we're very excited about what we're going to do with our company. In my prepared remarks, I've talked about, it's all about being better, not bigger. What do I mean by that? Well, just a couple of things. This may be a longer-winded answer then you're looking for. But I'll go ahead and take the opportunity to share with you, what I mean by that and what we mean by that. First, we are an engineering-driven company, you would expect us to be. But like any company who was 113 years old, we've over engineered much of what we've done. And I'll give you an example of that, depending on how you define products, we have between 400 and 500 products. We kicked off a task force to say, really, are we selling all of those products? Because when you think about it, if you have between 400 and 500 products, you have to build systems and technology to support those products, you have to build accountants to account for those products. You have to have auditors who audit for those products. And then you have to have salespeople who sell those products. As we looked at it, and it's very early days, we found that last year, there were over 100 of those products that we didn't even sell. So we're going to rationalize our product offering to make it simpler for our customers and reduce expense here. As we think about optimizing the network to your specific question on volume, it's about being better, not bigger. What we have done in the past is built capacity or bought capacity, and the hope that demand would follow. And we would take demand at any cost or any price, if you will. Not necessarily nutritive demand. So let me give you an example of a change, that we've just launched this year. We love our air fleet and in fact, about 11% of our air fleet are wide-body planes, these are 747 planes. And we took advantage of those wide bodies in the second quarter. We were able to fly demand out of Asia at a very effective cost, because they're wide bodies. We didn't have to fly as many planes. So we had an opportunity to buy more of those 747s because they're coming up production. And the question that we asked ourselves is, well, won't that create excess capacity? And won't we find that we'll need to fill that capacity at perhaps non-nutritive ways. And the answer to that question was, yes. So we passed on that investment that in the past we might have made. So we're going to really look to sweat the assets that we have to get more off of that investment that we've made over time. We will look to pivot the customer and the way we go-to-market to optimize the network. And I hope that answers your question. Yes. The easy way to think about profit growth is of course with pricing increases. And as you know, we did take some short surcharge increases at the end of May, but it's much more than pricing. It's really about optimizing the network and leaning into the customer segments that value the end-to-end network that we offer. And one of those segments is small and medium-sized businesses. And you heard Brian talk about the growth that we saw in that space in the second quarter up 11%. As I look at our small and medium-size customer base, we divide it into four big segments D1 through D4, that's based on customer size. D1 and D2 customer segments, we've got pretty good market share there. But in D3 and D4, we're underpenetrated relative to our competitors. We have an opportunity to grow into that space, but we need some enabling capabilities. The number one enabling capability to grow into that space is time and transit. So when I came onto the company and I looked at our time and transit activities we used to call that Panthera. We now called our fastest time – our Fastest Ground Ever. I saw that, we were planning to conclude that investment in June of 2021. I asked the team, well, what's getting in the way. What's getting in the way of going faster and they said money, I'm like, well, we've got money. So we'll accelerate the investment. We pull that investment into 2020. We will complete time and transit by October of this year. And that's a big deal because 46% of our SMB customers or potential customers tell us, time and transit is the number one thing on their mind. When we're done, we will be at parity or better in 20 of the 25 markets that matter in the U.S. We will reach 90% of the U.S. population in three days, 75% of the U.S. population will have Saturday delivery. And then of course, we have Sunday delivery through our SurePost product. This matters. And why am I focusing on SMB? Because the SMB customer values are end-to-end network and they pay us for it. As we think about leaning into SMBs, it's not just about time and transit, however. It's also about a better customer experience. This goes back to being better, not bigger. We had a couple of pilots that we launched to really understand that customer and what their wants, needs and desires were. We listened to them. We operationalized what they wanted. And in the pilots, we saw 2 percentage point reduction in churn. Now that matters because in this segment, for every reduction in churn, it's $170 million in revenue. And that revenue is a much better quality than other revenue. So as we think about moving the U.S. operating margin up, there's a real opportunity to lean into a different customer segment and to make sure that we're getting value for the services we provide. That's on the revenue side. But I must talk about the cost side too, for a moment, because we have opportunities there as well. We've talked to you in the past about Transformation 1.0. And we're well down the path of Transformation 1.0. And in fact, if you look at it life to date, on a net basis after investing, we have delivered over $1 billion of savings in Transformation 1.0. That's on a cumulative basis. If you tax effects that and use the outstanding shares, it's about $0.95 of EPS on a cumulative basis. We're not done. Productivity and efficiency must be the hallmark of UPS. So we have initial plans for Transformation 2.0 and 3.0, which when they are finalized, we will share those with you. We also are using technology to drive productivity and efficiency in our operations. And I can just give you a comment on how we're seeing that perform. We've talked to you in the past about ORION. We have ORION 3.0 out. We're seeing a reduction in the miles that our drivers are driving and a reduction in the per piece cost. Now this is virtuous, it's continuous, but the combination of rightsizing the revenue and driving productivity and efficiency gives us a path to drive operating margin expansion in the U.S. This is a big company to turn. You can't do it overnight, but if you look through 2020 into 2021 and beyond, you should expect the margin to start to go in the right direction. We were thrilled with our performance in our international segments and we expect them to have a very good back half as well. That model is a very different model than the one we run in inside the United States. It's an asset-light outside service provider model. So the margins will always be stronger outside of the United States than they are inside the United States. And we view that as a competitive opportunity for us, candidly. We've identified 10 growth markets that we will grow into. We'll be updating you as those opportunities present themselves. In the second quarter, we did enter into an alliance with a firm in Mexico. We're very excited about that, because that's one of our top 10 growth markets and we will now have the leading capabilities in Mexico, both inside Mexico and exporting out. So look for good things to come out of our international. I'm happy to do so. First, let me talk about my learnings during the last recession, which was housing-led recession. And my former employer, we felt it hard. They lost 25% of the top line during that recession. Two key learnings during that time. One, invest through the crisis. No better opportunity, if you have the financial wherewithal to do so, to invest through the crisis. So that when things settle down, you are positioned to take share. And that's what we're doing with time and transit. Our time and transit investment this year is $750 million. We could have canceled that. But we said, no, we're going to pull that board. And we're going to invest through the crisis. My second learning is to invest in your people. Now it doesn't mean that you don't have a fewer people in a downturn, but for those people that you have, you need to invest in. And if you looked at our population of UPSers, actually we're down in Supply Chain and Freight, as you would expect, because the demand softened up there. But for the people who are left behind, we are investing in them, because it creates loyalty and better experience and better service for our customers. So we're investing in incentives for our people. We've been promoting people. It pays huge dividends if you stay true to your people. Those are very good learnings in a downturn. Learnings as a retailer, is that when cost increases come your way, if you are a large retailer, you can pass those costs increases across the SKU base, and the customers don't know. So while retailers may squawk at price increases that come their way, large retailers have a way to spread that across. And nobody knows. So there's an opportunity here on the pricing side to do what we need to do. From a customer concentration perspective, I looked at our top 20 customers and their performance in the second quarter and of those top 20 customers, all but one group, the only one that didn't grow was government. And I can't tell you why, but it didn't grow. But if I look at our top 20 customers who are retailers, who were predominantly store-based retailers, who when their stores closed and demand shifted online, well for those customers, they had triple-digit growth in the second quarter. Our largest customer did not have triple-digit growth. So that gives you some perspective on how we manage through customer concentration and how we're thinking about optimizing the portfolio long-term. Well, maybe I'll start. Brian, you can chime in. I just looked at our ground business and we break our ground business into four segments. There's 100 weight in commercial, so that's more industrial. Then there's ground resi, which is going to be predominantly B2C and SurePost. If I look at the profitability of ground resi, which now makes up 44% of our total ground business in the U.S. The profitability was up year-on-year. We're taking actions actually to drive profitability in the business. And Brian, do you want to add any more color to that? I think the stability invest new, it's not getting worse, not getting better, but it's not getting worse on the pure B2B. So again, our theme is better, not bigger, optimizing the capacity that we have. And we have capacity to handle the peak volume that we are anticipating this year. There are capacity constraints in the United States, which gives opportunity to manage through with pricing, also opportunities to manage with our customers. As a former retailer, I know this very well, how to manage through, when you have promotions, how long you have promotions, how you use your store base, how you use our access points. Don't forget that we have over 15,000 access points that we can be used to address the capacity issues. So we are feeling very good about peak this year. And as we look forward, it's about right-sizing optimizing the investments that we had before we think about continued investments in capital. It's about being better, not bigger. Well, on transformation 1.0, I think that's what you're referring to. We began that in 2018 and on a gross basis life to date, we recognized $2.5 billion of savings. We have reinvested a good piece of that. On a net basis $1.1 billion in savings and tax effected, it's about $0.95 of EPS on a cumulative basis. That's not enough, candidly. It's great. Take credit for that. It's not enough. We have initiatives underway, we're calling it, Transformation 2.0 and 3.0 to drive continued productivity and efficiency in our company. Part of this will be enabled by technology. We are moving from my company as an example, that what was really stuck in a static business logic environment. And that resulted in a lot of overhead doing a lot of reports, looking through the rear view mirror to drive the company. We're moving to analytical decisions science as Juan and his team, build out our digital factory, and that's going to free up productivity. That will absolutely free up productivity. Until this year, believe it or not, we only had two IT releases a year. We now are moving into a continuous release as we move into a more agile environment. And that's critically important in terms of taking costs out of this company. We used to code everything ourselves. We had every application running on a mainframe. We now only have four applications running on our mainframes, and we're moving everything up to the cloud. We have 25 systems or applications in the cloud, another 20 in flight and more to do. This will get rid of some of the tech debt that we carry and free up expense dollars. There's a lot going on. And the ability to transform the way we run our business. The thing that I've observed that haven't quite cracked and we're quite good at, we have absolutely no leverage in our [indiscernible] we need to drive more leverage and our payroll given it's the largest expense that we have. Now, IT will help with that. And it certainly has helped, but we need to double down on how we can automate the inside of our facilities to drive more productivity. For example, I recently saw an automated label application by a robot. It was pretty cool. It's not ready for prime time, the cost curve isn't right. But it was pretty cool because the productivity of that arm was 50% higher than a human being. So imagine what we could do if we could drive some productivity and leverage in our payroll, it would be transformative. So expect to hear us talk about that over time. Yes. I'm happy to do so. TSR for UPS is the name of the game. We are all in. And as a leadership team, this is what we talk about as we get together on a weekly, hourly basis. How can we get more out of the assets that we have invested? So thank you for mentioning that, I came to UPS for a few reasons. One, because I love this company; two, because I want to make an impact on our people and three, I want to get the stock price moving. It's all about creating value for our shareholders. And you do that through effective capital allocation. It starts with how you allocate capital. And I will say that we have not gotten the returns that we should have delivered on some of the capital investments that we made. For all whole kinds of reasons, and it's not – we don't need to look back for those reasons, but looking forward, it's just we're going to have a different lens on how we allocate capital. As we've talked this morning, I gave an example of not buying aircraft to have excess capacity, that would have been value destroying. So we opted not to make that capital investment. We will get the network righted before we think about investing more dollars in the network. That suggests lower capital intensity going forward. To your question about, well, okay, great, I get the capital, which is the denominator side. How do you fix the numerator? Or how much cost can you take out? How you're going to fix the revenue? How are you going to get the cost out? I don't like anything unless it starts with a B, because it's just not worth our time. We're focusing on the wildly important here. So if it's not worth – if it doesn't start with a B, we're not doing it. So that gives you a sense of the cost that we're looking to take out. The only thing I would add is that value is defined by what the customer is willing to pay for. And if we're spending on capital on enabling capabilities or services or products that they're not willing to pay for, I don't know why we would spend that capital. So we are bringing a different lens. It's value defined by what the customer is willing to. Just perhaps on the growth side. Our volume will be up in the back half. It's just the growth rates won't be the same. And I just want to make sure we're really clear on that. I don't want to have any confusion there. And on the international side, I think our margin will be quite healthy in the back half. Yes. Our international business is quite different than the domestic business. It's an asset light outside service provider in many of the markets in which we serve. We actually like this cross border opportunity to grow B2C business, and the margins are quite healthy. Yes. We're a big believer as a board and the company's culture, because we think it is a competitive point of differentiation. As the board looked at CEO succession, they came up with a qualification, if you will, of what the next CEO should possess in terms of experience, in terms of just knowledge in certain areas. And they map that up against both internal and external candidates. Obviously, I wasn't part of that, but there was a search committee that was formed and they looked at, here are the qualifications of the next CEO. And they looked at our internal team as well as external team and decided to go outside for the role. And I was delighted that they asked me to take the role. It's because of the time that we're in. As I look to the future of UPS, my goal is to get CEO succession ready candidate. So then when it's time for me to move on and actually retire, because I have been retired. But when it's time for me to move on, we have ready now candidates inside the company to promote. The big believer and investing in people to help them get to their highest potential, whatever it may be. So don't expect to see a big cultural shift just because I came in for this time. And I am delighted to be here. It's an awesome leadership team. They're in the room with me today, giving me support just for answering your questions. We really do appreciate all the thoughtful questions that came to Brian and me today. So thank you for that. And Scott, I'll turn it back to you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations first quarter 2020 earnings call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question and answer period. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nScott Childress: Good morning and welcome to the UPS first quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer, along with International President Nando Cesarone, President of U.S. Operations George Willis, our Chief Information and Engineering Officer Juan Perez, and Scott Price, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we’ll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2019 Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports when filed are available on UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. During the quarter, GAAP results included a pre-tax charge of $45 million or $0.04 per share on an after-tax basis. The charge resulted primarily from transformation-related activities. In the prior year period, adjusted results excluded a pre-tax charge from transformation costs of $123 million or $0.11 per share on an after-tax basis. Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results. The webcast of today’s call along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available on UPS Investor Relations website. Webcast users can submit live questions during the call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. Thank you, and now I’ll turn the call over to David.\nDavid Abney: Thanks Scott, and good morning everyone. I would first like to thank UPSers worldwide for going above and beyond during the coronavirus pandemic. Since this crisis began, we have been operating as a critical infrastructure business leveraging the strength of our global network to keep supply chains moving around the world. People are counting on UPS more than ever before, and I am proud of the heroic actions of our employees throughout this pandemic. This crisis touches all parts of our business, and we have been methodical in our response. Our actions prioritize safety, focus on our customers, ensure our liquidity, and position UPS for additional opportunities as conditions improve. Regarding safety, we have adjusted our health and safety protocols throughout our company with increased social distancing, which includes waiving customer signature requirements where possible; more personal protective equipment, or PPE for our people; frequent cleaning of our facilities and equipment, and teleworking for our employees where feasible. Those are just some of the safeguards we’ve implemented to protect our people and customers, and we will continue to adjust as conditions change.  I also want to recognize the extraordinary efforts of healthcare professionals and everyone on the frontlines in the communities where we live and work. On behalf of UPS, we are grateful for their efforts and sacrifices. UPS is one of the few companies with the logistics expertise and global infrastructure to keep critical healthcare and other supply chains moving. We’ve embraced our leadership role supporting FEMA with Project Airbridge and other healthcare-related missions by managing charter flights to deliver millions of pounds of PPE and test kits from around the world into dedicated UPS distribution space outside Worldport. From there, we’re providing overnight delivery to locations throughout the U.S. UPS is also assisting other federal and state government agencies and supporting customers like 3M, Qiagen, Henry Schein, McKesson, and SanMar as they quickly adapt their supply chains to manufacture and distribute PPE and other supplies. Many companies are coming together with ingenuity and speed to solve the most urgent and complex healthcare challenges of this crisis. For example, we have the distinction of partnering with GM and Ventec Life Systems to provide transportation and logistics services for their advanced technology ventilators now being produced in GM’s retooled manufacturing facilities, and I’ll add that we’re doing all of this while U.S. domestic is delivering industry-leading, on-time performance. As China began to recover in March, our Asia outbound business accelerated, both air freight and small package, including the healthcare, high tech, and ecommerce sectors. We quickly added capacity to keep critical supply chains moving and commerce flowing, and outbound demand from Asia has continued. What’s more, as part of FEMA’s Project Airbridge and other healthcare-related missions, we increased the number of flights by over 200 to transport critical life-saving cargo to the U.S. and Europe.  Countless companies are relying on UPS to help keep their businesses running and to support their coronavirus response efforts. One fine example is the ecommerce support we’re providing to Target. When the coronavirus pandemic forced millions of Americans to stay at home, communities across the country turned to Target, and Target turned to UPS. Consumer ecommerce demand for essential and necessary goods surged, and UPS has been there with excellent on-time delivery. Several years ago, we identified healthcare and ecommerce as two of our strategic growth imperatives, and we’ve been investing in innovative solutions to enhance our capabilities. In healthcare, we’re expanding UPS Premier, our next generation on-package sensor and visibility technology for critical healthcare shipments, and starting in May in cooperation with the FAA, UPS Flight Forward, our drone subsidiary will deliver prescriptions from a CVS store in The Villages, which is the largest U.S. retirement community and is located in Florida. With our new healthcare unit, we are well positioned to continue to assist our customers as more countries move into recovery and demand for healthcare supplies evolves. In ecommerce, our digital access program for SMBs, one of our strategic imperatives greatly increases their ecommerce market reach, and we continue to deploy UPSNav, the latest enhancement to our proprietary Orion navigation software. UPSNav further supports our drivers with the increase in residential volume. These solutions and many more will enable us to build upon our existing customer relationships and foster new opportunities with others during these challenging times. In fact, UPS is poised and ready to help all customers, large and small, resume business as markets reopen. In late January, we provided our 2020 guidance which did not include any impacts from coronavirus. It was early then and no one could have foreseen the significant impact it would have on our customers and the global economy. In fact, over my 46-year career with UPS, I have never seen the level of demand variability in the markets we serve and among our customers that we are now experiencing.  Throughout the quarter, we adjusted our network and controlled costs, but we were not able to fully offset the unprecedented and swift changes in market demand and mix. Business closures and stay-at-home restrictions disproportionately affected SMBs, and we are seeing a dramatic shift in consumer shopping behavior. By late March, residential deliveries approached nearly 70% of our volume and drove increased delivery costs, a trend we are seeing continue in April. Brian will add more detail on this in a moment. Most economists are currently predicting a recession, but there is broad disagreement on the length and shape of the recovery. The main economic indicators, U.S. industrial production, U.S. retail, global industrial production, and global exports are all forecasted to decline significantly. Due to the uncertainties ahead, we are unable to predict the business impact of the pandemic or reasonably estimate our financial performance in future quarters. As a result, we are withdrawing 2020 guidance. Importantly, UPS generated good cash flow in the first quarter and our liquidity remains strong. We continue to make prudent financial decisions and have additional options available to ensure ample liquidity. In addition, our dividend remains a high priority and is a hallmark of our financial strength. We are confident our actions will continue to enable us to fund the business and support shareowner interests.  As a result of changing business conditions, we analyzed our 2020 capex projects and have re-prioritized our spending to those key investments necessary to support transformation. We are reducing capex by $1 billion. This decision was governed by two priorities: first, we will continue to make investments that best position the company to seize future opportunities as conditions improve; and second, we are prioritizing investments in spending that yield the greatest long-term benefits to the company. For example, we remain on track to speed up the U.S. ground network and expand weekend operations. These efforts will bolster our competitive position and help our customers meet the demand for faster delivery. Also, we will continue expanding our integrated network by adding about 5 million square feet of automated capacity this year. More automation reduces our costs, enhances our network flexibility, and enables the creation of innovative solutions for our customers.  Before I turn it over to Brian, I want to congratulate Carol Tomé on being named UPS’ 12th CEO. Carol has great knowledge of UPS from serving on our board for 17 years, and she has a proven track record of leading a global organization through volatile economic cycles. She brings a vast understanding of retail, ecommerce, strategy, and extensive financial background to the company. Carol is the right person to guide UPS at this time in our history. She officially takes over on June 1, but the transition is well underway. We’ve been working closely on all aspects of our business, including UPS’ response to the coronavirus pandemic. Carols’ unbridled enthusiasm and passion come through naturally in our daily interactions. She has hit the ground running, and I have great confidence in her ability to lead our company into the future. Now Brian will take you through the details for the quarter.\nBrian Newman: Good morning everyone. During the quarter, UPS saw unprecedented and rapid change in customer and volume fundamentals. As a result, we faced a challenging and uncertain environment. I’ll begin today by describing the factors that contributed to our results, then cover the strength of our liquidity and wrap up by sharing the trends we see in our business. Let me start with how the quarter unfolded. First, as David mentioned, leading economic indicators have turned negative. Historically, the small package industry was highly correlated with GDP but with two important variations. The small package industry typically grows faster than GDP over the long run, especially in a strong ecommerce environment; and second, during a recession demand volatility is elevated.  During the quarter, our business rapidly changed due to the coronavirus pandemic and declines in global economic activity. Let me begin with Asia. China average daily volume was down 16% in January and February on a local day basis, and then partially rebounded in March, growing 23%. Europe followed a different pattern with January and February average daily volume growth slightly positive and then down mid to high single digits in March. Declines in economic activity trailed the spread of the coronavirus as it emerged in new locations and then surfaced in the U.S.  The virus spread quickly, making it difficult for our customers to know how to respond or make adjustments to their businesses. UPS’ global network and solutions enabled flexibility and support to our customers; however, we experienced an overall decline in commercial packages of around 2% for the quarter, but in March the decline was actually 8.9%.  It’s also important to recognize that businesses were affected differently throughout the quarter. For example, many small and medium sized businesses with limited alternatives were more likely to temporarily halt their operations or move exclusively online. Consequently, U.S. SMB volume growth was flat, a reversal of a positive multi-quarter trend.  The impact across sectors was also somewhat unique. Consumer shopping migrated online, triggering a surge in volume growth led by multiple large UPS customers. Internationally, we saw ecommerce volume growth of almost 12% and domestically ecommerce grew 19% for the quarter. Healthcare was another sector with accelerated volume growth, where in the U.S. it increased 8.9% with significant contributions from personal protective equipment, testing and lab supplies, items that are critically needed to curtail the virus and protect healthcare providers and the general public. So what did all this mean to UPS? While UPS generated more than $18 billion in revenue and about $1 billion in net income during the quarter, we were down nearly 17% or $200 million in the quarter. This was driven by three after-tax items. The impact of the coronavirus was a drag of about $140 million; second, casualty self-insurance accruals were higher than anticipated by about $110 million, which we are addressing with targeted safety training designed for prevention, continued implementation of incident avoidance technology, and finally data analytics to enhance proactive driver coaching; and then finally, the impact of one additional operating day this quarter is a tailwind of approximately $50 million. We are confident, however, that we can take advantage of the opportunities in front of us and that we’ll be well prepared for the recovery when it comes, regardless of its shape. Now let me make a few comments about the segments. U.S. domestic delivered strong volume and revenue with average daily volume up 8.5% across all products, though volume growth softened as we moved toward the end of the quarter. Our automated hubs performed well, however these benefits were not enough to offset the rapidly changing and significant customer and product mix headwinds we faced. Specifically, commercial deliveries turned negative, ending five consecutive quarters of growth. B2C volumes spiked early in the period to high teens, which drove an increase in overall miles driven of nearly 10% and about a 15% increase in total average daily stops. By the end of the quarter, B2C approached 70% of our volume, and average package weight decreased by about a third of a pound. The U.S. generated $401 million in operating profit, which was $293 million below last year. Profitability was primarily affected by the coronavirus, with an impact of around $100 million, higher than anticipated casualty self insurance accruals of about $130 million, and the pension discount rate of $62 million.  Turning to the international segment, international executed well through various peaks and valleys as the coronavirus pandemic spread across the world. Business closures and stay-at-home restrictions led to a decline in commercial volume and downward pressure on volume growth. We had slightly positive average daily volume growth in January and February, but as I previously mentioned, volume declines came in March with the month finishing down 6.5%, mainly driven by Europe. We took advantage of certain growth opportunities and leveraged the flexibility of the network to manage costs to help offset the significant change in mix. We reduced block hours by nearly 6%, well below our export volume decline, and overall international cost per piece was lower by half a percent, primarily from the impact from currency.  One of the bright spots in the quarter occurred in mid-March as China began its recovery. March export volume from Asia was up around 15% on a local day basis. We quickly added capacity to support pent-up demand out of Asia from a variety of sectors, including healthcare, high tech, and ecommerce. International generated $558 million in operating profit and, even with the headwinds, operating margin was 16.5%, which includes an impact of around $70 million from the coronavirus.  Now let’s review the supply chain and freight segment. Despite the difficult macro environment, revenue for the segment was down less than 1%. The segment faced coronavirus challenges, as mentioned earlier; however, we saw some positives as the quarter progressed. International air freight tonnage rebounded in March and was up more than 15%, primarily on Asia outbound lanes as the China recovery took hold. Logistics grew operating profit led by U.S. healthcare and Marken, and Marken had a strong quarter of double digit revenue and operating profit growth.  On the downside, U.S. road freight softened during the quarter, pushing profit results within Coyote and UPS Freight lower on a year-over-year basis by around $50 million. Additionally, ocean freight, North American air freight, and brokerage were lower during the quarter. Total operating profit was $158 million. Overall impact from the coronavirus was a drag of around $10 million and tough year-over-year comps were headwinds to profit growth.  Moving to liquidity, we have a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, and capital management and dividends remain a high priority. We’re starting from a position of strength. Cash from operations was about $2.6 billion and adjusted free cash flow for the period was $1.6 billion, consistent with our first quarter average over the last three years. To date, we’ve strengthened our liquidity with a debt issuance of $3.5 billion in March, which more than satisfies our debt obligations for 2020. We are taking a strict approach to working capital and cost controls across the company. Working capital improved by around $80 million on a year-over-year basis.  We actively engaged with policymakers on stimulus packages to help support small businesses, consumers and corporate cash positions. Finally, we expect to lower our use of cash in 2020 by nearly $1.8 billion by suspending share buybacks and reducing capex. Our capex reduction will not impact our automation targets. About 50% of the billion dollars in capex reduction is from adjusting buildings and facilities projects and the other half comes re-phasing vehicle purchases, and we are finding that some projects are coming in at a lower cost.  We want to thank the U.S. Congress for providing the CARES Act to help companies across the country. We have elected not to participate in the program as we are confident in our ability to manage UPS’ liquidity through this cycle. We will, however, continue to monitor business conditions and make additional adjustments as needed, including further potential reductions in capex or operating expenses. Our ongoing transformation is extremely important right now as we manage through the current crisis and to further position UPS as global conditions improve in the future. In fact, in the first half of the year, we will add approximately 80,000 pieces per hour of new automated sort capacity to the U.S. domestic network, increasing efficiency and agility within our network. Let’s turn to what we’re seeing now. We view the current global situation as having three distinct stages: pre-coronavirus pandemic, stay-at-home restrictions, and then a recovery phase. The U.S. began the stay-at-home stage in March and it has continued into the second quarter. At this time, we are not able to determine the duration or depth of this stage or the resulting recession. We will leave those debates to the economists and instead will focus on keeping our employees safe, serving our customers, and ensuring ample liquidity for our shareholders. What I can tell you is that our business was performing well coming into the year in the pre-coronavirus stage, and as I shared, we encountered rapidly changing and significant mix headwinds as we entered the stay-at-home period. Because averages can be misleading during these times, let me provide you with some of the trends we are seeing. Asia appears to be stabilizing with strong outbound demand. Europe remains in transition and is weak economically, especially on the industrial side, and in the first half of April international average daily volume is down about 8%. In the U.S. at the end of March, B2C made up around 70% of our weekly volume and that trend has extended into April. Healthcare continues to be a positive with growth in commercial and residential deliveries. No industry verticals had positive commercial growth in March except for healthcare, and these trends have continued into April.  So far in April, U.S. average daily volume has grown mid single digits driven by ground residential and SurePost, and air shipments are up about 1%. Importantly, commercial ground volume is down significantly from last year. Productivity and service levels remain high and delivery stops and miles driven continue to be elevated, putting pressure on our delivery density. I know that it’s difficult to see all the moving pieces from outside the company, so I hope this provides a helpful glimpse inside. We know we’ll move into a recovery phase, we just don’t know when so we can’t provide guidance for the remainder of the year at this time; but as we move forward, we will continue to prioritize investment and operational decisions that put us in the best competitive and financial position for the recovery. It is also likely that future consumer and business behavior may change as a result of this crisis and UPS’ transformation initiatives will help bridge us through new market realities by delivering more automation, increased network flexibility, and new technology enabled solutions that position us well for the future. Thank you, and Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Our first question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Great, good morning. David or Brian, can you talk a bit about perhaps the domestic at 3.5% margin despite the network transformation? If residential is at 70% of volumes, but only for March, and if we now see stay-at-home lasting maybe April, May, do you expect then additional pressure on those margins, or are you seeing any benefit from increased density in the residential deliveries?\nBrian Newman: Sure Ken, good morning, it’s Brian. Thanks for the question. From a domestic margin perspective, as you mentioned 3.5%, there were three items that weighed on the margin in the U.S. in the quarter. The coronavirus, as I mentioned, was about 100 basis points. We had auto liability impact of about 130 basis points, and then the extra day was actually positive, Ken, by about $50 million. One other piece I didn’t mention was the SMB initiative that we previously invested, that was about an 80 point impact, and we’re continuing, Ken, to make those investments through the quarter.  George, maybe I’ll toss it over to you for a little color on the U.S. business.\nGeorge Willis: Thanks Brian, and Ken thanks for the question. Before I answer, I’d like to first of all thank all the UPSers for their heroic efforts and their leadership through this crisis. As we look into the U.S., despite the headwinds, we were able to continue to drive efficiency gains in our operations. Brian just spoke to the $100 million impact of corona, also $130 million for insurance, and $62 million for pension. Despite strong volume and revenue results, investment and efficiency gains, we were not able to offset the impact of the coronavirus and some other headwinds.  Our operating leverage was down for the first quarter since first quarter 2019, but it was driven by elevated miles, which was about 10%, and daily stops, which was up about 15% as a result of the elevated B2C. The rapid changes in customer and product mix in the quarter, those were mostly closed businesses.  So, we did make progress in our transformation initiatives. We generated exceptionally high service levels. As David said, we led the industry, and we helped our customers adapt their supply chain.\nDavid Abney: Thanks George. This is a good question, and I want to spend just a little more time on it. I think it just absolutely verifies the importance of transformation and what we’ve been doing, what we have in place, and what we will be doing. Scott, you want to add just a little more color to that?\nScott Price: Thanks David. I think it’s important to understand in the quarter that we are continuing to shift resources to the future of UPS, which is faster and nimbler. We have continued to target high quality growth opportunities, improving our operating leverage with efficiency initiatives, disguised by some of the issues that Brian raised with the focus upon long term earning power of the company. Because of the work that we’ve already done in transformation, we believe that we are better prepared to weather the crisis, and as we continue to implement and invest in projects this year, we think that we will continue to see very, very solid numerous benefits in the future as well.\nScott Childress: We’re going to take an online question here. This question comes from multiple analysts - Jordan Alliger over at Goldman Sachs, and Chris Wetherbee over at Citi. Do you think the COVID-19 pandemic will change the long-term dynamics of small/medium businesses and part of the UPS strategy?\nDavid Abney: Great question. This is David. Prior to the coronavirus, SMBs were and are a strategic imperative for UPS, and recent events will certainly speed up our SMB strategy. We’re prioritizing our strategies and investments to take advantage these opportunities as market conditions improve in order to get the greatest long-term benefit. We’re seeing unprecedented and swift changes in market demand, so are our SMB customers at the same time, and more and more they’re seeing the value of our network. Many of these SMBs, especially those that have had to temporarily close, are actively seeking other avenues and other platforms to conduct their business and to reach new markets. Kate, why don’t you share a few stories on what we’re doing in this regard with SMBs. \nKate Gutmann: Yes, absolutely. Thank you. As David said, SMBs are a priority and they are really--our solutions are resonating with the SMBs as we all find ourselves in these unprecedented times. From a demand generation connection, we’ve got our digital access program, so as some of the demand shifts away from the store on to further online, we actually are seamlessly integrated into where SMBs sell through this program - Stamps.com, Shopify, Amazon Marketplace, and we see vast opportunity in front of us as well, so ensuring they still have mechanisms to reach their consumers. Likewise at this time, they need fulfillment assistance, and we’re seeing our e-fulfillment and where to go solutions really resonating to help them to keep up with the demand on the fulfill side of the house. Then, of course that critical time in transit piece, so that they reach their customers in a timely manner. We’re speeding time in transit, as we’ve said, to over 80% of consumers in the market and through the weekend. This is really helping the SMBs through this difficult time to take advantage of online business. Of course, while the pandemic is upon us, SMBs did face a disproportionate headwind with the shutting of their businesses, with stay-at-home restrictions, but UPS is here to help them as they recover when the markets open.\nScott Childress: We’re going to take our next online question. This question comes from Dave Ross over at Stifel. What are you seeing in terms of capacity and demand out of Asia and Europe?\nNando Cesarone: I’ll take that, thank you David. It’s Nando. I’ll start with Asia, and really what we saw was our average daily volume for the quarter was down 2%, but we saw a bounce back in March to offset early softness. We still see strong demand today. In the quarter, we were successful at using our broad portfolio of freight, cargo, small package to better utilize our aircraft and serve our customers. We created capacity by reallocating aircraft from other parts of the world to where the demand was and currently is, and we’ve created capacity with purchase transportation where it made sense. We did these things to be where our customers needed us to be and we did it with industry-leading margins, and we are certainly seizing the opportunity that is in front of us right now in Asia.  A little bit of a different story in Europe. We see Europe is still in recovery, so still very hard to predict demand at this point and capacity demand, but I can assure you that the team in Europe is positioned for whatever comes next.\nDavid Abney: This is a great example of the need to show agility in a changing work environment. This is a very dynamic environment, and many of us when we were kids played musical chairs - well in this case, we’re having to play musical airplanes. We’re having to move these aircraft spur of the moment, very quickly making these decisions, and just absolutely proud of the way that we’ve been able to do that, but it’s not stopping for a while. It’s going to continue to be that way, and we just have to be responsive to the needs of our customers, and we will continue to do so.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for the time. Brian, when you call out the added costs for coronavirus and self insurance, are those costs that should come out as we move through the rest of the year, or are those going to be recurring? Then I guess a broader question kind of strategically for the company would be, that even if you were to back out some of those costs, the decrementals here on the ecommerce-driven growth are pretty negative. Is there a point where you really feel like you need to change the way you’re pricing that business to offset that decremental margin, in case this mix shift does stay with us for a while? I guess I’m surprised at the lack of operating leverage, even ex-some of those costs.\nBrian Newman: David, just in terms of the cost, your first part of the question, the impact of the coronavirus was felt in two ways. One was from a reduction in the SMB business and the shift to B2C - that came through in customer and product mix, which was worth about 120 basis points in terms of the U.S. RPP. We also incurred some costs associated with PPE and other associated opex expense, safety equipment for our folks as well.  In terms of continuation, look - we’re going to do whatever it takes to keep our employees safe and we’ve been preparing for some time for the shift to ecommerce. We’ll monitor that as it comes and adapt accordingly. Thanks Dave.\nDavid Vernon: And the second part of the question on changing your approach to pricing some of the residential?\nDavid Abney: David, we’re trying to get to as many questions as possible, and that question is going to come up. We’ve got an email question that’s very similar to that, so we’ll get to that in just a moment. Thank you.\nScott Childress: We’re going to take on online question real quick from Fadi Chamoun over at BMO. Would you consider scaling back the dividend if necessary?\nBrian Newman: Look - from a dividend perspective, Scott, the dividend remains very important to our investors. We’re aware of that. UPS has good liquidity and we do not expect to impact the dividend. We review it quarterly with our board. The first priority in our business is to reinvest in the business. We have a very strong ROIC and there continue to be a number of levers that we can pull to further strengthen our liquidity. Hopefully that answers the question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger. Please go ahead. \nJordan Alliger: Hi. You spoke a little bit about the transformation program, I think remaining on track, and just sort of curious if you can give more color around the facilities you planned on opening this year, you know, pulling forward some of the costs for the weekend delivery, and then once we get out on the other side of this, do you expect the leverage to be back on track from a margin standpoint, you know, in terms of what you were thinking about in 2022, both from a margin recovery standpoint and an additional EPS standpoint? I know there’s a lot of moving parts, but any color around that would be helpful.\nJuan Perez: Absolutely Jordan, thank you for the question. I’ll start first with the facility investments that we’re making this year. As Brian noted in his opening comments, we will continue to make investments in building capacity across the network. We still are on plan to be able to process 85% of the eligible volume in automated facilities in 2020, which is a significant milestone for us, but we’re not changing the view that by 2022, 100% of our eligible volume will be flowing through automation. That will provide significant benefits to UPS. This year as it relates to capacity, we will continue to build capacity. We plan on having roughly 350,000 packages per hour of new retrofit automated capacity in our network. That’s going to prove very useful during peak season. Again, all that capacity will be available before peak. The majority of it will be done by the third quarter, giving us an opportunity to optimize the utilization of that capacity. And then, we are still making improvements in the way that we run volume in our existing facilities through the implementation of new technologies. This year, we’re still on path to implement more autonomous guided vehicles in our facilities to be able to automate the movement of irregular large size packages, and we’re also in the process of implementing more automated small sorts across the network. Scott?\nScott Price: In addition to investing in costs, we also invest in new solutions that will continue to help us drive higher quality revenue. A few examples - Kate mentioned reduced transit time, making us very competitive with SMDs; seven day a week operations as we continue to expand our Saturday and Sunday; the UPS Flight Forward and an announcement made yesterday in terms of expanding that and CVS. But as Kate mentioned, the UPS digital access program, it’s powerful for SMBs, it will drive that higher quality revenue, and importantly it cements UPS’ position as truly the long-term ecommerce provider of choice.\nScott Childress: We’re going to take a live question. This question comes from Rick Paterson over at Loop Capital. In January, you reported that Amazon accounted for about 11.6% of your total revenue. What is Amazon’s percentage of total sales in the first quarter?\nDavid Abney: Thanks, this is David. We review Amazon’s percent of our global revenue on an annual basis, and so we announced in January the 11.6%. What I can tell you is that their percent in the first quarter of 2020 has really been consistent with their run rate from the start of the next day structural ship that we announced in the second quarter of last year, so that trend second, third and fourth quarter of last year has been very consistent going into the first quarter of this year. I also would like to say that the growth of ecommerce, whether it’s Amazon or other large customers, does make it pretty difficult for any of them to completely in-source all their transportation needs and it does show the value of existing partners, and we believe that we justify that value on a daily basis. Thank you, and we’ll go to the next question.\nOperator: Tom Wadewitz, UBS, please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. David, congratulations on the retirement. I know you’ve driven probably a lot more change at UPS than we would see from the outside, so congratulations on all the things you’ve done over time as the leader of UPS. I apologize for kind of a near term question, Brian, but I’m having difficulty with visibility here. Do you think that, given the big changes end of the quarter, that things are meaningfully tougher from a domestic perspective in second quarter? Is there room for some adjustment that would improve over some seasonality? I’m wondering if operating income in domestic second versus first, or margin or any framework you’d care to provide.\nDavid Abney: I’ll start that and then, Brian, if there is anything that you want to jump in, then you can certainly do so. What we have seen in first quarter, at the end of the first quarter has been pretty consistent with what we’ve seen in April, but we can’t tell you what we think it’s going to be the rest of the--even the rest of the quarter, or certainly the rest of the year. What we’ve seen in March and April is a reflection of this closure condition that we’re in. At some point in time, we’re going to see that bounce back, we just don’t know when and we don’t know how far it’s going to bounce back. But as businesses start to open, then you’re going to see more B2B increase. As far as B2C, don’t know that we’ll ever get back to what we’d call the old normal, but we’re not ready to declare what we see today as a new normal either.  That’s really about as much color as we can put on it. I wish to heck we knew more and I wish we could predict what’s going to happen. We just have to deal with where we are today and then we will adjust accordingly.\nScott Childress: Our next question, we’re going to take an online question from Scott Schneeberger over at Oppenheimer. What steps has UPS taken to balance volume and price in the current environment?\nKate Gutmann: Good morning, Scott. I wanted to start with of course our continuous position, that we ensure we get proper returns for the value we create for our customers. Through this unprecedented time, we saw significant changes in characteristics, which I’ll get to, but we also implemented surcharges on our international worldwide products from China and Hong Kong origins. We are also in the U.S. addressing characteristic and pricing changes on a customer-by-customer basis, so when you look at base pricing outside of the characteristic change, we’re still within our range of 2% to 3%. I did want to zoom in a little bit more on those characteristic changes. The drop in weight with essentials and necessary goods, really largely purchased online as well as the large essential shippers with that demand coming their way, and then as David mentioned, the stay-at-home restrictions and the shutdown of the commercial businesses would actually impact largely that B2B and B2C mix, with 19% growth in B2C and negative 2% in B2B. Those all impacting the view, but the pricing that I noted continues through the period as well as into the future.\nDavid Abney: So pricing is going to be dynamic, just like everything else, and with the world projected to go into a recession and with a lot of the indicators that we follow forecasted to go down, we just have to be very careful and watch what we’re doing here. As the demand indicates and as we continue to prove our value, obviously our goal is to maximize our pricing, at the same time keeping our network utilized. More to come on that, but we are very attuned to it and we will make adjustments accordingly.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe thinking a little bit about some of the longer term transformation targets, it would seem that a result of what we’re seeing now would be an acceleration of ecommerce growth and sort of a build within your mix towards B2C versus B2B, or acceleration of that. How do you think that impacts your ability to hit some of the longer term transformation targets, and are there things that you’re going to need to do, either from a capex perspective or an opex perspective, to be able to adapt to that, because it seems like it’s happening maybe quicker than we would have expected pre-coronavirus. \nScott Price: Yes, Scott here, thanks for the question, Chris. We continue to reaffirm our transformation target. Importantly, I think that transformation, as I mentioned earlier, has set us up for success. We do believe that our previous estimates of acceleration of ecommerce will probably increase as we think over the next five-year period of time, therefore the investments we’re making in automation, the investments we’re making in efficiency, we believe will help us deliver those long term transformational targets.\nScott Childress: We’re going to take an online question from Todd Fowler over at KeyBanc. Discuss what you’re seeing in the secular shifts around COVID-19 and how UPS will position itself to the response of these shifts coming out on the recovery side.\nDavid Abney: Okay. This is David again. First, I can tell you that going through this pandemic, our highest priority has certainly been the health and safety of our people and of our customers and the communities that we deal in, so we adopted a lot of new health protocols and procedures in place to make sure that we have done the right things there. Then of course, it really is focusing on what are the opportunities that we believe that are happening here in these shifts that are taking place, and it’s really open up in two immediate opportunities that also happen to be our strategic imperatives, and it has ramped up our initiatives in these areas. Kate, do you want to talk about that a little bit?\nKate Gutmann: Yes, absolutely. I’ll start with healthcare. We have noted previously that healthcare is one of our strategic growth imperatives. We last year set up the healthcare division, inclusive of our acquisition of Marken, and we are really involved in the recovery for our customers, the communities at large through this time. We also saw high growth in healthcare pre corona period as well and do expect that to continue, but we’re engaged with companies like Owens and Miner, CVS and Medtronics and Henry Schein, and really helping them as they participate in this recovery. David noted earlier the involvement in FEMA both with the transportation from Asia to the U.S. but also in the fulfillment services and the dedicated space that UPS has. Within healthcare, we have 8.1 million square feet dedicated, and that’s really resonating. Then the other one I would hit on of the strategic growth imperatives is the SMBs and just that critical area of our business, both now and in the future. I took you through our solutions that are resonating, helping them to grab the online opportunity through this time and in the future and giving them faster time in transit, more seamless integration to platforms as we help them to make the most of this situation.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Morning guys. I just want to follow up - I think I heard mid single digit volume growth in the U.S. in April. Can you share what the B2B and B2C trends are, and maybe any color on number of stops that you’re seeing? Then I know most of the focus has been on domestic, but any thoughts on international and how you think mix is trending and how margins typically hold up in a recession here? Thank you.\nKate Gutmann: Scott, thanks - this is Kate. I would say that what we saw as the stay-at-home restrictions started at the end of March have continued into April, and so we saw the double digit growth of B2C, the negative growth on B2B as companies were closed, and that continues. We also saw the air softening both from the COVID impact and then also from the wrap that we noted in Q2 of last year with the structural change in the market, so we are seeing a continuation of that end of March period in April. That’s largely the U.S. comment, but Nando, I’ll pass it to you for international.\nNando Cesarone: Yes, sure. We’re seeing similar dynamics on the residential side, but not as pronounced, of course, as the U.S. business. We do have a selective ecommerce strategy that is really focused on cross-border products and making sure that we’re being compensated for the service we’re providing, and in turn the margins, as you saw with all the changes in the quarter, still maintained a pretty decent level. We think that the investments that we’ve made in our European network, the efficiency gains from that also the deployment of our 747-8s really has created a lot of great unmatched capabilities and play well into our ecommerce cross-border strategy.  Thanks for the question.\nScott Childress: We’re going to take an online question. This question comes from multiple analysts, including Fadi Chamoun of BMO. President Trump has suggested that the USPS should raise rates 4 to 5x as part of postal reform. What are the implications for UPS?\nDavid Abney: Yes, this is David again, and obviously we can’t make any comments on our competitors’ rates, but as we stated before, we do support a healthy and a viable USPS and we have a unique relationship with them. We’re a customer of theirs, they’re a customer of ours, and we also compete. Where we are concerned, though, is their use of funding from declining monopoly products subsidizing competitive products, and we were certainly in agreement with most all of the president’s postal task force recommendations. They were aligned with many of our priorities, and we think if many of them had been implemented, that there may be a different situation today regarding the postal service than what exists. We do support the president’s view that stimulus grants do not solve the underlying issues at the USPS, at the post office, and we think that any government financial support must be accompanied by important business model and cost accounting reform. We don’t believe the role of government is to pick winners and losers, and when you look at the $10 billion of funding in stimulus 3, you look at the $75 billion that’s being asked for in the next stimulus package, if that was left unfettered, it would create a very unlevel playing field, so we’re very supportive of the postal task force recommendations and do believe that there needs to be a focus on reform at the same time.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Scott Schneeberger. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. Could you please discuss volumes and particularly pricing you’ve encountered on international export parcels in light of the fluctuating level of commercial airlines flying cargo in their belly space over the past few months due to the coronavirus impact? Thanks. \nNando Cesarone: Yes, I’ll start off - it’s Nando, thanks. Just talking about belly capacity for a second, we know it’s limited right now and for a period of time into the future. The industry is down around 80% at this point in time and approximately 70,000 daily tons, so quite a bit of capacity that’s been taken out of the market. Not sure how long the condition will last, but certainly a recovery will most likely happen when businesses, business travel and tourist travel begin again into the future, and that’s really the big question mark. For now, we have added aircraft, we have added flights where we see, and if it’s appropriate in terms of profitability, we will purchase transportation. But we are dealing with that capacity that’s not available as it was in the past allowing us to make sure we run our network as efficiently as possible. \nKate Gutmann: I’ll just add on the pricing side of it, the market rate in China and the Asian origins has gone up, as well as we’ve implemented surcharges during this period to address that as well.\nScott Childress: Our next question is a live question from--or an online question from Brian Ossenbeck over at JP Morgan. What other measures to preserve cash or capital are under consideration and available to UPS?\nBrian Newman: Thanks very much for the question - it’s Brian. Look, we feel good about our liquidity today in terms of preservation of capital. The priority is to stay liquid, reinvest in the business, and fund the dividend. We have taken, as mentioned, and continue to evaluate several actions to ensure our liquidity. We recently did a $3.5 billion debt issuance which satisfied our upcoming refinancing needs. We suspended the share buybacks for the rest of the year, which gave us a use of funds reduction of about $800 million. Working capital is a focal point for our team, so we saw good results in Q1, and then finally CP and international markets remain open and attractive, so UPS finally has good access to financial revolvers in the event of any unforeseen risks. I feel good about our liquidity and I feel like we’re taking the right measures in terms of preservation of capital. Thanks Scott.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Ross. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ross: Yes, good morning everyone. Just a question on the cost side of things. The self insurance accrual headwind of $130 million was significant, so if you could just talk a little bit more about that. I’m kind of surprised, because the weather was milder this winter. Was that from some nuclear verdicts, and did that drive a change in either your insurance policy of self retention levels?  Then also, I saw repairs and maintenance is up 30% year-over-year. Any comments on that?\nBrian Newman: Thanks for the question. It’s Brian. In terms of the casualty, auto liability, severity really was the driver of that. We are implementing corrective actions to address in the short term. I would say that the trends would probably continue over the next couple of quarters. Specifically what are we doing? Targeting safety training, installing accident avoidance technology, leveraging data analytics. All of these things are sort of proven to address the auto liability risk, but net-net once we implement those three, we’d expect to see significant improvements over time.\nScott Childress: We’re going to take an online question. This comes from Allison over at Wells Fargo. As the wave of the virus moved globally, any lessons learned that you’ve been able to apply and adjust that help you in a positive way?\nDavid Abney: Yes, and I talked about a little earlier, the first is you’ve got to take care of your people and make sure not only that you’re doing the right things, but that you’re communicating and making sure that people realize that part of being a critical infrastructure business is we were able to operate, and we have learned a lot from that. Then second, this is such a changing environment, and one thing that we have learned from Asia and are learning in Europe, and obviously in the United States, is that the needs of our customers change and change quickly, and if you’re going to be a player in that, you have to be able to change with them. So we’ve had to be very dynamic in our approach and listen, and Kate and her group have spent more time talking to our customers and finding out just exactly what their changing needs are, and it can be from one week to the next, so we’ve had to adjust to that. Another one that’s been very interesting, that applies throughout, is that a lot of governments with the best of intentions have been changing a lot of the rules and regulations, and we have learned that, first, you talk to them about the effects of those rules and regulations and try to get them to see sometimes that there is a full side of the story that needs to be considered, but then second is you adjust and you collaborate and you comply, and if you do that, and we’ve had 113 years of changing rules, maybe not to the speed that we’re seeing now, and we have learned that you adjust to those quickly and then sometimes you have to make up for it through extra people, and other times you move your assets around. But just got to be very attentive to what’s going on and then very responsive at the same time. There are challenges, there’s no doubt about it, but there are opportunities, but those opportunities only come to the people that are going to be assertive and are going to read these things quickly and then respond. That pace of change that we’ve been talking about since we’ve been undergoing transformation has never been any more true than what it is right now. Thank you for that question.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Amit Mehotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehotra: Thanks Operator, hi everybody. Thanks for taking my question, I appreciate it. I think it would just be helpful to get a sense of how you think about the structural margin profile of the domestic business over the long term. I’m not talking about obviously this year or next year, but really four or five years from now, what do you think is an achievable domestic margin and what needs to happen between now and then for you to be able to achieve that? Obviously that question is in the context of seemingly accelerating B2C volume mix, but then also overlaid with some successes you’ve had bending the cost curve really in the back half of last year, from a cost per piece perspective.  If you could just talk about kind of the four or five year, what’s achievable from a domestic margin perspective. Thank you. \nBrian Newman: Why don’t I take the outlook portion and then I’ll kick it to Kate for a little color. Look - we withdrew our guidance this morning, so I don’t think it’s appropriate to be talking about looking down three or four years in terms of what the margins will do. We’ll come back to you with that when the timing is right. Kate, do you want to give some color? \nKate Gutmann: Yes, absolutely. Our pricing strategy overall, of course, is to match the pricing with the value that we deliver for our customers. What you’re seeing, and we are all seeing in this time, is big shifts with characteristics, so addressing those. When I say characteristics, weight - when people are buying essentials that come out of each’s, so single, you see a big weight drop, and ensuring that we continue to help customers with heavy weight solutions, density solutions. You’ve heard us talk about synthetic density - that’s a part of the pricing structure and strategy because the more you can get people to match up at our expansive access point network, then it’s a commercial delivery, lower cost, lower price for them. So we maintain our focus on revenue quality through the future, and then also have learned quite a bit, of course, with the characteristic swings that we see currently.\nDavid Abney: So the key to margins, and whether it’s five months, five years or 50 years down the road, right, it’s going to be the value that you provide to your customers and the services that we offer, and how we price those. Then, it’s going to be on looking at our cost structure, and that’s one of the big things that transformation has focused on, and it will continue. Scott, you want to just talk a little bit more about a little bit longer term, what we’re focusing on from a transformation standpoint?\nScott Price: Yes, thanks David. The transformation program is multi-year, and as I mentioned before, it’s focused on how we enable and invest in higher revenue business, but also how we protect margin through reductions in cost. Juan covered the reduction in costs that we’re making through automation and technology. We also continue to invest in a more efficient business overall. Our cost per piece in the long term, we see as an opportunity to continue to invest to reduce. We have continued to invest over these periods of time in our competitiveness, both in terms of revenue and cost, and we’ll continue to do that with the expectation that net total shareholder value will increase.\nScott Childress: We’re going to take an online question. This comes from Jordan Alliger over at Goldman Sachs. Do you expect to see more growth potential from ecommerce post the pandemic due to the consumers moving more to online orders?\nKate Gutmann: Thanks Jordan. I would say that yes, we expect to see more online orders regardless, even prior to the pandemic, just as more and more consumers are shifting online as well as then sellers have migrated and are connected to different platforms and the like for ease to reach their consumers. Then of course with the pandemic, there are various reports out there saying that online purchasing will be migrating in advance of four to five years, depending on which report you go to, so we do see an increase there and we’re well positioned through our solutions, such as the digital access platform. Scott, you want to expand on that?\nScott Price: Yes, I think what’s important is that we have tracked over the last several years a number of market dynamics, but I think substantially the brick and mortar world has had a reset. What that reset will mean into the long term is not yet clear until we emerge into recovery, but I think that there is now a behavior that is baked and we continue to assess now what our estimates are going to be - one, the penetration of retail in terms of digital platforms, and then what volume that creates for UPS.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. I guess this is directed towards Kate. Could you talk for a moment about how you see supply chains perhaps structurally changing as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic, especially on the heels of the trade war? Do you think we could see more near-shoring activity moving forward, maybe more of a demand for more safety stock and more inventory? I’m just curious how UPS is being positioned for what could be some larger structural changes here. Thank you.\nKate Gutmann: Absolutely. Thanks so much, Jack, for the question. We do see a shift, and even prior to with the different tariff discussions that were going on in the world, our customers more than ever were reaching out to us and we were doing solutions redesigns globally for them, to help them evaluate how they would be more protected by having production in different parts of the world. I think that continues. It only magnifies with any situation like a pandemic. What we bring to them is, first of all, our solutions approach, having engineering and design time when they may not have resources available, but then our network supports, our portfolio that helps them right from origin throughout the globe, all the forwarding moves, whether ocean or air, and then fulfillment has really taken off. I think the answer is clearly through this pandemic, especially with small and medium sized businesses that didn’t have fulfillment options and did need to pivot, we’ve seen a really big uptick there as well as the time in transit that we know is so critical, fastest in the world, fastest in Europe, and then also with our enhanced time in transit in the U.S. All of those position us well for this continued trend of looking at customer supply chain.\nDavid Abney: So we have this team of supply chain solutions experts that really focus on solutions, and we also have an advanced technology group that is going to play an even greater role. With the agility that’s going to be required, you see those two teams working together well along with our engineers, and at the end of the day if we listen to our customers, if we will take a look at how we can make a difference, and if we make sure that we’re looking further down the road than just immediate needs, then we can continue to add to the value that we provide. Great question.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hi, thank you for taking my question. David, I just want to come back to the pricing discussion, and especially with the comments you guys made on your international selective ecommerce growth strategy, where you do have higher returns. What is different about the U.S. market, because as we’ve seen B2C get bigger over the past decade, there’s just been a pretty strong correlation with [indiscernible] profitability. Is it something about the competitive landscape potentially with the post office or is it potentially Amazon in-sourcing more in the future that has you a little bit more fearful, or is it even something with your [indiscernible] cost structure that just doesn’t allow you to extract a greater return on that B2C traffic?\nKate Gutmann: Brandon, this is Kate. I’ll address that. For the U.S. specifically with the pricing, I do want to underscore 2.2% was the base pricing increase, and we are actually implementing pricing changes and also solutions that will impact characteristics, but we’re doing it customer by customer. If you think about the U.S., SMBs are most impacted by this stay-at-home with businesses closing, and then we see the large customers who are actually gaining the demand for the essential products especially, and that’s why we’ve decided to selectively through customer by customer pricing increase that and then achieve that 2.2.  The characteristic change that’s going on can mask that, and that’s why I wanted to make sure I clarified that for the U.S.\nDavid Abney: It’s really a balance. You want to take advantage of the opportunities and you want to certainly price for the value that you bring. At the same time, though, you have to look at utilization of the network, and with this recession that’s being predicted globally, if - and there are so many ifs out there that we just don’t know what’s going to happen - but if demand drops due to the recession, then we have to make sure we respond accordingly there too. So it will be extremely hard, and that’s why we withdrew guidance, to give any kind of future prediction on what we’re going to do with pricing that’s further out than where we are now. A lot of it is going to depend on what we see unfold over the next few months, hopefully, but could go further than that, so we’ll have to just take a look and see. But appreciate the question, and it’s something we ask ourselves on a regular basis. Kate’s referred to this range that we’re talking about of 2% to 3%. She’s also made it very clear that we never see that as a barrier, that the value that we provide gives us the opportunity, we of course would increase and operate above the range, that’s for sure. \nOperator: That concludes our Q&A. I will now turn the program back over to Mr. Childress. Please go ahead, sir. \nScott Childress: Thank you Stephen. David, closing comments? \nDavid Abney: I will, thanks Scott. Certainly a dynamic environment, and if somebody had asked me a couple of years ago if we’d be facing what we are today, or if I would be facing on my last earnings call talking about withdrawing guidance and the uncertainty that we have seen, I just wouldn’t have believed it, but it is the world that we’re in. UPS has responded well, not only to the needs of our customers but also to governments around the world, and I’m really pleased with the response of UPSers.  I am truly grateful for the wonderful career that UPS has enabled me to have, and like many fellow UPSers past and present, I have gotten a chance to live the American dream through the opportunities of this great, great company. Throughout my journey from a part-time package handler in Mississippi years ago to becoming CEO, it’s just been a real privilege to have worked alongside you for those 46 years.  To our customers, investors, and friends, I truly value the relationships that I’ve made over the years, many of which have turned into long lasting friendships. I’ve never counted the number of earnings calls - I know some do - that I’ve participated on as a COO or a CEO, but what’s most important, it’s been an honor to speak with and hear from all of you over the years. Carol will lead the next earnings call. I am absolutely confident you will be in great hands with her. I just want to thank everyone for joining us today and urge you to stay safe and stay healthy. That’s the end of our call. Thank you.",

Before I answer, I'd like to first of all thank all the UPSers for their heroic efforts and their leadership through this crisis. As we look into the U.S., despite the headwinds, we were able to continue to drive efficiency gains in our operations. Brian just spoke to the $100 million impact of corona, also $130 million for insurance, and $62 million for pension. Despite strong volume and revenue results, investment and efficiency gains, we were not able to offset the impact of the coronavirus and some other headwinds.  Our operating leverage was down for the first quarter since first quarter 2019, but it was driven by elevated miles, which was about 10%, and daily stops, which was up about 15% as a result of the elevated B2C. The rapid changes in customer and product mix in the quarter, those were mostly closed businesses.  So, we did make progress in our transformation initiatives. We generated exceptionally high service levels. As David said, we led the industry, and we helped our customers adapt their supply chain."

            "content": "Absolutely Jordan, thank you for the question. I'll start first with the facility investments that we're making this year. As Brian noted in his opening comments, we will continue to make investments in building capacity across the network. We still are on plan to be able to process 85% of the eligible volume in automated facilities in 2020, which is a significant milestone for us, but we're not changing the view that by 2022, 100% of our eligible volume will be flowing through automation. That will provide significant benefits to UPS. This year as it relates to capacity, we will continue to build capacity. We plan on having roughly 350,000 packages per hour of new retrofit automated capacity in our network. That's going to prove very useful during peak season. Again, all that capacity will be available before peak. The majority of it will be done by the third quarter, giving us an opportunity to optimize the utilization of that capacity. And then, we are still making improvements in the way that we run volume in our existing facilities through the implementation of new technologies. This year, we're still on path to implement more autonomous guided vehicles in our facilities to be able to automate the movement of irregular large size packages, and we're also in the process of implementing more automated small sorts across the network. Scott?"

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Kate Gutmann",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely. Thank you. As David said, SMBs are a priority and they are really--our solutions are resonating with the SMBs as we all find ourselves in these unprecedented times. From a demand generation connection, we've got our digital access program, so as some of the demand shifts away from the store on to further online, we actually are seamlessly integrated into where SMBs sell through this program - Stamps.com, Shopify, Amazon Marketplace, and we see vast opportunity in front of us as well, so ensuring they still have mechanisms to reach their consumers. Likewise at this time, they need fulfillment assistance, and we're seeing our e-fulfillment and where to go solutions really resonating to help them to keep up with the demand on the fulfill side of the house. Then, of course that critical time in transit piece, so that they reach their customers in a timely manner. We're speeding time in transit, as we've said, to over 80% of consumers in the market and through the weekend. This is really helping the SMBs through this difficult time to take advantage of online business. Of course, while the pandemic is upon us, SMBs did face a disproportionate headwind with the shutting of their businesses, with stay-at-home restrictions, but UPS is here to help them as they recover when the markets open. Good morning, Scott. I wanted to start with of course our continuous position, that we ensure we get proper returns for the value we create for our customers. Through this unprecedented time, we saw significant changes in characteristics, which I'll get to, but we also implemented surcharges on our international worldwide products from China and Hong Kong origins. We are also in the U.S. addressing characteristic and pricing changes on a customer-by-customer basis, so when you look at base pricing outside of the characteristic change, we're still within our range of 2% to 3%. I did want to zoom in a little bit more on those characteristic changes. The drop in weight with essentials and necessary goods, really largely purchased online as well as the large essential shippers with that demand coming their way, and then as David mentioned, the stay-at-home restrictions and the shutdown of the commercial businesses would actually impact largely that B2B and B2C mix, with 19% growth in B2C and negative 2% in B2B. Those all impacting the view, but the pricing that I noted continues through the period as well as into the future. Yes, absolutely. I'll start with healthcare. We have noted previously that healthcare is one of our strategic growth imperatives. We last year set up the healthcare division, inclusive of our acquisition of Marken, and we are really involved in the recovery for our customers, the communities at large through this time. We also saw high growth in healthcare pre corona period as well and do expect that to continue, but we're engaged with companies like Owens and Miner, CVS and Medtronics and Henry Schein, and really helping them as they participate in this recovery. David noted earlier the involvement in FEMA both with the transportation from Asia to the U.S. but also in the fulfillment services and the dedicated space that UPS has. Within healthcare, we have 8.1 million square feet dedicated, and that's really resonating. Then the other one I would hit on of the strategic growth imperatives is the SMBs and just that critical area of our business, both now and in the future. I took you through our solutions that are resonating, helping them to grab the online opportunity through this time and in the future and giving them faster time in transit, more seamless integration to platforms as we help them to make the most of this situation. Scott, thanks - this is Kate. I would say that what we saw as the stay-at-home restrictions started at the end of March have continued into April, and so we saw the double digit growth of B2C, the negative growth on B2B as companies were closed, and that continues. We also saw the air softening both from the COVID impact and then also from the wrap that we noted in Q2 of last year with the structural change in the market, so we are seeing a continuation of that end of March period in April. That's largely the U.S. comment, but Nando, I'll pass it to you for international. I'll just add on the pricing side of it, the market rate in China and the Asian origins has gone up, as well as we've implemented surcharges during this period to address that as well. Yes, absolutely. Our pricing strategy overall, of course, is to match the pricing with the value that we deliver for our customers. What you're seeing, and we are all seeing in this time, is big shifts with characteristics, so addressing those. When I say characteristics, weight - when people are buying essentials that come out of each's, so single, you see a big weight drop, and ensuring that we continue to help customers with heavy weight solutions, density solutions. You've heard us talk about synthetic density - that's a part of the pricing structure and strategy because the more you can get people to match up at our expansive access point network, then it's a commercial delivery, lower cost, lower price for them. So we maintain our focus on revenue quality through the future, and then also have learned quite a bit, of course, with the characteristic swings that we see currently. Thanks Jordan. I would say that yes, we expect to see more online orders regardless, even prior to the pandemic, just as more and more consumers are shifting online as well as then sellers have migrated and are connected to different platforms and the like for ease to reach their consumers. Then of course with the pandemic, there are various reports out there saying that online purchasing will be migrating in advance of four to five years, depending on which report you go to, so we do see an increase there and we're well positioned through our solutions, such as the digital access platform. Scott, you want to expand on that? Absolutely. Thanks so much, Jack, for the question.

            "name": "Nando Cesarone",
            "content": "I'll take that, thank you David. It's Nando. I'll start with Asia, and really what we saw was our average daily volume for the quarter was down 2%, but we saw a bounce back in March to offset early softness. We still see strong demand today. In the quarter, we were successful at using our broad portfolio of freight, cargo, small package to better utilize our aircraft and serve our customers. We created capacity by reallocating aircraft from other parts of the world to where the demand was and currently is, and we've created capacity with purchase transportation where it made sense. We did these things to be where our customers needed us to be and we did it with industry-leading margins, and we are certainly seizing the opportunity that is in front of us right now in Asia.  A little bit of a different story in Europe. We see Europe is still in recovery, so still very hard to predict demand at this point and capacity demand, but I can assure you that the team in Europe is positioned for whatever comes next. Yes, sure. We're seeing similar dynamics on the residential side, but not as pronounced, of course, as the U.S. business. We do have a selective ecommerce strategy that is really focused on cross-border products and making sure that we're being compensated for the service we're providing, and in turn the margins, as you saw with all the changes in the quarter, still maintained a pretty decent level. We think that the investments that we've made in our European network, the efficiency gains from that also the deployment of our 747-8s really has created a lot of great unmatched capabilities and play well into our ecommerce cross-border strategy.  Thanks for the question. Yes, I'll start off - it's Nando, thanks. Just talking about belly capacity for a second, we know it's limited right now and for a period of time into the future. The industry is down around 80% at this point in time and approximately 70,000 daily tons, so quite a bit of capacity that's been taken out of the market. Not sure how long the condition will last, but certainly a recovery will most likely happen when businesses, business travel and tourist travel begin again into the future, and that's really the big question mark. For now, we have added aircraft, we have added flights where we see, and if it's appropriate in terms of profitability, we will purchase transportation. But we are dealing with that capacity that's not available as it was in the past allowing us to make sure we run our network as efficiently as possible."

            "name": "David Abney",
            "content": "Thanks Scott, and good morning everyone. I would first like to thank UPSers worldwide for going above and beyond during the coronavirus pandemic. Since this crisis began, we have been operating as a critical infrastructure business leveraging the strength of our global network to keep supply chains moving around the world. People are counting on UPS more than ever before, and I am proud of the heroic actions of our employees throughout this pandemic. This crisis touches all parts of our business, and we have been methodical in our response. Our actions prioritize safety, focus on our customers, ensure our liquidity, and position UPS for additional opportunities as conditions improve. Regarding safety, we have adjusted our health and safety protocols throughout our company with increased social distancing, which includes waiving customer signature requirements where possible; more personal protective equipment, or PPE for our people; frequent cleaning of our facilities and equipment, and teleworking for our employees where feasible. Those are just some of the safeguards we've implemented to protect our people and customers, and we will continue to adjust as conditions change.  I also want to recognize the extraordinary efforts of healthcare professionals and everyone on the frontlines in the communities where we live and work. On behalf of UPS, we are grateful for their efforts and sacrifices. UPS is one of the few companies with the logistics expertise and global infrastructure to keep critical healthcare and other supply chains moving. We've embraced our leadership role supporting FEMA with Project Airbridge and other healthcare-related missions by managing charter flights to deliver millions of pounds of PPE and test kits from around the world into dedicated UPS distribution space outside Worldport. From there, we're providing overnight delivery to locations throughout the U.S. UPS is also assisting other federal and state government agencies and supporting customers like 3M, Qiagen, Henry Schein, McKesson, and SanMar as they quickly adapt their supply chains to manufacture and distribute PPE and other supplies. Many companies are coming together with ingenuity and speed to solve the most urgent and complex healthcare challenges of this crisis. For example, we have the distinction of partnering with GM and Ventec Life Systems to provide transportation and logistics services for their advanced technology ventilators now being produced in GM's retooled manufacturing facilities, and I'll add that we're doing all of this while U.S. domestic is delivering industry-leading, on-time performance. As China began to recover in March, our Asia outbound business accelerated, both air freight and small package, including the healthcare, high tech, and ecommerce sectors. We quickly added capacity to keep critical supply chains moving and commerce flowing, and outbound demand from Asia has continued. What's more, as part of FEMA's Project Airbridge and other healthcare-related missions, we increased the number of flights by over 200 to transport critical life-saving cargo to the U.S. and Europe.  Countless companies are relying on UPS to help keep their businesses running and to support their coronavirus response efforts. One fine example is the ecommerce support we're providing to Target. When the coronavirus pandemic forced millions of Americans to stay at home, communities across the country turned to Target, and Target turned to UPS. Consumer ecommerce demand for essential and necessary goods surged, and UPS has been there with excellent on-time delivery. Several years ago, we identified healthcare and ecommerce as two of our strategic growth imperatives, and we've been investing in innovative solutions to enhance our capabilities. In healthcare, we're expanding UPS Premier, our next generation on-package sensor and visibility technology for critical healthcare shipments, and starting in May in cooperation with the FAA, UPS Flight Forward, our drone subsidiary will deliver prescriptions from a CVS store in The Villages, which is the largest U.S. retirement community and is located in Florida. With our new healthcare unit, we are well positioned to continue to assist our customers as more countries move into recovery and demand for healthcare supplies evolves. In ecommerce, our digital access program for SMBs, one of our strategic imperatives greatly increases their ecommerce market reach, and we continue to deploy UPSNav, the latest enhancement to our proprietary Orion navigation software. UPSNav further supports our drivers with the increase in residential volume. These solutions and many more will enable us to build upon our existing customer relationships and foster new opportunities with others during these challenging times. In fact, UPS is poised and ready to help all customers, large and small, resume business as markets reopen. In late January, we provided our 2020 guidance which did not include any impacts from coronavirus. It was early then and no one could have foreseen the significant impact it would have on our customers and the global economy. In fact, over my 46-year career with UPS, I have never seen the level of demand variability in the markets we serve and among our customers that we are now experiencing.  Throughout the quarter, we adjusted our network and controlled costs, but we were not able to fully offset the unprecedented and swift changes in market demand and mix. Business closures and stay-at-home restrictions disproportionately affected SMBs, and we are seeing a dramatic shift in consumer shopping behavior. By late March, residential deliveries approached nearly 70% of our volume and drove increased delivery costs, a trend we are seeing continue in April. Brian will add more detail on this in a moment. Most economists are currently predicting a recession, but there is broad disagreement on the length and shape of the recovery. The main economic indicators, U.S. industrial production, U.S. retail, global industrial production, and global exports are all forecasted to decline significantly. Due to the uncertainties ahead, we are unable to predict the business impact of the pandemic or reasonably estimate our financial performance in future quarters. As a result, we are withdrawing 2020 guidance. Importantly, UPS generated good cash flow in the first quarter and our liquidity remains strong. We continue to make prudent financial decisions and have additional options available to ensure ample liquidity. In addition, our dividend remains a high priority and is a hallmark of our financial strength. We are confident our actions will continue to enable us to fund the business and support shareowner interests.  As a result of changing business conditions, we analyzed our 2020 capex projects and have re-prioritized our spending to those key investments necessary to support transformation. We are reducing capex by $1 billion. This decision was governed by two priorities: first, we will continue to make investments that best position the company to seize future opportunities as conditions improve; and second, we are prioritizing investments in spending that yield the greatest long-term benefits to the company. For example, we remain on track to speed up the U.S. ground network and expand weekend operations. These efforts will bolster our competitive position and help our customers meet the demand for faster delivery. Also, we will continue expanding our integrated network by adding about 5 million square feet of automated capacity this year. More automation reduces our costs, enhances our network flexibility, and enables the creation of innovative solutions for our customers.  Before I turn it over to Brian, I want to congratulate Carol Tomé on being named UPS' 12th CEO. Carol has great knowledge of UPS from serving on our board for 17 years, and she has a proven track record of leading a global organization through volatile economic cycles. She brings a vast understanding of retail, ecommerce, strategy, and extensive financial background to the company. Carol is the right person to guide UPS at this time in our history. She officially takes over on June 1, but the transition is well underway. We've been working closely on all aspects of our business, including UPS' response to the coronavirus pandemic. Carols' unbridled enthusiasm and passion come through naturally in our daily interactions. She has hit the ground running, and I have great confidence in her ability to lead our company into the future. Now Brian will take you through the details for the quarter. Thanks George. This is a good question, and I want to spend just a little more time on it. I think it just absolutely verifies the importance of transformation and what we've been doing, what we have in place, and what we will be doing. Scott, you want to add just a little more color to that? Great question. This is David. Prior to the coronavirus, SMBs were and are a strategic imperative for UPS, and recent events will certainly speed up our SMB strategy. We're prioritizing our strategies and investments to take advantage these opportunities as market conditions improve in order to get the greatest long-term benefit. We're seeing unprecedented and swift changes in market demand, so are our SMB customers at the same time, and more and more they're seeing the value of our network. Many of these SMBs, especially those that have had to temporarily close, are actively seeking other avenues and other platforms to conduct their business and to reach new markets. Kate, why don't you share a few stories on what we're doing in this regard with SMBs. This is a great example of the need to show agility in a changing work environment. This is a very dynamic environment, and many of us when we were kids played musical chairs - well in this case, we're having to play musical airplanes. We're having to move these aircraft spur of the moment, very quickly making these decisions, and just absolutely proud of the way that we've been able to do that, but it's not stopping for a while. It's going to continue to be that way, and we just have to be responsive to the needs of our customers, and we will continue to do so. David, we're trying to get to as many questions as possible, and that question is going to come up. We've got an email question that's very similar to that, so we'll get to that in just a moment. Thank you. Thanks, this is David. We review Amazon's percent of our global revenue on an annual basis, and so we announced in January the 11.6%. What I can tell you is that their percent in the first quarter of 2020 has really been consistent with their run rate from the start of the next day structural ship that we announced in the second quarter of last year, so that trend second, third and fourth quarter of last year has been very consistent going into the first quarter of this year. I also would like to say that the growth of ecommerce, whether it's Amazon or other large customers, does make it pretty difficult for any of them to completely in-source all their transportation needs and it does show the value of existing partners, and we believe that we justify that value on a daily basis. Thank you, and we'll go to the next question. I'll start that and then, Brian, if there is anything that you want to jump in, then you can certainly do so. What we have seen in first quarter, at the end of the first quarter has been pretty consistent with what we've seen in April, but we can't tell you what we think it's going to be the rest of the--even the rest of the quarter, or certainly the rest of the year. What we've seen in March and April is a reflection of this closure condition that we're in. At some point in time, we're going to see that bounce back, we just don't know when and we don't know how far it's going to bounce back. But as businesses start to open, then you're going to see more B2B increase. As far as B2C, don't know that we'll ever get back to what we'd call the old normal, but we're not ready to declare what we see today as a new normal either.  That's really about as much color as we can put on it. I wish to heck we knew more and I wish we could predict what's going to happen. We just have to deal with where we are today and then we will adjust accordingly. So pricing is going to be dynamic, just like everything else, and with the world projected to go into a recession and with a lot of the indicators that we follow forecasted to go down, we just have to be very careful and watch what we're doing here. As the demand indicates and as we continue to prove our value, obviously our goal is to maximize our pricing, at the same time keeping our network utilized. More to come on that, but we are very attuned to it and we will make adjustments accordingly. Okay. This is David again. First, I can tell you that going through this pandemic, our highest priority has certainly been the health and safety of our people and of our customers and the communities that we deal in, so we adopted a lot of new health protocols and procedures in place to make sure that we have done the right things there. Then of course, it really is focusing on what are the opportunities that we believe that are happening here in these shifts that are taking place, and it's really open up in two immediate opportunities that also happen to be our strategic imperatives, and it has ramped up our initiatives in these areas. Kate, do you want to talk about that a little bit? Yes, this is David again, and obviously we can't make any comments on our competitors' rates, but as we stated before, we do support a healthy and a viable USPS and we have a unique relationship with them. We're a customer of theirs, they're a customer of ours, and we also compete. Where we are concerned, though, is their use of funding from declining monopoly products subsidizing competitive products, and we were certainly in agreement with most all of the president's postal task force recommendations. They were aligned with many of our priorities, and we think if many of them had been implemented, that there may be a different situation today regarding the postal service than what exists. We do support the president's view that stimulus grants do not solve the underlying issues at the USPS, at the post office, and we think that any government financial support must be accompanied by important business model and cost accounting reform. We don't believe the role of government is to pick winners and losers, and when you look at the $10 billion of funding in stimulus 3, you look at the $75 billion that's being asked for in the next stimulus package, if that was left unfettered, it would create a very unlevel playing field, so we're very supportive of the postal task force recommendations and do believe that there needs to be a focus on reform at the same time. Yes, and I talked about a little earlier, the first is you've got to take care of your people and make sure not only that you're doing the right things, but that you're communicating and making sure that people realize that part of being a critical infrastructure business is we were able to operate, and we have learned a lot from that. Then second, this is such a changing environment, and one thing that we have learned from Asia and are learning in Europe, and obviously in the United States, is that the needs of our customers change and change quickly, and if you're going to be a player in that, you have to be able to change with them. So we've had to be very dynamic in our approach and listen, and Kate and her group have spent more time talking to our customers and finding out just exactly what their changing needs are, and it can be from one week to the next, so we've had to adjust to that. Another one that's been very interesting, that applies throughout, is that a lot of governments with the best of intentions have been changing a lot of the rules and regulations, and we have learned that, first, you talk to them about the effects of those rules and regulations and try to get them to see sometimes that there is a full side of the story that needs to be considered, but then second is you adjust and you collaborate and you comply, and if you do that, and we've had 113 years of changing rules, maybe not to the speed that we're seeing now, and we have learned that you adjust to those quickly and then sometimes you have to make up for it through extra people, and other times you move your assets around. But just got to be very attentive to what's going on and then very responsive at the same time. There are challenges, there's no doubt about it, but there are opportunities, but those opportunities only come to the people that are going to be assertive and are going to read these things quickly and then respond. That pace of change that we've been talking about since we've been undergoing transformation has never been any more true than what it is right now. Thank you for that question. So the key to margins, and whether it's five months, five years or 50 years down the road, right, it's going to be the value that you provide to your customers and the services that we offer, and how we price those. Then, it's going to be on looking at our cost structure, and that's one of the big things that transformation has focused on, and it will continue. Scott, you want to just talk a little bit more about a little bit longer term, what we're focusing on from a transformation standpoint? So we have this team of supply chain solutions experts that really focus on solutions, and we also have an advanced technology group that is going to play an even greater role. With the agility that's going to be required, you see those two teams working together well along with our engineers, and at the end of the day if we listen to our customers, if we will take a look at how we can make a difference, and if we make sure that we're looking further down the road than just immediate needs, then we can continue to add to the value that we provide. Great question. It's really a balance. You want to take advantage of the opportunities and you want to certainly price for the value that you bring. At the same time, though, you have to look at utilization of the network, and with this recession that's being predicted globally, if - and there are so many ifs out there that we just don't know what's going to happen - but if demand drops due to the recession, then we have to make sure we respond accordingly there too. So it will be extremely hard, and that's why we withdrew guidance, to give any kind of future prediction on what we're going to do with pricing that's further out than where we are now. A lot of it is going to depend on what we see unfold over the next few months, hopefully, but could go further than that, so we'll have to just take a look and see. But appreciate the question, and it's something we ask ourselves on a regular basis. Kate's referred to this range that we're talking about of 2% to 3%. She's also made it very clear that we never see that as a barrier, that the value that we provide gives us the opportunity, we of course would increase and operate above the range, that's for sure. I will, thanks Scott. Certainly a dynamic environment, and if somebody had asked me a couple of years ago if we'd be facing what we are today, or if I would be facing on my last earnings call talking about withdrawing guidance and the uncertainty that we have seen, I just wouldn't have believed it, but it is the world that we're in. UPS has responded well, not only to the needs of our customers but also to governments around the world, and I'm really pleased with the response of UPSers.  I am truly grateful for the wonderful career that UPS has enabled me to have, and like many fellow UPSers past and present, I have gotten a chance to live the American dream through the opportunities of this great, great company. Throughout my journey from a part-time package handler in Mississippi years ago to becoming CEO, it's just been a real privilege to have worked alongside you for those 46 years.  To our customers, investors, and friends, I truly value the relationships that I've made over the years, many of which have turned into long lasting friendships. I've never counted the number of earnings calls - I know some do - that I've participated on as a COO or a CEO, but what's most important, it's been an honor to speak with and hear from all of you over the years. Carol will lead the next earnings call. I am absolutely confident you will be in great hands with her. I just want to thank everyone for joining us today and urge you to stay safe and stay healthy. That's the end of our call. Thank you."

            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Good morning everyone. During the quarter, UPS saw unprecedented and rapid change in customer and volume fundamentals. As a result, we faced a challenging and uncertain environment. I'll begin today by describing the factors that contributed to our results, then cover the strength of our liquidity and wrap up by sharing the trends we see in our business. Let me start with how the quarter unfolded. First, as David mentioned, leading economic indicators have turned negative. Historically, the small package industry was highly correlated with GDP but with two important variations. The small package industry typically grows faster than GDP over the long run, especially in a strong ecommerce environment; and second, during a recession demand volatility is elevated.  During the quarter, our business rapidly changed due to the coronavirus pandemic and declines in global economic activity. Let me begin with Asia. China average daily volume was down 16% in January and February on a local day basis, and then partially rebounded in March, growing 23%. Europe followed a different pattern with January and February average daily volume growth slightly positive and then down mid to high single digits in March. Declines in economic activity trailed the spread of the coronavirus as it emerged in new locations and then surfaced in the U.S.  The virus spread quickly, making it difficult for our customers to know how to respond or make adjustments to their businesses. UPS' global network and solutions enabled flexibility and support to our customers; however, we experienced an overall decline in commercial packages of around 2% for the quarter, but in March the decline was actually 8.9%.  It's also important to recognize that businesses were affected differently throughout the quarter. For example, many small and medium sized businesses with limited alternatives were more likely to temporarily halt their operations or move exclusively online. Consequently, U.S. SMB volume growth was flat, a reversal of a positive multi-quarter trend.  The impact across sectors was also somewhat unique. Consumer shopping migrated online, triggering a surge in volume growth led by multiple large UPS customers. Internationally, we saw ecommerce volume growth of almost 12% and domestically ecommerce grew 19% for the quarter. Healthcare was another sector with accelerated volume growth, where in the U.S. it increased 8.9% with significant contributions from personal protective equipment, testing and lab supplies, items that are critically needed to curtail the virus and protect healthcare providers and the general public. So what did all this mean to UPS? While UPS generated more than $18 billion in revenue and about $1 billion in net income during the quarter, we were down nearly 17% or $200 million in the quarter. This was driven by three after-tax items. The impact of the coronavirus was a drag of about $140 million; second, casualty self-insurance accruals were higher than anticipated by about $110 million, which we are addressing with targeted safety training designed for prevention, continued implementation of incident avoidance technology, and finally data analytics to enhance proactive driver coaching; and then finally, the impact of one additional operating day this quarter is a tailwind of approximately $50 million. We are confident, however, that we can take advantage of the opportunities in front of us and that we'll be well prepared for the recovery when it comes, regardless of its shape. Now let me make a few comments about the segments. U.S. domestic delivered strong volume and revenue with average daily volume up 8.5% across all products, though volume growth softened as we moved toward the end of the quarter. Our automated hubs performed well, however these benefits were not enough to offset the rapidly changing and significant customer and product mix headwinds we faced. Specifically, commercial deliveries turned negative, ending five consecutive quarters of growth. B2C volumes spiked early in the period to high teens, which drove an increase in overall miles driven of nearly 10% and about a 15% increase in total average daily stops. By the end of the quarter, B2C approached 70% of our volume, and average package weight decreased by about a third of a pound. The U.S. generated $401 million in operating profit, which was $293 million below last year. Profitability was primarily affected by the coronavirus, with an impact of around $100 million, higher than anticipated casualty self insurance accruals of about $130 million, and the pension discount rate of $62 million.  Turning to the international segment, international executed well through various peaks and valleys as the coronavirus pandemic spread across the world. Business closures and stay-at-home restrictions led to a decline in commercial volume and downward pressure on volume growth. We had slightly positive average daily volume growth in January and February, but as I previously mentioned, volume declines came in March with the month finishing down 6.5%, mainly driven by Europe. We took advantage of certain growth opportunities and leveraged the flexibility of the network to manage costs to help offset the significant change in mix. We reduced block hours by nearly 6%, well below our export volume decline, and overall international cost per piece was lower by half a percent, primarily from the impact from currency.  One of the bright spots in the quarter occurred in mid-March as China began its recovery. March export volume from Asia was up around 15% on a local day basis. We quickly added capacity to support pent-up demand out of Asia from a variety of sectors, including healthcare, high tech, and ecommerce. International generated $558 million in operating profit and, even with the headwinds, operating margin was 16.5%, which includes an impact of around $70 million from the coronavirus.  Now let's review the supply chain and freight segment. Despite the difficult macro environment, revenue for the segment was down less than 1%. The segment faced coronavirus challenges, as mentioned earlier; however, we saw some positives as the quarter progressed. International air freight tonnage rebounded in March and was up more than 15%, primarily on Asia outbound lanes as the China recovery took hold. Logistics grew operating profit led by U.S. healthcare and Marken, and Marken had a strong quarter of double digit revenue and operating profit growth.  On the downside, U.S. road freight softened during the quarter, pushing profit results within Coyote and UPS Freight lower on a year-over-year basis by around $50 million. Additionally, ocean freight, North American air freight, and brokerage were lower during the quarter. Total operating profit was $158 million. Overall impact from the coronavirus was a drag of around $10 million and tough year-over-year comps were headwinds to profit growth.  Moving to liquidity, we have a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, and capital management and dividends remain a high priority. We're starting from a position of strength. Cash from operations was about $2.6 billion and adjusted free cash flow for the period was $1.6 billion, consistent with our first quarter average over the last three years. To date, we've strengthened our liquidity with a debt issuance of $3.5 billion in March, which more than satisfies our debt obligations for 2020. We are taking a strict approach to working capital and cost controls across the company. Working capital improved by around $80 million on a year-over-year basis.  We actively engaged with policymakers on stimulus packages to help support small businesses, consumers and corporate cash positions. Finally, we expect to lower our use of cash in 2020 by nearly $1.8 billion by suspending share buybacks and reducing capex. Our capex reduction will not impact our automation targets. About 50% of the billion dollars in capex reduction is from adjusting buildings and facilities projects and the other half comes re-phasing vehicle purchases, and we are finding that some projects are coming in at a lower cost.  We want to thank the U.S. Congress for providing the CARES Act to help companies across the country. We have elected not to participate in the program as we are confident in our ability to manage UPS' liquidity through this cycle. We will, however, continue to monitor business conditions and make additional adjustments as needed, including further potential reductions in capex or operating expenses. Our ongoing transformation is extremely important right now as we manage through the current crisis and to further position UPS as global conditions improve in the future. In fact, in the first half of the year, we will add approximately 80,000 pieces per hour of new automated sort capacity to the U.S. domestic network, increasing efficiency and agility within our network. Let's turn to what we're seeing now. We view the current global situation as having three distinct stages: pre-coronavirus pandemic, stay-at-home restrictions, and then a recovery phase. The U.S. began the stay-at-home stage in March and it has continued into the second quarter. At this time, we are not able to determine the duration or depth of this stage or the resulting recession. We will leave those debates to the economists and instead will focus on keeping our employees safe, serving our customers, and ensuring ample liquidity for our shareholders. What I can tell you is that our business was performing well coming into the year in the pre-coronavirus stage, and as I shared, we encountered rapidly changing and significant mix headwinds as we entered the stay-at-home period. Because averages can be misleading during these times, let me provide you with some of the trends we are seeing. Asia appears to be stabilizing with strong outbound demand. Europe remains in transition and is weak economically, especially on the industrial side, and in the first half of April international average daily volume is down about 8%. In the U.S. at the end of March, B2C made up around 70% of our weekly volume and that trend has extended into April. Healthcare continues to be a positive with growth in commercial and residential deliveries. No industry verticals had positive commercial growth in March except for healthcare, and these trends have continued into April.  So far in April, U.S. average daily volume has grown mid single digits driven by ground residential and SurePost, and air shipments are up about 1%. Importantly, commercial ground volume is down significantly from last year. Productivity and service levels remain high and delivery stops and miles driven continue to be elevated, putting pressure on our delivery density. I know that it's difficult to see all the moving pieces from outside the company, so I hope this provides a helpful glimpse inside. We know we'll move into a recovery phase, we just don't know when so we can't provide guidance for the remainder of the year at this time; but as we move forward, we will continue to prioritize investment and operational decisions that put us in the best competitive and financial position for the recovery. It is also likely that future consumer and business behavior may change as a result of this crisis and UPS' transformation initiatives will help bridge us through new market realities by delivering more automation, increased network flexibility, and new technology enabled solutions that position us well for the future. Thank you, and Operator, please open the lines. Sure Ken, good morning, it's Brian. Thanks for the question. From a domestic margin perspective, as you mentioned 3.5%, there were three items that weighed on the margin in the U.S. in the quarter. The coronavirus, as I mentioned, was about 100 basis points. We had auto liability impact of about 130 basis points, and then the extra day was actually positive, Ken, by about $50 million. One other piece I didn't mention was the SMB initiative that we previously invested, that was about an 80 point impact, and we're continuing, Ken, to make those investments through the quarter.  George, maybe I'll toss it over to you for a little color on the U.S. business. David, just in terms of the cost, your first part of the question, the impact of the coronavirus was felt in two ways. One was from a reduction in the SMB business and the shift to B2C - that came through in customer and product mix, which was worth about 120 basis points in terms of the U.S. RPP. We also incurred some costs associated with PPE and other associated opex expense, safety equipment for our folks as well.  In terms of continuation, look - we're going to do whatever it takes to keep our employees safe and we've been preparing for some time for the shift to ecommerce. We'll monitor that as it comes and adapt accordingly. Thanks Dave. Look - from a dividend perspective, Scott, the dividend remains very important to our investors. We're aware of that. UPS has good liquidity and we do not expect to impact the dividend. We review it quarterly with our board. The first priority in our business is to reinvest in the business. We have a very strong ROIC and there continue to be a number of levers that we can pull to further strengthen our liquidity. Hopefully that answers the question. Thanks very much for the question - it's Brian. Look, we feel good about our liquidity today in terms of preservation of capital. The priority is to stay liquid, reinvest in the business, and fund the dividend. We have taken, as mentioned, and continue to evaluate several actions to ensure our liquidity. We recently did a $3.5 billion debt issuance which satisfied our upcoming refinancing needs. We suspended the share buybacks for the rest of the year, which gave us a use of funds reduction of about $800 million. Working capital is a focal point for our team, so we saw good results in Q1, and then finally CP and international markets remain open and attractive, so UPS finally has good access to financial revolvers in the event of any unforeseen risks. I feel good about our liquidity and I feel like we're taking the right measures in terms of preservation of capital. Thanks Scott. Thanks for the question. It's Brian. In terms of the casualty, auto liability, severity really was the driver of that. We are implementing corrective actions to address in the short term. I would say that the trends would probably continue over the next couple of quarters. Specifically what are we doing? Targeting safety training, installing accident avoidance technology, leveraging data analytics. All of these things are sort of proven to address the auto liability risk, but net-net once we implement those three, we'd expect to see significant improvements over time. Why don't I take the outlook portion and then I'll kick it to Kate for a little color. Look - we withdrew our guidance this morning, so I don't think it's appropriate to be talking about looking down three or four years in terms of what the margins will do. We'll come back to you with that when the timing is right. Kate, do you want to give some color?"

            "content": "Thanks David. I think it's important to understand in the quarter that we are continuing to shift resources to the future of UPS, which is faster and nimbler. We have continued to target high quality growth opportunities, improving our operating leverage with efficiency initiatives, disguised by some of the issues that Brian raised with the focus upon long term earning power of the company. Because of the work that we've already done in transformation, we believe that we are better prepared to weather the crisis, and as we continue to implement and invest in projects this year, we think that we will continue to see very, very solid numerous benefits in the future as well. In addition to investing in costs, we also invest in new solutions that will continue to help us drive higher quality revenue. A few examples - Kate mentioned reduced transit time, making us very competitive with SMDs; seven day a week operations as we continue to expand our Saturday and Sunday; the UPS Flight Forward and an announcement made yesterday in terms of expanding that and CVS. But as Kate mentioned, the UPS digital access program, it's powerful for SMBs, it will drive that higher quality revenue, and importantly it cements UPS' position as truly the long-term ecommerce provider of choice. Yes, Scott here, thanks for the question, Chris. We continue to reaffirm our transformation target. Importantly, I think that transformation, as I mentioned earlier, has set us up for success. We do believe that our previous estimates of acceleration of ecommerce will probably increase as we think over the next five-year period of time, therefore the investments we're making in automation, the investments we're making in efficiency, we believe will help us deliver those long term transformational targets. Yes, thanks David. The transformation program is multi-year, and as I mentioned before, it's focused on how we enable and invest in higher revenue business, but also how we protect margin through reductions in cost. Juan covered the reduction in costs that we're making through automation and technology. We also continue to invest in a more efficient business overall. Our cost per piece in the long term, we see as an opportunity to continue to invest to reduce. We have continued to invest over these periods of time in our competitiveness, both in terms of revenue and cost, and we'll continue to do that with the expectation that net total shareholder value will increase. Yes, I think what's important is that we have tracked over the last several years a number of market dynamics, but I think substantially the brick and mortar world has had a reset. What that reset will mean into the long term is not yet clear until we emerge into recovery, but I think that there is now a behavior that is baked and we continue to assess now what our estimates are going to be - one, the penetration of retail in terms of digital platforms, and then what volume that creates for UPS."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to our host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nScott Childress: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS Fourth Quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal security laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which are described in our 2020 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports we file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. For the fourth quarter of 2021, GAAP results included a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $14 million and after-tax transformation and other charges of $45 million. The after-tax total for these items is $59 million, an impact to fourth quarter 2021 EPS of $0.07 per diluted share. The mark-to-market pension charge of $14 million represents losses recognized outside of 10% corridor on company sponsored pension and post retirement plans. Additional detail regarding year-end pension charges are included in the appendix of our fourth quarter 2021 earnings presentation that will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website later today. Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude year-end pension charges and transformation and other charges. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, is available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. If you wish to ask a question, press one then zero on your phone to enter the queue. Please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you, Scott, and good morning. What an incredible year it's been at UPS. Let me begin by recognizing the efforts of our amazing UPSers, 534,000 strong around the world. Not only did our team once again provide industry-leading service during peak, but over the last year we delivered 1.1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses with 99.9% on-time service. I'm so very proud of our team and what we've accomplished. The external environment is challenging due to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, labor tightness, upstream supply chain jams and rising inflation, but inside our better not bigger framework, we are a maniacal about controlling what we can control. We are laser focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve and allocating capital in a disciplined fashion. This is enabling us to move faster and to be more agile so that we capture the best opportunities in the market, enhance the customer experience and continuously improve our financial performance. Looking at the fourth quarter, our results exceeded our expectations driven by improved revenue quality across all three of our business segments and significant gains in productivity. Consolidated revenue rose 11.5% from last year to $27.8 billion and operating profit grew 37.7% from last year to $4 billion. This is the highest quarterly operating profit in the company's history. And for the full year 2021, our business delivered record financial results. Consolidated revenue increased 15% to reach $97.3 billion and operating profit totaled $13.1 billion, 50.8% higher than last year. We generated $10.9 billion in free cash flow more than double the amount generated in the prior year and diluted earnings per share were $12.13, an increase of 47.4%. In a moment, Brian will provide more detail about our financial results. At our June Investor and Analyst Day, I said, intent is not a strategy and vision without action is just a dream. At UPS, we are acting on our customer-first people-led innovation-driven strategy as we transform nearly every aspect of our business. Starting with Customer First, as we've discussed, we are focused on growing in the parts of the market that value our end-to-end network, including B2B, healthcare, SMBs and large enterprise accounts. In 2021, our SMB average daily volume grew 18% and represented 26.8% of our total U.S. volume, putting us on track to achieve our 2023 target of more than 30%. Our Digital Access Program, or DAP, makes it easy for SMBs to access UPS services and it's an important driver of our SMB growth. In 2020, I challenged the team to turn DAP into $1 billion business. In 2021, DAP generated $1.3 billion in revenue. Looking ahead, we expect DAP to reach more than $2 billion in 2022 as we add new partners and expand to additional countries. SMB opportunities outside of the U.S. are tremendous. And in the fourth quarter, our international SMB revenue growth rate was 18%. As we expand DAP, grow with SMBs across Europe and introduce new partnerships, we expect to gain overall SMB revenue share faster than the market growth. Healthcare is another market we are focused on. And in 2021, our healthcare portfolio reached more than $8 billion in revenue. Here, we serve complex customers with our global footprint of healthcare facilities and cold chain solutions. Our healthcare expertise and end-to-end solutions are unmatched in the industry, and we are well on our way to hitting our $10 billion revenue target for 2023. And amid the bottlenecks and uncertainty, our Supply Chain Solutions group is providing customer supply chain flexibility and resiliency through alternative routings and solutions. Demand for forwarding products continued to be strong in the fourth quarter. In fact, ocean shipments were up double digits and container rates remain elevated in the market. Now from an experience perspective, Customer First is about providing a frictionless end-to-end customer experience. We are attacking the biggest pain points first and over the last several months have rolled out improvements to the digital experience in pickup, claims at ups.com. You may not know this, but we generate over $9 billion in gross revenue annually from transactions on our global website. We redesigned the U.S. site in 2021 and saw site visits grow one hundredfold with an equally impressive growth in monthly page views, up from 10,000 in January to 600,000 in December. We've got more plans to improve the ups.com experience around the world, which should lead to higher revenue and better customer satisfaction. We know it will take time to move the needle on our net promoter score, which stands at 30, but we set a target of 50 and have laid out a path to get there. Moving to the second element of our strategy, people-led; here we focus on the employee experience and making UPS a great place to work. We measure our performance by how likely an employee is to recommend others to work at UPS. When I became CEO in 2020, our likelihood to recommend metrics stood at 51% globally and our goal is to surpass 80%. We've made great strides, gaining 10 percentage points to finish 2021 at 61%. And now to the last leg of our strategic platform, innovation-driven is at the heart of what we do.  Our global smart logistics network powered by technology developed by UPS engineers enabled us to deliver another successful peak. It may have been our hardest peak ever. We had higher volume than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter and lower volume at the end, but our sales, engineering and operating teams remained agile and pivoted with changes in global market conditions and the needs of our customers. We delivered excellent service levels, avoided chaos costs and improved efficiency in the network. In fact, productivity in our U.S. operations improved by 1.7% for the fourth quarter as measured by pieces per hour. Progress on the innovation-driven element of our strategy is all about driving higher returns on invested capital. As Brian will detail in 2021, we reversed a multi-year downward trend in this metric and delivered a return on invested capital of 30.8%, 910 basis points above 2020. We remain disciplined in our capital allocation priorities and commitments. In regard to capital expenditures, we are increasing our investments back into the business to drive innovation and growth. We just started the first phase of what we're calling smart package smart facility, which over time will put our FID tax on all of our packages. This initiative will enhance customer experience while improving UPS productivity by eliminating millions of manual scams every day. Brian will share more detail on our CapEx plans during his remarks. In June, we told you we were going to target a dividend payout ratio at year end of 50% of adjusted earnings per share. And we're doing just that. Today, the UPS Board approved a 49% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.02 per share to $1.52 per share. This represents the largest quarterly dividend increase in our company's history. Our strategy is building a solid foundation for our business and enabling agility. While we expect 2022 to be another challenging year, we've got momentum. So let me end by sharing our 2022 financial goals. Building on the record results we delivered last year, we anticipate delivering our 2023 consolidated revenue and operating margin targets one year ahead of our plan. In 2022, consolidated revenues are expected to be about $102 billion. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7% and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%. Brian will provide more details on our outlook. I'm excited about the many opportunities in front of us. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol. And good morning. In my comments I'll cover three areas, starting with our fourth quarter results, then I'll cover our full year 2021 results, including cash and share owner returns, and lastly, I'll share our financial outlook for 2022. In the fourth quarter, supply chain challenges and the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant weighed on global economic growth. In fact, the U.S. December retail sales report came in lower than forecasted and the inventory to sales ratio remained at historic lows. Despite these factors, our financial performance was better than we expected as the progress we've made executing our strategy continues to deliver strong results. Consolidated revenue increased 11.5% to $27.8 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $4 billion, 37.7% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14.2%, which was 270 basis points above last year. For the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $3.59, up 35% from the same period last year. And full year EPS was $12.13 per diluted share an increase of 47.4% year-over-year. Now let's look at our business segments. U.S. Domestic delivered outstanding fourth quarter results. Our success was driven by gains in revenue quality and productivity, as well as our ability to quickly adjust our network to match capacity with the needs of our customers while providing industry-leading service. Average daily volume increased by 39,000 packages per day or a 0.2% year-over-year to a total of 25.2 million packages per day. This was below our expectations due to the soft retail environment in December.  Regarding revenue quality, the impact of our better not bigger approach is continuing to drive improvement in customer mix. In fact, SMB average daily volume, including platforms grew 8.4% outpacing the market. And in the fourth quarter, SMBs made up 25.8 of U.S. domestic volume, up 240 basis points versus last year. Mix also shifted positively toward commercial volume as our B2B average daily volume continued to recover and was up 8.8%. B2B represented 36% of our volume compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $17.7 billion up 12.4% driven by a 10.5% increase in revenue per piece. Fuel drove 380 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate. And demand related surcharges drove a 110 basis points of the growth rate increase. Revenue per piece grew across all products and customer segments with ground revenue per piece up 10%. Turning to costs, total expense grew 8.1%. Fuel drove 230 basis points of the expense growth rate increase. Wages and benefits, which included market rate adjustments drove 410 basis points of the increase. And the remaining increase in the expense growth rate was due to several factors, including higher depreciation, federal excise taxes and weakened expansion costs. Productivity improvements helped partially offset the increase in expense. For example, through our ongoing efforts to optimize our trailer loads, we eliminated over 1000 loads per day, compared to the same time period last year. Turning to the holiday season in the U.S., our teams did an excellent job executing our plan and adjusting where appropriate. Early in the quarter volume came in stronger than expected. And we quickly adjusted the network by leveraging our weekend operations, package flow technology and automated facilities. Late in the quarter, volume levels were lower than we expected as Omicron and inventory challenges negatively impacted the enterprise retail sector. Again, our operators adjusted the network and importantly, also pulled out cost. We decreased staffing levels and returned rental equipment early, which helped to lower the year-over-year operating expense growth rate. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $2.2 billion in operating profit, an increase of $786 million or 57% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. And operating margin expanded 340 basis points to 12.2%. Moving to International, the segment delivered excellent results by focusing on revenue quality and adjusting network capacity. Because of tough year-over-year comps and COVID-19 dynamics, we anticipated a fourth quarter decline in average daily volume, which was down 4.8%. On a more positive note, product mix was favorable with B2B average daily volume up 4.7% on a year-over-year basis. This partially offset a decline in BSC volume, which was down 18.4% compared to an increase of 104% during the same period last year. In addition to tough year-over-year comps, total export average daily volume declined by 5.2% due to the decrease in volume between the UK and Europe arising from Brexit disruptions and from fewer flights coming out of Asia. In the fourth quarter, we operated 105 fewer flights than planned, primarily due to COVID-19. Despite these factors, for the fourth quarter, international revenue increased 13.1% to $5.4 billion. Revenue per piece increased 16.4%, including a 730 basis point benefit from fuel and a 340 basis point benefit from demand-related surcharges. The International segment delivered record operating profit and fourth quarter operating margin. Operating profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of 14.7%, and operating margin was 24.7%. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions, the business segment delivered record fourth quarter top and bottom-line results as our team executed extremely well in a challenging environment. Revenue increased to $4.7 billion, up 6.7%, despite a $789 million reduction in revenue from the divestiture of UPS Freight. Looking at the key performance drivers, forwarding revenue was up 37.9% and operating profit more than doubled as global market demand remained strong and capacity stayed tight. International air freight kilos increased 3.3%. And in ocean freight volume growth on the trans-Pacific eastbound lane, our largest trade-lane grew 7.8%, which was more than twice the market growth rate. Within forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit grew revenue and profit by double digits, driven by revenue quality initiatives and strong cost management. And our healthcare portfolio delivered strong profits in the fourth quarter led by pharma and medical device customers. In the fourth quarter supply chain solutions generated strong operating profit of $456 million and delivered an operating margin of 9.7%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $173 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $267 million, and lastly our effective tax rate came in at 22%. Now let me comment on our full year 2021 results. Starting at the consolidated level revenue increased $12.7 billion to $97.3 billion. We reduced our cost to serve through a combination of non-operating cost reductions along with improved productivity. We grew operating profit by $4.4 billion, an increase of 50.8% finishing the year at $13.1 billion. Operating margin was 13.5% an increase of 320 basis points. And for context, this is the highest consolidated operating margin we've had in 14 years. We increased our ROIC to 30.8%, an increase of 910 basis points. We generated $10.9 billion of free cash flow, an increase of 114% over 2020. And we strengthened the balance sheet by paying off $2.55 billion of long-term debt. And we reduced our pension liabilities by $7.8 billion, which improved our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 1.9 turns compared to 3.6 last year. And we returned over $3.9 billion of cash to share owners through dividends and share buybacks. Now for a few full year highlights for the segments. In U.S. domestic, operating profit was up 62.7%, an increase of $2.6 billion to reach $6.7 billion for the full year. And we expanded operating margin to 11.1% a year-over-year increase of 340 basis points. International grew operating profit by $1.2 billion ending the year at a record $4.7 billion in profit and operating margin was 24.2%, an increase of 200 basis points. And supply chain solutions increased operating profit by $649 million, up 61.3% and delivered operating margin of 9.8%, 280 basis points above 2020. 2021 was an outstanding year for UPS, which brings us back to our outlook for 2022. Global GDP is expected to grow 4.2%. We are continuing to pay close attention to and manage through several external factors, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures, upstream supply chain constraints and labor shortages. As a result, we expect the environment to remain dynamic in 2022. Most importantly, within this backdrop, we will focus on controlling what we can control and continuing to advance our strategic initiatives. And as Carol stated, we expect to deliver our 2023 consolidated financial targets one-year early. So, looking at 2022 on a consolidated, revenues are expected to be about $102 billion, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS freight. Additionally, consolidated operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7%. In U.S. domestic we anticipate revenue growth of around 5.5% with revenue per piece growing faster than volume. We expect pricing in the industry to remain firm and will continue to price based on the value we provide to our customers. As a result, we anticipate domestic operating margin will expand around 50 basis points in 2022. Lastly, in the U.S. we expect to deliver an incremental revenue-to-profit conversion percentage in the low-20s for the full year. Moving to the international segment, we expect to continue growing faster than the market. Revenue growth is anticipated to be approximately 7.7% with volume growing slightly faster than revenue. More specifically, we expect to grow faster in our transborder ground products. Additionally, we expect international demand related surcharges to remain elevated in 2022. Pulling it all together operating profit in the international segment is expected to increase around 5% and operating margin is anticipated to be around 23.6%. In supply chain solutions we expect revenue to be around $17 billion driven by continued strong growth in healthcare and elevated demand in forwarding. However, we expect ocean surcharge rates to moderate below 2021 peak levels. Therefore, we expect operating profit to be down from what we reported in 2021. Operating margin is expected to be about 9.4%. And for modeling purposes below the line, we anticipate $1.2 billion in other pension income, partly offset by $665 million in interest expense. The full year net impact is expected to be around $570 million, which can be spread evenly across the quarters. Now let's turn to full year 2022 capital allocation. As we discussed at last year's Investor and Analyst Day, we've transitioned to a discipline and programmatic approach to capital expenditures in line with the CapEx range we shared then, we expect 2022 capital expenditures to be about 5.4% of revenue or $5.5 billion. These investments will continue to improve overall network efficiency and move us further down the path to achieving our 2050 carbon neutral goal. About 60% of our capital spending plan will be allocated to growth projects and about 40% to maintenance. Let me give you a few project highlights. We have 30 delivery centers and two automated hub projects planned to be delivered this year. Combined, these projects will enable us to drive greater efficiency by better balancing sort capacity with delivery capacity. We will purchase over 3,700 alternative fuel vehicles this year, including around 425 arrival electric delivery vehicles to be deployed in the U.S. and in Europe. We will take delivery of two new 747-8 aircraft in 2022, which adds international capacity and will make pre-delivery payments on the 19 Boeing 767 freighters that we announced in December. The 767s are planned to enter our fleet between 2023 and 2025. And lastly, across these projects and others, our annual capital expenditures will again include over $1 billion of investments that support our carbon-neutral goals. Now let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow of around $9 billion, including our annual pension contributions, which are equal to our expected service costs. As Carol mentioned, the Board has approved a dividend per share of $1.52 for the first quarter, which represents a 49% increase in our dividend. We are planning to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends in 2022 subject to Board approval. We expect to buy back at least $1 billion of our shares, and we'll evaluate additional opportunities as the year progresses. We expect diluted share count to be about 880 million shares throughout the year. Finally, our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. In closing, the strategic and financial progress we've made in 2021 delivered consistent returns and created strong momentum as we entered 2022. We remain laser-focused on continuously improving our financial performance by enhancing revenue quality, reducing our cost-to-serve and staying disciplined on capital allocation. Thank you, and operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Hi. Good morning. Obviously, you have done a really good job on domestic profit per package in the fourth quarter and you gave some good color for 2022. Can you talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about the revenue per fees, cost per base and maybe what some of the key drivers are in 2022 around productivity? Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Hi, Jordan, thanks for the questions. So, in 2022, we're thinking ADV, it will probably be in the low single digits, 1.5%. Revenue, we're expecting to be 5.5. As we think about that, SMB mix will continue to grow probably about 150 basis points. So slightly lower than the growth trajectory we saw in 2021, but continue to push, and that drives benefit on the revenue side. Demand surcharges are likely to be fairly flattish, and then fuel is going to be likely not as high as we saw in 2021. The rate, as you know, most of our contracts are locked in for multi-year contracts, so those rates are in place driving the 5.5% revenue growth. On the productivity side, we're going to build on the momentum we saw in Q4. Carol talked about the pieces per hour productivity over 1.5%, very, very favorable. We'll continue those trends and continue to take non-op cost out of the business. So, we feel good about the margin expansion of 50 basis points in the 2022.\nCarol Tomé: Maybe just a little more color on the productivity initiatives. Nando is doing – and team are doing a great job there. He's identified 10 key productivity initiatives in 2022, running anywhere from improving cube utilization, and we've already seen some good movement there, but we've got more to do, to basically making sure that we are adhering to our operating standards across the network. Further, we've got more non-ops cost reductions, don't we, and that's all part of our productivity initiatives. So, we feel very good about our ability to leverage expenses as we move into 2022.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks operator and everybody. Congrats on the results. I guess I had a two-parter, if I could. Just talking about productivity, Carol, in the domestic business to the lens of packages per direct labor hour, everybody is trying to figure out where the endpoint – or not the endpoint, what the potential is for domestic margins. And if we look at it through the number of packages per direct labor hour, where are you on that metric? How much further improvement do you think that's there through the CapEx that you're allocating to technology? Just give us a little bit – that may give us a little bit of a hint into what the further margin opportunities in 2022. And just as a follow-up, I was hoping you can also update us on the Amazon exposure as you typically do when you close out the year. Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Sure. Well, I'm super excited about the productivity opportunities we have inside of our business. We're pretty good at what we do, but we can be even better. I think at the third quarter earnings call, we talked a lot about inside operations and how we're going about automating our inside operations. We have about 140,000 people inside of our operations. And through automatic bagging, automatic label application, robotic induction into the small sorts, there is a way to really drive productivity inside of the buildings. We also have an opportunity with the RFID project that we've just kicked off, smart package, smart facility. You can imagine our pre-loaders are manually scanning every package. That's 20 million-plus packages a day that are being manually scanned. That manual scan will disappear with the smart package, smart facilities. So, the opportunities are endless in many ways. To your question about where will the U.S. margin go? We have told you our goal is 12%. Let us get there. We'll ring the bell and then we'll reset it. As it relates to Amazon, as we talked to you at the end of the third quarter, Amazon's revenue surged with us during 2020 as a result of the pandemic. At the third quarter, their revenue as a percent of our total is trending more like what we experienced in 2019. And that's held true for the entire year. Amazon's revenue as a percent of our total for the year was 11.7% compared to 11.6% in 2019.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. I want to ask a little bit about international, a lot of moving parts there right now. You did talk about some SMB opportunity growth, and I know there's some white space that you're going after. Your margin for 2022 is certainly trending above that sort of 2023 target. Could you maybe help us understand the evolution of the international business? I know the surcharges come off potentially and – through that revenue quality focus versus that white space opportunity that you have there?\nCarol Tomé: Well, we're thrilled with our International business, and it's been challenging there because of COVID and they've done a masterful job of working through that. And the profitability is, as you point out, Allison, above where we thought we would be when we put together our three-year target. So, as we look to 2022, we anticipate that the ADV will actually grow faster than the revenue because of geo and mix changes. The team is really leaning into transborder Europe, excited about what we can do there. We do that, as you know, in an asset-light fashion, which is very value nutritive for our company. We're also liking the business – the opportunity to grow our Asian flights. And as you know, we added to new large freighters to help grow that space. Brian, anything you want to add?\nBrian Newman: Well, I think, as we think about growing faster than the market, Carol, the DRS we see is remaining elevated. There's been a lot of challenges on the passenger side with the Asia lane. So, we expect, Allison, those surcharges to remain elevated this year. So, while there's an 80 basis point decline in margin year-over-year, 23.6 is actually ahead of where we thought we'd be in terms of the journey here. So, team is doing a terrific job.\nCarol Tomé: And I was remiss in not mentioning DAP. We've had such success with the DAP here in the United States, and we're taking our DAP platform outside the United States, which will be a driver of growth.\nAllison Poliniak: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hi, good morning, Carol and Brian, obviously a great quarter and great job in following through on the better not bigger. So, my question is just on the pricing. Brian, you mentioned kind of most are locked into contracts. It sounded like it's a multiyear contract. Maybe dig into the sustainability of pricing growth. You hit 10% of domestic. You start lapping those double-digit growth levels as we entered 2022. Maybe talk about your thoughts there. And then just to wrap that up, peak was just so different this year. Is there something we should think about in the year ahead just because maybe costs were better because the network was flatter? So how should we think about the impact for next year?\nBrian Newman: Yes, Ken, happy to talk about the revenue quality. It's been a hallmark of our success and I think underpinning the better not bigger. Look, I think Carol said at the investor conference, if we did one thing, which was get the SMB mix up to 30% that would basically deliver our 12% domestic margin. We were at 26.8% at the close of last year. We have plans to grow that by 150 basis points. We're investing in capability. We're very confident in our ability to do that. So, I like the sustainability from an SMB mix perspective. As you think about rate in the contracts, we're pushing around 60% in terms of renegotiating contracts. So, there is still mileage there to go from a sustainability standpoint. So overall, demand surcharges were elevated last year. So, we're not counting in the plan too much from an increase there. So, I think we feel not only is 2022 in good shape, but we've got room to run in 2023 and beyond.\nCarol Tomé: And the small package market is expected to grow about 5% in 2022. There is additional capacity being added, but not enough that's going to create surplus. So, the environment supports the firm pricing as we look to 2022.\nOperator: Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks, and good morning and congratulations on the strong results. Brian, I was curious if maybe you would share some of the shape of your expectations, particularly for U.S. domestic. I know that the comparisons are difficult in the first half of the year. But is the expectation that you're going to see that low single-digit volume growth pretty consistently and any directional comments on the expectations for that 50 basis points of margin improvement? Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Yes, Todd, happy to. So, as we think about the volume, revenue and profit in the domestic business for 1H and 2H, I would tell you that revenue is going to be fairly balanced, maybe a little bit higher than the 5.5 in the second half right around or slightly lower. So, you can count on 5.5-ish as a good metric for the first and the second half in terms of growth rates. And actually, the operating margin of 11.6, I think that's a good number for you to hold for 1H and 2H because that's – from a planning perspective, we're also fairly balanced, might be a little bit softer volume in the first half of the year as we came out of the low retail sales report coming in December. Omicron obviously had a little bit of impact going into January. But overall, low single digit for the full year, we feel good about.\nCarol Tomé: And Brian, I feel terrible. We didn't answer Ben's [ph] questions about peak expectations. We just talked about pricing. So maybe we should talk a little bit about peak because I don't want to lose the opportunity to just give a shout-out to the team for operating in such a really interesting environment, where our volume was higher at the beginning of the quarter than we expected and lower at the end. Our team showed incredible agility to adjust to the market demands. And that's what you should expect going forward, incredible agility. We have built technology that's surpassed in the industry that allows us to react day by day to what we're seeing in the marketplace. We also have a different attitude, I think. So, we're not going to just keep vehicles and planes and people in place, hoping that the volume will come. We're going to react to the market and that really drove productivity. The other aspect of peak this year as we look forward that may not materialize next year, we don't think it will, is the slowdown in December retail sales. That was a function of Omicron and the low inventory to sales ratio and so many other factors. We would expect peak next year from a revenue mix to be more like what we've seen in the past, which is more enterprise business. So hopefully, those two dynamics are helpful as you think about peak of 2022.\nOperator: Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So, it looks like compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenue dropped about 45%, which is your lowest level in a while. I know some of that is obviously a benefit from your recent automation initiatives, but also, we are in a very inflationary labor environment. So would love your view on how that trends into 2022 and 2023. Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Yes, let me please Carol.\nCarol Tomé: Go ahead.\nBrian Newman: Ravi, look, the trends on comp and benefit we don't see anything extraordinary. Obviously, from a management compensation standpoint, delivering the targets, et cetera, will fluctuate in terms of the stock comp, et cetera. But we're looking to manage from a management compensation. Carol talked about agility. We're trying to think through from a field perspective manage the labor cost. We have a good handle on the union piece in terms of contractual rates and then we're pulsing MRAs as needed.\nCarol Tomé: And there are just a couple of nuances in the quarter when you look at the year-over-year performance. Remember last year, we had an impairment because of freight. So that was on the different line that was on the other expense line. But up on the comp and benefit line. freight had a $245 million impact year-on-year, didn't it? So, you've got to back the freight noise out to understand the real performance and comp and benefits.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you.\nOperator: Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup, please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, great, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on pricing if you could just sort of give us an update on where you are in terms of the book of business in terms of domestic repricing? And then maybe how much you think you'll be getting in 2022? And if you can give us some help around the magnitude of some of these rate increases, I think it would be helpful. And then just want to understand also just kind of on the comment about Omicron impacting December volume activity. Is that in the rearview do you feel like you've kind of reaccelerated back to what you'd expect to be somewhat normal levels for this time of the year? Just want to get a sense of how that's playing out.\nBrian Newman: Yes, happy to comment further on the pricing side. So, as we look at 2022, the composition of the roughly 4% RPP growth rate is going to be about 40% of that. As I think I mentioned, we're about 60% the way through with contract renegotiations, mix will be another 30%, and then fuel will actually contribute about 30%. They're all levers that we pull with respect to revenue management.\nCarol Tomé: And in terms of current trends, the first week of January, I'm like, where are the customers? Everybody seemed to be net home because of Omicron, but the business has come back roaring. So, we're feeling really good about the guidance that we've just given.\nChris Wetherbee: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein, please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: You mentioned sixty-forty is the right split for growth to maintenance. How would that split look if we thought about domestic versus international? And just as a follow-up to that, if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about growing capacity in the domestic network longer term. I'm just wondering, if we think about a post-COVID world where supply chains are reorganizing, maybe a little bit more B2B growth, is the network ready for that kind of demand?\nBrian Newman: Yes, David, happy to comment. So, as you think about the CapEx domestically, we're going to have about – of the $1.3 billion increase in CapEx from 2021 to 2022, 75% of that's going to go into car positions, we've got sortation capacity and tech automation, which Carol was referencing earlier, about 25% will be increasing the amount of vehicles and IT investments. So that's a relative split from a largely a domestic point of view. And in terms of capacity going forward, we're not just relying on capital. We're enhancing the weekend service to provide additional cat capacity, smoothing the days of the week. But we are putting 60% of our capital spend in 2022. The $5.5 billion is going towards growth. We're bringing on 30 delivery centers. We actually have 50 coming online, but 30 in the year. And then we've got a big hub – regional hub in Pennsylvania coming on as well.\nCarol Tomé: And as we think about the future, we really, over the past 18 months, have really worked to optimize our network and feeling good about that. That gives us the confidence in our ability to grow into the future and add capacity that will be nutritive to the return on capital and to the bottom line. But as Brian said, for our plans for 2022, we are well set to handle the volume that will come our way.\nDavid Vernon: All right, thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. Carol, I think, you said let us hit the 12% margin first, and then we'll kind of get back to you. So, I'm not looking for an update on that target. But I wondered if you could offer some kind of directional thoughts on when you get to 2023, do you shift the mix of focus to more volume growth or more revenue growth and less focus on margin improvement? Or do you think that you continue with what I'd characterize as a pretty balanced approach in terms of revenue growth and margin? And then I guess if I can sneak in another one on the Amazon mix, do you expect that percent of revenue to go down or to be kind of stable? Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: So, if we think about longer-term margin, I'd really like to get to that 12% number before we talk about longer-term margin. A year ago, we said on this call and we said we would have a double-digit operating margin in the U.S. and the action was, I don't think you are going to do that. Well, we showed that we could. Let us get to the 12% number, and then we'll come back and tell you where we think we're going to take the company. On the Amazon percentage of total revenue, it's totally a function of where the growth comes from. We have a great relationship with Amazon, and we have mutually agreed about the volume that we should take and the volume that they should keep that works best for both companies. And so, as we continue to lean into SMBs, and healthcare and B2B, you're going to see shifting of penetration, and we'll report that out to you as the time goes by.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays, please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. I guess I don't want to focus too much on Amazon, but if I look at your average yield performance throughout the year, up double digits. And I think just back-of-the-envelope math here, your largest customer revenue would have been about flat year-on-year. Is there anything to suggest that maybe there was upwards of like a 10% volume shift to their internal network, Carol, off that last comment there?\nCarol Tomé: So, I will just tell you that their revenue grew with us in 2021.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, that’s right.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning.\nBrian Newman: Good morning.\nScott Group: So, I understand you don't want to talk about the U.S. margin targets, but maybe talk consolidated if we're getting there a year early, how you think about 2023. And then – Carol, sorry, I've got some background noise. So, you finished the year with around $10 billion of cash, $9 billion of free cash flow this year, $5 billion of dividend. Why not more buyback?\nBrian Newman: So, Scott, it's Brian. I'm happy to take that. Our return to shareholders in 2021 was $3.9 billion. If you take the dividend and the buyback, that's going up to $6.2 billion this year. That's a 59% increase, pretty healthy. That said, we've declared the dividend. We told you to put $1 billion in your model for share repo. We do have authorization from the board, and we do have ample cash, should we want to get back into the market. So, I would tell you, take the $1 billion as a placeholder, and we'll update you as we go forward.\nCarol Tomé: I would say it's the floor. The authorization that's remaining is $4.5 billion.\nScott Childress: Thanks Scott\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey good morning. Thank you. I appreciate the detailed segment guidance. But I wanted to get your thoughts on inflation as you look at the balance of the year. Do you expect consistent trends from first half to second half, or should we be thinking about a lower cost per package and lower required revenue per package growth to achieve the same margin expansion outcome at some point this year?\nBrian Newman: From an inflation standpoint, I think we would look for higher growth in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. So, as you think about cost per piece in the U.S. in particular, which is sort of 3-plus percent, I would expect that number to be higher in 1H and slightly lower in 2H with a few moving pieces.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And I wonder if I could get a second one here on returns, not returns on capital, which are great, but within the context of e-commerce returns. How big of a business is that for you? And can you talk about growth of that service within the context of your biggest enterprise customers? Thanks for taking the question.\nCarol Tomé: Well, we've been public on our holiday return estimate, $60 million packages and we're well on our way of meeting that number. Broadly speaking, we've got a really great return process for our largest customer, where recipients of packages from that customer can take them to a UPS store and we'll ship them back. It's a great experience. And as you know, we have over 5,000 UPS store locations. Think about the UPS store as just an extension of our network. I'm very excited about what we might be able to do with that asset. It's working for us really well now, but we can do even more with that asset.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. Congratulations and again thank you also for all that detail on the division outlooks. Carol, I want to focus a little bit on ESG here. You mentioned $1 billion of CapEx into carbon-neutral investments. You mentioned the 3,700 alternative fuel vehicles that you'll be bringing on next year. Right now, customers are choosing based on scarcity. But eventually, that's going to change and no doubt, the ESG conversations with your customers are picking up as well. Where are you ahead of the curve in terms of where you want to be right now on ESG? And where is there more work needed to be done?\nCarol Tomé: Well, this is part of our core values and has been part of our core values for a long, long time and we look at – for example, our automotive equipment is a rolling laboratory. We have 13,000 vehicles today that are powered by some sort of an alternative fuel, and we are continuing to invest in that as you heard from Brian. We've set forth measurable goals and milestones along the way to our goal of being carbon neutral by 2050 and some of the investments that we're making today are enabling that. The aircraft, for example that we are buying from Boeing are more energy-efficient. The automobiles that we're buying are more energy efficient and of course, we're moving to all-renewable energy to power our buildings. So, you can get all of these details in our ESG report, and we're committed to reaching that carbon-neutral goal by 2050. As it relates to customer needs, wants and desires it's starting to actually increase particularly outside of the United States. So, this isn't just good for the planet, it's good for business.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. That's the one.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. With the update of the operating target to the pull forward of 2023, I'm not sure how meaningful the three-year cash flow absolute numbers were. And I understand you don't want to guide 2023 early, but can you talk a little bit about anything you have visibility into on either CapEx or cash taxes, pension funding that would impact whatever profit trend that we assume for 2023 as far as the cash flow drop-down? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Yes. I think the free cash flow, Bascome, is going to dip by about $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion from 2021 to 2022. So, as you think about what's driving that, we had prefunded some of our service costs in 2020. So, if you take that $1.7 billion out, it's relatively flattish and I think for the moment, that's a good placeholder. We're throwing off a lot of cash. We're investing in the business to drive operating margin to improve operating cash flow. I don't see a big spike in CapEx anytime soon. If we increase CapEx, it's likely to be for automation to reduce cost, et cetera. But I don't want to get out ahead of my SKUs in terms of the 2023 guide at this point.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for that. And with respect to would you be comfortable issuing another long-term outlook now that you've pulled forward the one from last year? Any thoughts? Is that something that we could expect early next year? Or do you think you need to get through the teamsters negotiation to be able to have that level of certainty? Just any thoughts on when we might hear a longer-term update would be helpful? Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Yes. It's a very fair question. If you don't know where you're going on any road, we'll get you there. So, we appreciate the need to give longer-term guidance. Let us get to our targets, and then we will come back and talk to you.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Bascome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jairam Nathan of Daiwa. Please go ahead.\nJairam Nathan: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I just wanted to kind of – in terms of your better but not bigger strategy, is the company done with most of the areas where you would like to peel back? Or is there more to be done there?\nCarol Tomé: Oh, there's no finish line. We're just getting started in so many ways. When I think about our approach to enterprise data, I'm so excited about it. Today, we have data held in a number of data pools that aren't particularly clean. We've just kicked off an enterprise data strategy initiative that's going to clean up all that data, put it into eight domains. All the consuming applications will go into the domains. We'll have one version of the truth. That's going to drive productivity like we've never seen in this company. That's just one example of things that we got underway. So, there's just no finish line. Would you agree, Brian?\nBrian Newman: Yes. No, we're very focused on a handful of wildly important initiatives, and that's sort of running the better not bigger playbook, and yes, there is no finish line, so a perpetual flywheel.\nJairam Nathan: And I was...\nCarol Tomé: Go ahead, Jairam.\nJairam Nathan: Yes. I'm specifically referring on the revenue side because if I look at your comments, you said Healthcare will be up about $2 billion in 2022 from 2021. I think DAP was about $0.7 billion, and then if I look at your revenue increase; it's about $5 billion. So, it looks like there is some – there's still left – some revenue left or some areas of revenue sources where you would be peeling back and saying, you're kind of getting out of the market. So, I just wanted to understand, is that the right way to think about it?\nCarol Tomé: So don't – we might have confused the messaging because we had some 2023 numbers and some 2022 numbers. The guide we gave was for 2022 and it may not look as aggressive as you might think. But remember there's freight sales that we are comping in 2021 that will not materialize in 2022 and that's about $1 billion of revenue. So, there's plenty of growth for us to go get plenty.\nJairam Nathan: Thanks.\nScott Childress: Steven, we've got time for one more question please.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. I'm going to ask on B2C versus B2B. Brian, how are we comparing now in that mix versus pre-COVID levels? And what's implicit in the guidance over 2022 about how you think each will play in the upcoming year? Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Yes, Scott, good to hear from you. We finished the fourth quarter at 64% B2C. The guide for 2021 is – we'll be roughly in that 60 – low-60s range as we go forward. So, we see it in kind of a low-60s range.\nCarol Tomé: Yes. For the full year, it was in the low-60s, wasn't it?\nBrian Newman: Yes.\nCarol Tomé: It was 61/39. When I came to the company, the previous year it was more like 50/50. There's been a step change in the mix. I think it's going to stay around this 61/39 period, don't you?\nBrian Newman: Agree. Agree. Thanks Scott.\nScott Schneeberger: Congratulations.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you.\nOperator: I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Brian Newman.\nBrian Newman: Thank you, operator. I'd just like to take a minute as we close our call to announce a change within our Investor Relations group. Scott Childress has done an excellent job leading the IR team over the last six years, and I've asked Scott to take on an exciting new role within the finance team continuing to report to myself. Scott will transition his current IR role to Ken Cook, who most of you already know. Scott and Ken have worked together over the past couple of years to ensure a seamless transition. Scott, I know I speak for the entire executive leadership team when I express our sincere gratitude to you on a job well done. I'd also like to welcome Ken into his new role. So, thanks for dialing in today. We look forward to talking to you all soon, and this concludes our call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol. And good morning. In my comments I'll cover three areas, starting with our fourth quarter results, then I'll cover our full year 2021 results, including cash and share owner returns, and lastly, I'll share our financial outlook for 2022. In the fourth quarter, supply chain challenges and the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant weighed on global economic growth. In fact, the U.S. December retail sales report came in lower than forecasted and the inventory to sales ratio remained at historic lows. Despite these factors, our financial performance was better than we expected as the progress we've made executing our strategy continues to deliver strong results. Consolidated revenue increased 11.5% to $27.8 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $4 billion, 37.7% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14.2%, which was 270 basis points above last year. For the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $3.59, up 35% from the same period last year. And full year EPS was $12.13 per diluted share an increase of 47.4% year-over-year. Now let's look at our business segments. U.S. Domestic delivered outstanding fourth quarter results. Our success was driven by gains in revenue quality and productivity, as well as our ability to quickly adjust our network to match capacity with the needs of our customers while providing industry-leading service. Average daily volume increased by 39,000 packages per day or a 0.2% year-over-year to a total of 25.2 million packages per day. This was below our expectations due to the soft retail environment in December.  Regarding revenue quality, the impact of our better not bigger approach is continuing to drive improvement in customer mix. In fact, SMB average daily volume, including platforms grew 8.4% outpacing the market. And in the fourth quarter, SMBs made up 25.8 of U.S. domestic volume, up 240 basis points versus last year. Mix also shifted positively toward commercial volume as our B2B average daily volume continued to recover and was up 8.8%. B2B represented 36% of our volume compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $17.7 billion up 12.4% driven by a 10.5% increase in revenue per piece. Fuel drove 380 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate. And demand related surcharges drove a 110 basis points of the growth rate increase. Revenue per piece grew across all products and customer segments with ground revenue per piece up 10%. Turning to costs, total expense grew 8.1%. Fuel drove 230 basis points of the expense growth rate increase. Wages and benefits, which included market rate adjustments drove 410 basis points of the increase. And the remaining increase in the expense growth rate was due to several factors, including higher depreciation, federal excise taxes and weakened expansion costs. Productivity improvements helped partially offset the increase in expense. For example, through our ongoing efforts to optimize our trailer loads, we eliminated over 1000 loads per day, compared to the same time period last year. Turning to the holiday season in the U.S., our teams did an excellent job executing our plan and adjusting where appropriate. Early in the quarter volume came in stronger than expected. And we quickly adjusted the network by leveraging our weekend operations, package flow technology and automated facilities. Late in the quarter, volume levels were lower than we expected as Omicron and inventory challenges negatively impacted the enterprise retail sector. Again, our operators adjusted the network and importantly, also pulled out cost. We decreased staffing levels and returned rental equipment early, which helped to lower the year-over-year operating expense growth rate. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $2.2 billion in operating profit, an increase of $786 million or 57% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. And operating margin expanded 340 basis points to 12.2%. Moving to International, the segment delivered excellent results by focusing on revenue quality and adjusting network capacity. Because of tough year-over-year comps and COVID-19 dynamics, we anticipated a fourth quarter decline in average daily volume, which was down 4.8%. On a more positive note, product mix was favorable with B2B average daily volume up 4.7% on a year-over-year basis. This partially offset a decline in BSC volume, which was down 18.4% compared to an increase of 104% during the same period last year. In addition to tough year-over-year comps, total export average daily volume declined by 5.2% due to the decrease in volume between the UK and Europe arising from Brexit disruptions and from fewer flights coming out of Asia. In the fourth quarter, we operated 105 fewer flights than planned, primarily due to COVID-19. Despite these factors, for the fourth quarter, international revenue increased 13.1% to $5.4 billion. Revenue per piece increased 16.4%, including a 730 basis point benefit from fuel and a 340 basis point benefit from demand-related surcharges. The International segment delivered record operating profit and fourth quarter operating margin. Operating profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of 14.7%, and operating margin was 24.7%. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions, the business segment delivered record fourth quarter top and bottom-line results as our team executed extremely well in a challenging environment. Revenue increased to $4.7 billion, up 6.7%, despite a $789 million reduction in revenue from the divestiture of UPS Freight. Looking at the key performance drivers, forwarding revenue was up 37.9% and operating profit more than doubled as global market demand remained strong and capacity stayed tight. International air freight kilos increased 3.3%. And in ocean freight volume growth on the trans-Pacific eastbound lane, our largest trade-lane grew 7.8%, which was more than twice the market growth rate. Within forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit grew revenue and profit by double digits, driven by revenue quality initiatives and strong cost management. And our healthcare portfolio delivered strong profits in the fourth quarter led by pharma and medical device customers. In the fourth quarter supply chain solutions generated strong operating profit of $456 million and delivered an operating margin of 9.7%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $173 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $267 million, and lastly our effective tax rate came in at 22%. Now let me comment on our full year 2021 results. Starting at the consolidated level revenue increased $12.7 billion to $97.3 billion. We reduced our cost to serve through a combination of non-operating cost reductions along with improved productivity. We grew operating profit by $4.4 billion, an increase of 50.8% finishing the year at $13.1 billion. Operating margin was 13.5% an increase of 320 basis points. And for context, this is the highest consolidated operating margin we've had in 14 years. We increased our ROIC to 30.8%, an increase of 910 basis points. We generated $10.9 billion of free cash flow, an increase of 114% over 2020. And we strengthened the balance sheet by paying off $2.55 billion of long-term debt. And we reduced our pension liabilities by $7.8 billion, which improved our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 1.9 turns compared to 3.6 last year. And we returned over $3.9 billion of cash to share owners through dividends and share buybacks. Now for a few full year highlights for the segments. In U.S. domestic, operating profit was up 62.7%, an increase of $2.6 billion to reach $6.7 billion for the full year. And we expanded operating margin to 11.1% a year-over-year increase of 340 basis points. International grew operating profit by $1.2 billion ending the year at a record $4.7 billion in profit and operating margin was 24.2%, an increase of 200 basis points. And supply chain solutions increased operating profit by $649 million, up 61.3% and delivered operating margin of 9.8%, 280 basis points above 2020. 2021 was an outstanding year for UPS, which brings us back to our outlook for 2022. Global GDP is expected to grow 4.2%. We are continuing to pay close attention to and manage through several external factors, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures, upstream supply chain constraints and labor shortages. As a result, we expect the environment to remain dynamic in 2022. Most importantly, within this backdrop, we will focus on controlling what we can control and continuing to advance our strategic initiatives. And as Carol stated, we expect to deliver our 2023 consolidated financial targets one-year early. So, looking at 2022 on a consolidated, revenues are expected to be about $102 billion, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS freight. Additionally, consolidated operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7%. In U.S. domestic we anticipate revenue growth of around 5.5% with revenue per piece growing faster than volume. We expect pricing in the industry to remain firm and will continue to price based on the value we provide to our customers. As a result, we anticipate domestic operating margin will expand around 50 basis points in 2022. Lastly, in the U.S. we expect to deliver an incremental revenue-to-profit conversion percentage in the low-20s for the full year. Moving to the international segment, we expect to continue growing faster than the market. Revenue growth is anticipated to be approximately 7.7% with volume growing slightly faster than revenue. More specifically, we expect to grow faster in our transborder ground products. Additionally, we expect international demand related surcharges to remain elevated in 2022. Pulling it all together operating profit in the international segment is expected to increase around 5% and operating margin is anticipated to be around 23.6%. In supply chain solutions we expect revenue to be around $17 billion driven by continued strong growth in healthcare and elevated demand in forwarding. However, we expect ocean surcharge rates to moderate below 2021 peak levels. Therefore, we expect operating profit to be down from what we reported in 2021. Operating margin is expected to be about 9.4%. And for modeling purposes below the line, we anticipate $1.2 billion in other pension income, partly offset by $665 million in interest expense. The full year net impact is expected to be around $570 million, which can be spread evenly across the quarters. Now let's turn to full year 2022 capital allocation. As we discussed at last year's Investor and Analyst Day, we've transitioned to a discipline and programmatic approach to capital expenditures in line with the CapEx range we shared then, we expect 2022 capital expenditures to be about 5.4% of revenue or $5.5 billion. These investments will continue to improve overall network efficiency and move us further down the path to achieving our 2050 carbon neutral goal. About 60% of our capital spending plan will be allocated to growth projects and about 40% to maintenance. Let me give you a few project highlights. We have 30 delivery centers and two automated hub projects planned to be delivered this year. Combined, these projects will enable us to drive greater efficiency by better balancing sort capacity with delivery capacity. We will purchase over 3,700 alternative fuel vehicles this year, including around 425 arrival electric delivery vehicles to be deployed in the U.S. and in Europe. We will take delivery of two new 747-8 aircraft in 2022, which adds international capacity and will make pre-delivery payments on the 19 Boeing 767 freighters that we announced in December. The 767s are planned to enter our fleet between 2023 and 2025. And lastly, across these projects and others, our annual capital expenditures will again include over $1 billion of investments that support our carbon-neutral goals. Now let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow of around $9 billion, including our annual pension contributions, which are equal to our expected service costs. As Carol mentioned, the Board has approved a dividend per share of $1.52 for the first quarter, which represents a 49% increase in our dividend. We are planning to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends in 2022 subject to Board approval. We expect to buy back at least $1 billion of our shares, and we'll evaluate additional opportunities as the year progresses. We expect diluted share count to be about 880 million shares throughout the year. Finally, our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. In closing, the strategic and financial progress we've made in 2021 delivered consistent returns and created strong momentum as we entered 2022. We remain laser-focused on continuously improving our financial performance by enhancing revenue quality, reducing our cost-to-serve and staying disciplined on capital allocation. Thank you, and operator, please open the lines. Hi, Jordan, thanks for the questions. So, in 2022, we're thinking ADV, it will probably be in the low single digits, 1.5%. Revenue, we're expecting to be 5.5. As we think about that, SMB mix will continue to grow probably about 150 basis points. So slightly lower than the growth trajectory we saw in 2021, but continue to push, and that drives benefit on the revenue side. Demand surcharges are likely to be fairly flattish, and then fuel is going to be likely not as high as we saw in 2021. The rate, as you know, most of our contracts are locked in for multi-year contracts, so those rates are in place driving the 5.5% revenue growth. On the productivity side, we're going to build on the momentum we saw in Q4. Carol talked about the pieces per hour productivity over 1.5%, very, very favorable. We'll continue those trends and continue to take non-op cost out of the business. So, we feel good about the margin expansion of 50 basis points in the 2022. Well, I think, as we think about growing faster than the market, Carol, the DRS we see is remaining elevated. There's been a lot of challenges on the passenger side with the Asia lane. So, we expect, Allison, those surcharges to remain elevated this year. So, while there's an 80 basis point decline in margin year-over-year, 23.6 is actually ahead of where we thought we'd be in terms of the journey here. So, team is doing a terrific job. Yes, Ken, happy to talk about the revenue quality. It's been a hallmark of our success and I think underpinning the better not bigger. Look, I think Carol said at the investor conference, if we did one thing, which was get the SMB mix up to 30% that would basically deliver our 12% domestic margin. We were at 26.8% at the close of last year. We have plans to grow that by 150 basis points. We're investing in capability. We're very confident in our ability to do that. So, I like the sustainability from an SMB mix perspective. As you think about rate in the contracts, we're pushing around 60% in terms of renegotiating contracts. So, there is still mileage there to go from a sustainability standpoint. So overall, demand surcharges were elevated last year. So, we're not counting in the plan too much from an increase there. So, I think we feel not only is 2022 in good shape, but we've got room to run in 2023 and beyond. Yes, Todd, happy to. So, as we think about the volume, revenue and profit in the domestic business for 1H and 2H, I would tell you that revenue is going to be fairly balanced, maybe a little bit higher than the 5.5 in the second half right around or slightly lower. So, you can count on 5.5-ish as a good metric for the first and the second half in terms of growth rates. And actually, the operating margin of 11.6, I think that's a good number for you to hold for 1H and 2H because that's – from a planning perspective, we're also fairly balanced, might be a little bit softer volume in the first half of the year as we came out of the low retail sales report coming in December. Omicron obviously had a little bit of impact going into January. But overall, low single digit for the full year, we feel good about. Yes, let me please Carol. Ravi, look, the trends on comp and benefit we don't see anything extraordinary. Obviously, from a management compensation standpoint, delivering the targets, et cetera, will fluctuate in terms of the stock comp, et cetera. But we're looking to manage from a management compensation. Carol talked about agility. We're trying to think through from a field perspective manage the labor cost. We have a good handle on the union piece in terms of contractual rates and then we're pulsing MRAs as needed. Yes, happy to comment further on the pricing side. So, as we look at 2022, the composition of the roughly 4% RPP growth rate is going to be about 40% of that. As I think I mentioned, we're about 60% the way through with contract renegotiations, mix will be another 30%, and then fuel will actually contribute about 30%. They're all levers that we pull with respect to revenue management. Yes, David, happy to comment. So, as you think about the CapEx domestically, we're going to have about – of the $1.3 billion increase in CapEx from 2021 to 2022, 75% of that's going to go into car positions, we've got sortation capacity and tech automation, which Carol was referencing earlier, about 25% will be increasing the amount of vehicles and IT investments. So that's a relative split from a largely a domestic point of view. And in terms of capacity going forward, we're not just relying on capital. We're enhancing the weekend service to provide additional cat capacity, smoothing the days of the week. But we are putting 60% of our capital spend in 2022. The $5.5 billion is going towards growth. We're bringing on 30 delivery centers. We actually have 50 coming online, but 30 in the year. And then we've got a big hub – regional hub in Pennsylvania coming on as well. Good morning. So, Scott, it's Brian. I'm happy to take that. Our return to shareholders in 2021 was $3.9 billion. If you take the dividend and the buyback, that's going up to $6.2 billion this year. That's a 59% increase, pretty healthy. That said, we've declared the dividend. We told you to put $1 billion in your model for share repo. We do have authorization from the board, and we do have ample cash, should we want to get back into the market. So, I would tell you, take the $1 billion as a placeholder, and we'll update you as we go forward. From an inflation standpoint, I think we would look for higher growth in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. So, as you think about cost per piece in the U.S. in particular, which is sort of 3-plus percent, I would expect that number to be higher in 1H and slightly lower in 2H with a few moving pieces. Yes. I think the free cash flow, Bascome, is going to dip by about $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion from 2021 to 2022. So, as you think about what's driving that, we had prefunded some of our service costs in 2020. So, if you take that $1.7 billion out, it's relatively flattish and I think for the moment, that's a good placeholder. We're throwing off a lot of cash. We're investing in the business to drive operating margin to improve operating cash flow. I don't see a big spike in CapEx anytime soon. If we increase CapEx, it's likely to be for automation to reduce cost, et cetera. But I don't want to get out ahead of my SKUs in terms of the 2023 guide at this point. Thanks, Bascome. Yes. No, we're very focused on a handful of wildly important initiatives, and that's sort of running the better not bigger playbook, and yes, there is no finish line, so a perpetual flywheel. Yes, Scott, good to hear from you. We finished the fourth quarter at 64% B2C. The guide for 2021 is – we'll be roughly in that 60 – low-60s range as we go forward. So, we see it in kind of a low-60s range. Yes. Agree. Agree. Thanks Scott. Thank you, operator. I'd just like to take a minute as we close our call to announce a change within our Investor Relations group. Scott Childress has done an excellent job leading the IR team over the last six years, and I've asked Scott to take on an exciting new role within the finance team continuing to report to myself.

            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning. What an incredible year it's been at UPS. Let me begin by recognizing the efforts of our amazing UPSers, 534,000 strong around the world. Not only did our team once again provide industry-leading service during peak, but over the last year we delivered 1.1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses with 99.9% on-time service. I'm so very proud of our team and what we've accomplished. The external environment is challenging due to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, labor tightness, upstream supply chain jams and rising inflation, but inside our better not bigger framework, we are a maniacal about controlling what we can control. We are laser focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve and allocating capital in a disciplined fashion. This is enabling us to move faster and to be more agile so that we capture the best opportunities in the market, enhance the customer experience and continuously improve our financial performance. Looking at the fourth quarter, our results exceeded our expectations driven by improved revenue quality across all three of our business segments and significant gains in productivity. Consolidated revenue rose 11.5% from last year to $27.8 billion and operating profit grew 37.7% from last year to $4 billion. This is the highest quarterly operating profit in the company's history. And for the full year 2021, our business delivered record financial results. Consolidated revenue increased 15% to reach $97.3 billion and operating profit totaled $13.1 billion, 50.8% higher than last year. We generated $10.9 billion in free cash flow more than double the amount generated in the prior year and diluted earnings per share were $12.13, an increase of 47.4%. In a moment, Brian will provide more detail about our financial results. At our June Investor and Analyst Day, I said, intent is not a strategy and vision without action is just a dream. At UPS, we are acting on our customer-first people-led innovation-driven strategy as we transform nearly every aspect of our business. Starting with Customer First, as we've discussed, we are focused on growing in the parts of the market that value our end-to-end network, including B2B, healthcare, SMBs and large enterprise accounts. In 2021, our SMB average daily volume grew 18% and represented 26.8% of our total U.S. volume, putting us on track to achieve our 2023 target of more than 30%. Our Digital Access Program, or DAP, makes it easy for SMBs to access UPS services and it's an important driver of our SMB growth. In 2020, I challenged the team to turn DAP into $1 billion business. In 2021, DAP generated $1.3 billion in revenue. Looking ahead, we expect DAP to reach more than $2 billion in 2022 as we add new partners and expand to additional countries. SMB opportunities outside of the U.S. are tremendous. And in the fourth quarter, our international SMB revenue growth rate was 18%. As we expand DAP, grow with SMBs across Europe and introduce new partnerships, we expect to gain overall SMB revenue share faster than the market growth. Healthcare is another market we are focused on. And in 2021, our healthcare portfolio reached more than $8 billion in revenue. Here, we serve complex customers with our global footprint of healthcare facilities and cold chain solutions. Our healthcare expertise and end-to-end solutions are unmatched in the industry, and we are well on our way to hitting our $10 billion revenue target for 2023. And amid the bottlenecks and uncertainty, our Supply Chain Solutions group is providing customer supply chain flexibility and resiliency through alternative routings and solutions. Demand for forwarding products continued to be strong in the fourth quarter. In fact, ocean shipments were up double digits and container rates remain elevated in the market. Now from an experience perspective, Customer First is about providing a frictionless end-to-end customer experience. We are attacking the biggest pain points first and over the last several months have rolled out improvements to the digital experience in pickup, claims at ups.com. You may not know this, but we generate over $9 billion in gross revenue annually from transactions on our global website. We redesigned the U.S. site in 2021 and saw site visits grow one hundredfold with an equally impressive growth in monthly page views, up from 10,000 in January to 600,000 in December. We've got more plans to improve the ups.com experience around the world, which should lead to higher revenue and better customer satisfaction. We know it will take time to move the needle on our net promoter score, which stands at 30, but we set a target of 50 and have laid out a path to get there. Moving to the second element of our strategy, people-led; here we focus on the employee experience and making UPS a great place to work. We measure our performance by how likely an employee is to recommend others to work at UPS. When I became CEO in 2020, our likelihood to recommend metrics stood at 51% globally and our goal is to surpass 80%. We've made great strides, gaining 10 percentage points to finish 2021 at 61%. And now to the last leg of our strategic platform, innovation-driven is at the heart of what we do.  Our global smart logistics network powered by technology developed by UPS engineers enabled us to deliver another successful peak. It may have been our hardest peak ever. We had higher volume than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter and lower volume at the end, but our sales, engineering and operating teams remained agile and pivoted with changes in global market conditions and the needs of our customers. We delivered excellent service levels, avoided chaos costs and improved efficiency in the network. In fact, productivity in our U.S. operations improved by 1.7% for the fourth quarter as measured by pieces per hour. Progress on the innovation-driven element of our strategy is all about driving higher returns on invested capital. As Brian will detail in 2021, we reversed a multi-year downward trend in this metric and delivered a return on invested capital of 30.8%, 910 basis points above 2020. We remain disciplined in our capital allocation priorities and commitments. In regard to capital expenditures, we are increasing our investments back into the business to drive innovation and growth. We just started the first phase of what we're calling smart package smart facility, which over time will put our FID tax on all of our packages. This initiative will enhance customer experience while improving UPS productivity by eliminating millions of manual scams every day. Brian will share more detail on our CapEx plans during his remarks. In June, we told you we were going to target a dividend payout ratio at year end of 50% of adjusted earnings per share. And we're doing just that. Today, the UPS Board approved a 49% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.02 per share to $1.52 per share. This represents the largest quarterly dividend increase in our company's history. Our strategy is building a solid foundation for our business and enabling agility. While we expect 2022 to be another challenging year, we've got momentum. So let me end by sharing our 2022 financial goals. Building on the record results we delivered last year, we anticipate delivering our 2023 consolidated revenue and operating margin targets one year ahead of our plan. In 2022, consolidated revenues are expected to be about $102 billion. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7% and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%. Brian will provide more details on our outlook. I'm excited about the many opportunities in front of us. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Maybe just a little more color on the productivity initiatives. Nando is doing – and team are doing a great job there. He's identified 10 key productivity initiatives in 2022, running anywhere from improving cube utilization, and we've already seen some good movement there, but we've got more to do, to basically making sure that we are adhering to our operating standards across the network. Further, we've got more non-ops cost reductions, don't we, and that's all part of our productivity initiatives. So, we feel very good about our ability to leverage expenses as we move into 2022. Sure. Well, I'm super excited about the productivity opportunities we have inside of our business. We're pretty good at what we do, but we can be even better. I think at the third quarter earnings call, we talked a lot about inside operations and how we're going about automating our inside operations. We have about 140,000 people inside of our operations. And through automatic bagging, automatic label application, robotic induction into the small sorts, there is a way to really drive productivity inside of the buildings. We also have an opportunity with the RFID project that we've just kicked off, smart package, smart facility. You can imagine our pre-loaders are manually scanning every package. That's 20 million-plus packages a day that are being manually scanned. That manual scan will disappear with the smart package, smart facilities. So, the opportunities are endless in many ways. To your question about where will the U.S. margin go? We have told you our goal is 12%. Let us get there. We'll ring the bell and then we'll reset it. As it relates to Amazon, as we talked to you at the end of the third quarter, Amazon's revenue surged with us during 2020 as a result of the pandemic. At the third quarter, their revenue as a percent of our total is trending more like what we experienced in 2019. And that's held true for the entire year. Amazon's revenue as a percent of our total for the year was 11.7% compared to 11.6% in 2019. Well, we're thrilled with our International business, and it's been challenging there because of COVID and they've done a masterful job of working through that. And the profitability is, as you point out, Allison, above where we thought we would be when we put together our three-year target. So, as we look to 2022, we anticipate that the ADV will actually grow faster than the revenue because of geo and mix changes. The team is really leaning into transborder Europe, excited about what we can do there. We do that, as you know, in an asset-light fashion, which is very value nutritive for our company. We're also liking the business – the opportunity to grow our Asian flights. And as you know, we added to new large freighters to help grow that space. Brian, anything you want to add? And I was remiss in not mentioning DAP. We've had such success with the DAP here in the United States, and we're taking our DAP platform outside the United States, which will be a driver of growth. And the small package market is expected to grow about 5% in 2022. There is additional capacity being added, but not enough that's going to create surplus. So, the environment supports the firm pricing as we look to 2022. And Brian, I feel terrible. We didn't answer Ben's [ph] questions about peak expectations. We just talked about pricing. So maybe we should talk a little bit about peak because I don't want to lose the opportunity to just give a shout-out to the team for operating in such a really interesting environment, where our volume was higher at the beginning of the quarter than we expected and lower at the end. Our team showed incredible agility to adjust to the market demands. And that's what you should expect going forward, incredible agility. We have built technology that's surpassed in the industry that allows us to react day by day to what we're seeing in the marketplace. We also have a different attitude, I think. So, we're not going to just keep vehicles and planes and people in place, hoping that the volume will come. We're going to react to the market and that really drove productivity. The other aspect of peak this year as we look forward that may not materialize next year, we don't think it will, is the slowdown in December retail sales. That was a function of Omicron and the low inventory to sales ratio and so many other factors. We would expect peak next year from a revenue mix to be more like what we've seen in the past, which is more enterprise business. So hopefully, those two dynamics are helpful as you think about peak of 2022. Go ahead. And there are just a couple of nuances in the quarter when you look at the year-over-year performance. Remember last year, we had an impairment because of freight. So that was on the different line that was on the other expense line. But up on the comp and benefit line. freight had a $245 million impact year-on-year, didn't it? So, you've got to back the freight noise out to understand the real performance and comp and benefits. And in terms of current trends, the first week of January, I'm like, where are the customers? Everybody seemed to be net home because of Omicron, but the business has come back roaring. So, we're feeling really good about the guidance that we've just given. And as we think about the future, we really, over the past 18 months, have really worked to optimize our network and feeling good about that. That gives us the confidence in our ability to grow into the future and add capacity that will be nutritive to the return on capital and to the bottom line. But as Brian said, for our plans for 2022, we are well set to handle the volume that will come our way. So, if we think about longer-term margin, I'd really like to get to that 12% number before we talk about longer-term margin. A year ago, we said on this call and we said we would have a double-digit operating margin in the U.S. and the action was, I don't think you are going to do that. Well, we showed that we could. Let us get to the 12% number, and then we'll come back and tell you where we think we're going to take the company. On the Amazon percentage of total revenue, it's totally a function of where the growth comes from. We have a great relationship with Amazon, and we have mutually agreed about the volume that we should take and the volume that they should keep that works best for both companies. And so, as we continue to lean into SMBs, and healthcare and B2B, you're going to see shifting of penetration, and we'll report that out to you as the time goes by. So, I will just tell you that their revenue grew with us in 2021. Thank you. I would say it's the floor. The authorization that's remaining is $4.5 billion. Well, we've been public on our holiday return estimate, $60 million packages and we're well on our way of meeting that number. Broadly speaking, we've got a really great return process for our largest customer, where recipients of packages from that customer can take them to a UPS store and we'll ship them back. It's a great experience. And as you know, we have over 5,000 UPS store locations. Think about the UPS store as just an extension of our network. I'm very excited about what we might be able to do with that asset. It's working for us really well now, but we can do even more with that asset. Well, this is part of our core values and has been part of our core values for a long, long time and we look at – for example, our automotive equipment is a rolling laboratory. We have 13,000 vehicles today that are powered by some sort of an alternative fuel, and we are continuing to invest in that as you heard from Brian. We've set forth measurable goals and milestones along the way to our goal of being carbon neutral by 2050 and some of the investments that we're making today are enabling that. The aircraft, for example that we are buying from Boeing are more energy-efficient. The automobiles that we're buying are more energy efficient and of course, we're moving to all-renewable energy to power our buildings. So, you can get all of these details in our ESG report, and we're committed to reaching that carbon-neutral goal by 2050. As it relates to customer needs, wants and desires it's starting to actually increase particularly outside of the United States. So, this isn't just good for the planet, it's good for business. Thank you. Yes. It's a very fair question. If you don't know where you're going on any road, we'll get you there. So, we appreciate the need to give longer-term guidance. Let us get to our targets, and then we will come back and talk to you. Oh, there's no finish line. We're just getting started in so many ways. When I think about our approach to enterprise data, I'm so excited about it. Today, we have data held in a number of data pools that aren't particularly clean. We've just kicked off an enterprise data strategy initiative that's going to clean up all that data, put it into eight domains. All the consuming applications will go into the domains. We'll have one version of the truth. That's going to drive productivity like we've never seen in this company. That's just one example of things that we got underway. So, there's just no finish line. Would you agree, Brian? Go ahead, Jairam. So don't – we might have confused the messaging because we had some 2023 numbers and some 2022 numbers. The guide we gave was for 2022 and it may not look as aggressive as you might think. But remember there's freight sales that we are comping in 2021 that will not materialize in 2022 and that's about $1 billion of revenue. So, there's plenty of growth for us to go get plenty. Yes. For the full year, it was in the low-60s, wasn't it? It was 61/39. When I came to the company, the previous year it was more like 50/50. There's been a step change in the mix. I think it's going to stay around this 61/39 period, don't you? Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Kelly Johnson, and I will be your facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations 3rd Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nScott Childress: Good morning and welcome to the UPS Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO, and Brian Newman, our CFO. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2020 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs, and other reports we file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  These reports when filed are available on the UPS investor relations website and from the SEC. For the third quarter of 2021, GAAP results included after-tax transformation and other charges of $54 million or $0.06 per diluted share. Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude transformation and other charges. The webcast of today's call, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, is available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference.  If you wish to ask a question, press 1 and then 0 on your phone to enter the queue. Please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now I will turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking all UPSers for continuing to deliver great service to our customers. In the 17 months that I've been CEO, I've learned that no matter what comes our way, UPSers deliver. The third quarter brought several extreme weather events, including the widespread effects of Hurricane Ida in the U.S. But through it all UPSers leveraged the flexibility of our integrated network and a technology that powers it to deliver what matters. A little over one year ago, we laid out our better, not bigger framework, under a Customer First, People Lead, Innovation Driven strategy.  Inside that strategic framework is a focus on three main areas. First is to improve revenue quality, including growing SMB volume. Second is to reduce our cost to serve through productivity and cost take-out initiatives. And third is to effectively allocate capital to create a better customer experience, happier UPSers, and higher returns on the capital we deploy. While it is early in the execution of our strategy, the progress we are making is clearly visible in our results. Looking at the third quarter, our performance was better than we anticipated. Consolidated revenue rose 9.2% from last year to $23.2 billion driven by another quarter of improved revenue quality across all three of our operating segments.  Consolidated operating profit grew 23.4% to $3 billion driven by solid revenue growth and strong expense control. Each of our segments delivered year - over - operating profit improvement, and double-digit operating margins. And for the first 9 months of 2021, UPS has generated more operating profit than any full year in our history. Brian will share the details of our performance shortly. As we've discussed, we are laser-focused on adding capabilities that enable UPS to grow with SMB. These improvements also benefit large customers that value our end-to-end network. Expanded weekend delivery services is one of our new capabilities. This initiative will be completed in the U.S. as planned by the end of this week.  We will now cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturday for both residential and commercial, pickups and deliveries. In addition, expanded Saturday services provides more capacity for Sunday SurePost delivery. The best part of our weekend delivery program is that we've unlocked additional network capacity that benefits all customers without deploying additional capital. And we've done this while expanding our U.S. operating margin on a year-over-year basis. As we look at our third quarter results, we see that SMB 's value the new capabilities we are providing. In the U.S., SMB average daily volume including platforms was up 10.9% year-over-year. In fact, we've seen strong growth here for the past 6 quarters. In the third quarter, SMB s made up 27.4% of our total U.S. volume, up 380 basis points from 1 year ago.  And outside the U.S., SMB average daily volume growth was 3.9%. We see many opportunities to grow our international SMB volume as we continue to improve our digital experiences and roll out DAP, our digital access program to customers outside of the U.S. Let me also touch on SMB s and healthcare. When COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out late last year, the world turned to UPS, and we were ready with connected capabilities, technology, and expertise. Our brand relevance here is attracting new SMB healthcare customers and significantly driving profit growth in the sector. And just on COVID-19 vaccines, we are on track to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of this year, with 99.9% on-time delivery.  Moving to productivity, we are relentlessly focused on reducing our cost to serve, and we're making good progress. While Brian will go through the details, I'll call out a few highlights. In the U.S., we drove a measurable improvement in productivity as PPH or pieces per hour increased by 2.5%. Additionally, as Nando described at our June Investor Day, through our ongoing efforts to optimize loads in our trailers, cube utilization in the third quarter was up 520 basis points versus last year.  This helped us eliminate more than 10% of daily trailer loads year-over-year. And as we've discussed previously, we are creating fewer but more impactful jobs. So to reduce turnover and improved productivity, we are converting around 1,000 part-time supervisor positions in our operations into nearly 400 full-time positions at no additional cost to our Company. Turning to what we referred to as Transformation 2.0 or plans to optimize our non-operating expense, we are on track to eliminate $500 million in non-operating costs this year with about $500 million of additional opportunity in 2022.  Finally, our third area of focus is disciplined capital allocation. Since we began executing our strategy, we've seen marked improvement in our employee satisfaction and competitive Net Promoter Scores due in part to how we've allocated capital to enhance the employee and customer experience. In October, we completed the acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform that also provides delivery services for packages that don't lend themselves to our small package network. We are delighted to welcome the Roadie team to UPS. We continue to be disciplined in our capital spending practices. This discipline, plus record earnings yield a significant amount of cash. So far this year, we've generated a record $9.3 billion in free cash flow.  And we expect full-year 2021 return on invested capital to be around 29%, which is a 730-basis point improvement from what we reported at the end of last year. Turning to the Fourth Quarter, the global supply chain market is challenging. There are capacity, congestion, and cost concerns. But for UPS, our outlook is positive. As once we get a package, we get it delivered. Outside of the U.S. where we peak, we are ready, and tight capacity benefits our freight forwarding business. In the U.S., we project a robust peak season. And through our planning efforts, we believe we are well on our way to deliver a peak that will be a win for UPS shippers, recipients, and shareowners. Let me share a few details.  To begin with, the calendar is helpful as we have 1 more of peak-operating day than last year. Further, we've expanded weekend delivery and added additional sorting capacity. Nonetheless, we expect consumer demand will outpace capacity in the market. We began collaborating with our largest customers several months ago and we'll stay in close contact with them during the holiday shopping season. Our technology allows us to match daily capacity with customer demand. And where we need to, we will again control the amount of volume that enters our network.  These actions will minimize chaos costs and enable high service levels. On the labor front, we've digitized and simplified our job application process, enabling qualified applicants to receive a job offer within 30 minutes of applying. In parts of the country, labor costs are higher than they were last year, but we are effectively managing through that cost pressure. When you add it up in the fourth quarter, we expect to generate record consolidated operating profit and expand operating margin year-over-year. While we are laser-focused on peak, our business doesn't end on December 31st. Later this week, we will release our U.S. general rate increase.  The 2022 increase will be 5.9%, reflecting the value of the services we offer and cost inflation pressures. The details will be posted to ups.com. As we move ahead, we will continue to execute by leveraging our global smart logistics network, our amazing UPSers and a strategy that's driving strong financial results today and positions us well for the future. Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman : Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover four areas, starting with the macro-overview, then our third quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and share owner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook for the full year. Let's start with the macro. In the third quarter, the global economy continued its strong growth despite the dampening effects of COVID-19 and inflation, along with shortages in inventory and labor. Within this backdrop, demand for our services remained high and the pricing environment in the industry was firm.  We expect similar dynamics in the fourth quarter. And as we demonstrated in the third, we will continue to execute our strategy and capture profitable growth opportunities in the market. IHS is forecasting fourth quarter global GDP will grow 3.8%, and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 4.9%, which remain above historic GDP growth rates. Moving to our third quarter consolidated performance. The progress we've made to improve revenue quality, enhance productivity, and allocate capital is driving strong top and bottom-line results. Consolidated revenue increased 9.2% to $23.2 billion.  Consolidated operating profit totaled $3 billion, 23.4% higher than last year. All 3 segments generated record third quarter operating profit and achieved double-digit operating margins in the quarter. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 12.8%, which was 150 basis points above last year. And diluted earnings per share was $2.71, up 18.9% from the same period last year. Now let's take a look at the segments. Our results in U.S. domestic were better than we anticipated. Principally, due to higher than planned for improvements in revenue per piece and productivity gains. As we expected, average daily volume in the U.S. was down 540,000 pieces or 2.7% due to a decline in SurePost of 576,000 packages per day.  This decline was partially offset by growth in ground commercial volume. Our results reflect the continued execution of our strategy to win in the most attractive parts of the market. In fact, customer mix continued to be positive as higher-yielding SMB average daily volume, including platforms was up 10.9%. And in the third quarter, SMB has made up 27.4% of U.S. domestic volume compared to 23.6% last year. Regarding our delivery mix, our commercial business continued to recover and grew 6.8%, representing 42% of our volume in the third quarter, compared to 39% in the third quarter of last year. Nearly all industry sectors grew B2B average daily volume, including retail and high tech.  For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.2 billion up 7.4% driven by a 12% increase in revenue per piece with fuel driving 270 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate. Turning to costs, total expense grew 5.8% with fuel driving 180 basis points of the year-over-year expense growth rate. Through our focus on productivity, overall improvements led by our inside sort operations and on-road activities helped offset the market rate adjustments we implemented in certain geographies, as well as the cost of expanding Saturday delivery. And as Carol mentioned, a key measure of UPS productivity is pieces per hour. And in the third quarter, we made improvements in nearly every area of our operations led by preload, which improved by 6.5%.  Combined, these improvements contributed to a decrease in direct labor hours per day of 5.1%. In summary, revenue growth was above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $1.4 billion in operating profit, an increase of $281 million or 24.8% compared to last year. And operating margin expanded 140 basis points. Moving to international, the segment continues to generate strong profit growth driven by the execution of our strategy. Due to tough year-over-year comparisons and some supply chain disruptions, growth in average daily volume moderated in the third quarter and was up 1.9%.  B2B average daily volume grew 3.8% on a year-over-year basis and offset a decline in B2C volume which was down 2.3%. On a two-year stack, total average daily volume was up 14%. Total export, average daily volume was up 1.3% on a year-over-year basis. Export growth in Europe and the Americas offset a 4.8% decrease in export average daily volume out of Asia. The decline in Asia was due to difficult comps from a year ago and the implementation of network contingency plans in response to COVID-19 protocols at select airports. Relative to our plan, we had 137 fewer flights out of Asia than we anticipated.  For the quarter, international revenue was up 15.5% to $4.7 billion with strong growth across all regions. Revenue per piece was up 14%, including a 500-basis point benefit from fuel. Revenue quality improved on a year-over-year basis as we continue to utilize surcharges to match demand with available capacity. In the third quarter, international delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of profits over $1 billion. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of 14%, and operating margin was 23.5%.  Now looking at supply chain solutions, the segment delivered record third quarter top and bottom-line results as the team executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment. Revenue increased 8.4% to $4.3 billion with all major business categories contributing to profit growth. Market demand remained elevated with a couple of key profit drivers. In forwarding, capacity constraints and consumer demand in the market drove volume growth in air freight forwarding and strong yields in our ocean freight product, which drove top and bottom-line results. And in logistics, revenue and operating profit grew by double digits led by our healthcare portfolio.  In the Third Quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated record operating profit of $448 million, and the operating margin was an impressive 10.5%. As a reminder, this is our first full quarter without UPS Freight results. given that we closed the sale on that business on April 30th of this year. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $285 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.3%, which was lower than last year due to favorable changes in jurisdictional tax rates and discrete items.  Now let's turn to cash in the balance sheet. We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and growth in net income. So far in 2021, we have generated a record $11.8 billion in cash flow operations and $9.3 billion in free cash flow. And in the first 9 months of this year, UPS has distributed $2.6 billion in dividends. In August, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase plan with the intent to repurchase $500 million of shares in 2021, which we completed in the third quarter. We expect to execute the remainder of the program over the next few years. Now I will make a few comments regarding the full-year outlook. We are continuing to pay close attention to and manage through several external factors, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures, and inventory and labor shortages.  Despite these challenges, consumer demand is expected to be strong during peak season and in the fourth quarter. Due to our third quarter out-performance combined with the progress we are making with our strategic initiatives and our increased fourth quarter plan, we are raising our full-year guidance. On a consolidated basis, we expect full year 2021 revenue growth of around 13.8% year-over-year, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight. Additionally, consolidated operating margins should be around 13%. In U.S. domestic, we anticipate full-year 2021 revenue growth of about 12.7% with revenue growing faster than volume.  We anticipate the full year 2021 U.S. operating margin will be around 10.5%. As you update your models for the U.S. domestic segment, there are a couple of things to keep in mind as we get into the fourth quarter. First, as usual, enterprise and B2C volume will represent a larger percentage of our total volume due to peak when compared to the rest of the year. And second, we are lapping more than $550 million in peak season surcharges in addition to the early customer pricing actions we implemented last year as a part of our revenue quality initiatives. As a result, we expect a sequential revenue per piece growth rate to moderate in the fourth quarter.  Moving to the international segment, we expect full-year revenue growth of around 20.7%, with an operating margin of about 23.9%. And in the Supply Chain Solution segment, we anticipate full-year revenue growth of around 10.3% and operating margin of about 10%. Additionally, for the full year in 2021, we expect free cash flow to be around $10.5 billion, and return on invested capital will be around 29%. Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $4.2 billion. And lastly, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be about 22.5%. As I wrap up, the economic outlook and the effects of our revenue quality, and productivity initiatives are putting us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 targets that I shared with you in June.  We are executing our strategy under the better, not bigger framework and delivering on our commitments, despite a very dynamic environment. We are laser-focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve, and remaining disciplined on capital allocation to improve the experience for our customers, and our people, and the financial performance of our Company. Thank you. An operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from the line of Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks and good morning. Congratulations on the good performance in a tough environment. Carol, I wanted to start with the increase in cost per piece in the U.S. domestic segments. It sounds like fuel was a component there. Also, it sounds like you're seeing some cost pressure. But can you talk a little bit about your ability to get out in front of or ahead of that and start to see cost per piece start to slow as we move into 2022 and kind of how you view that as a normalized or what a normalized rate for that should be going forward? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: Happy to. We were very pleased with the productivity that the team delivered in the third quarter with our cost per piece increasing at a lower rate than our revenue per piece. There were lots of goes ins and goes outs that Brian can share with you. But look, productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS, and I'm super proud of what Nano and the team are doing in terms of driving more pieces per hour and higher cube utilization. And actually, as we look into '22 driving automation in our facilities, as we've talked about, we have about 141,000 people inside of our buildings. And through automation, we'll be able to optimize that cost. But, Brian, maybe you want to give a little more detail on the third quarter cost per piece.\nBrian Newman : Happy to, Carol, and good morning, Todd. Look, our cost per piece in the U.S. was up about $0.95, and there were four big drivers. The union benefits and wages were up about $0.30. Our fastest ground ever weekend initiatives contributed 16. You're right, fuel did drive plus $0.20. It's about $0.19 of the total increase. And then we had some other items like the excise tax, lap, etc. But from a growth perspective, Todd, we saw about 10.4% CPP increase in the third quarter. You'd expect that to go down to mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter if we think about the trajectory.\nTodd Fowler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Can you give us an update on  and the  customer volumes you did in 3Q. And also regarding your largest customer, you shed some light on how that relationship is going. I think you said that you are working to agree with them for fourth quarter, but  also said that you expect that relationship will change over time. So if you can give us some color there, that would be great. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Sure. So if we think about the growth of enterprise customers versus the rest of the business, we declared and called out the growth that we saw in our SMB customers with an increasing penetration and SMB customers, that means the enterprise customers declined a bit as we expected. For a couple of reasons, one, we were up against tough year-over-year comparisons. Secondly, we're controlling the volume that comes into our network, because we are laser-focused on revenue quality. We used to think that every package was the same, we don't think that anymore. For some shippers, we're no longer delivering their packages and that's okay with us. Now, if we think about our largest customer, we've got a great relationship with our largest customer. And really, I'm pleased where that relationship stands. Last year volume with that customer surged as you would expect, because of the impact of COVID-19, and the shift in e-commerce demand. This year by look at the volume with our largest customer as a percent of total volume, for the first 9 months of this year, it's trending at where it was back in 2019. And we continue to support their customer as they continue to grow, but we're not their supply chain, we're just part of their supply chain.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi, please go ahead with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just taking a look at some of the implied Fourth Quarter guidance, particularly on the domestic side. So it seems like from a margin standpoint, we're looking at a fairly similar quarter than what we had in the Third Quarter, And from an operating profit perspective, maybe even a little bit more growth than we saw in the Third Quarter. So maybe you could give us a little bit of color. You mentioned some of the surcharges that you're lapping in the Fourth Quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing dynamic, and then ultimately, how you feel like you're managing through some of the cost inflation that's out there in the market and maybe give us an update on how you think about that hourly labor cost inflation, just because it looks like the profit, forecast is actually very good relative to what we've seen in, even here in the Third Quarter.\nBrian Newman : Chris, happy to -- I want to pick that up. The spread, which we so focused on between RPP and CPP in the third quarter was 12% RPP and 10.4% in CPP. We're looking to maintain that spread as we go into the fourth quarter, but your RPP would likely come down in the high single-digits and your CPP have come down into mid-single-digit. So as we think about it, you highlighted the lapping of the $550 million of surcharges from last year were also from a volume perspective, we grew SMB ADV last year in the fourth quarter by 28.5%. So there was some elements year-over-year-over-year. That's one of the reasons I called out on my prepared remarks, this sequential moderation on the pricing, but we have confidence that we can pull the cost per piece down. So in terms of the pricing environment, we expect it to be firm in the fourth quarter and feel good about the outlook.\nCarol Tome: And maybe we'll talk a little bit about the cost inflation question that you had. If you think about our employee base in the United States, we have about 458,000 UPSers in the United States. 75% of them are covered by some sort of a collective bargaining agreement. So we have a good idea of what the compensation is for those employees, and we manage through that. Now with turnovers, sometimes we do have to make market rate adjustments to attract people into our Company. We've been able to cover those market rate adjustments with productivity. So I feel really good about our ability to manage through the labor cost inflation that many companies are struggling with today.\nChris Wetherbee: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Good morning. Carol, on the SMB volumes, can you just talk about how your share with D3 and then D4 S&P volumes are trending versus a year ago, because I think that's the area where you guys have been under-penetrated. And then just following up on the last point you made. Can you talk about the priorities with respect to the union negotiations? Those are going to be here sooner than anybody realizes. But just wondering what your priorities are in those negotiations that will allow the Company to be more competitive and deliver on the long-term plan?\nCarol Tome: Yes. Happy to. So on the S&P question, we look at S&P through a series of segments. We used to call them by numbers. Now we actually have names attached for those segments. But happy to say that they're all growing. And that's what we want to see, is growth in all segments, from the medium-sized down to the micro-end platform side. So we're delighted with the growth in all of those categories. And as it relates to the union question, look, we want to win, win, win at the end of the day, and we're looking at this through the lens of a strategy rather than just a negotiation. In fact, we have a board meeting next week, and we're going to talk to them about how we're approaching this. It's different than we've done in the past and we'll keep you apprised as we go along. Brian, is there any other color you want to share on the SMB front?\nBrian Newman : No, Carol. We had good growth. It moderated, obviously, with some of the overlaps. I did call out though, in the fourth quarter last year, we posted 28.5% growth. So as we think about this fourth quarter, you might look for lower growth rates, but the mix has been holding steady at that 27%. So as we think back to last year, we were in the low 20s. We're well on our way up into the high 20s, and our goal by 23 is to get to that 30% as a mile marker.\nCarol Tome: And couldn't be more pleased with the progress we're making on the 16 customer journeys that we've shared with you because our SMBs are really responding to those journeys. And it's not just good for SMBs, it's good for all customers. We're just improving the overall experience.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Thanks, Operator, and good morning, guys. So Brian and Carol, I was hoping to talk a little bit about a longer-term issue around when did -- what level of domestic margins you want to see before you think about allocating a little bit more capital into the domestic business? I know you've been pretty clear that ADV in the next couple of years should be in that 2% to 3% range. But how do we think about the level of profitability you want to achieve in that domestic segment before you maybe think about allocating a little bit of capital and driving growth at a little faster rate on the volume front?\nBrian Newman : Dave, thanks for the question. So we've laid out the trajectory here and the domestic is to move that business up to 12% by '23. The full-year forecast now stands at 10 and 1/2. So we're well on our way to that journey. We are actually allocating capital -- growth capital to the domestic segment, but we're doing it in a very disciplined way. We're trying to create some more capacity in the network by sweating our assets, opening up weekend, etc. So there's a few variables at play here. I will come back to you on the next quarter call when we talk about the '22 guide and break down the capital for you.\nCarol Tome: And just on that point, I called out weekend delivery and how important that is for our customer experience. Last Saturday, we delivered 6 million packages. A year ago, that would've been basically nothing. And we did that without adding any incremental capital spending into network. We just opened up the network to add capacity. So we're going to make sure that this network is as optimized as it possibly can be before we start investing a lot of additional capacity then. But when it's as optimized as it possibly can be, then we'll add more capital.\nBrian Newman : And then we'll unpack for you the shifting capital domestically may go from the buildings to more technology. And we talked about the smart package initiatives. So as Carol mentioned, making the experience a better one for our customers. Those are the things we want to unlock and invest in.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thank you, guys, that's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning. Just want to focus on your comments around optimizing the existing labor for us. I guess first, you highlighted the benefit of the key utilization efforts and reducing the direct labor hours. When does that start to accelerate from here? And then second, just automation, obviously a longer tail to get benefits. But any other choke points that you're looking to address first, any color there? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: Well, we are all in on smart package and automation. And we've kicked off two big projects to attack those opportunities. Smart package alone by putting RFID tags on our packages are pre -loaders. The men and women who are loading our packaged cars for delivery will eliminate manual scans because they'll have a wearable device. That means they'll be eliminating 20 million manual scans a day. That alone drives productivity. And then when you think about the cool technology that we're going to introduce into our buildings, automated label application, automated bagging, robotic induction into the packaged cars, there's just a ton of opportunity here to drive automation in ways that we haven't done before. I'm really excited about that. Brian, what else do you want to add?\nBrian Newman : I think, from a cost perspective, Allison, we talked -- Carol talked about 75% of the workforce being under a contract, and that gives us some certainty of our largest cost expense going forward to plan that. Look, it is a dynamic environment though going into fourth quarter, and I talked last call about some of the MRAs, the market rate adjustments we're doing for the part-timers, we've increased that amount in our forecast, but that's embedded and captured already within the 10.5 margin I put out there. So I think we're -- we have a good line of sight to the future, and we're prepared for it.\nAllison Poliniak: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jairam Nathan of Daiwa. please go ahead with your question.\nJairam Nathan: Hi, thanks for taking my question. It is somewhat connected to the earlier question here. So I just want to understand, you talked about pieces per hour being a metric. What is the -- what kind of potential do you see? If you could also give us some perspective on where pieces per hour was about 2, 3 years back and how much of a further reduction you can see.\nCarol Tome: As we looked at our productivity results in the third quarter, you have to go back to 2016 to see that kind of productivity. So it's a dramatic improvement driven by just the great work of our operating team and our engineers. Once the potential, we're going to get better, quarter after quarter after quarter, and we'll report to you as we do that.\nJairam Nathan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nScott Group: Thanks. Good morning. I know it's a bit early, but Carol, maybe -- can you talk about the pricing outlook for next year and your ability to maintain inflation plus pricing again next year? Just along those lines, I think you guys have talked about 100 base points of U.S. margin improvement next year. Do you still feel good about that from the higher 2021 base now within the guidance?\nCarol Tome: Well, we're putting the finishing touches on our 2022 plan, and we'll tell you what we think about 2022 at the end of the fourth quarter. As it relates to the pricing environment, we mentioned in the call today that our general rate increase is 5.9%. We've also made some other adjustments in pricing, and then you can go on the website to see all of those. It includes the 1% increase in fuel that goes in in November of this year. So we priced our products for the services and value associated with those products.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. On international margins, higher than we expected in the third quarter, and it sounds like it's going to remain elevated in the fourth. Could you just talk about the sustainability? It looks like it's trending nicely above the 2023 guide. So just some thoughts on the puts and takes in the quarter and which -- what we should expect a little bit more color on the fourth quarter with regard to international volume in March. Thanks.\nBrian Newman : Yeah. Thanks, Scott. The -- you're right. We delivered a 24% margin internationally in the first half of the year, and we're looking to do the same in the second half of the year. So full-year will be right at that -- should be right at that number. We did experience some challenges in the quarter with some of the lanes out of Asia. But as we think about the tight supply chains, we don't expect to see the demand surcharges fall off anytime soon. So where we feel confident through most of '22 that those surcharges would remain and the Asia lane does matter the most. And we don't see belly capacity returning to pre -pandemic levels until '23. So hopefully, both of those things should maintain demand for both our international small package and for the supply chain business.\nScott Schneeberger: Okay, thanks.\nBrian Newman : Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Hi, morning. Just quick follow-up around pricing. Can you talk maybe of -- update us where you think you maybe in terms of the actual quarter re-pricing of contracts, especially on the enterprise business? And then the revenue per piece up 12% domestically, any sense how mix impacted that and -- specifically, of course, in the underlying profitability better with these SMBs, etc.? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: Do you want to unpack the RPP?\nBrian Newman : Sure happy to. Jordan so the -- in Third Quarter, a little over 1/2 came from rate this quarter and the balance and surcharges and mix. Where we are in the turning, we're in the low 40s in terms of contract renegotiation, in terms of that cycle.\nCarol Tome: And that's contract re-negotiations have gone very favorably half a day\nBrian Newman : We have indeed, yes.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. Good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about supply chain constraints into the ports and how you think about the net impact of this environment to the domestic segment specifically. Supply chain urgency tilts more to air cargo, but perhaps throughput from the ports is not as high as it could be. So how do you think about the net impact of this tightness and could we see an elongated peak? Thanks for taking the question.\nCarol Tome: Yeah, it's such an interesting , isn't it? We are hearing from surveys that consumer reserve quite panicked about this because supply chain jams are all over the news. And in fact, some things like a holiday shopping will be completed by Cyber Monday or 50% of holiday shopping will be completed by Cyber Monday. As a result, some of our customers are actually pulling forward promotions. And we saw that last week as an example, our volume was quite good, because of promotions that our retail customers were offering.  So I think everyone is trying to work through the supply chain demand to ensure a good holiday season. There's also a belief that there will be more gift cards sold this year than in prior years, which should suggest that packages will continue to be delivered post the holiday. That's kind of elongates the holiday shipping season in a way, as we think about what it means for us right now, others make your real for you for the ports in California. And a lot of discussion about the ports in Los Angeles and at Long Beach.  We have hubs very close to those ports. We received containers from those ports through a drop ship arrangement with a third-party. So when people say there's a supply shortage of truck drivers, it's true because this third-party is delivering those containers to our hubs. We have capacity of -- as an example, of one of our hub’s parks 70 containers today, we're only getting about 50 of those containers.  So it is slowing down, the flow of packages. Now, as soon as we get it, get it delivered. So our business is doing well, but in terms of the end-to-end supply chain, it's jammed upstream. So when the administration -- the Biden administration recently announced we're going to have efforts to operate these ports at 24/7, we said, that's great news because if you can pull the containers off the ships, and then get them dropship to us, we've got the capacity to take on those containers. So we're here ready and able to support anything that we can do to unlock some of that jam.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, good morning. Congrats on a solid quarter. Just looks like, Brian, the 12.7% domestic growth, pretty solid with the 10.5% margin, pretty solid outlook. Just wanted to see where you think you're seeing some acceleration or improvement to get that. And I guess, Carol, you mentioned the $500 million of productivity, not only this year, but next year. Maybe you can talk or walk us through what is leading that for next year. Is that same thing labor or are there shifts and where you're getting those cost cut?\nBrian Newman : So Ken, we obviously had a good top-line results in the third quarter and we expect to see spread continuing. We are pushing hard on the productivity lever. There's not often there's ops, we've talked to you about that non-op piece and that will repeat next year. So we'll get to a billion dollars over the two-year period and we feel confident in that. The productivity side is the thing that took a little longer to kick in. But the optimization right now, as we think about cube utilization, I think our track -- our trailers were down about 10% in terms of utilization, which is a great stat.  And I talked about direct labor hours being down 5 relatives to volume. So we're going to track those metrics very closely on the pieces per hour, the cube utilization and, and watch those as we go into next year. But we feel good about maintaining the margin spread from Q3 to Q4 in terms of the Delta thing, RPP and CPP. And as Carol mentioned, we'll come back in the Fourth Quarter, and talk about the trajectory of margin expansion for '22.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks Brian\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel, please go ahead with your questions.\nBruce Chan: Thank you, operator. And Good morning, everyone. Team, great results for the quarter here. Just a question on the international side, can you remind us what your approximate market share is on the European export? And when we think about the better not bigger strategy, does that apply in Europe as well? Got a competitor that's turning the corner on a major integration there next year, and just kind of wondering what your baseline expectations are for how that affects the competitive dynamics in that market.\nCarol Tome: Well, our market share in export is low. We're taking share on the ground in Europe. And I couldn't be prouder of what the team is doing outside the United States to grow this business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So just a quick point of clarification, but it sounds like your largest customer volumes are trending in line with your enterprise customers. I think that's what I heard. But then I guess the bigger issue for me, Carol or Brian, how do you guys leverage this -- your technology package? What is innovative about working with UPS for a small, medium-sized business or shipper that would be differentiated from someone that's running a much larger business?\nCarol Tome: It's the end-to-end network, it's not just the technology solution. It's what we offer from an end-to-end perspective. On the technology side, we are laser-focused on making sure every experience is best in class. So we've talked to you in the past about our billing system. When you compared our billing system against every other player out there, we were not best in class. We were worst in class. So we've just introduced a new billing system, and all of the attributes and applications associated with that billing system are now best-in-class. So we're -- in many ways, we're fortunate that we hadn't invested so much in the past, because now we can leap frog everybody else with new.  And with those 16 customers earnings that were well down the road, that creates a sticky experience with those customers. We've created APIs that are unique to them, so their systems can link in with us. It's really important when you think about our digital access platform and how we connect to those platforms like Shopify and Stamps and eBay and all the other platforms that we interact with. In fact, our DAP business, well, it'll be way over a billion-dollar business this year and growing. Brian, anything you want to add?\nBrian Newman : I just highlight 3 things from a technology standpoint. We're thinking about what's important to customer. You got claims, you've got lost packages, you've got pricing. On the claims front, we're speeding up the claims process and simplifying that using some technology. On the loss package, which is really important, Carol talked about the RFID, the investment there to drive tracking of packages. And then on the pricing front, we're piloting right now, dynamic pricing, which will make it more effective and optimize the pricing in the areas. So those are just three ways that we're employing technology to make the customer experience more effective.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Excuse me, UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. Tom Wadewitz at UBS. I know you've talked a fair bit about labor and inflation. I am going to ask you a little bit more about it. Brian, you said the market rate adjustment is above 100 million, but you didn't quantify that. Would you care to tell us what that is? Is it 150, is it 200, maybe just to ballpark it. And then just wanted to get a broader thought on labor impacts from an availability perspective. I don't know maybe how much visibility you have with 100,000 seasonal workers in peak. And just whether you think that labor market stabilized or is that something we ought to think about further pressure as we go into 22? Thank you.\nBrian Newman : Tom, good to hear you and you're still UBS. I like that. So the increase in the MRA s, I talked last call, we were spending about 80 to 100 in terms of the market rate adjustments to remain competitive in certain geographies. We've had in our forecast, that was for the second half of the year, we've got to increase that range, move the 80 to 100, up to 100 to 130. So it's bumped up marginally. But I will say, all of that increase is embedded within the 10.5% full-year domestic margin outlook.\nCarol Tome: And then on the labor front, maybe I'll give you some color. Is really interesting when you look at the labor dynamics, there are 5 million fewer jobs in the United States today than there were pre -pandemic. And yet they're only 4 million, so a lot . So there's not excess demand. The problem is that everybody is rushing to fill up the jobs. And so that's why you see so much pressure out there because as the economy has opened up, everyone's rushing to fill the jobs. Now, in some ways we got ahead of it because if you think about last year when our volume surged, we hired 40,000 people in the second quarter. So we got ahead of some of the challenges by hiring last year.  Now, we are heading into peak where we do hire 100,000 seasonal workers. We are pretty good at this. We've done this for the past several years. The environment is different than it's ever been for sure. But we're all hands-on deck. We have hundreds of recruiters that are working for us. These are UPSers as well as partners that we work with outside of the . We have simplified the hiring process. So now within 30 minutes, you can get an offer. Before, you had to go through a gaming exercise before you're going to get an offer. And trust me, I play those games that I didn't do well.  like clutch whatever the game.  So we've simplified the  to come onboard, and look, it's -- we're not -- it's not over till it's over. But we're making progress here. I'll just give you one data point. Last week alone, we hired over 13,000 people. We've been at this for a while and we'll stay at it until we get the number of people, we need to deliver a great peak for our customers.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Thanks for taking my question. Carol, I wanted your perspective on the regional last-mile competition, can you give us some thoughts on where they fit in the competitive landscape today and does that change as LaserShip expands acquisitively under the leadership of a credible CEO from your former Company? And just as an extension of that, just any thoughts on how you focus on improving your revenue quality while being cautious not to shed enough or in share to help create a new nationwide low-cost competitor. Thanks.\nCarol Tome: Yeah. We've talked about the small package market in the United States is very attractive. There's a demand-supply imbalance and everybody wants a piece of the pie. And so these regional players certainly want a piece of the pie. If you look at the LaserShip announced the acquisition, that combined Company, which by the way, is by coastal, so they don't have an end-to-end regional network yet. They just buy coastal fans less than 2% of the volume space. And they're delivering actually for our largest customer, by the way.  That was because our largest customer has that lots of players delivering their boxes. So as we -- as I think about it, game on, right, it's competitive environment and what we have to do is we've got to invest in the customer experience. So that we've got an experience where people want to come to us and pay for the experience that we offer. And just on the leader that's joining that Company, I have great amount of respect from our colleague , I worked with him for 16 years, is an awesome leader. But I love to compete. Mark a little note. Welcome to -- it's the industry and that we're going to have fun together competing. So more to come.\nScott Childress: Operator, we've got time for one more call or one more question if you would please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the long term. We talked about moving further upstream of coordination with the retailers and others throughout the supply chain, but that's often been hard to actually execute in the past. Do you think with the amount of disruption in demand that we're seeing that this might actually be a good time to have this conversation? Maybe you can elaborate on how those are trending as you look to more synchronized deliveries, which I can imagine might be challenging to get into place, but would actually benefit everybody from a capacity utilization standpoint. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yeah. We don't have a lot of time to talk about this, this morning, but we do have some pilots underway with a third-party platform to see if we can move upstream to consolidate orders into a basket for multiple shippers and ship it on one packaged car. It's early days the pilots just kicked off. But we'll have more color for you. I think at the end of the Fourth Quarter.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right. Thank you, Carol,\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the floor back to your host, Mr. Scott Childress.\nScott Childress: Well, we want to thank everyone for joining us today, and that concludes our call. And we hope everyone has a fantastic day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover four areas, starting with the macro-overview, then our third quarter results. Next, I'll review cash and share owner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook for the full year. Let's start with the macro. In the third quarter, the global economy continued its strong growth despite the dampening effects of COVID-19 and inflation, along with shortages in inventory and labor. Within this backdrop, demand for our services remained high and the pricing environment in the industry was firm.  We expect similar dynamics in the fourth quarter. And as we demonstrated in the third, we will continue to execute our strategy and capture profitable growth opportunities in the market. IHS is forecasting fourth quarter global GDP will grow 3.8%, and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 4.9%, which remain above historic GDP growth rates. Moving to our third quarter consolidated performance. The progress we've made to improve revenue quality, enhance productivity, and allocate capital is driving strong top and bottom-line results. Consolidated revenue increased 9.2% to $23.2 billion.  Consolidated operating profit totaled $3 billion, 23.4% higher than last year. All 3 segments generated record third quarter operating profit and achieved double-digit operating margins in the quarter. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 12.8%, which was 150 basis points above last year. And diluted earnings per share was $2.71, up 18.9% from the same period last year. Now let's take a look at the segments. Our results in U.S. domestic were better than we anticipated. Principally, due to higher than planned for improvements in revenue per piece and productivity gains. As we expected, average daily volume in the U.S. was down 540,000 pieces or 2.7% due to a decline in SurePost of 576,000 packages per day.  This decline was partially offset by growth in ground commercial volume. Our results reflect the continued execution of our strategy to win in the most attractive parts of the market. In fact, customer mix continued to be positive as higher-yielding SMB average daily volume, including platforms was up 10.9%. And in the third quarter, SMB has made up 27.4% of U.S. domestic volume compared to 23.6% last year. Regarding our delivery mix, our commercial business continued to recover and grew 6.8%, representing 42% of our volume in the third quarter, compared to 39% in the third quarter of last year. Nearly all industry sectors grew B2B average daily volume, including retail and high tech.  For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.2 billion up 7.4% driven by a 12% increase in revenue per piece with fuel driving 270 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate. Turning to costs, total expense grew 5.8% with fuel driving 180 basis points of the year-over-year expense growth rate. Through our focus on productivity, overall improvements led by our inside sort operations and on-road activities helped offset the market rate adjustments we implemented in certain geographies, as well as the cost of expanding Saturday delivery. And as Carol mentioned, a key measure of UPS productivity is pieces per hour. And in the third quarter, we made improvements in nearly every area of our operations led by preload, which improved by 6.5%.  Combined, these improvements contributed to a decrease in direct labor hours per day of 5.1%. In summary, revenue growth was above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $1.4 billion in operating profit, an increase of $281 million or 24.8% compared to last year. And operating margin expanded 140 basis points. Moving to international, the segment continues to generate strong profit growth driven by the execution of our strategy. Due to tough year-over-year comparisons and some supply chain disruptions, growth in average daily volume moderated in the third quarter and was up 1.9%.  B2B average daily volume grew 3.8% on a year-over-year basis and offset a decline in B2C volume which was down 2.3%. On a two-year stack, total average daily volume was up 14%. Total export, average daily volume was up 1.3% on a year-over-year basis. Export growth in Europe and the Americas offset a 4.8% decrease in export average daily volume out of Asia. The decline in Asia was due to difficult comps from a year ago and the implementation of network contingency plans in response to COVID-19 protocols at select airports. Relative to our plan, we had 137 fewer flights out of Asia than we anticipated.  For the quarter, international revenue was up 15.5% to $4.7 billion with strong growth across all regions. Revenue per piece was up 14%, including a 500-basis point benefit from fuel. Revenue quality improved on a year-over-year basis as we continue to utilize surcharges to match demand with available capacity. In the third quarter, international delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of profits over $1 billion. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of 14%, and operating margin was 23.5%.  Now looking at supply chain solutions, the segment delivered record third quarter top and bottom-line results as the team executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment. Revenue increased 8.4% to $4.3 billion with all major business categories contributing to profit growth. Market demand remained elevated with a couple of key profit drivers. In forwarding, capacity constraints and consumer demand in the market drove volume growth in air freight forwarding and strong yields in our ocean freight product, which drove top and bottom-line results. And in logistics, revenue and operating profit grew by double digits led by our healthcare portfolio.  In the Third Quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated record operating profit of $448 million, and the operating margin was an impressive 10.5%. As a reminder, this is our first full quarter without UPS Freight results. given that we closed the sale on that business on April 30th of this year. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $285 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.3%, which was lower than last year due to favorable changes in jurisdictional tax rates and discrete items.  Now let's turn to cash in the balance sheet. We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and growth in net income. So far in 2021, we have generated a record $11.8 billion in cash flow operations and $9.3 billion in free cash flow. And in the first 9 months of this year, UPS has distributed $2.6 billion in dividends. In August, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase plan with the intent to repurchase $500 million of shares in 2021, which we completed in the third quarter. We expect to execute the remainder of the program over the next few years. Now I will make a few comments regarding the full-year outlook. We are continuing to pay close attention to and manage through several external factors, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures, and inventory and labor shortages.  Despite these challenges, consumer demand is expected to be strong during peak season and in the fourth quarter. Due to our third quarter out-performance combined with the progress we are making with our strategic initiatives and our increased fourth quarter plan, we are raising our full-year guidance. On a consolidated basis, we expect full year 2021 revenue growth of around 13.8% year-over-year, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight. Additionally, consolidated operating margins should be around 13%. In U.S. domestic, we anticipate full-year 2021 revenue growth of about 12.7% with revenue growing faster than volume.  We anticipate the full year 2021 U.S. operating margin will be around 10.5%. As you update your models for the U.S. domestic segment, there are a couple of things to keep in mind as we get into the fourth quarter. First, as usual, enterprise and B2C volume will represent a larger percentage of our total volume due to peak when compared to the rest of the year. And second, we are lapping more than $550 million in peak season surcharges in addition to the early customer pricing actions we implemented last year as a part of our revenue quality initiatives. As a result, we expect a sequential revenue per piece growth rate to moderate in the fourth quarter.  Moving to the international segment, we expect full-year revenue growth of around 20.7%, with an operating margin of about 23.9%. And in the Supply Chain Solution segment, we anticipate full-year revenue growth of around 10.3% and operating margin of about 10%. Additionally, for the full year in 2021, we expect free cash flow to be around $10.5 billion, and return on invested capital will be around 29%. Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $4.2 billion. And lastly, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be about 22.5%. As I wrap up, the economic outlook and the effects of our revenue quality, and productivity initiatives are putting us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 targets that I shared with you in June.  We are executing our strategy under the better, not bigger framework and delivering on our commitments, despite a very dynamic environment. We are laser-focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve, and remaining disciplined on capital allocation to improve the experience for our customers, and our people, and the financial performance of our Company. Thank you. An operator, please open the lines. Happy to, Carol, and good morning, Todd. Look, our cost per piece in the U.S. was up about $0.95, and there were four big drivers. The union benefits and wages were up about $0.30. Our fastest ground ever weekend initiatives contributed 16. You're right, fuel did drive plus $0.20. It's about $0.19 of the total increase. And then we had some other items like the excise tax, lap, etc. But from a growth perspective, Todd, we saw about 10.4% CPP increase in the third quarter. You'd expect that to go down to mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter if we think about the trajectory. Chris, happy to -- I want to pick that up. The spread, which we so focused on between RPP and CPP in the third quarter was 12% RPP and 10.4% in CPP. We're looking to maintain that spread as we go into the fourth quarter, but your RPP would likely come down in the high single-digits and your CPP have come down into mid-single-digit. So as we think about it, you highlighted the lapping of the $550 million of surcharges from last year were also from a volume perspective, we grew SMB ADV last year in the fourth quarter by 28.5%. So there was some elements year-over-year-over-year. That's one of the reasons I called out on my prepared remarks, this sequential moderation on the pricing, but we have confidence that we can pull the cost per piece down. So in terms of the pricing environment, we expect it to be firm in the fourth quarter and feel good about the outlook. No, Carol. We had good growth. It moderated, obviously, with some of the overlaps. I did call out though, in the fourth quarter last year, we posted 28.5% growth. So as we think about this fourth quarter, you might look for lower growth rates, but the mix has been holding steady at that 27%. So as we think back to last year, we were in the low 20s. We're well on our way up into the high 20s, and our goal by 23 is to get to that 30% as a mile marker. Dave, thanks for the question. So we've laid out the trajectory here and the domestic is to move that business up to 12% by '23. The full-year forecast now stands at 10 and 1/2. So we're well on our way to that journey. We are actually allocating capital -- growth capital to the domestic segment, but we're doing it in a very disciplined way. We're trying to create some more capacity in the network by sweating our assets, opening up weekend, etc. So there's a few variables at play here. I will come back to you on the next quarter call when we talk about the '22 guide and break down the capital for you. And then we'll unpack for you the shifting capital domestically may go from the buildings to more technology. And we talked about the smart package initiatives. So as Carol mentioned, making the experience a better one for our customers. Those are the things we want to unlock and invest in. I think, from a cost perspective, Allison, we talked -- Carol talked about 75% of the workforce being under a contract, and that gives us some certainty of our largest cost expense going forward to plan that. Look, it is a dynamic environment though going into fourth quarter, and I talked last call about some of the MRAs, the market rate adjustments we're doing for the part-timers, we've increased that amount in our forecast, but that's embedded and captured already within the 10.5 margin I put out there. So I think we're -- we have a good line of sight to the future, and we're prepared for it. Yeah. Thanks, Scott. The -- you're right. We delivered a 24% margin internationally in the first half of the year, and we're looking to do the same in the second half of the year. So full-year will be right at that -- should be right at that number. We did experience some challenges in the quarter with some of the lanes out of Asia. But as we think about the tight supply chains, we don't expect to see the demand surcharges fall off anytime soon. So where we feel confident through most of '22 that those surcharges would remain and the Asia lane does matter the most. And we don't see belly capacity returning to pre -pandemic levels until '23. So hopefully, both of those things should maintain demand for both our international small package and for the supply chain business. Thanks. Sure happy to. Jordan so the -- in Third Quarter, a little over 1/2 came from rate this quarter and the balance and surcharges and mix. Where we are in the turning, we're in the low 40s in terms of contract renegotiation, in terms of that cycle. We have indeed, yes. So Ken, we obviously had a good top-line results in the third quarter and we expect to see spread continuing. We are pushing hard on the productivity lever. There's not often there's ops, we've talked to you about that non-op piece and that will repeat next year. So we'll get to a billion dollars over the two-year period and we feel confident in that. The productivity side is the thing that took a little longer to kick in. But the optimization right now, as we think about cube utilization, I think our track -- our trailers were down about 10% in terms of utilization, which is a great stat.  And I talked about direct labor hours being down 5 relatives to volume. So we're going to track those metrics very closely on the pieces per hour, the cube utilization and, and watch those as we go into next year. But we feel good about maintaining the margin spread from Q3 to Q4 in terms of the Delta thing, RPP and CPP. And as Carol mentioned, we'll come back in the Fourth Quarter, and talk about the trajectory of margin expansion for '22. I just highlight 3 things from a technology standpoint. We're thinking about what's important to customer. You got claims, you've got lost packages, you've got pricing. On the claims front, we're speeding up the claims process and simplifying that using some technology. On the loss package, which is really important, Carol talked about the RFID, the investment there to drive tracking of packages. And then on the pricing front, we're piloting right now, dynamic pricing, which will make it more effective and optimize the pricing in the areas. So those are just three ways that we're employing technology to make the customer experience more effective. Tom, good to hear you and you're still UBS. I like that. So the increase in the MRA s, I talked last call, we were spending about 80 to 100 in terms of the market rate adjustments to remain competitive in certain geographies. We've had in our forecast, that was for the second half of the year, we've got to increase that range, move the 80 to 100, up to 100 to 130. So it's bumped up marginally. But I will say, all of that increase is embedded within the 10.5% full-year domestic margin outlook."

            "name": "Carol Tome",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking all UPSers for continuing to deliver great service to our customers. In the 17 months that I've been CEO, I've learned that no matter what comes our way, UPSers deliver. The third quarter brought several extreme weather events, including the widespread effects of Hurricane Ida in the U.S. But through it all UPSers leveraged the flexibility of our integrated network and a technology that powers it to deliver what matters. A little over one year ago, we laid out our better, not bigger framework, under a Customer First, People Lead, Innovation Driven strategy.  Inside that strategic framework is a focus on three main areas. First is to improve revenue quality, including growing SMB volume. Second is to reduce our cost to serve through productivity and cost take-out initiatives. And third is to effectively allocate capital to create a better customer experience, happier UPSers, and higher returns on the capital we deploy. While it is early in the execution of our strategy, the progress we are making is clearly visible in our results. Looking at the third quarter, our performance was better than we anticipated. Consolidated revenue rose 9.2% from last year to $23.2 billion driven by another quarter of improved revenue quality across all three of our operating segments.  Consolidated operating profit grew 23.4% to $3 billion driven by solid revenue growth and strong expense control. Each of our segments delivered year - over - operating profit improvement, and double-digit operating margins. And for the first 9 months of 2021, UPS has generated more operating profit than any full year in our history. Brian will share the details of our performance shortly. As we've discussed, we are laser-focused on adding capabilities that enable UPS to grow with SMB. These improvements also benefit large customers that value our end-to-end network. Expanded weekend delivery services is one of our new capabilities. This initiative will be completed in the U.S. as planned by the end of this week.  We will now cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturday for both residential and commercial, pickups and deliveries. In addition, expanded Saturday services provides more capacity for Sunday SurePost delivery. The best part of our weekend delivery program is that we've unlocked additional network capacity that benefits all customers without deploying additional capital. And we've done this while expanding our U.S. operating margin on a year-over-year basis. As we look at our third quarter results, we see that SMB 's value the new capabilities we are providing. In the U.S., SMB average daily volume including platforms was up 10.9% year-over-year. In fact, we've seen strong growth here for the past 6 quarters. In the third quarter, SMB s made up 27.4% of our total U.S. volume, up 380 basis points from 1 year ago.  And outside the U.S., SMB average daily volume growth was 3.9%. We see many opportunities to grow our international SMB volume as we continue to improve our digital experiences and roll out DAP, our digital access program to customers outside of the U.S. Let me also touch on SMB s and healthcare. When COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out late last year, the world turned to UPS, and we were ready with connected capabilities, technology, and expertise. Our brand relevance here is attracting new SMB healthcare customers and significantly driving profit growth in the sector. And just on COVID-19 vaccines, we are on track to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of this year, with 99.9% on-time delivery.  Moving to productivity, we are relentlessly focused on reducing our cost to serve, and we're making good progress. While Brian will go through the details, I'll call out a few highlights. In the U.S., we drove a measurable improvement in productivity as PPH or pieces per hour increased by 2.5%. Additionally, as Nando described at our June Investor Day, through our ongoing efforts to optimize loads in our trailers, cube utilization in the third quarter was up 520 basis points versus last year.  This helped us eliminate more than 10% of daily trailer loads year-over-year. And as we've discussed previously, we are creating fewer but more impactful jobs. So to reduce turnover and improved productivity, we are converting around 1,000 part-time supervisor positions in our operations into nearly 400 full-time positions at no additional cost to our Company. Turning to what we referred to as Transformation 2.0 or plans to optimize our non-operating expense, we are on track to eliminate $500 million in non-operating costs this year with about $500 million of additional opportunity in 2022.  Finally, our third area of focus is disciplined capital allocation. Since we began executing our strategy, we've seen marked improvement in our employee satisfaction and competitive Net Promoter Scores due in part to how we've allocated capital to enhance the employee and customer experience. In October, we completed the acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform that also provides delivery services for packages that don't lend themselves to our small package network. We are delighted to welcome the Roadie team to UPS. We continue to be disciplined in our capital spending practices. This discipline, plus record earnings yield a significant amount of cash. So far this year, we've generated a record $9.3 billion in free cash flow.  And we expect full-year 2021 return on invested capital to be around 29%, which is a 730-basis point improvement from what we reported at the end of last year. Turning to the Fourth Quarter, the global supply chain market is challenging. There are capacity, congestion, and cost concerns. But for UPS, our outlook is positive. As once we get a package, we get it delivered. Outside of the U.S. where we peak, we are ready, and tight capacity benefits our freight forwarding business. In the U.S., we project a robust peak season. And through our planning efforts, we believe we are well on our way to deliver a peak that will be a win for UPS shippers, recipients, and shareowners. Let me share a few details.  To begin with, the calendar is helpful as we have 1 more of peak-operating day than last year. Further, we've expanded weekend delivery and added additional sorting capacity. Nonetheless, we expect consumer demand will outpace capacity in the market. We began collaborating with our largest customers several months ago and we'll stay in close contact with them during the holiday shopping season. Our technology allows us to match daily capacity with customer demand. And where we need to, we will again control the amount of volume that enters our network.  These actions will minimize chaos costs and enable high service levels. On the labor front, we've digitized and simplified our job application process, enabling qualified applicants to receive a job offer within 30 minutes of applying. In parts of the country, labor costs are higher than they were last year, but we are effectively managing through that cost pressure. When you add it up in the fourth quarter, we expect to generate record consolidated operating profit and expand operating margin year-over-year. While we are laser-focused on peak, our business doesn't end on December 31st. Later this week, we will release our U.S. general rate increase.  The 2022 increase will be 5.9%, reflecting the value of the services we offer and cost inflation pressures. The details will be posted to ups.com. As we move ahead, we will continue to execute by leveraging our global smart logistics network, our amazing UPSers and a strategy that's driving strong financial results today and positions us well for the future. Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Brian. Happy to. We were very pleased with the productivity that the team delivered in the third quarter with our cost per piece increasing at a lower rate than our revenue per piece. There were lots of goes ins and goes outs that Brian can share with you. But look, productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS, and I'm super proud of what Nano and the team are doing in terms of driving more pieces per hour and higher cube utilization. And actually, as we look into '22 driving automation in our facilities, as we've talked about, we have about 141,000 people inside of our buildings. And through automation, we'll be able to optimize that cost. But, Brian, maybe you want to give a little more detail on the third quarter cost per piece. Sure. So if we think about the growth of enterprise customers versus the rest of the business, we declared and called out the growth that we saw in our SMB customers with an increasing penetration and SMB customers, that means the enterprise customers declined a bit as we expected. For a couple of reasons, one, we were up against tough year-over-year comparisons. Secondly, we're controlling the volume that comes into our network, because we are laser-focused on revenue quality. We used to think that every package was the same, we don't think that anymore. For some shippers, we're no longer delivering their packages and that's okay with us. Now, if we think about our largest customer, we've got a great relationship with our largest customer. And really, I'm pleased where that relationship stands. Last year volume with that customer surged as you would expect, because of the impact of COVID-19, and the shift in e-commerce demand. This year by look at the volume with our largest customer as a percent of total volume, for the first 9 months of this year, it's trending at where it was back in 2019. And we continue to support their customer as they continue to grow, but we're not their supply chain, we're just part of their supply chain. And maybe we'll talk a little bit about the cost inflation question that you had. If you think about our employee base in the United States, we have about 458,000 UPSers in the United States. 75% of them are covered by some sort of a collective bargaining agreement. So we have a good idea of what the compensation is for those employees, and we manage through that. Now with turnovers, sometimes we do have to make market rate adjustments to attract people into our Company. We've been able to cover those market rate adjustments with productivity. So I feel really good about our ability to manage through the labor cost inflation that many companies are struggling with today. Yes. Happy to. So on the S&P question, we look at S&P through a series of segments. We used to call them by numbers. Now we actually have names attached for those segments. But happy to say that they're all growing. And that's what we want to see, is growth in all segments, from the medium-sized down to the micro-end platform side. So we're delighted with the growth in all of those categories. And as it relates to the union question, look, we want to win, win, win at the end of the day, and we're looking at this through the lens of a strategy rather than just a negotiation. In fact, we have a board meeting next week, and we're going to talk to them about how we're approaching this. It's different than we've done in the past and we'll keep you apprised as we go along. Brian, is there any other color you want to share on the SMB front? And couldn't be more pleased with the progress we're making on the 16 customer journeys that we've shared with you because our SMBs are really responding to those journeys. And it's not just good for SMBs, it's good for all customers. We're just improving the overall experience. And just on that point, I called out weekend delivery and how important that is for our customer experience. Last Saturday, we delivered 6 million packages. A year ago, that would've been basically nothing. And we did that without adding any incremental capital spending into network. We just opened up the network to add capacity. So we're going to make sure that this network is as optimized as it possibly can be before we start investing a lot of additional capacity then. But when it's as optimized as it possibly can be, then we'll add more capital. Well, we are all in on smart package and automation. And we've kicked off two big projects to attack those opportunities. Smart package alone by putting RFID tags on our packages are pre -loaders. The men and women who are loading our packaged cars for delivery will eliminate manual scans because they'll have a wearable device. That means they'll be eliminating 20 million manual scans a day. That alone drives productivity. And then when you think about the cool technology that we're going to introduce into our buildings, automated label application, automated bagging, robotic induction into the packaged cars, there's just a ton of opportunity here to drive automation in ways that we haven't done before. I'm really excited about that. Brian, what else do you want to add? As we looked at our productivity results in the third quarter, you have to go back to 2016 to see that kind of productivity. So it's a dramatic improvement driven by just the great work of our operating team and our engineers. Once the potential, we're going to get better, quarter after quarter after quarter, and we'll report to you as we do that. Well, we're putting the finishing touches on our 2022 plan, and we'll tell you what we think about 2022 at the end of the fourth quarter. As it relates to the pricing environment, we mentioned in the call today that our general rate increase is 5.9%. We've also made some other adjustments in pricing, and then you can go on the website to see all of those. It includes the 1% increase in fuel that goes in in November of this year. So we priced our products for the services and value associated with those products. Do you want to unpack the RPP? And that's contract re-negotiations have gone very favorably half a day Yeah, it's such an interesting , isn't it? We are hearing from surveys that consumer reserve quite panicked about this because supply chain jams are all over the news. And in fact, some things like a holiday shopping will be completed by Cyber Monday or 50% of holiday shopping will be completed by Cyber Monday. As a result, some of our customers are actually pulling forward promotions. And we saw that last week as an example, our volume was quite good, because of promotions that our retail customers were offering.  So I think everyone is trying to work through the supply chain demand to ensure a good holiday season. There's also a belief that there will be more gift cards sold this year than in prior years, which should suggest that packages will continue to be delivered post the holiday. That's kind of elongates the holiday shipping season in a way, as we think about what it means for us right now, others make your real for you for the ports in California. And a lot of discussion about the ports in Los Angeles and at Long Beach.  We have hubs very close to those ports. We received containers from those ports through a drop ship arrangement with a third-party. So when people say there's a supply shortage of truck drivers, it's true because this third-party is delivering those containers to our hubs. We have capacity of -- as an example, of one of our hub's parks 70 containers today, we're only getting about 50 of those containers.  So it is slowing down, the flow of packages. Now, as soon as we get it, get it delivered. So our business is doing well, but in terms of the end-to-end supply chain, it's jammed upstream. So when the administration -- the Biden administration recently announced we're going to have efforts to operate these ports at 24/7, we said, that's great news because if you can pull the containers off the ships, and then get them dropship to us, we've got the capacity to take on those containers. So we're here ready and able to support anything that we can do to unlock some of that jam. Yes. Well, our market share in export is low. We're taking share on the ground in Europe. And I couldn't be prouder of what the team is doing outside the United States to grow this business. It's the end-to-end network, it's not just the technology solution. It's what we offer from an end-to-end perspective. On the technology side, we are laser-focused on making sure every experience is best in class. So we've talked to you in the past about our billing system. When you compared our billing system against every other player out there, we were not best in class. We were worst in class. So we've just introduced a new billing system, and all of the attributes and applications associated with that billing system are now best-in-class. So we're -- in many ways, we're fortunate that we hadn't invested so much in the past, because now we can leap frog everybody else with new.  And with those 16 customers earnings that were well down the road, that creates a sticky experience with those customers. We've created APIs that are unique to them, so their systems can link in with us. It's really important when you think about our digital access platform and how we connect to those platforms like Shopify and Stamps and eBay and all the other platforms that we interact with. In fact, our DAP business, well, it'll be way over a billion-dollar business this year and growing. Brian, anything you want to add? And then on the labor front, maybe I'll give you some color. Is really interesting when you look at the labor dynamics, there are 5 million fewer jobs in the United States today than there were pre -pandemic. And yet they're only 4 million, so a lot . So there's not excess demand. The problem is that everybody is rushing to fill up the jobs. And so that's why you see so much pressure out there because as the economy has opened up, everyone's rushing to fill the jobs. Now, in some ways we got ahead of it because if you think about last year when our volume surged, we hired 40,000 people in the second quarter. So we got ahead of some of the challenges by hiring last year.  Now, we are heading into peak where we do hire 100,000 seasonal workers. We are pretty good at this. We've done this for the past several years. The environment is different than it's ever been for sure. But we're all hands-on deck. We have hundreds of recruiters that are working for us. These are UPSers as well as partners that we work with outside of the . We have simplified the hiring process. So now within 30 minutes, you can get an offer. Before, you had to go through a gaming exercise before you're going to get an offer. And trust me, I play those games that I didn't do well.  like clutch whatever the game.  So we've simplified the  to come onboard, and look, it's -- we're not -- it's not over till it's over. But we're making progress here. I'll just give you one data point. Last week alone, we hired over 13,000 people. We've been at this for a while and we'll stay at it until we get the number of people, we need to deliver a great peak for our customers. Yeah. We've talked about the small package market in the United States is very attractive. There's a demand-supply imbalance and everybody wants a piece of the pie. And so these regional players certainly want a piece of the pie. If you look at the LaserShip announced the acquisition, that combined Company, which by the way, is by coastal, so they don't have an end-to-end regional network yet. They just buy coastal fans less than 2% of the volume space. And they're delivering actually for our largest customer, by the way.  That was because our largest customer has that lots of players delivering their boxes. So as we -- as I think about it, game on, right, it's competitive environment and what we have to do is we've got to invest in the customer experience. So that we've got an experience where people want to come to us and pay for the experience that we offer. And just on the leader that's joining that Company, I have great amount of respect from our colleague , I worked with him for 16 years, is an awesome leader. But I love to compete. Mark a little note. Welcome to -- it's the industry and that we're going to have fun together competing. So more to come. Yeah. We don't have a lot of time to talk about this, this morning, but we do have some pilots underway with a third-party platform to see if we can move upstream to consolidate orders into a basket for multiple shippers and ship it on one packaged car. It's early days the pilots just kicked off. But we'll have more color for you. I think at the end of the Fourth Quarter. Thank you."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nScott Childress: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2020 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports that we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. For the second quarter of 2021, GAAP results include after tax transformation and other charges of $11 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Also in the second quarter, on April the 30th, we closed on the sale of UPS Freight, which triggered remeasurement of certain of our pension and post-retirement benefit plans.  The remeasurement resulted in a $2.1 billion reduction in pension and post-retirement benefit obligations on our balance sheet, primarily due to higher discount rates. The vast majority of the remeaseurement impact fell within the corridor. So the impact to GAAP net income was negligible at approximately $3 million.  Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude transformation and other charges. The webcast of today's call, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures is available on the UPS Investor Relations website.  Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining is via the teleconference. If you wish to ask a question, press one then zero on your phone to enter the queue. Please ask only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now, I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Let me start by thanking all UPSers for their hard work and efforts. Our better not bigger framework is enabling consistently high service levels and producing improved financial results. Our team is truly moving our world forward by delivering what matters.  More specifically, we are winning in the most attractive parts of the markets with new capabilities like our fastest ground ever weekend initiatives and improvements in our customer experience journey. We are continuing to deliver lifesaving COVID-19 vaccine and our healthcare growth initiative is gaining momentum. We are also driving sustainable revenue per piece growth through targeted revenue quality strategies.  And lastly, we are driving productivity improvements in the network and implementing targeted transformational expense reductions. Our second quarter financial results across all segments were much better than we anticipated.  Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 14.5% from last year to $23.4 billion and operating profit grew 40.8% to $3.3 billion. As we expected, U.S. average daily volume for the quarter was down slightly from one year ago, driven primarily by tough comparisons due to the jump in ecommerce-related volume last year, but our revenue quality in the U.S. were much improved due to a change in customer mix, as well as our revenue quality strategies.  All of our business segments delivered record quarterly operating profits and expanded operating margin on a year-over-year basis. In the U.S., operating margin was 11.6%, our highest second quarter operating margin since 2017. In the International segment, operating profit increased 41.3% and operating margin reached a record 24.7%.  And in Supply Chain Solutions, continued strength in freight forwarding and healthcare drove operating margin of 9.7%, a record for the segment. While we closely monitor external factors like the tight labor markets and low inventory levels, the execution of our initiatives has put us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 financial targets. Brian will share more details with you during his remarks.  Moving to our Customer First, people-led, innovation-driven strategy, we strive to provide our customers with the best digital experience powered by our global smart logistics network. Customer First is about creating a frictionless customer experience and building the capabilities that matter the most to our customers.  During the second quarter, Saturday Ground delivery volume grew 13% as we continued expanding our weekend coverage. This is an example of better not bigger as we are expanding service with very little capital spending.  We are currently half way through our efforts to expand our existing centers and turn on Saturday operations in more than 200 additional centers. By the end of October of this year, we will cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturdays, which will further extend our market-leading Saturday commercial delivery and pickup services and support our ongoing Sunday delivery services.  These improvements benefit all of our customers, large and small by enabling faster time in transit and expanding capacity. As we execute our strategy, our focus is on growing value share. We are changing the growth targets of the company and our no longer focus solely on volume growth.  Instead, we are creating new capabilities and leveraging our competitive advantages to grow revenue and profits from the most attractive parts of the markets like SMB, B2B, healthcare and international while at the same time, providing value and service to targeted large enterprise customers.  It’s early days, but we believe our strategy is working. For example, in the U.S., we grew SMB average daily volume including platforms by 21.6% and we saw total U.S. revenue per piece increase by 13.4%. As you know, healthcare is one of our wildly important Customer First initiatives. In the second quarter, healthcare customer revenue on a global basis grew 19.8% and contributed to margin expansion in all three segments.  To grow in the healthcare sector, we are creating new capabilities like our recent launch of the UPS Cold Chain Solutions and we are deploying sophisticated solutions that customers want into new geographies like the expansion of the UPS Premier to Canada and Europe. These actions are advancing our leadership position in the global healthcare logistics markets.  To support growth in our International segment, we continue to invest broadly including the launch of our first ever daily flight from Osaka to Shenzen, thus significantly speeding up our time in transit across multiple trade lines. We are also improving the customer experience across 16 journeys to make them simpler and more helpful.  One of the customer pain points we are addressing is claims. We recently completed a successful pilot that shortened the average claim processing time from 20 days to five. The improvements we made resulted in a 1.9% reduction in churn among pilot participants. We are rolling out our new claims process to all U.S. SMB customers over the next twelve months.  To put this into perspective, every 1 percentage point reduction in U.S. SMB churn is worth about $170 million in annual revenue.  Moving to the People Led component of our strategy, our focus here is to make UPS a great place to work. So that our people feel confident recommending UPS to others. During the second quarter, our executive leadership team spent many days in our operations around the world, delivery packages, walking our facilities, and talking with our people.  When we did that, we don’t take a list, we bring back a list of the actions we can take to simplify our processes, drive productivity and improve the quality of the work environment for our people. I cannot say enough about the commitment of UPSers who over the last year rose to meet the challenges of elevated volume, while ensuring great service to our customers day in and day out.  I’d like to recognize our 38,000 part-time management employees in the U.S. that work primarily in our pre-load, hub, sort and air operations. In appreciation of their extraordinary efforts, we provided them with a one-time financial award in the second quarter. People Led builds on a strong foundation and we will continue living our values, modernizing our policies, and rewarding our people to make UPS an even better place to work and employer of choice.  Turning to Innovation-Driven. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation is generating significant levels of free cash flow. In fact, in the first six months of this year, we generated $6.8 billion in free cash flow. This is a record. We’ve generated more free cash flow in the first six months of this year than we previously generated in any full year at any time in our company’s history.  Also in the second quarter, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight, a capital-intensive, low-returning part of our business. This with other actions has greatly improved our financial condition from one year ago as Brian will detail. And looking ahead, we expect to see a significant increase in our return on invested capital this year.  Innovation-Driven will also help us to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. In August, we will publish our annual sustainability report, which include our 19th GRI Content Index, along with our second Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB reports and our first Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures or TCFD report.  Social and environmental stewardship goes right to our core values and we remain committed to providing investors transparency through our expanded ESG disclosures.  Next month, UPS will celebrate our 114th anniversary. It is such an honor for me to guide this company to our next chapter. We are a purpose-driven company and we are investing in the capabilities that matter most to our customers to create value for our shareowners.  Thank you. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Brian. \nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover four areas, starting with macroeconomic trends, then our second quarter results, next I'll review cash and shareowner returns, and lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook.  Okay, let's start with the macro. All major economic indicators remains strong with the economic recovery progressing faster than expected. In the second quarter, looking at IHS forecasts, Global GDP is expected to finish up 10.6% and U.S. GDP is expected to be up 12.5%. However, robust economic growth and high consumer demand is putting pressure on global supply chains and inventory replenishment. In fact, the U.S. inventory to sales ratio declined further from the figure I shared last quarter and was 1.09 in June. As a point of reference, for the three years prior to COVID, this ratio ran between 1.4 and 1.5. For the full year, global GDP is now expected to grow 5.8% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 6.6%. Accordingly, as we look at the back half of the year, while economic growth is forecast to remain positive, the rate of growth slows.  Moving to our second quarter consolidated performance. We delivered double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Consolidated revenue increased 14.5% to $23.4 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.3 billion, 40.8% higher than last year. And I’ll note that this is the first time UPS has generated quarterly operating profit over $3 billion.  Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14%, which was 260 basis points above last yearour best consolidated margin in 18 quarters and diluted earnings per share was up $2.77, up 141% from the same period last year. And diluted earnings per share was $3.06, up 43.7% from the same period last year.  Now let's take a look at the segments. In U.S. Domestic, our mix improvement and other revenue quality initiatives, as well as productivity efforts continued to drive strong results. As expected, As expected, last year’s surge in essential goods delivered to homes created tough comparisons on a year-over-year basis.  As a result, total average daily volume in the U.S., in the second quarter of this year was down 619,000 pieces per day or 2.9% due to a decline in SurePost volume of 1.3 million packages per day. The decline in SurePost volume was partially offset by double-digit percentage growth in ground commercial and next day air volume. The unique year-over-year comparisons were also visible in our volume mix. B2C average daily volume was down 15.8% year-over-year. Conversely, B2B volume increased 25.7%. All industry sectors grew B2B volume, led by retail as more foot traffic returned to the brick-and-mortar locations. In fact, B2B retail posted its first year-over-year increase in volume since 2019.  And healthcare remained a bright spot, with B2B volume up 28.6%. Customer mix continued to be positive as our network enhancements drove SMB volume growth including platforms of 21.6%. And in the second quarter, SMB made up 27.2% of U.S. domestic volume. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $14.4 billion, up 10.2%, driven by a record 13.4% increase in revenue per piece, with fuel driving 220 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate. We are pleased with the progress of our revenue quality efforts. The combination of base rate increases, surcharges and mix improvements generated double-digit revenue per piece percentage increases in our next day air and ground products. Turning to costs, total expense grew 7.3% driven by three main areas. First, fuel represented 220 basis points of the increase. Second were the enhancements to speed up our network and expand weekend operations, which accounted for around 200 basis points of the total expense increase.  And finally, another 210 basis points came from an increase in employee benefit expenses as more employees became eligible for health, welfare and retirement benefits; and from the reinstatement of the federal excise tax. Looking at efficiencies, we continue to see productivity improvements within package and inside operations. In fact, direct labor hours were down 1.4%, which includes a double-digit percentage reduction in over time hours. Most notably in the quarter, revenue growth was significantly above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage.  In summary, the U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, an increase of $460 million or 37.9%, compared to last year and operating margin expanded 230 basis points. Moving to International, the segment delivered another quarter of record operating profit. Total average daily volume was up 12.7%. B2B volume grew 25% on a year-over-year basis with growth across all industries and customer segments. Conversely, B2C volume was down 4.1%. These year-over-year comparisons reflect the unique pandemic effects from last year, as B2C volume doubled in the second quarter of 2020.  Total export average daily volume was up 14% on a year-over-year basis with all regions except Asia posting double-digit growth. Asia export volume faced difficult comps and was down 5.8%, compared to the remarkable growth rate of 46.8% in the second quarter of last year driven by the surge of PPE.  For the quarter, International revenue was up 30% to $4.8 billion, with all major regions growing revenue by double-digit percentages. We generated positive operating leverage in the quarter. Revenue per piece was up 15.5%, including a 530 basis point benefit from the fuel surcharge and cost per piece was up 12.4%, including a 570 basis point impact from higher fuel costs.  In the second quarter, International delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion, an increase of 41.3% and operating margin expanded to 24.7%. Our strategy in the International segment is absolutely driving value share and growth from the best parts of the market.  As Scott Price shared in June, we are underpenetrated in almost all geographies around the world. So we see tremendous potential as we continue executing our wildly important initiatives internationally. Now looking at supply chain solutions, revenue increased 14.3% to $4.2 billion and the segment generated record profit and operating margin. Market demand was elevated and revenue growth in our major business categories more than offset the revenue impact from the sale of UPS Freight, which closed on April 30th. Looking at operating profit, in forwarding, our ocean freight product more than doubled its operating profit on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong inventory replenishment demand. And in healthcare, our clinical trials, along with cell and gene solutions again delivered record top and bottom-line results.  In the second quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $408 million and the operating margin was 9.7%. We are extremely pleased with our performance in this segment. We have moved the needle on operating margin where over the past five years operating margin has averaged 6.6%.  Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had a $167 million of interest expense; other pension income was $302 million; and lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.1%, which was lower than last year due to discrete items. Now let’s turn to cash and the balance sheet. We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focused on capital allocation and bottom-line results. For the first six months of the year, we generated $8.5 billion in cash from operations and $6.8 billion in free cash flow.  Also in the second quarter, the sale of UPS Freight triggered remeasurement of certain U.S. pension and post-retirement plans, which resulted in a reduction in our net pension liability of $2.1 billion on our balance sheet, primarily due to higher discount rates. GAAP income only benefited by about $3 million, because the vast majority of the gain fell within the corridor. As Carol mentioned, our financial condition has greatly improved. A strong balance sheet is a core UPS principle and since the end of 2020, we have reduced our pension liability and outstanding debt by $10.2 billion, bringing our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.1. And lastly, so far this year, UPS has distributed $1.7 billion in dividends. Moving to our outlook, I’ll cover both the second half of 2021 and the full year. First, we expect market conditions to remain favorable and our initiatives to continue delivering positive results in our business. We are also paying close attention to several external factors, including the Delta variant of COVID-19, inflationary pressures, the U.S. inventory-to-sales ratio and consumer spending preferences.  Nonetheless, we expect our revenue quality efforts to cover known expense pressures and we are on track to meet our 2021 non-operating savings target of $500 million. On a consolidated basis, we expect second half 2021 revenue growth of around 5.4% year-over-year, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight, tough comparisons from last year, and our revenue quality initiatives. We expect the second half 2021 consolidated operating margin of around 12%. In U.S. Domestic, we anticipate back half 2021 revenue growth of about 8.2%, with revenue growing faster than volumes. Operating margin should be around 9.2%. Operating margin in the back half of the year is expected to be lower than what we reported in the first half due to three factors. First is higher compensation expense from our contractual labor increase, which goes into effect each year in August.  Second, we have made targeted hourly rate adjustments in certain geographies to remain competitive in the market. And as usual, lower margin enterprise and B2C volume will represent a larger percentage of our total volume due to peak. Pulling it all together, we now expect full year 2021 U.S. operating margin to be approximately 10.1%. In the International segment, for the second half of 2021, we anticipate year-over-year average daily volume growth from Europe to be in the mid-single digits. In addition, we expect Asia outbound volume to remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, we expect revenue growth around 10.7% with an operating margin of about 22.9%. In the Supply Chain Solutions segment, in the second half of this year, we expect freight forwarding and healthcare to continue to lead the segment. We anticipate total revenue in this segment will decline around 9.6%, due to the sale of UPS Freight. However, we expect operating profit growth of around 8.1% and an operating margin of about 9.1%. Moving to the full year, in 2021, we expect consolidated operating margin of approximately 12.7% and return on invested capital of approximately 28%. We expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion, and in April, we repaid $1 billion in debt and have achieved our 2021 target of $2.55 billion in debt repayment.  We have no plans to repurchase shares in 2021 at this time, but given the strong free cash flow and further reductions to our pension liabilities, we continue to evaluate the option to repurchase shares later this year.  And lastly, our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is now expected to be around 23%. Looking out to 2023, the current economic outlook, coupled with the early results from our revenue quality and productivity initiatives is putting us well on our way to achieving the high-end of our 2023 targets.  In closing, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy under the better not bigger framework, and leaning into the best market opportunities to improve the financial performance of the company, provide the best customer experience and benefit our shareowners.  Thank you, and operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Morning, everyone. Carol, a few questions on enterprise customers. What was that growth or decline year-over-year in 2Q? Was that mostly again running into really difficult comps? Or have any enterprise customers changed their sourcing behavior in response to your pricing and surcharge strategy? And lastly, you said that you’re targeting large – you are going after targeted large enterprise customers in the future. What does that mean, kind of what’s the basis for that targeting? Thank you.\nCarol Tome : Thank you, Ravi for the question. On the enterprise customer behavior in the second quarter, it was largely impacted by SurePost volume and as Brian explained our SurePost volume was down 1.3 million pieces. That happened because many of our brick-and-mortar enterprise customers reopened their stores and as the economies reopened, customers went back to those stores.  So, we actually anticipated this when we built our second quarter plan and in fact, the average daily volume performed better than we had planned at the beginning of the year. As we focus our efforts going forward, we are really leaning into those customers that value our end-to-end network and focused on value share, not so much volume share.  As we discussed during our June investor conference, a package is not a package. They come with different characteristics and we are leaning into those packages and those customers that value our end-to-end network.  Brian anything to add?\nBrian Newman : No, just Ravi, if you back out that SurePost volume that Carol alluded to we’d actually be up 4% in ground in Domestic business for the quarter.\nRavi Shanker : Great. Any follow-up on larger ecommerce enterprise customers, kind of any update there versus the brick-and-mortar guys? Thank you.\nCarol Tome : So, we value our very large ecommerce customer that doesn’t have a storefront, as well as all of our enterprise customers and if I look at our very large enterprise customer that doesn’t have a storefront or much of a storefront, the percentage of our total revenue was about the same as it was in the first quarter.\nRavi Shanker : Thank you.\nCarol Tome : You bet.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter : Great. Good morning. So, just looking at your volume comp, just to follow that discussion. Are you seeing the B2C deceleration? Or are your outlook on that B2C relative growth continuing to decline as you face these tougher comps? And then, just looking at the margin thoughts there, right? So you are looking for a deceleration in the margin.  Maybe you could just flush that out a little bit. You kind of highlighted, Brian that your three thoughts on that, but maybe just kind of talk to Carol’s historical conservativism versus your thoughts on the extending cost that you see coming back online with the union costs?\nCarol Tome : Well, maybe I’ll comment on volume and then we’ll turn to cost. We were really pleased with the growth that we saw in our SMB customer in the second quarter. Last year, SMBs in the United States made up about 20% of our total revenue. This year it make up more than 27% of our total revenue. So we think that the capabilities that we are investing to grow this very important customer segment, they are further working.  Now, If you look at the breakdown of SMB, 50% of the revenue was for commercial. 50% of the revenue was for residential delivery. So you can see a shift within SMBs. What you would expect as the economies start to reopen and we were very pleased with the growth that we saw in our commercial business.  Looking ahead, we would expect the volume trends to be around the same in the third quarter and we are not into the process of giving you quarterly guidance, but we would expect the volume trends to be about the same in the third quarter and then volume up in the fourth quarter as we head into peak. Brian comments on cost?\nBrian Newman : Ken, on the cost front, I think I articulated what drove the 730 BPS of increase in the second quarter. If you look at the first half of the year, our cost per piece was about 6.5%. So, mid-single digit. I think we would anticipate that looking to be somewhat similar from a CPP basis in the second half of the year. We can unpack that for us if you want more detail.\nKen Hoexter : No – no – no more detail. I was just kind of wondering your thoughts on the deceleration versus trying to be conservative with the outlook versus your thoughts on kind of the margin follow-through.\nBrian Newman : Well, I think from a cost perspective, Ken, one of the elements that’s driving that cost per piece is our union labor increase in August. So, when you look sequentially from the first half of the year to the back half of the year, it’s a fairly material number when you look at the market rate adjustments and the union increase. It’s a north of $400 million. So it’s about 150 BPS on the margin.\nKen Hoexter : Very helpful. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra : Thanks. Excuse me. Thanks, operator. Brian, just wanted to confirm or Carol, just wanted to confirm your comments that you are expecting total average daily volume in Domestic volumes to be down year-over-year in 3Q versus a similar rate in 4Q and then positive in 4Q? And then, also, maybe a little bit more of a bigger picture question, Carol, the company has paid - committed to basically paying down debt.  The balance sheet, financial position has gotten better as some of these pension issues have kind of resolved themselves. I am wondering if you are opening up the company to maybe a more of a major acquisition over the next couple of years, is there an appetite for maybe significant M&A? And if there is, what are some of the areas and adjacencies that kind of make sense for how you see the company evolving over the next many years, that would be helpful as well? Thank you.\nCarol Tome : Well, Brian, what’s your comment on the volume and then, I’ll talk about the balance sheet.\nBrian Newman : Sure, Amit. Our current forecast that we are holding for the second half of the year is low-single-digit from an ADB perspective. So, I am not going to get into Q3 versus Q4 as there is a lot of movement right now in the market. But we had one each was about 4%. We are expecting low-single-digit, slightly lower than that in the second half.\nCarol Tome : And I think a lot of this on the volume side is still highly dependent on the inventory to sales ratio, isn’t it? We’ve been talking to our large customers about what they are seeing in their business and interestingly, one large brick-and-mortar customer told us they had 50 containers that were stuck in the port. And until those containers can get into their warehouses and into their stores, it’s hard to sell.  So, there is a bit of an uncertainty out there. But we are going to control what we are going to control and we shared this back half view with you because we thought you should know what we are seeing and what we’re thinking about our business. On the balance sheet question Amit, gosh, from where we were a year ago, the financial condition of our company has greatly improved, even from the end of the year it’s greatly improved with our debt and pension liabilities down $10 million from the end of the year end and having a strong financial condition lets us all sleep well at night. So that we can lean into our customer experience and do the right thing for our people, for our communities and for our customers. As we think about our strategic opportunities ahead, we are opportunity-rich. So we are going to continue to lean into those 16 customer journeys that we’ve talked to you about, because we really think by improving the end-to-end experience, we get stickiness with our customers and can grow that value share that we are sticking to grow.  Could there be a capability that might - we might want to acquire to enable or speed up those journeys? Perhaps. But we’re not seeing here building a large M&A war chest, if you will. In fact, risk and try to run the best business that we can. Now we do believe that cash belongs to the shareowners and not to us. We told you that at the beginning or at the end of this year, if you will, we have a new dividend payout target which is 50% of earnings.  So, based on the guidance that Brian has shared with you today, that could imply a fairly nice use of cash when we announced that new dividend. We are also looking at re-entering the share repurchase market. This is something that we discuss with our Board every quarter. We have a Board Meeting next week. So, Brian shared with you in his prepared remarks that we are looking that as well.\nAmit Mehrotra : So is $1 billion a year the right target that you disclosed a month-and-a-half ago? Or is it now there is more upward bias on that, as you look forward?\nCarol Tome : So, I think as we reported, we generated more free cash in the first six months of this year than we have in any year and any time in our company history. So, with the debt-to-EBITDA ratio now of 2.1, things are looking good for UPS and our ability to return capital to our shareowners. So, when we get ready to change, how much you should put in your model for share repurchases, we’ll tell you.\nAmit Mehrotra : Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nCarol Tome : Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. So I want to dig into the Domestic revenue per piece a little bit more. I know you called out fuel. But you had also mentioned the surcharges which I believe are weighted more towards B2C, as well as some your revenue quality issues. Any way to break that down a little further? I am just trying to get a better sense of what the organic revenue quality impact is to that revenue per piece, if you could?\nBrian Newman : Hey, Allison, I’ll take that. So, when you look at the RPP in the quarter, we were up Domestic 13.4%. Two-thirds of that improvement came from customer product mix and surcharges. And as you think about the surcharges and the mix, the big driver of mix was SMB volume, which - it increased to 27.2% of our total mix. If you think back to last year in Q2, that was down at about 21.2%.  So we’re on that journey at the Investor Day. We talked that we wanted to get north of 30% to hit the high end of our guidance. We’re well on the way of that journey and we feel good. Lastly, on the rate component. We are not even really halfway through the rate contractual negotiations as those contracts open back up. So there is still more gas in the tank across the three levers.\nAllison Poliniak : Great. Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee : Hey. Thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to kind of comment that yield point for a second and maybe tie it into the domestic margin outlook in the second half of the year. So, low-single-digit ADV in the back half of the year, is that kind of way to think about it? I guess, you sort of maybe get mid single-digit yield growth.  And then in the context of that SMB sort of step-up as well as B2B being up, I guess I am a little surprised to not see the incremental margins or implied margins in the back half of the year be a little bit stronger. So it sounds like there is some cost dynamics probably fuel sort of weighing in there a little bit.  But could you help us unpack a little bit more some of those moving pieces maybe on the cost side or maybe something that’s going on within mix between B2B and B2C that kind of help us with the sequential progression of the Domestic margins in the back half of the year?\nBrian Newman : Sure, Chris. I’ll take a stab at that. So, the way I think about the second half of the year, when I say low-single-digit ADV, it’s really closer to the 1% range, RPP should be in sort of the high-single digits, 7-ish, 7.5 thereabout and then cost per piece is probably similar to what we saw in one each, which was in that 6.5 range. So that’s sort of from an algorithm perspective how the math plays out.  There are a lot of moving pieces here from a CPP I mentioned the cost increases from the wage and union contracts. We’ve also gotten some market rate adjustments that are going in, in the second half of the year to remain competitive on a geographic standpoint. And then RPP, obviously, you’ve got that higher enterprise in B2C mix in the peak season. Carol, anything to add?\nCarol Tome : I think the peak season comment is right, because we will see mix difference. \nBrian Newman : That’s right. \nCarol Tome : We won’t see a higher penetration of enterprise than we have today.\nChris Wetherbee : And just a quick follow-up, is the fourth quarter, do you assume that you can get Domestic margin expansion in 4Q during peak season this year?\nBrian Newman : We do.\nChris Wetherbee : Thank you.\nBrian Newman : Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAllison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. Obviously called out the cost headwinds weighing on Domestic margins in the second half. But you should start to lap costs related to the Saturday expansion and speeding up the network. So, does the 220 basis point headwind in Q2 related to this ease in Q3 and go away by Q4? So maybe if you could just sort of address some of the factors that are positive for margins?  And just to clarify, so, is it fair to assume for both Q3 and Q4 that the spread between RPP and CPP should remain positive? Thank you.\nCarol Tome : So, I’ll start with the expansion of our weekend delivery, which we are so pleased with. And we commented that we saw 13% growth on Saturday in the second quarter. We are about half way through this initiative to reach 90% of the U.S. population by October of this year. We are expanding services in over 500 buildings, existing and new. So, we’ve got some more costs coming out of this in the third quarter, but then, as you point out, looking to lap that next year, which we look forward to.\nBrian Newman : Allison, just in terms of the margin and sequential performance, look, we plan for positive spreads between RPP and CPP on a quarterly basis. So, that’s our objective. It’s probably a little tighter in Q3 than it is four. And I just remind you the journey we are on, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are going towards that 12% by 2023.  And I think at the Investor Day I had mentioned we want to be more than halfway there by 2021. The guidance of 10.1 versus the 7.7 last year, we had 240 basis points in the first year that leaves another 200 basis points over a two year basis. So I think we passed that 50% mark and we are confident that we’ll deliver that 12%.\nAllison Landry : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker : Hello. Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody. And thank you for your time. I just have two questions. On the free cash flow, when you think about so much free cash flow in the forecast for greater free cash flow as you continue to see these improvements that you are talking about, do you worry about under-investing in the business and then having to invest later to catch-up to the growth that you’re seeing? And maybe you could talk a little bit more about that?\nCarol Tome : Yes, I am happy to talk to you about philosophically, then Brian, please add on. When we had our Investor Day back in June, we laid out a capital investing plan on the high side of about $14.5 billion between now and 2023. That’s based on what we know.  If we have an opportunity to invest that returns, the kinds of returns that we are looking for, we’ll increase that capital. So we laid out what we knew. There is no gating factor here. We will continue to invest in the capabilities that are necessary to drive the business forward.\nBrian Newman : And I just, Helane, I just follow-up, we are still adding capacity when we look at the business. So, in terms of this year, we’ll bring on seven new retrofit lines, about 2 million square feet of space, 130,000 pieces per hour and it’s a journey. As Carol mentioned, we’ve got about a 60-40 split in terms of our buildings and facilities and capacity and future growth making 60%, maintenance 40% or less.  So I think we will continue to evaluate. The thing I would highlight is, with ROIC going up to 28% on a full year basis, we are very happy with the returns that we are making in the business, as Carol mentioned with the excess cash, if we find areas to continue to invest and grow the business, we’ll certainly do that.\nCarol Tome : And we are also adding aircrafts, Brian, from a capacity perspective. \nBrian Newman : Sure.\nCarol Tome : We are thinking about, I think six aircrafts between now and the end of the year.\nBrian Newman : For the balance of the year, that’s right.\nHelane Becker : Yes. That’s perfect and thank you very much. I appreciate that.\nCarol Tome : Thank you.\nBrian Newman : Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. I am going to go International and it’s a bit of a two-parter. Just curious what you are seeing with regard to SMB penetration in International market contrasting it with the U.S. market? And then looking at International, it’s been tremendously strong, very high margin. I am just curious, what are the factors you are watching that might put you a little higher or lower in the back half of the year with regard to the international business overall? Thanks.\nCarol Tome : Well, I’ll address the SMB. We were very pleased with the SMB performance in the second quarter. It grew 17% year-on-year. Many of the customer journeys that we are introducing in the United States, we are taking outside the United States, as well. And Scott Price and his team are doing a really nice job of understanding customer pain points and where we need to invest.  One of the areas that we need to invest candidly is time in transit. And that’s one reason we were so excited about the new Osaka to Shenzhen lane that we opened up in the second quarter, where our time in transit was something like 26%, it’s now 76%. So we are leading the pack in that regard. So, pleased about that. You might talk about margin.\nBrian Newman : Yes, I think from a margin perspective, Scott, what’s plus up or plus down drivers, I think Scott and the team are focused on controlling what they can control and doing that very well. They’ve remained - they’ll continue to deliver these elevated margins which are terrific.  I think this is a thing that we are really plus it up or plus down would be the external factors in terms of the inventory pipeline and COVID spikes with the Delta variant to the extent there are less impact - impactful, maybe we go up to the extent there are more shutdowns and inventory remains tighter. It could be a challenge. But that - those are really the external factors that I would highlight.\nScott Schneeberger : Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTodd Fowler : Great. Thanks, and good morning. So, I wanted to ask a little bit on the labor availability side. It sounds like that there were some actions taken in the current quarter for some incentive compensation there. And as we think about the back half of the year, it sounds like some market adjustments. I guess, we typically think about it’s been little bit more locked in on the labor cost side.  Can you speak to what you are seeing with labor availability and how you think you are positioned at this point from a labor cost standpoint for the rest of the year?\nCarol Tome : Yes, it’s a tight labor market for sure. And to your observation, we are pretty much locked in, because of the way that most of our people are employed. But in certain parts of the country, we’ve had to make some market rate adjustments. That’s a smaller piece on the cost pressure that we have in the back half that Brian detailed for you in his remarks.  We need to hire a lot of people for peak and I’m happy to say that even in the face of this tight labor market, we are ahead of where we were a year ago. And Nando and his team are just managing this on a day-to-day basis. And just as it relates to peak, our peak planning is well underway. The good news is from an operating perspective, we have one additional operating day this year, which helped us.  We are lining up the aircraft that we need to lease to manage the volume. We are lining up all the rental equipment that we need to have in place to handle the volume and of course, on the people - on the people side. So, we’re - every day we are working on peak. I know it’s just July, but we are working on peak every day.\nTodd Fowler : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group : Hey. Thanks. Morning. Just a couple of things I want to clarify. Can you just give us how much the one-time bonus was in 2Q that you talked about? And is the August wage increase different than normal? And then, just bigger picture, I am struggling with just understanding if we have a positive price cost spread in second half? Why margins aren’t really improving?  And then, if I could just ask one more, Carol, going back to the Analyst Day, we heard a lot about mix. I don’t know that we heard a lot about like underlying pricing. And can you just talk about that as well? Thank you.\nCarol Tome : Sure. Go ahead, Brian.\nBrian Newman : Yes. So, the first two questions, Scott, you got a few packed in there. The one-time bonus cost about $20 million in terms of the impact that we put out. The increase, we have step-ups in our wage contracts and so, it would be higher than previous year. Obviously, we are always talking more sequentially what was in the first half versus the second half and that’s the big impact, which is about - in or about $400 million in totals, so about 150 BPS on margin.  And then I think, the margins, as spreads get a bit tighter, I laid out the - what our assumptions were in the back half of the year. So there is still positive leverage. They just get a little bit constrained by two things. One is the mix that we talked about during peak and the higher enterprise and B2C and then the additional headwind pressure in terms of the labor piece that I mentioned.\nCarol Tome : You might give a little color on next-gen profit to and the activity underway there.\nBrian Newman : So, next-gen profits has evolved Scott, to look at both the RPP and the CPP and so the team’s got together each and every week to think about, how do we drive the right customer in and the service trade-offs to deliver the right product availability. A lot of it has to do with the dynamic pricing. So when we announced our surcharges, we are trying to target specific areas and basically play the mix rate and surcharge lever.  We still got plenty of room to go as I mentioned on the rate renegotiation on the cost piece. We are looking at bigger ticket items to change the game. So, Nando and his team or are thinking about – they are doing the blocking and tackling every day, but how do we take on a few initiatives in that much bigger cost bucket.  Non-ops were making good progress. We’ve delivered about half of that $500 million in non-ops on a year-to-date basis, about $220 million. But on the back-end of the year, we’ll be getting after some of the operations opportunity and going into 2022.\nScott Group : And Carol, just the broader pricing?\nCarol Tome : The broader pricing market. So, pricing remains tight. It’s projected that at peak there’ll be a demand capacity imbalance of about 5 million pieces per day. So that is a nice environment to be working in. But you don’t want to run the business just on price lift, day in and day out. You really want to right the total value equation. So, we’ve got a laser-focus on cost and productivity, as well as providing the capabilities that our customers value the most.\nScott Group : Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nBrian Newman : Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two quick follow-ups on the last commentary. Brian, can you elaborate on just the next-gen profit initiative? Is it fully rolled out across the entire company? Is this more of a U.S. domestic focus? And we heard about it at Investor Day, but how embedded - is it 100% ramped up across the operations and fully working?  And then, Carol, you mentioned the 5 million pieces per day shortfall. I think that’s down from 7 million. Last time you talked about it I don’t necessarily think that’s a bad thing because people are trying to secure capacity in advance probably. But maybe you can put some context around that in terms of the broader supply demand balance which seemingly is still pretty tight, but obviously maybe a little bit more capacity coming back into the market ahead of another strong peak?\nBrian Newman : So, on the first question that you are asking about the next-gen profit, look, Scott Price and the international team are really focused on value share growth. And so, this is mainly a domestic initiative at this stage of the game as we look at margin opportunities between RPP and CPP in terms of it being fully deployed.  Now, the cost runway takes a little longer to get after. So we still catching up with some of the initiatives taking hold from an operations and a cost perspective that will have a longer tail to it. And then we are well on the journey in terms of getting a playbook. I would say the piece on RPP that still needs some revenue that still needs to catch up would be the dynamic pricing that relies on technology.  So that’s the next chapter on the revenue side. Cost, we continue to work on and it’s more of a Domestic focus.\nCarol Tome : That dynamic pricing is such an exciting aspect of our future. But it is highly dependent on data and technology. We have in one of our wildly important initiatives is enterprise data strategy. We’ve got data and lots of data and lots of data pools around the company. And I would say some of the data pools are not very clean.  So we are going to clean up all those data pools and get to one version of the truth so all of our consuming applications go into one clean data pool that will make it so much easier for our revenue leaders and our sales leaders to manage the business.  The same is true for cost, right? So this is a pretty exciting initiative that we have underway and then you layer technology on top of that. The technology piece is not the heavy lift to data is the heavy lift but that initiative is well under way. And in terms of the demand/supply capacity challenge, it has gotten a little bit better because people have added capacity as you would expect, we’re adding capacity. So is our competitors. So it’s still an interesting environment for sure and as we work with our customers, we want to ensure that we meet their needs.  So we’re sitting down with - there are out 300 customers who make up that peak volume surge and we’re sitting down with each of them understanding what their projections, what their promotions are, how are they thinking about the holiday season and really trying to work with them. So that we provide to them the same outstanding and excellent service that we gave to them last year. We just - we are laser-focused on making them happy.\nBrian Ossenbeck : All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. So, I think, when I guess when I try to process the comments in the guidance and everything, it does seem like there is a bit of positive outlook, but lots of momentum relative to the year-over-year improvement in Domestic margin. So focused on domestic in particular. Is that the right way to understand it? Again, not that you can’t improve in the future, but just a slower pace.  And I guess, is there - I wonder is there something that would kind of re-accelerate that if you looked at 2022? Is there pricing that labor inflation moving through that would cause another bite at the apple on some of this pricing? Or how would you think about that, I guess, question, slower improvement and is there an acceleration in or a potential driver of acceleration in Domestic in 2022?. Thank you.\nCarol Tome : It’s still very interesting when you look at the shape of our years, our quarters and our business. We are not a sequential business. Q2 is usually the high watermark for margin and then it comes in the back half because of mixed changes in the fourth quarter related to peak. So, the way you should think about our business is year-on-year-on-year.  At the beginning of this year, I can recall quite clearly at our earnings call at the end of the fourth quarter, where I said, our U.S. operating margins would increase this year and the reaction was, no it won’t, you can’t possibly do it. And in fact, Brian, we are increasing the operating margin in the U.S. by 240 basis points.  So we are well on our way to increasing our operating margin in the U.S. to the 12% target that we set forth in 2023. So think of our business year-on-year not so much quarter-over-quarter or first half versus back half.\nBrian Newman : Yes. And Tom, one of the other things that changed this year, if you look at last year’s Q1 in which there was 3%-ish. Nando and the team did an extraordinary job of focusing to get the cost out from peak and that changed the shape of the calendar a bit and that’s one of the reasons of that combined with a strong 2Q performance why the first half of the year.  But as Carol said, we are managing on a full year basis and to go from 7.7 last year to 10.1, it’s more than 50% on that journey to get to that 12%.\nTom Wadewitz : Yes. Okay, that’s helpful. What about that inflation component? Is there - if you had stronger wage inflation - every company it seems is talking about difficulty of labor availability and inflation. Is it possible that that gives you the ability to go back and ask for a second price increase? Or that supports more pricing as you look at 2022? Or it’s more supply/demand driven and the market is getting a touch less tight?\nCarol Tome : Well, we know what happens in an inflationary environment that way, somebody pays for it. It’s usually the consumer, which means, right, that price increases get passed along all the way to the end to the consumer until the consumer says ouch, I am not going to buy anymore. Consumer continues to buy. So yes, we are in the cycle and this is the cycle, so right, this is the cycle.\nTom Wadewitz : Right. Okay. Thank you.\nBrian Newman : Thanks, Tom.\nScott Childress : Hey, Steven, it’s Scott. We’ve got time for one more question if you would please.\nOperator: Certainly, sir. Our final question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon : Thanks for squeezing me in here. I kind of want to specifically kind of drill into this lack of momentum seen here, right? When you think about the rate of change even on a year-over-year basis, if we are looking at something in a nine handle in the back half of the year, the rate of change is decelerating. So I’d love to understand kind of, what specifically we should be looking for to reaccelerate that rate of change into 2022?  And how we should be thinking about the risk that the 2H domestic margin guide, whether you can actually do a little bit more than that nine in the guidance?\nBrian Newman : So, from a 2H risk perspective, Dave, look, there is a lot of uncertainty out there with COVID and Delta variant and what happens. We are using the data we have today to build the best forecast we can. I think then from a sequential margin perspective, look I think the improvement from 7.7 to 10.1 is positive. Next year what can accelerate? We have an annual GRI, we can relook at our pricing. Our cost and productivity initiatives are taking further hold.  So we are going to continue to press and the journey on SMBs, that’s been a great story. As we’ve been walking up, obviously in Q4 with peak, the mix of SMBs will be a little bit less and then the B2C enterprise customers. But, I would look for that journey to continue next year. Kevin and the team and Kate, they are doing a wonderful job of working with platform customers and SMBs to drive that.  So as that mix goes up, margin improves. So there are several levers. Carol, I don’t know if you want to provide some color.\nCarol Tome : No, I think you called it. Thank you.\nBrian Newman : Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: I will now turn the floor back over to our host, Mr. Childress. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Childress : Thank you, Steven. This concludes our call. I want to thank everyone for joining. And hope you have a great day. Thank you.",

            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover four areas, starting with macroeconomic trends, then our second quarter results, next I'll review cash and shareowner returns, and lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook.  Okay, let's start with the macro. All major economic indicators remains strong with the economic recovery progressing faster than expected. In the second quarter, looking at IHS forecasts, Global GDP is expected to finish up 10.6% and U.S. GDP is expected to be up 12.5%. However, robust economic growth and high consumer demand is putting pressure on global supply chains and inventory replenishment. In fact, the U.S. inventory to sales ratio declined further from the figure I shared last quarter and was 1.09 in June. As a point of reference, for the three years prior to COVID, this ratio ran between 1.4 and 1.5. For the full year, global GDP is now expected to grow 5.8% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 6.6%. Accordingly, as we look at the back half of the year, while economic growth is forecast to remain positive, the rate of growth slows.  Moving to our second quarter consolidated performance. We delivered double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Consolidated revenue increased 14.5% to $23.4 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.3 billion, 40.8% higher than last year. And I'll note that this is the first time UPS has generated quarterly operating profit over $3 billion.  Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14%, which was 260 basis points above last yearour best consolidated margin in 18 quarters and diluted earnings per share was up $2.77, up 141% from the same period last year. And diluted earnings per share was $3.06, up 43.7% from the same period last year.  Now let's take a look at the segments. In U.S. Domestic, our mix improvement and other revenue quality initiatives, as well as productivity efforts continued to drive strong results. As expected, As expected, last year's surge in essential goods delivered to homes created tough comparisons on a year-over-year basis.  As a result, total average daily volume in the U.S., in the second quarter of this year was down 619,000 pieces per day or 2.9% due to a decline in SurePost volume of 1.3 million packages per day. The decline in SurePost volume was partially offset by double-digit percentage growth in ground commercial and next day air volume. The unique year-over-year comparisons were also visible in our volume mix. B2C average daily volume was down 15.8% year-over-year. Conversely, B2B volume increased 25.7%. All industry sectors grew B2B volume, led by retail as more foot traffic returned to the brick-and-mortar locations. In fact, B2B retail posted its first year-over-year increase in volume since 2019.  And healthcare remained a bright spot, with B2B volume up 28.6%. Customer mix continued to be positive as our network enhancements drove SMB volume growth including platforms of 21.6%. And in the second quarter, SMB made up 27.2% of U.S. domestic volume. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $14.4 billion, up 10.2%, driven by a record 13.4% increase in revenue per piece, with fuel driving 220 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate. We are pleased with the progress of our revenue quality efforts. The combination of base rate increases, surcharges and mix improvements generated double-digit revenue per piece percentage increases in our next day air and ground products. Turning to costs, total expense grew 7.3% driven by three main areas. First, fuel represented 220 basis points of the increase. Second were the enhancements to speed up our network and expand weekend operations, which accounted for around 200 basis points of the total expense increase.  And finally, another 210 basis points came from an increase in employee benefit expenses as more employees became eligible for health, welfare and retirement benefits; and from the reinstatement of the federal excise tax. Looking at efficiencies, we continue to see productivity improvements within package and inside operations. In fact, direct labor hours were down 1.4%, which includes a double-digit percentage reduction in over time hours. Most notably in the quarter, revenue growth was significantly above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage.  In summary, the U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, an increase of $460 million or 37.9%, compared to last year and operating margin expanded 230 basis points. Moving to International, the segment delivered another quarter of record operating profit. Total average daily volume was up 12.7%. B2B volume grew 25% on a year-over-year basis with growth across all industries and customer segments. Conversely, B2C volume was down 4.1%. These year-over-year comparisons reflect the unique pandemic effects from last year, as B2C volume doubled in the second quarter of 2020.  Total export average daily volume was up 14% on a year-over-year basis with all regions except Asia posting double-digit growth. Asia export volume faced difficult comps and was down 5.8%, compared to the remarkable growth rate of 46.8% in the second quarter of last year driven by the surge of PPE.  For the quarter, International revenue was up 30% to $4.8 billion, with all major regions growing revenue by double-digit percentages. We generated positive operating leverage in the quarter. Revenue per piece was up 15.5%, including a 530 basis point benefit from the fuel surcharge and cost per piece was up 12.4%, including a 570 basis point impact from higher fuel costs.  In the second quarter, International delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion, an increase of 41.3% and operating margin expanded to 24.7%. Our strategy in the International segment is absolutely driving value share and growth from the best parts of the market.  As Scott Price shared in June, we are underpenetrated in almost all geographies around the world. So we see tremendous potential as we continue executing our wildly important initiatives internationally. Now looking at supply chain solutions, revenue increased 14.3% to $4.2 billion and the segment generated record profit and operating margin. Market demand was elevated and revenue growth in our major business categories more than offset the revenue impact from the sale of UPS Freight, which closed on April 30th. Looking at operating profit, in forwarding, our ocean freight product more than doubled its operating profit on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong inventory replenishment demand. And in healthcare, our clinical trials, along with cell and gene solutions again delivered record top and bottom-line results.  In the second quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $408 million and the operating margin was 9.7%. We are extremely pleased with our performance in this segment. We have moved the needle on operating margin where over the past five years operating margin has averaged 6.6%.  Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had a $167 million of interest expense; other pension income was $302 million; and lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.1%, which was lower than last year due to discrete items. Now let's turn to cash and the balance sheet. We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focused on capital allocation and bottom-line results. For the first six months of the year, we generated $8.5 billion in cash from operations and $6.8 billion in free cash flow.  Also in the second quarter, the sale of UPS Freight triggered remeasurement of certain U.S. pension and post-retirement plans, which resulted in a reduction in our net pension liability of $2.1 billion on our balance sheet, primarily due to higher discount rates. GAAP income only benefited by about $3 million, because the vast majority of the gain fell within the corridor. As Carol mentioned, our financial condition has greatly improved. A strong balance sheet is a core UPS principle and since the end of 2020, we have reduced our pension liability and outstanding debt by $10.2 billion, bringing our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.1. And lastly, so far this year, UPS has distributed $1.7 billion in dividends. Moving to our outlook, I'll cover both the second half of 2021 and the full year. First, we expect market conditions to remain favorable and our initiatives to continue delivering positive results in our business. We are also paying close attention to several external factors, including the Delta variant of COVID-19, inflationary pressures, the U.S. inventory-to-sales ratio and consumer spending preferences.  Nonetheless, we expect our revenue quality efforts to cover known expense pressures and we are on track to meet our 2021 non-operating savings target of $500 million. On a consolidated basis, we expect second half 2021 revenue growth of around 5.4% year-over-year, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight, tough comparisons from last year, and our revenue quality initiatives. We expect the second half 2021 consolidated operating margin of around 12%. In U.S. Domestic, we anticipate back half 2021 revenue growth of about 8.2%, with revenue growing faster than volumes. Operating margin should be around 9.2%. Operating margin in the back half of the year is expected to be lower than what we reported in the first half due to three factors. First is higher compensation expense from our contractual labor increase, which goes into effect each year in August.  Second, we have made targeted hourly rate adjustments in certain geographies to remain competitive in the market. And as usual, lower margin enterprise and B2C volume will represent a larger percentage of our total volume due to peak. Pulling it all together, we now expect full year 2021 U.S. operating margin to be approximately 10.1%. In the International segment, for the second half of 2021, we anticipate year-over-year average daily volume growth from Europe to be in the mid-single digits. In addition, we expect Asia outbound volume to remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, we expect revenue growth around 10.7% with an operating margin of about 22.9%. In the Supply Chain Solutions segment, in the second half of this year, we expect freight forwarding and healthcare to continue to lead the segment. We anticipate total revenue in this segment will decline around 9.6%, due to the sale of UPS Freight. However, we expect operating profit growth of around 8.1% and an operating margin of about 9.1%. Moving to the full year, in 2021, we expect consolidated operating margin of approximately 12.7% and return on invested capital of approximately 28%. We expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion, and in April, we repaid $1 billion in debt and have achieved our 2021 target of $2.55 billion in debt repayment.  We have no plans to repurchase shares in 2021 at this time, but given the strong free cash flow and further reductions to our pension liabilities, we continue to evaluate the option to repurchase shares later this year.  And lastly, our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is now expected to be around 23%. Looking out to 2023, the current economic outlook, coupled with the early results from our revenue quality and productivity initiatives is putting us well on our way to achieving the high-end of our 2023 targets.  In closing, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy under the better not bigger framework, and leaning into the best market opportunities to improve the financial performance of the company, provide the best customer experience and benefit our shareowners.  Thank you, and operator, please open the lines. No, just Ravi, if you back out that SurePost volume that Carol alluded to we'd actually be up 4% in ground in Domestic business for the quarter. Ken, on the cost front, I think I articulated what drove the 730 BPS of increase in the second quarter. If you look at the first half of the year, our cost per piece was about 6.5%. So, mid-single digit. I think we would anticipate that looking to be somewhat similar from a CPP basis in the second half of the year. We can unpack that for us if you want more detail. Well, I think from a cost perspective, Ken, one of the elements that's driving that cost per piece is our union labor increase in August. So, when you look sequentially from the first half of the year to the back half of the year, it's a fairly material number when you look at the market rate adjustments and the union increase. It's a north of $400 million. So it's about 150 BPS on the margin. Sure, Amit. Our current forecast that we are holding for the second half of the year is low-single-digit from an ADB perspective. So, I am not going to get into Q3 versus Q4 as there is a lot of movement right now in the market. But we had one each was about 4%. We are expecting low-single-digit, slightly lower than that in the second half. Hey, Allison, I'll take that. So, when you look at the RPP in the quarter, we were up Domestic 13.4%. Two-thirds of that improvement came from customer product mix and surcharges. And as you think about the surcharges and the mix, the big driver of mix was SMB volume, which - it increased to 27.2% of our total mix. If you think back to last year in Q2, that was down at about 21.2%.  So we're on that journey at the Investor Day. We talked that we wanted to get north of 30% to hit the high end of our guidance. We're well on the way of that journey and we feel good. Lastly, on the rate component. We are not even really halfway through the rate contractual negotiations as those contracts open back up. So there is still more gas in the tank across the three levers. Sure, Chris. I'll take a stab at that. So, the way I think about the second half of the year, when I say low-single-digit ADV, it's really closer to the 1% range, RPP should be in sort of the high-single digits, 7-ish, 7.5 thereabout and then cost per piece is probably similar to what we saw in one each, which was in that 6.5 range. So that's sort of from an algorithm perspective how the math plays out.  There are a lot of moving pieces here from a CPP I mentioned the cost increases from the wage and union contracts. We've also gotten some market rate adjustments that are going in, in the second half of the year to remain competitive on a geographic standpoint. And then RPP, obviously, you've got that higher enterprise in B2C mix in the peak season. Carol, anything to add? That's right. We do. Thanks, Chris. Allison, just in terms of the margin and sequential performance, look, we plan for positive spreads between RPP and CPP on a quarterly basis. So, that's our objective. It's probably a little tighter in Q3 than it is four. And I just remind you the journey we are on, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are going towards that 12% by 2023.  And I think at the Investor Day I had mentioned we want to be more than halfway there by 2021. The guidance of 10.1 versus the 7.7 last year, we had 240 basis points in the first year that leaves another 200 basis points over a two year basis. So I think we passed that 50% mark and we are confident that we'll deliver that 12%. And I just, Helane, I just follow-up, we are still adding capacity when we look at the business. So, in terms of this year, we'll bring on seven new retrofit lines, about 2 million square feet of space, 130,000 pieces per hour and it's a journey. As Carol mentioned, we've got about a 60-40 split in terms of our buildings and facilities and capacity and future growth making 60%, maintenance 40% or less.  So I think we will continue to evaluate. The thing I would highlight is, with ROIC going up to 28% on a full year basis, we are very happy with the returns that we are making in the business, as Carol mentioned with the excess cash, if we find areas to continue to invest and grow the business, we'll certainly do that. Sure. For the balance of the year, that's right. Thanks, Helane. Yes, I think from a margin perspective, Scott, what's plus up or plus down drivers, I think Scott and the team are focused on controlling what they can control and doing that very well. They've remained - they'll continue to deliver these elevated margins which are terrific.  I think this is a thing that we are really plus it up or plus down would be the external factors in terms of the inventory pipeline and COVID spikes with the Delta variant to the extent there are less impact - impactful, maybe we go up to the extent there are more shutdowns and inventory remains tighter. It could be a challenge. But that - those are really the external factors that I would highlight. Yes. So, the first two questions, Scott, you got a few packed in there. The one-time bonus cost about $20 million in terms of the impact that we put out. The increase, we have step-ups in our wage contracts and so, it would be higher than previous year. Obviously, we are always talking more sequentially what was in the first half versus the second half and that's the big impact, which is about - in or about $400 million in totals, so about 150 BPS on margin.  And then I think, the margins, as spreads get a bit tighter, I laid out the - what our assumptions were in the back half of the year. So there is still positive leverage. They just get a little bit constrained by two things. One is the mix that we talked about during peak and the higher enterprise and B2C and then the additional headwind pressure in terms of the labor piece that I mentioned. So, next-gen profits has evolved Scott, to look at both the RPP and the CPP and so the team's got together each and every week to think about, how do we drive the right customer in and the service trade-offs to deliver the right product availability. A lot of it has to do with the dynamic pricing. So when we announced our surcharges, we are trying to target specific areas and basically play the mix rate and surcharge lever.  We still got plenty of room to go as I mentioned on the rate renegotiation on the cost piece. We are looking at bigger ticket items to change the game. So, Nando and his team or are thinking about – they are doing the blocking and tackling every day, but how do we take on a few initiatives in that much bigger cost bucket.  Non-ops were making good progress. We've delivered about half of that $500 million in non-ops on a year-to-date basis, about $220 million. But on the back-end of the year, we'll be getting after some of the operations opportunity and going into 2022. Thanks, Scott. So, on the first question that you are asking about the next-gen profit, look, Scott Price and the international team are really focused on value share growth. And so, this is mainly a domestic initiative at this stage of the game as we look at margin opportunities between RPP and CPP in terms of it being fully deployed.  Now, the cost runway takes a little longer to get after. So we still catching up with some of the initiatives taking hold from an operations and a cost perspective that will have a longer tail to it. And then we are well on the journey in terms of getting a playbook. I would say the piece on RPP that still needs some revenue that still needs to catch up would be the dynamic pricing that relies on technology.  So that's the next chapter on the revenue side. Cost, we continue to work on and it's more of a Domestic focus. Yes. And Tom, one of the other things that changed this year, if you look at last year's Q1 in which there was 3%-ish. Nando and the team did an extraordinary job of focusing to get the cost out from peak and that changed the shape of the calendar a bit and that's one of the reasons of that combined with a strong 2Q performance why the first half of the year.  But as Carol said, we are managing on a full year basis and to go from 7.7 last year to 10.1, it's more than 50% on that journey to get to that 12%. Thanks, Tom. So, from a 2H risk perspective, Dave, look, there is a lot of uncertainty out there with COVID and Delta variant and what happens. We are using the data we have today to build the best forecast we can. I think then from a sequential margin perspective, look I think the improvement from 7.7 to 10.1 is positive. Next year what can accelerate? We have an annual GRI, we can relook at our pricing. Our cost and productivity initiatives are taking further hold.  So we are going to continue to press and the journey on SMBs, that's been a great story. As we've been walking up, obviously in Q4 with peak, the mix of SMBs will be a little bit less and then the B2C enterprise customers. But, I would look for that journey to continue next year. Kevin and the team and Kate, they are doing a wonderful job of working with platform customers and SMBs to drive that.  So as that mix goes up, margin improves. So there are several levers. Carol, I don't know if you want to provide some color. Thanks, Dave."

            "name": "Carol Tomé",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Let me start by thanking all UPSers for their hard work and efforts. Our better not bigger framework is enabling consistently high service levels and producing improved financial results. Our team is truly moving our world forward by delivering what matters.  More specifically, we are winning in the most attractive parts of the markets with new capabilities like our fastest ground ever weekend initiatives and improvements in our customer experience journey. We are continuing to deliver lifesaving COVID-19 vaccine and our healthcare growth initiative is gaining momentum. We are also driving sustainable revenue per piece growth through targeted revenue quality strategies.  And lastly, we are driving productivity improvements in the network and implementing targeted transformational expense reductions. Our second quarter financial results across all segments were much better than we anticipated.  Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 14.5% from last year to $23.4 billion and operating profit grew 40.8% to $3.3 billion. As we expected, U.S. average daily volume for the quarter was down slightly from one year ago, driven primarily by tough comparisons due to the jump in ecommerce-related volume last year, but our revenue quality in the U.S. were much improved due to a change in customer mix, as well as our revenue quality strategies.  All of our business segments delivered record quarterly operating profits and expanded operating margin on a year-over-year basis. In the U.S., operating margin was 11.6%, our highest second quarter operating margin since 2017. In the International segment, operating profit increased 41.3% and operating margin reached a record 24.7%.  And in Supply Chain Solutions, continued strength in freight forwarding and healthcare drove operating margin of 9.7%, a record for the segment. While we closely monitor external factors like the tight labor markets and low inventory levels, the execution of our initiatives has put us well on our way to achieving the high end of our 2023 financial targets. Brian will share more details with you during his remarks.  Moving to our Customer First, people-led, innovation-driven strategy, we strive to provide our customers with the best digital experience powered by our global smart logistics network. Customer First is about creating a frictionless customer experience and building the capabilities that matter the most to our customers.  During the second quarter, Saturday Ground delivery volume grew 13% as we continued expanding our weekend coverage. This is an example of better not bigger as we are expanding service with very little capital spending.  We are currently half way through our efforts to expand our existing centers and turn on Saturday operations in more than 200 additional centers. By the end of October of this year, we will cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturdays, which will further extend our market-leading Saturday commercial delivery and pickup services and support our ongoing Sunday delivery services.  These improvements benefit all of our customers, large and small by enabling faster time in transit and expanding capacity. As we execute our strategy, our focus is on growing value share. We are changing the growth targets of the company and our no longer focus solely on volume growth.  Instead, we are creating new capabilities and leveraging our competitive advantages to grow revenue and profits from the most attractive parts of the markets like SMB, B2B, healthcare and international while at the same time, providing value and service to targeted large enterprise customers.  It's early days, but we believe our strategy is working. For example, in the U.S., we grew SMB average daily volume including platforms by 21.6% and we saw total U.S. revenue per piece increase by 13.4%. As you know, healthcare is one of our wildly important Customer First initiatives. In the second quarter, healthcare customer revenue on a global basis grew 19.8% and contributed to margin expansion in all three segments.  To grow in the healthcare sector, we are creating new capabilities like our recent launch of the UPS Cold Chain Solutions and we are deploying sophisticated solutions that customers want into new geographies like the expansion of the UPS Premier to Canada and Europe. These actions are advancing our leadership position in the global healthcare logistics markets.  To support growth in our International segment, we continue to invest broadly including the launch of our first ever daily flight from Osaka to Shenzen, thus significantly speeding up our time in transit across multiple trade lines. We are also improving the customer experience across 16 journeys to make them simpler and more helpful.  One of the customer pain points we are addressing is claims. We recently completed a successful pilot that shortened the average claim processing time from 20 days to five. The improvements we made resulted in a 1.9% reduction in churn among pilot participants. We are rolling out our new claims process to all U.S. SMB customers over the next twelve months.  To put this into perspective, every 1 percentage point reduction in U.S. SMB churn is worth about $170 million in annual revenue.  Moving to the People Led component of our strategy, our focus here is to make UPS a great place to work. So that our people feel confident recommending UPS to others. During the second quarter, our executive leadership team spent many days in our operations around the world, delivery packages, walking our facilities, and talking with our people.  When we did that, we don't take a list, we bring back a list of the actions we can take to simplify our processes, drive productivity and improve the quality of the work environment for our people. I cannot say enough about the commitment of UPSers who over the last year rose to meet the challenges of elevated volume, while ensuring great service to our customers day in and day out.  I'd like to recognize our 38,000 part-time management employees in the U.S. that work primarily in our pre-load, hub, sort and air operations. In appreciation of their extraordinary efforts, we provided them with a one-time financial award in the second quarter. People Led builds on a strong foundation and we will continue living our values, modernizing our policies, and rewarding our people to make UPS an even better place to work and employer of choice.  Turning to Innovation-Driven. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation is generating significant levels of free cash flow. In fact, in the first six months of this year, we generated $6.8 billion in free cash flow. This is a record. We've generated more free cash flow in the first six months of this year than we previously generated in any full year at any time in our company's history.  Also in the second quarter, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight, a capital-intensive, low-returning part of our business. This with other actions has greatly improved our financial condition from one year ago as Brian will detail. And looking ahead, we expect to see a significant increase in our return on invested capital this year.  Innovation-Driven will also help us to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. In August, we will publish our annual sustainability report, which include our 19th GRI Content Index, along with our second Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB reports and our first Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures or TCFD report.  Social and environmental stewardship goes right to our core values and we remain committed to providing investors transparency through our expanded ESG disclosures.  Next month, UPS will celebrate our 114th anniversary. It is such an honor for me to guide this company to our next chapter. We are a purpose-driven company and we are investing in the capabilities that matter most to our customers to create value for our shareowners.  Thank you. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nScott Childress: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2020 Form 10-K and other reports we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.  For the first quarter of 2021, GAAP results include a net benefit of $2.4 billion, or $2.70 per diluted share, comprised of an after-tax mark-to-market pension benefit of $2.5 billion and an after-tax transformation and other charges of $140 million. The mark-to-market pension benefit was primarily driven by the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act, the resulting elimination of our balance sheet liability related to the Central States Pension Fund, as well as the remeasurement of the UPS IBT Pension plan at the current discount rate. Together, these reduced our pension liability by $6.4 billion. Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude the mark-to-market pension benefit and transformation and other charges. The webcast of today's call along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining via the teleconference. If you wish to ask a question, press one then zero on your phone to enter the queue. Please ask only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now, I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. We are now more than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove enormous change to how we all live and conduct business. I want to thank our more than 540,000 UPSers for continuing to deliver what matters and for serving our customers, communities, and each other. Looking at the first quarter, our results exceeded our expectations driven by an improving macro environment and great execution by our team. Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 27% from last year to $22.9 billion and operating profit grew 164% to $2.9 billion. All of our business segments delivered strong performance in the first quarter. We reported record profits and a double digit operating margin in our U.S. Domestic segment, record first quarter profit in our International segment and record operating profit and operating margin in Supply Chain and Freight. As shown in our results, our team is advancing our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy under the better not bigger framework. As we've discussed, Customer First is about building capabilities that matter the most to our customers and using those capabilities to capture the best opportunities in the market like small and medium sized businesses and healthcare. In the U.S., the improvements we made last year and continue to make this year to speed up our ground network, enhance our Digital Access Program known as DAP and expand weekend operations while these are taking hold. In fact, during the first quarter, we added nearly 150,000 new DAP accounts, and we are well on our way to hitting our $1 billion DAP revenue target by the end of this year. Further in the U.S., total average daily volume growth for SMBs, including our platform businesses, reached an all-time high of 35.6%, outpacing the growth rate of our larger customers for the third consecutive quarter. This mix improvement and certain other revenue quality actions are delivering results with U.S. Domestic revenue per piece up 10.2% in the first quarter. Looking at our International segment, we were able to meet elevated customer demand by leveraging the agility of our network. Export volume grew double digits in all regions, commercial volume increased 10.1% and SMB average daily volume was up 23% in the first quarter. And we see even more opportunity moving ahead as we expand DAP and other solutions to key international markets. During the quarter, our Supply Chain and Freight segment responded well to market demands. We are on track to complete the divestiture of our UPS Freight business by the end of this month and we look forward to our new commercial relationship with TFI. Our focus on the customer includes improving the end-to-end experience, in other words, improving the experience from the shipper to the receiver as both our customers. We've identified a number of customer journeys and candidly pain points that we are addressing. Let me give you an example. Until recently, paying a UPS bill online was a poor customer experience. So we replaced our old homegrown system with a new SaaS application, which we began deploying globally in the first quarter. Once fully implemented, our industry leading billing solution will make it easy for nearly $2 million global customers to pay and manage their UPS bills. This will be particularly helpful for our SMB customers. Our Customer First aspiration is to provide the best digital experience powered by our smart global logistics network. A simplified billing experience is one aspect of this aspiration. Another is the digitization that's occurring within our Supply Chain and Freight segment. We are moving from telephone based quotes to online quoting. This new digital experience is driving simplification across the entire value chain. We'll talk more about our efforts to improve our customers' experiences during our June Investor and Analyst Day. We know that our customers place high value on the reliability of the UPS network. That's why we led the market by reinstating our service guarantees for U.S. Next Day Air services and Worldwide Express services for all origins and destinations. We intend to be the carrier that shippers and receivers can count on for reliable delivery. And as it relates to COVID-19 vaccine, our global expertise, technology and network are enabling us to move vaccines, kits and dry ice over great distances around the world. As of last week, we've delivered more than 1.1 million shipments, about 196 million vaccine doses to about 50 countries and territories and utilized our UPS premiere service to achieve 99.9% on time delivery. The combination of our efforts to remove friction and the customer experience provide the digital capabilities that matter most and deliver industry leading service levels are positioning us for future growth. Further, as we've discussed, market demand is outpacing industry supply, and we expect this dynamic to continue for the foreseeable future. GDP forecasts are being revived higher, economies are reopening and U.S. consumer spending is being boosted by government stimulus programs. This demand supply imbalance creates an environment where pricing in the industry should remain firm. Brian will cover more of our economic outlook in his remarks. People Led is an important part of our strategy. Our success in the first quarter was due to the commitment of our people and the strength of our culture. Every UPSer has a role to play in supporting our customers. We've hired a lot of new UPSers. So we know we need to focus on employee safety and training. In the U.S., we have re-imagined our driver's safety program by truly taking it on the road. We've created mobile units that can be rapidly deployed across the country. These units provide classroom training and a learning lab within movable trailers. Our mobile training along with other vehicle safety technologies, are making a difference. So far this year we've improved auto accident frequency by 2.1% globally and we will continue to advance our employee safety programs around the world. Moving to Innovation Driven. Over the past several years we have invested in automation, introduced new technology and opened new facilities. We are now starting to reap productivity benefits from these investments. The additional flexibility we've gained in the network enables us to be more responsive to changes in demand and be more efficient. In fact, in the first quarter compared to last year productivity improved in nearly all major operating categories, but we have more to do. We aim to make productivity a virtuous cycle, not just a transformation project. We are laser focused on operational excellence, and we'll share more details about our efforts here during our conference. Let me take a moment to touch on one of our five core principles, which is maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit rating. We have made great strides in this area by reducing financial leverage and improving the share owner's equity. Brian will share the details on this in a moment. Our strategy is gaining traction and we see even more opportunities ahead. We look forward to sharing the details with you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover four areas starting with macro economic trends, then our first quarter results, next I'll review cash and share on a returns, and lastly I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook and the new pension reform law. Okay, let's start with the macro and how it is projected to unfold. Global GDP in the first quarter is expected to finish up 3.5% and U.S. GDP is expected to be up 0.2%. Both have shown significant improvement over the fourth quarter of 2020. Key economic indicators continue to support a strong recovery in 2021. Forecasts are moving higher based on three factors. First is the progress with the global vaccine rollout. Second is a low U.S. inventory to sales ratio, which ran between 1.4 and 1.5 for the three years prior to COVID, and is currently down about 18% from historic averages, at a time when a number of economies are starting to reopen. And third is the passage of the most recent U.S. government stimulus. According to IHS for the full year global GDP is now expected to grow 5.3% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 6.2%. In the U.S. full year nominal retail sales are anticipated to grow 11.7% and electronic sales and mail orders, the proxy we use for online sales are expected to be up 12.7% following growth of 24.7% in 2020. The outlook for the commercial side of the U.S. economy is also encouraging. Full year industrial production is forecasted to grow 6.5% on a year-over-year basis. We view these projections as favorable for our company and expect the imbalance between market demand and industry capacity to continue as Carol mentioned. Moving to our first quarter performance; consolidated revenue increased 27% to $22.9 billion. Operating profit total $2.9 billion, 164% higher than last year; consolidated operating margin expanded 12.9%, which is our best consolidated margin in 18 quarters and diluted earnings per share was up $2.77, up 141% from the same period last year. Now let's take a look at the segments. In U.S. domestic, our success was due to a combination of our revenue quality initiatives and the impact of our productivity efforts running the network. Average daily volume increased 12.8% year-over-year to a total of 20.4 million packages per day. Additionally, mix continued to be positive. SMB volume growth including platforms accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter reaching 35.6% and accounted for 63% of our total average daily volume increase. Both SMBs and our larger customers grew residential shipments across air and ground products. Overall B2C shipments increased 23.8% year-over-year. Conversely, B2B average daily volume declined 0.6% year-over-year. Healthcare and automotive remain bright spots and delivered mid-single-digit B2B growth, yet they were unable to offset weakness in other commercial segments. Total B2B volume strengthened late in the quarter with March turning positive. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $14 billion, up 22.3% driven by average daily volume growth and improvements in revenue per piece. We were extremely pleased with our revenue quality efforts, which were driven by strong SMB average daily volume growth and demand-related surcharges. As a result of our actions, reported revenue per piece grew 10.2% year-over-year with ground revenue per piece up 12.5%. Turning to costs; expenses were up 13.5%. Cost per piece rose 2.2%, driven primarily by two factors: our fastest ground ever and weekend initiatives and planned benefit expense increases. Nando and his team did an outstanding job transitioning the network from fourth quarter peak back into non-peak operations. This enabled us to control unnecessary costs and make productivity improvements across the network. And building on Carol's comments about reducing accident frequency, our efforts to prevent incidents through additional safety training, technology and analytics enabled lower-than-expected casualty self-insurance costs in the first quarter. Most notably in the quarter, revenue growth was significantly above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage. So in summary, the U.S. domestic segment delivered $1.5 billion in operating profit, an increase of $1.1 billion or 265% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded to 10.4%. Moving over to International; the results were excellent, and our performance demonstrates the flexibility of our network to match global air capacity with demand. Volume growth was very strong, with total average daily volume up 23.1%. We saw growth across customer segments with both larger customers and SMBs growing over 20%. To support outbound Asia demand, we added 25% more flights and even more in terms of capacity because of our 747-8 capabilities. Asia export volume was up 43%, Europe exports were up 27.7%, and overall total exports grew 26.2% on a year-over-year basis. B2C average daily volume grew 77.6%, while B2B was up 10.1% driven by the retail, high-tech and automotive sectors. For the quarter, International revenue was up 36.2% to $4.6 billion, with all regions growing revenue over 20%. We generated strong operating leverage in the quarter with revenue per piece of 12.3% and cost per piece up 2.7% year-over-year. For the first quarter, International delivered operating of $1.1 billion, an increase of 95.5% and operating margin expanded to 23.7%. Looking at Supply Chain & Freight; revenue increased 34.3% to $4.3 billion, and the segment generated record profit and operating margin. Market demand was elevated and nearly all business units had revenue and profit growth. Forwarding led the way, driven by strong growth on the outbound Asia lane for both air and ocean. And health care activities delivered the highest top and bottom-line growth ever. Growth was broad-based from biopharma and biologics as well as implantable medical device and lab customers, all while providing near perfect service during the quarter for COVID-19 vaccine deliveries. In the first quarter, Supply Chain & Freight generated operating profit of $395 million and operating margin was 9.2%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $313 million, and lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 21.6% due to discrete items. Now let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. Our focus on bottom line results drove strong cash flow in the quarter. We generated $4.5 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $3.7 billion, a 130% increase year-over-year. And lastly, so far this year, UPS has distributed $938 million in dividends. Moving to our outlook for 2021. We recognize there is still uncertainty ahead related to the pandemic and other factors that could interrupt the recovery, so we are not providing revenue or diluted earnings per share guidance at this time. As Carol mentioned, we expect the sale of UPS Freight to close during the second quarter, and today, we are reaffirming our capital allocation plans. To that end, we still expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion. We have no plans to repurchase shares at this time, and our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be around 23.5%. We repaid $1.5 billion of long-term debt maturities in the first quarter and in early April we repaid another $1 billion in debt, achieving our 2021 target of $2.5 billion in debt repayment. And lastly, on March 11, the American Rescue Plan Act was signed into law. This law protects certain multiemployer pension plans from becoming insolvent through 2051. And, in turn, eliminates our balance sheet liability for potential coordinating benefits related to the Central States Pension Fund. The passage of the law triggered us to remeasure the UPS IBT Pension plan at current discount rates, which have significantly increased since year-end. The result was a $6.4 billion reduction in our pension liability. Additional information is available in the Appendix section of today's earnings presentation. As Carol mentioned, a strong balance sheet is a core UPS principle, and we are absolutely moving in a positive direction. The reduction in pension liability and debt repayments have reduced our long-term obligations by $7.9 billion. Combined with our improving business performance, our leverage ratios have significantly improved. In closing, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy and look forward to sharing more with you at our June 9 Investor and Analyst Day. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shankar: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Carol looking ahead to the June 9th Analyst Day. Can you share a little more color on how transformation 3.0 is going? Kind of what are some of the categories and buckets that you've outlined there? And if the – the cost savings part of that program can get up to the kind of 8% of the cost base that you saw in the transformation 2.0? Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Thanks, Ravi, for your question. We're looking forward to the June Investor and Analyst Day, where we will give you much more color on our forward-looking outlook including what we're doing from a productivity perspective. As we think about productivity, we really want to move away from an event, in other words, a transformation event to actually a virtuous cycle. And we're starting that as you see in our results from the first quarter. If you look at our operating performance, we drove productivity in nearly every operating category. And when I think about productivity in the business, it's really about packages per hour. We had improvement in packages per hour in our sort, in our theater, in our hub operations. We saw productivity in our delivery. Our route density improved year-on-year, driven in large part by our ORION technology. So we're going to give you a lot more color as to what we're doing to drive productivity in the business at our Investor Day. One more comment on productivity and that relates to non-operations. What you refer to that Brian? It's transformation 2.0. And at the beginning of the year, we told you we were taking out $500 million of expense in our non-operations area. We're well down the path in that regard. We are on plan and we believe we will deliver that result by the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAllison Landry: Good morning. Thanks. Just in terms of domestic margins if I sort of applied normal sequential trends to the Q1 10.4 for the balance of the year, so Q2 to Q4 seems to imply a full year segment margin in the 11.5% range. So curious, I mean, is that the right way to think about it? And if not, what are some of the potential costs or mix headwinds that might be a sequential drag during the remaining quarters of the year? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Hi, Allison. It's Brian. I'll take that. So the one caveat to your question is I would be careful about applying a history to the future. And the reason I say that is that historically we've taken quite a bit of time to get the peak costs from November, December out of the domestic business. Nando in the U.S. operating team did a very good job this year, planning for it and pulling those costs out quite quickly. So the CPP growth was only 2% and RPP was over 10%. So, you had an eight point spread. We're confident the domestic margin is expanding this year. I would just be careful about extrapolating history to the future.\nAllison Landry: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Allison.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Hi, thanks. Good morning. Maybe I could pick up on that last point, Brian, so CPP plus 2%. I guess productivity is going into that. You obviously did a really good job with cost controls as well. How sustainable is that level of cost per piece increase going forward? Obviously, we understand what's going on with the pricing environment, but with volume decelerating, are you going to be able to maintain that level of cost control?\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Chris. Look the – taking out of the temporary labor, the rentals, which we returned on an accelerated basis, those were a lot of the reasons. Chris, we were able to do to limit the growth of CPP to 2%. As Carol mentioned, there is a lot that goes into our costs. It’s a combination of non-op and operating. We’re going to continue to drive leverage throughout the system. Is 2% the number going forward? We’re going to have more of a conversation about that in June. So I won’t talk as much about the future, but we were pleased with the performance in the quarter and confident in our ability to continue operating leverage going forward.\nChris Wetherbee: All right. Thanks.\nBrian Newman: All right, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead, sir.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning, just another question for you on Domestic margin. I think that's been a key point of debate. And obviously, you gave us a lot of good news to work with in the first quarter results. How do you think about what the most important year-over-year drivers were for that improvement? So B2B, I guess, was flat, but that's better than you’ve seen. Pricing was strong. I think you got some of the cost takeout from the $500 million program. But what do you think was most important year-over-year? And how do you think about the key drivers, whether you're kind of early in those or whether you're just kind of how much runway you have left on those key drivers of domestic improvement? Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Well, maybe I’ll start, Brian, and then turn it over to you. You've heard us talk about our better, not bigger framework. And that's really about optimizing the network. And you saw that take hold in the first quarter with over 63% of our average daily volume growth in the United States driven by small and medium-sized businesses. That was a large contributor to the growth in RPP in the quarter. And when you have a 10% growth in RPP, well, you’re going to leverage the bottom line, and we did just that. So optimizing the network and leaning in to those opportunities of growth that – candidly the revenue quality is better for us, our customers like the offering, the end-to-end network that we present to them, that’s really laying the future for our growth going forward. Coupled with health care, those two growth opportunities are a winning combination. We saw the same opportunity outside the United States too, with great SMB growth, 23% in our International business. So optimizing the network, leaning in to those areas of growth that are most attractive to us and winning in those areas certainly was a big part of the value equation, and it will be a big part of the value equation going forward, but you have to have productivity as well. We want productivity to be a virtuous cycle here. Every day, we should run a better business. And that’s what we’re doing from a cost out perspective. You might just talk about casualty and the real impact that casualty had in the quarter.\nBrian Newman: Yes, Tom, so we saw a benefit in casualty. It was about $90 million relative to prior year. And we’re really focused on the accident. Some of that was lapping at some Tier 3 accidents last Q1. But as Carol mentioned, we’re leveraging technology, telematics, to go after the auto frequency and severity challenge that has been in the industry. Additionally, workers’ comp, that’s the other piece that goes into casualty. That’s driven by systemic turnover and training and the teams are really going about our arduous effort to attack that. So those trends don’t turn overnight, but we’re seeing some demonstrated improvement.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Just on productivity, what was the net productivity number in domestic relative to the $500 million of non-operating savings? And then just, Carol, on the SMB point, I think, SMB growth is just so key to the revenue quality initiatives that you and UPS have. You’ve obviously invested a lot in time in transit, fastest ground ever. Just in that context, how do you see the service products stacking up versus your main competitor after these investments in Fastest Ground Ever? And wondering if you just see the need to further invest in something like direct Sunday delivery outside of the USPS postal injection and what kind of cost or fixed cost absorption issues that has if you decide to go that route? Pun intended, I guess.\nCarol Tomé: Yes. So I’ll take the latter part of the question. So our customers are responding to the investments that we made last year to speed up our time in transit, but there is no finish line here. So we continue to invest in time in transit. We are expanding our weekend deliveries. Our Saturday coverage will increase to 90% of the U.S. population by October and we’ll go through the details of this at our June Investor Day. But to let you know what we’re doing, because we’re increasing our weekend delivery because our customers are demanding that. We love our SurePost product. SurePost was about 36% of the ADB growth in the first quarter. But the cool thing about SurePost is that 41% of that product was redirected back into the UPS network, which allows us to get delivery density. So that’s a great way to think about how we can grow Sunday. So we’ll be expanding our Sunday deliveries as well. We don’t have enough time this morning, but we really look forward to the June Investor Conference, because we’re going to talk to you about how by expanding our network across seven days we can actually eliminate some of the lumpiness in the network in the middle of the week. And the lumpiness in the network in the middle of the week is causing some of the productivity deleverage that we see in our business. And if we can flatten out the demand, we can really get some great productivity. So we’ll walk you through that algorithm at our June Investor Day.\nBrian Newman: And on the topic of cost takeout, we spent roughly $6 billion in non-op we committed in 2021 and take $500 million out. That’s a start. There will be more next year. In the first quarter, we took $80 million of the $500 million out, which is exactly on our plan. So we’re tracking to deliver that $500 million associated. The big driver of that was about 1,700 headcount that have participated in the VSSP, the voluntary severance separation program. So we’re on-track and committed to the $500 million.\nCarol Tomé: And the cool thing about leveraging the seven-day network is that it’s capital-light, isn’t it?\nBrian Newman: Yes.\nCarol Tomé: Yes, we’ll put some expense into the network. We’ll have to have some more drivers. We’ll have to have some more operators, some more package cards, but it’s pretty capital-light, I like that.\nBrian Newman: Different type of investment.\nCarol Tomé: Yes, it’s different. It’s like a different line item on the income statement…\nBrian Newman: That's right.\nCarol Tomé: …rather than a depreciation expense coming off of capital. It’s on the operations expense and we can lever that all day long to get the right revenue quality.\nAmit Mehrotra: Love it. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the good quarter. Appreciate it.\nBrian Newman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Good morning. Just want to touch on International, clearly benefiting from the macro. But would you expand a bit more on the internal efforts to grab more of that white space in the International markets? I think you called out SMB specifically in International, maybe early days. But trying to understand how you think of those internal initiatives evolving through the year in International. Any thoughts there?\nCarol Tomé: Yes. We’re just scratching the surface on what we could do from a growth perspective without putting a lot of capital into the International business by creating what we have in the United States, which is the Digital Access Platform. We’re very excited about introducing that into our International businesses. We really aren’t there today. But our customers in the U.S. want to sell through this platform outside the United States. So we’ll be investing that in a major big way. And there are a number of other efforts underway, Allison. But I hate to keep kicking the can down to June, but we’re going to have Scott talk about all this at the June Investor Conference. So hold type for a little bit, and we’ll give you more color.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hi, thanks. Morning. So I want to ask about some of the revenue drivers. So the volume just gets so funky going forward. Maybe can you give us some thoughts on April B2C and B2B volume trends? And how are you thinking about overall volumes in the second quarter, U.S. and International? And then just with that, right, the B2B, B2C mix should be meaningfully positive, you would think, going forward. So does that drive the RPP growth even higher on a year-over-year basis going forward? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Scott. So I’ll take it. From a trend perspective, April is off to a good start. And your point about B2C and B2B, we’re comping down 22% last year in the second quarter in terms of B2B. So we would expect the commercial side of the business to come back. In the first quarter it was still down 0.6% in the U.S., but in the month of March it was actually up 8%. So there were signs of life that it was coming back domestically. Internationally, we actually posted plus 10% on the B2B side in the first quarter. So as we think about the next quarter, the comps in the U.S. down 22%, give us reason to believe that the commercial side will come back and obviously our density in our commercial side of the business is more attractive than the residential side, so that'll be another positive.\nCarol Tomé: And as you build your model, I think it's just important, given the year-over-year comparisons and the funkiness of the volume, just expect revenue to grow faster than volumes.\nScott Group: But do you have any color; are B2C volumes, up, down, overall volumes up, down? Any color you can give us would be great.\nCarol Tomé: B2C volumes are up.\nBrian Newman: They are. Yes.\nScott Group: Great. Thank you, guys.\nBrian Newman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hi, great. Congrats and good morning. So just maybe a little bit on that future growth. I guess, just to clarify that last comment there, Carol. So you're still expecting positive growth against – despite the up 25% kind of – or double-digit growth in Ground and Export for the rest of the year? Just to clarify that last point. And then focusing on International a bit. Maybe your thoughts, are you starting to see Europe rebound at all given the lockdowns? Or is that more still just B2C still growing there because of the lockdowns and not yet seeing that B2B rebound?\nBrian Newman: So Ken, maybe I'll take the first part and Carol can handle the second. From a growth perspective, just picking up on the last comment, yes, we expect positive growth, maybe not the 14% ADB we saw in the first quarter, but certainly positive growth.\nCarol Tomé: And on the International side, as we talked about, our Export business was up in all geographies outside of the United States. As it relates to Europe itself, we had outstanding export volume in the 20%. And our European business is the biggest part of our export business, making up over 60% of our Export business. So Europe really matters to our International performance. I might just comment on the U.K., it's really interesting what we're seeing in the U.K. Our Domestic U.K. business is quite strong. Our Export business out of the U.K. is great, export outside of the intercontinent. But there's been some Brexit disruption, candidly, that we’ve had to work through. We're not alone. Everybody has tried to work through the Brexit disruption, U.K. to the intercontinent.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to go back to productivity for a second. I know, last quarter, you mentioned delivery density was a bit of a headwind. Clearly, the mix is starting to improve. This is a hard metric to really turn the corner on. It sounds like a lot of other things are moving positive. So do you expect you can improve stop density – residential stop density independent of mix? Or is that something that you think mix is just going to take care of it, and it's less about what you can do and more about what type of business that you have? Any thoughts on that would be appreciated.\nCarol Tomé: Sure. If we look at delivery density for the quarter, it was down slightly year-on-year, but improved from both the third and fourth quarter of last year. So the sequential trends are good. Clearly, that's a part of the mix change. But we don't want to just rely on the mix change to improve delivery density. We want to be in control of our density or destiny I should say. And so we've got a number of pilots underway to see if we can improve delivery density, and we'll touch upon some of those pilots at our June Investor Day.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. Look forward to it, then. Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, hi. I know you guys have talked about it, I think you mentioned surcharges are still in place. Mix is helping all that stuff in profitability. Can you maybe discuss a little bit the core price aspect, which I think is part of the revenue quality? And I'm sure you'll touch on it on the Analyst Day, but where are you on the contract renegotiation process? And how far through, how much room do you have? Is it going as expected? Thanks.\nCarol Tomé: So as a matter, of course, we have a number of longer-term contracts that come up for renewal every year. And when those contracts come up for renewals, we negotiate through those. And our team, Kate and team have done a masterful job of managing through that, those contract renewals in this very challenging demand environment.\nJordan Alliger: So would you – is there a certain time frame in terms of runway? Is it like a two, three-year process of going through the contracts? And any ideas around that?\nCarol Tomé: It never ends. I mean, every year, there are a number of contracts that come up for renewal because we have staggered maturities. So I think this is a virtuous cycle as well.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Carol, could you please elaborate a little bit on the vaccine distribution? It sounds like there's a lot of momentum going International. Just curious about the profitability characteristics of the program and the magnitude? Thanks.\nCarol Tomé: Well, I don't think it's appropriate for me to talk about the profitability of a product, but we can talk broadly about our health care business, which includes vaccines. And our health care business is very nutritive to the overall business. As Brian commented, we had the best top line and bottom-line performance ever. We do make money on vaccines, as you can appreciate, principally because of the value-added attributes to the vaccines. UPS Premier is a special label that goes on top of the package. The label has a battery inside. So we can track that package wherever it is throughout our network. We stood up a command center to watch that package wherever it is throughout the network. And these are precious vaccines, and we want to make sure they get to their dosing sites on time and we’re able to do that with 99.9% on-time delivery. So clearly, there’s a value add and value is defined by what the customers are willing to pay for. So hopefully, that helps you understand the profitability of that segment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thank you for the time, everybody. Just a couple of questions on pension. Brian, does this – the changes mean that the yellow and reds on your – on the pension plan all go to green now? And I think at the end of the year, you were 80% funded for 2020. What is the change due to your pension contributions for 2021? And does that bring you into fully funded status?\nBrian Newman: So, yes, most of our measures go into green. The benefit we saw was a combination, Helane of the Central State reversal liability for $5.5 billion. We also had to remeasure the IBT plan at the end of the quarter. That combined with the asset returns was close to another $1 billion, $900 million. So that's the $6.4 billion. So that's a reduction in liabilities for us. The funded status, the IBT plan, will actually be funded at 100%. So that's a positive. And going forward, from a P&L perspective, the P&L benefit aside from the asset base, we'll see about a $50 million reduced service cost on a quarterly basis going forward. So it has both a liability balance sheet impact as well as a P&L benefit. And as far as funded status, we update that when we remeasure based on discount rates. So that moves up and moves down, but clearly, the liability was favorable for us.\nCarol Tomé: I think, Brian, its [indiscernible] 80% number, the relative number is 90% for all the pension plan.\nBrian Newman: For all pension plans. Obviously, I was talking IBT specific, yes. Yes. So we're still close to 90%, Helane, across all three pension plans.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.\nBrian Newman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my question. So, Brian, I don't want to steal your thunder for the June analyst meeting, but we do have a call here. So can you talk about capital priorities going ahead, especially with these changes on the pension side? You guys do have a lot of cash here, and you explicitly said no share repurchases as of now. So can you talk through like the thought process going forward?\nBrian Newman: Yes, happy to Brandon. So our thought process hasn't changed from a principal perspective. The first allocation of capital will be into the business. Obviously, with the type of returns, the improving domestic business and the growth in international supply chain and health care, we’re going to continue to invest in those businesses. And investments will not just take the form of CapEx. There are new investments in SaaS and capabilities that we're putting in from an OpEx perspective. So we'll do that. We're committed to the dividend. We'll have a capital discussion in the June conference. So I don't want to front run that discussion. And then obviously, improving the flexibility of the balance sheet, which we're making good strides on. And that share repo, we don’t have any plans to repurchase shares currently. But as Carol said on the last call, we'll continue to look and evaluate that going forward.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jairam Nathan of Daiwa. Please go ahead.\nJairam Nathan: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to understand your thinking with regard to some new last mile competition with companies like Uber, DoorDash and the others. So do you see yourself, UPS and the industry, coexist and use the last mile competition as some second to USPS here, especially we have noticed these companies have been pretty aggressive on the price side and last to enter these markets. So I just wanted to kind of understand the thought process here?\nCarol Tomé: Yes. Long gone are the days when we describe our competitive set as those headquartered in Memphis and those headquartered in Washington, D.C. or those headquartered on the West Coast. And there are lots of players that are coming into the supply chain. And everybody wants a little piece of the pie. And our job is to keep them out of the pie that we want to eat, and we are doing that by investing in the capabilities that the customers matter most. And again, without – I'm sorry to be wasting your time, hopefully not today, but we're going to kick the can down the road one more time because we're going to talk to you about the enabling capabilities that we are investing in at our June Investor Conference to continue to offer the services that matter most to the customers that we want to serve.\nJairam Nathan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have a follow-up from the line of Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTodd Fowler: Hey. Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It sounds like that SMB and health care were really big contributors to the growth within U.S. Domestic this quarter. Can you talk about the opportunity – the longer-term opportunity, kind of where you're at in your progress with those initiatives? And then how do we think about the balance between some of your existing legacy accounts in that business as you focus on growth with SMB and healthcare? Thanks.\nCarol Tomé: Our focus on SMB and health care does not take away our desire to grow our large enterprise accounts, which are many large retailers. And if I look at those large enterprise accounts, which we very much appreciate the relationship we have with those customers, they were very growthy. In the first quarter, they grew mid-teens. So that's very growthy compared to what we were up against. So we will continue to invest in that experience as well. But we're really looking at an end-to-end experience and have discovered 16 customer journeys, where we can – based on customer feedback, where we can make improvements; and based on those improvements, get stickiness with those customers. And those customer journeys are as true for our SMB customers as they are for our enterprise customers. And we'll talk more about that at our June Investor Day.\nTodd Fowler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have a follow-up from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Hey. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just related to that SMB. I think, Carol, a few quarters ago, you talked about what percentage of your Domestic business was SMB, I think it was maybe 25%. Wondering if you can update us on that. Obviously, it's growing a lot, but off a smaller base. And maybe – I don’t know if you're willing to do this, but just update us on what Amazon is as a percentage of revenue, because, obviously, SMB is growing faster than your enterprise customers of the Amazon to your largest. And given that's a big topic of discussion, I'm wondering if you could discuss that a little bit?\nCarol Tomé: Well, I'll tell you the SMB as a percent of total is 27%. So we've shown a nice increase in penetration there. We're delighted with that. And we disclose Amazon at the end of every year, so I think we'll just wait to do that.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nScott Childress: Stephen, before we go, we've got time for probably one more question this morning.\nOperator: Alrighty. Our final question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Question is about the commercial side of the house. Are you rethinking the approach on better not bigger based on your success in growing volume to date at a decent degree of operating leverage? And could you comment on whether you're starting to see any customer churn as a result of pricing and revenue quality initiatives?\nCarol Tomé: So we love our commercial business, and we're delighted to see it coming back. When we think about the segments that we serve from a commercial perspective, the largest segment is retail. And as retailers start to open their stores, we expect that to come back in a meaningful way, and that would be a great business for us. So we look forward to the economy continuing to recover and our commercial business coming back as well.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. I'd like to turn the floor back over to our host, Mr. Scott Childress, for any closing remarks, please.\nScott Childress: Thank you, Stephen. This concludes our call, and we want to thank everyone for joining us and hope that you have a great day. Thank you.",

            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol and good morning. In my comments today, I will cover four areas starting with macro economic trends, then our first quarter results, next I'll review cash and share on a returns, and lastly I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook and the new pension reform law. Okay, let's start with the macro and how it is projected to unfold. Global GDP in the first quarter is expected to finish up 3.5% and U.S. GDP is expected to be up 0.2%. Both have shown significant improvement over the fourth quarter of 2020. Key economic indicators continue to support a strong recovery in 2021. Forecasts are moving higher based on three factors. First is the progress with the global vaccine rollout. Second is a low U.S. inventory to sales ratio, which ran between 1.4 and 1.5 for the three years prior to COVID, and is currently down about 18% from historic averages, at a time when a number of economies are starting to reopen. And third is the passage of the most recent U.S. government stimulus. According to IHS for the full year global GDP is now expected to grow 5.3% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 6.2%. In the U.S. full year nominal retail sales are anticipated to grow 11.7% and electronic sales and mail orders, the proxy we use for online sales are expected to be up 12.7% following growth of 24.7% in 2020. The outlook for the commercial side of the U.S. economy is also encouraging. Full year industrial production is forecasted to grow 6.5% on a year-over-year basis. We view these projections as favorable for our company and expect the imbalance between market demand and industry capacity to continue as Carol mentioned. Moving to our first quarter performance; consolidated revenue increased 27% to $22.9 billion. Operating profit total $2.9 billion, 164% higher than last year; consolidated operating margin expanded 12.9%, which is our best consolidated margin in 18 quarters and diluted earnings per share was up $2.77, up 141% from the same period last year. Now let's take a look at the segments. In U.S. domestic, our success was due to a combination of our revenue quality initiatives and the impact of our productivity efforts running the network. Average daily volume increased 12.8% year-over-year to a total of 20.4 million packages per day. Additionally, mix continued to be positive. SMB volume growth including platforms accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter reaching 35.6% and accounted for 63% of our total average daily volume increase. Both SMBs and our larger customers grew residential shipments across air and ground products. Overall B2C shipments increased 23.8% year-over-year. Conversely, B2B average daily volume declined 0.6% year-over-year. Healthcare and automotive remain bright spots and delivered mid-single-digit B2B growth, yet they were unable to offset weakness in other commercial segments. Total B2B volume strengthened late in the quarter with March turning positive. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $14 billion, up 22.3% driven by average daily volume growth and improvements in revenue per piece. We were extremely pleased with our revenue quality efforts, which were driven by strong SMB average daily volume growth and demand-related surcharges. As a result of our actions, reported revenue per piece grew 10.2% year-over-year with ground revenue per piece up 12.5%. Turning to costs; expenses were up 13.5%. Cost per piece rose 2.2%, driven primarily by two factors: our fastest ground ever and weekend initiatives and planned benefit expense increases. Nando and his team did an outstanding job transitioning the network from fourth quarter peak back into non-peak operations. This enabled us to control unnecessary costs and make productivity improvements across the network. And building on Carol's comments about reducing accident frequency, our efforts to prevent incidents through additional safety training, technology and analytics enabled lower-than-expected casualty self-insurance costs in the first quarter. Most notably in the quarter, revenue growth was significantly above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage. So in summary, the U.S. domestic segment delivered $1.5 billion in operating profit, an increase of $1.1 billion or 265% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded to 10.4%. Moving over to International; the results were excellent, and our performance demonstrates the flexibility of our network to match global air capacity with demand. Volume growth was very strong, with total average daily volume up 23.1%. We saw growth across customer segments with both larger customers and SMBs growing over 20%. To support outbound Asia demand, we added 25% more flights and even more in terms of capacity because of our 747-8 capabilities. Asia export volume was up 43%, Europe exports were up 27.7%, and overall total exports grew 26.2% on a year-over-year basis. B2C average daily volume grew 77.6%, while B2B was up 10.1% driven by the retail, high-tech and automotive sectors. For the quarter, International revenue was up 36.2% to $4.6 billion, with all regions growing revenue over 20%. We generated strong operating leverage in the quarter with revenue per piece of 12.3% and cost per piece up 2.7% year-over-year. For the first quarter, International delivered operating of $1.1 billion, an increase of 95.5% and operating margin expanded to 23.7%. Looking at Supply Chain & Freight; revenue increased 34.3% to $4.3 billion, and the segment generated record profit and operating margin. Market demand was elevated and nearly all business units had revenue and profit growth. Forwarding led the way, driven by strong growth on the outbound Asia lane for both air and ocean. And health care activities delivered the highest top and bottom-line growth ever. Growth was broad-based from biopharma and biologics as well as implantable medical device and lab customers, all while providing near perfect service during the quarter for COVID-19 vaccine deliveries. In the first quarter, Supply Chain & Freight generated operating profit of $395 million and operating margin was 9.2%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $313 million, and lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 21.6% due to discrete items. Now let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. Our focus on bottom line results drove strong cash flow in the quarter. We generated $4.5 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $3.7 billion, a 130% increase year-over-year. And lastly, so far this year, UPS has distributed $938 million in dividends. Moving to our outlook for 2021. We recognize there is still uncertainty ahead related to the pandemic and other factors that could interrupt the recovery, so we are not providing revenue or diluted earnings per share guidance at this time. As Carol mentioned, we expect the sale of UPS Freight to close during the second quarter, and today, we are reaffirming our capital allocation plans. To that end, we still expect capital expenditures to be about $4 billion. We have no plans to repurchase shares at this time, and our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be around 23.5%. We repaid $1.5 billion of long-term debt maturities in the first quarter and in early April we repaid another $1 billion in debt, achieving our 2021 target of $2.5 billion in debt repayment. And lastly, on March 11, the American Rescue Plan Act was signed into law. This law protects certain multiemployer pension plans from becoming insolvent through 2051. And, in turn, eliminates our balance sheet liability for potential coordinating benefits related to the Central States Pension Fund. The passage of the law triggered us to remeasure the UPS IBT Pension plan at current discount rates, which have significantly increased since year-end. The result was a $6.4 billion reduction in our pension liability. Additional information is available in the Appendix section of today's earnings presentation. As Carol mentioned, a strong balance sheet is a core UPS principle, and we are absolutely moving in a positive direction. The reduction in pension liability and debt repayments have reduced our long-term obligations by $7.9 billion. Combined with our improving business performance, our leverage ratios have significantly improved. In closing, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy and look forward to sharing more with you at our June 9 Investor and Analyst Day. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines. Hi, Allison. It's Brian. I'll take that. So the one caveat to your question is I would be careful about applying a history to the future. And the reason I say that is that historically we've taken quite a bit of time to get the peak costs from November, December out of the domestic business. Nando in the U.S. operating team did a very good job this year, planning for it and pulling those costs out quite quickly. So the CPP growth was only 2% and RPP was over 10%. So, you had an eight point spread. We're confident the domestic margin is expanding this year. I would just be careful about extrapolating history to the future. Thanks, Allison. Thanks, Chris. Look the – taking out of the temporary labor, the rentals, which we returned on an accelerated basis, those were a lot of the reasons. Chris, we were able to do to limit the growth of CPP to 2%. As Carol mentioned, there is a lot that goes into our costs. It's a combination of non-op and operating. We're going to continue to drive leverage throughout the system. Is 2% the number going forward? We're going to have more of a conversation about that in June. So I won't talk as much about the future, but we were pleased with the performance in the quarter and confident in our ability to continue operating leverage going forward. All right, Chris. Yes, Tom, so we saw a benefit in casualty. It was about $90 million relative to prior year. And we're really focused on the accident. Some of that was lapping at some Tier 3 accidents last Q1. But as Carol mentioned, we're leveraging technology, telematics, to go after the auto frequency and severity challenge that has been in the industry. Additionally, workers' comp, that's the other piece that goes into casualty. That's driven by systemic turnover and training and the teams are really going about our arduous effort to attack that. So those trends don't turn overnight, but we're seeing some demonstrated improvement. And on the topic of cost takeout, we spent roughly $6 billion in non-op we committed in 2021 and take $500 million out. That's a start. There will be more next year. In the first quarter, we took $80 million of the $500 million out, which is exactly on our plan. So we're tracking to deliver that $500 million associated. The big driver of that was about 1,700 headcount that have participated in the VSSP, the voluntary severance separation program. So we're on-track and committed to the $500 million. Yes. Different type of investment. That's right. Thanks. Thanks, Scott. So I'll take it. From a trend perspective, April is off to a good start. And your point about B2C and B2B, we're comping down 22% last year in the second quarter in terms of B2B. So we would expect the commercial side of the business to come back. In the first quarter it was still down 0.6% in the U.S., but in the month of March it was actually up 8%. So there were signs of life that it was coming back domestically. Internationally, we actually posted plus 10% on the B2B side in the first quarter. So as we think about the next quarter, the comps in the U.S. down 22%, give us reason to believe that the commercial side will come back and obviously our density in our commercial side of the business is more attractive than the residential side, so that'll be another positive. They are. Yes. Thanks. So Ken, maybe I'll take the first part and Carol can handle the second. From a growth perspective, just picking up on the last comment, yes, we expect positive growth, maybe not the 14% ADB we saw in the first quarter, but certainly positive growth. So, yes, most of our measures go into green. The benefit we saw was a combination, Helane of the Central State reversal liability for $5.5 billion. We also had to remeasure the IBT plan at the end of the quarter. That combined with the asset returns was close to another $1 billion, $900 million. So that's the $6.4 billion. So that's a reduction in liabilities for us. The funded status, the IBT plan, will actually be funded at 100%. So that's a positive. And going forward, from a P&L perspective, the P&L benefit aside from the asset base, we'll see about a $50 million reduced service cost on a quarterly basis going forward. So it has both a liability balance sheet impact as well as a P&L benefit. And as far as funded status, we update that when we remeasure based on discount rates. So that moves up and moves down, but clearly, the liability was favorable for us. For all pension plans. Obviously, I was talking IBT specific, yes. Yes. So we're still close to 90%, Helane, across all three pension plans. Thank you. Yes, happy to Brandon. So our thought process hasn't changed from a principal perspective. The first allocation of capital will be into the business. Obviously, with the type of returns, the improving domestic business and the growth in international supply chain and health care, we're going to continue to invest in those businesses. And investments will not just take the form of CapEx. There are new investments in SaaS and capabilities that we're putting in from an OpEx perspective. So we'll do that. We're committed to the dividend. We'll have a capital discussion in the June conference. So I don't want to front run that discussion. And then obviously, improving the flexibility of the balance sheet, which we're making good strides on. And that share repo, we don't have any plans to repurchase shares currently. But as Carol said on the last call, we'll continue to look and evaluate that going forward."

            "name": "Carol Tomé",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. We are now more than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove enormous change to how we all live and conduct business. I want to thank our more than 540,000 UPSers for continuing to deliver what matters and for serving our customers, communities, and each other. Looking at the first quarter, our results exceeded our expectations driven by an improving macro environment and great execution by our team. Consolidated revenue in the quarter rose 27% from last year to $22.9 billion and operating profit grew 164% to $2.9 billion. All of our business segments delivered strong performance in the first quarter. We reported record profits and a double digit operating margin in our U.S. Domestic segment, record first quarter profit in our International segment and record operating profit and operating margin in Supply Chain and Freight. As shown in our results, our team is advancing our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy under the better not bigger framework. As we've discussed, Customer First is about building capabilities that matter the most to our customers and using those capabilities to capture the best opportunities in the market like small and medium sized businesses and healthcare. In the U.S., the improvements we made last year and continue to make this year to speed up our ground network, enhance our Digital Access Program known as DAP and expand weekend operations while these are taking hold. In fact, during the first quarter, we added nearly 150,000 new DAP accounts, and we are well on our way to hitting our $1 billion DAP revenue target by the end of this year. Further in the U.S., total average daily volume growth for SMBs, including our platform businesses, reached an all-time high of 35.6%, outpacing the growth rate of our larger customers for the third consecutive quarter. This mix improvement and certain other revenue quality actions are delivering results with U.S. Domestic revenue per piece up 10.2% in the first quarter. Looking at our International segment, we were able to meet elevated customer demand by leveraging the agility of our network. Export volume grew double digits in all regions, commercial volume increased 10.1% and SMB average daily volume was up 23% in the first quarter. And we see even more opportunity moving ahead as we expand DAP and other solutions to key international markets. During the quarter, our Supply Chain and Freight segment responded well to market demands. We are on track to complete the divestiture of our UPS Freight business by the end of this month and we look forward to our new commercial relationship with TFI. Our focus on the customer includes improving the end-to-end experience, in other words, improving the experience from the shipper to the receiver as both our customers. We've identified a number of customer journeys and candidly pain points that we are addressing. Let me give you an example. Until recently, paying a UPS bill online was a poor customer experience. So we replaced our old homegrown system with a new SaaS application, which we began deploying globally in the first quarter. Once fully implemented, our industry leading billing solution will make it easy for nearly $2 million global customers to pay and manage their UPS bills. This will be particularly helpful for our SMB customers. Our Customer First aspiration is to provide the best digital experience powered by our smart global logistics network. A simplified billing experience is one aspect of this aspiration. Another is the digitization that's occurring within our Supply Chain and Freight segment. We are moving from telephone based quotes to online quoting. This new digital experience is driving simplification across the entire value chain. We'll talk more about our efforts to improve our customers' experiences during our June Investor and Analyst Day. We know that our customers place high value on the reliability of the UPS network. That's why we led the market by reinstating our service guarantees for U.S. Next Day Air services and Worldwide Express services for all origins and destinations. We intend to be the carrier that shippers and receivers can count on for reliable delivery. And as it relates to COVID-19 vaccine, our global expertise, technology and network are enabling us to move vaccines, kits and dry ice over great distances around the world. As of last week, we've delivered more than 1.1 million shipments, about 196 million vaccine doses to about 50 countries and territories and utilized our UPS premiere service to achieve 99.9% on time delivery. The combination of our efforts to remove friction and the customer experience provide the digital capabilities that matter most and deliver industry leading service levels are positioning us for future growth. Further, as we've discussed, market demand is outpacing industry supply, and we expect this dynamic to continue for the foreseeable future. GDP forecasts are being revived higher, economies are reopening and U.S. consumer spending is being boosted by government stimulus programs. This demand supply imbalance creates an environment where pricing in the industry should remain firm. Brian will cover more of our economic outlook in his remarks. People Led is an important part of our strategy. Our success in the first quarter was due to the commitment of our people and the strength of our culture. Every UPSer has a role to play in supporting our customers. We've hired a lot of new UPSers. So we know we need to focus on employee safety and training. In the U.S., we have re-imagined our driver's safety program by truly taking it on the road. We've created mobile units that can be rapidly deployed across the country. These units provide classroom training and a learning lab within movable trailers. Our mobile training along with other vehicle safety technologies, are making a difference. So far this year we've improved auto accident frequency by 2.1% globally and we will continue to advance our employee safety programs around the world. Moving to Innovation Driven. Over the past several years we have invested in automation, introduced new technology and opened new facilities. We are now starting to reap productivity benefits from these investments. The additional flexibility we've gained in the network enables us to be more responsive to changes in demand and be more efficient. In fact, in the first quarter compared to last year productivity improved in nearly all major operating categories, but we have more to do. We aim to make productivity a virtuous cycle, not just a transformation project. We are laser focused on operational excellence, and we'll share more details about our efforts here during our conference. Let me take a moment to touch on one of our five core principles, which is maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit rating. We have made great strides in this area by reducing financial leverage and improving the share owner's equity. Brian will share the details on this in a moment. Our strategy is gaining traction and we see even more opportunities ahead. We look forward to sharing the details with you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Ravi, for your question. We're looking forward to the June Investor and Analyst Day, where we will give you much more color on our forward-looking outlook including what we're doing from a productivity perspective. As we think about productivity, we really want to move away from an event, in other words, a transformation event to actually a virtuous cycle. And we're starting that as you see in our results from the first quarter. If you look at our operating performance, we drove productivity in nearly every operating category. And when I think about productivity in the business, it's really about packages per hour. We had improvement in packages per hour in our sort, in our theater, in our hub operations. We saw productivity in our delivery. Our route density improved year-on-year, driven in large part by our ORION technology. So we're going to give you a lot more color as to what we're doing to drive productivity in the business at our Investor Day. One more comment on productivity and that relates to non-operations. What you refer to that Brian? It's transformation 2.0. And at the beginning of the year, we told you we were taking out $500 million of expense in our non-operations area. We're well down the path in that regard. We are on plan and we believe we will deliver that result by the end of the year. Well, maybe I'll start, Brian, and then turn it over to you. You've heard us talk about our better, not bigger framework. And that's really about optimizing the network. And you saw that take hold in the first quarter with over 63% of our average daily volume growth in the United States driven by small and medium-sized businesses. That was a large contributor to the growth in RPP in the quarter. And when you have a 10% growth in RPP, well, you're going to leverage the bottom line, and we did just that. So optimizing the network and leaning in to those opportunities of growth that – candidly the revenue quality is better for us, our customers like the offering, the end-to-end network that we present to them, that's really laying the future for our growth going forward. Coupled with health care, those two growth opportunities are a winning combination. We saw the same opportunity outside the United States too, with great SMB growth, 23% in our International business. So optimizing the network, leaning in to those areas of growth that are most attractive to us and winning in those areas certainly was a big part of the value equation, and it will be a big part of the value equation going forward, but you have to have productivity as well. We want productivity to be a virtuous cycle here. Every day, we should run a better business. And that's what we're doing from a cost out perspective. You might just talk about casualty and the real impact that casualty had in the quarter. Yes. So I'll take the latter part of the question. So our customers are responding to the investments that we made last year to speed up our time in transit, but there is no finish line here. So we continue to invest in time in transit. We are expanding our weekend deliveries. Our Saturday coverage will increase to 90% of the U.S. population by October and we'll go through the details of this at our June Investor Day. But to let you know what we're doing, because we're increasing our weekend delivery because our customers are demanding that. We love our SurePost product. SurePost was about 36% of the ADB growth in the first quarter. But the cool thing about SurePost is that 41% of that product was redirected back into the UPS network, which allows us to get delivery density. So that's a great way to think about how we can grow Sunday. So we'll be expanding our Sunday deliveries as well. We don't have enough time this morning, but we really look forward to the June Investor Conference, because we're going to talk to you about how by expanding our network across seven days we can actually eliminate some of the lumpiness in the network in the middle of the week. And the lumpiness in the network in the middle of the week is causing some of the productivity deleverage that we see in our business. And if we can flatten out the demand, we can really get some great productivity. So we'll walk you through that algorithm at our June Investor Day. And the cool thing about leveraging the seven-day network is that it's capital-light, isn't it? Yes, we'll put some expense into the network. We'll have to have some more drivers. We'll have to have some more operators, some more package cards, but it's pretty capital-light, I like that. Yes, it's different. It's like a different line item on the income statement... ...rather than a depreciation expense coming off of capital. It's on the operations expense and we can lever that all day long to get the right revenue quality. Yes. We're just scratching the surface on what we could do from a growth perspective without putting a lot of capital into the International business by creating what we have in the United States, which is the Digital Access Platform. We're very excited about introducing that into our International businesses. We really aren't there today. But our customers in the U.S. want to sell through this platform outside the United States. So we'll be investing that in a major big way. And there are a number of other efforts underway, Allison. But I hate to keep kicking the can down to June, but we're going to have Scott talk about all this at the June Investor Conference. So hold type for a little bit, and we'll give you more color. And as you build your model, I think it's just important, given the year-over-year comparisons and the funkiness of the volume, just expect revenue to grow faster than volumes. B2C volumes are up. And on the International side, as we talked about, our Export business was up in all geographies outside of the United States. As it relates to Europe itself, we had outstanding export volume in the 20%. And our European business is the biggest part of our export business, making up over 60% of our Export business. So Europe really matters to our International performance. I might just comment on the U.K., it's really interesting what we're seeing in the U.K. Our Domestic U.K. business is quite strong. Our Export business out of the U.K. is great, export outside of the intercontinent. But there's been some Brexit disruption, candidly, that we've had to work through. We're not alone. Everybody has tried to work through the Brexit disruption, U.K. to the intercontinent. Sure. If we look at delivery density for the quarter, it was down slightly year-on-year, but improved from both the third and fourth quarter of last year. So the sequential trends are good. Clearly, that's a part of the mix change. But we don't want to just rely on the mix change to improve delivery density. We want to be in control of our density or destiny I should say. And so we've got a number of pilots underway to see if we can improve delivery density, and we'll touch upon some of those pilots at our June Investor Day. Thank you. So as a matter, of course, we have a number of longer-term contracts that come up for renewal every year. And when those contracts come up for renewals, we negotiate through those. And our team, Kate and team have done a masterful job of managing through that, those contract renewals in this very challenging demand environment. It never ends. I mean, every year, there are a number of contracts that come up for renewal because we have staggered maturities. So I think this is a virtuous cycle as well. Well, I don't think it's appropriate for me to talk about the profitability of a product, but we can talk broadly about our health care business, which includes vaccines. And our health care business is very nutritive to the overall business. As Brian commented, we had the best top line and bottom-line performance ever. We do make money on vaccines, as you can appreciate, principally because of the value-added attributes to the vaccines. UPS Premier is a special label that goes on top of the package. The label has a battery inside. So we can track that package wherever it is throughout our network. We stood up a command center to watch that package wherever it is throughout the network. And these are precious vaccines, and we want to make sure they get to their dosing sites on time and we're able to do that with 99.9% on-time delivery. So clearly, there's a value add and value is defined by what the customers are willing to pay for. So hopefully, that helps you understand the profitability of that segment. I think, Brian, its [indiscernible] 80% number, the relative number is 90% for all the pension plan. Yes. Long gone are the days when we describe our competitive set as those headquartered in Memphis and those headquartered in Washington, D.C. or those headquartered on the West Coast. And there are lots of players that are coming into the supply chain. And everybody wants a little piece of the pie. And our job is to keep them out of the pie that we want to eat, and we are doing that by investing in the capabilities that the customers matter most. And again, without – I'm sorry to be wasting your time, hopefully not today, but we're going to kick the can down the road one more time because we're going to talk to you about the enabling capabilities that we are investing in at our June Investor Conference to continue to offer the services that matter most to the customers that we want to serve. Our focus on SMB and health care does not take away our desire to grow our large enterprise accounts, which are many large retailers. And if I look at those large enterprise accounts, which we very much appreciate the relationship we have with those customers, they were very growthy. In the first quarter, they grew mid-teens. So that's very growthy compared to what we were up against. So we will continue to invest in that experience as well. But we're really looking at an end-to-end experience and have discovered 16 customer journeys, where we can – based on customer feedback, where we can make improvements; and based on those improvements, get stickiness with those customers. And those customer journeys are as true for our SMB customers as they are for our enterprise customers. And we'll talk more about that at our June Investor Day. Well, I'll tell you the SMB as a percent of total is 27%. So we've shown a nice increase in penetration there. We're delighted with that. And we disclose Amazon at the end of every year, so I think we'll just wait to do that. So we love our commercial business, and we're delighted to see it coming back. When we think about the segments that we serve from a commercial perspective, the largest segment is retail. And as retailers start to open their stores, we expect that to come back in a meaningful way, and that would be a great business for us. So we look forward to the economy continuing to recover and our commercial business coming back as well."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And the after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nKen Cook: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within The Federal Securities Laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2021 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports we file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results. For the third quarter of 2022, GAAP results include a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension gains of $782 million, a onetime non-cash after tax charge of $384 million resulting from accelerated vesting of restricted performance units in connection with the change in incentive compensation program design, a non-cash after tax charge of $58 million from a reduction in the residual value of our MD11 aircraft and after tax transformation and other charges of $41 million.  The after tax total for these items is $299 million, a benefit to fourth quarter 2022 EPS of $0.34 per diluted share. Additional details regarding your pension adjustments are included in the Appendix of our fourth quarter 2022 earnings presentation that will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website later today. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website, along with the webcast of today's call. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions].  And now I'll turn the call over to Carol. \nCarol Tome : Thank you, Ken. And good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for delivering what matters to our customers this holiday season. In a quarter, we were faced with choppy demand, continued COVID lockdowns in China, a threat of a work strike in the United States, and a bomb cyclone in North America.  But no matter what came our way, our team delivered. We executed another outstanding peak and delivered industry leading service for the fifth consecutive year. I'm very proud of our team and what we accomplished, not just in the quarter, but for the entire year. Looking at our fourth quarter results, we expected volume levels to decline from last year and they did, but more than we planned due to macro conditions that Brian will discuss. We responded by managing our network with agility and a focus on service. Consolidated revenue was $27 billion, down 2.7% from last year, and operating profit was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 3.3%. While our consolidated operating margin declined by 10 basis points from last year, to 14.1%, our U.S. operating margin expanded to 12.8% and reached the levels not seen in 10 year. Reflecting back on 2022, much changed from when we originally set our plan. We experienced geopolitical tensions, including a war and global inflation drove food and energy costs higher. We saw both relief and concern as China pivoted away from its zero COVID policy. Global supply chains continue to adjust and demand and pricing for air and ocean freight softened accordingly. Consumers returned to pre-pandemic shopping behaviors, as retailers have been successful and attracting consumers back into stores. And we won't even talk about the weather, which candidly presented challenges throughout the year. Even in the face of so much change, UPSers remained focus on controlling what we can control. And we delivered our full year consolidated operating margins and return on invested capital targets. In 2022, consolidated revenue increased 3.1% to reach $100.3 billion. We missed our revenue target by about 2%, but as Brian will detail, nearly all of this mess was due to a stronger dollar than originally anticipated. Consolidated operating profit in 2022 totaled $13.9 billion, 5.4% higher than last year, and consolidated operating margin reached 13.8%. We generated $9 billion in free cash flow and diluted earnings per share were $12.94, an increase of 6.7%. During the year, we stayed on strategy, customer first, people-led, innovation-driven. As we've discussed, customer first is about creating a frictionless customer experience targeted at certain customer segments including SMBs and healthcare. Since its inception, we've had huge success with DAP, our Digital Access Program and making it easier for SMB customers to do business with UPS. In 2022, we generated more than $2.3 billion in DAP revenue exceeding our targets. We expect the momentum to continue and plan to generate around $3 billion in global DAP revenue in 2023. And with the launch of Deal Manager in 2022, we've made progress towards dynamic pricing. Deal Manager digitizes the pricing process, and applies pricing science to present the right offer to our SMB customers the first time, so we are able to close deals faster and with better revenue quality. In 2022, our U.S. win rate with Deal Manager was 22 percentage points higher than the baseline. So we are moving quickly to expand access to Deal Manager to more than 40 countries in 2023. Additionally, we recently launched a pilot that enables systematic day or week pricing, which is good for our customers and good for UPS. Early feedback is promising, and we'll share more updates on this pilot on future calls. Looking at SMBs, they made up 28% of our total U.S. volume in 2022, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2021. Turning to healthcare, in 2022, our healthcare portfolio reached $9.2 billion in revenue, and the quality of our offerings was best-in-class. Our goal is to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. Today, we have nearly 17 million square feet of healthcare compliance distribution space globally, with leading cold chain logistics capabilities. In 2023, we expect our healthcare portfolio to generate more than $10 billion in revenue. We don't just look at volume and revenue to measure our success, we also look at our net promoter score. In 2022, the improvements we saw in our net promoter score outpaced the competition. We made strong gains in all 16-customer journeys, including the three most important, negotiate value, reroute a package and resolve a claim. We are well on our way to our NPS target of 50. Turning to People led. Here we are focused on the employee experience, and making UPS a great place to work. For our frontline employees, we made organizational design changes to address certain work-life balance challenges. We've stepped up maintenance spending in our buildings, including updating break rooms and restrooms, refreshing paints, improving lighting, and adding cooling stations. And for our management employees, nearly 40,000 around the world, we've been laser focused on improving our likelihood to recommend score, or LTR. When I started with the company LTR stood at 51%. It is now 60%, and we would like it to be 80% or higher. And looking at the drivers of dissatisfaction, the largest area of concern was pay, not the total amount of pay, but rather than pay mix structure. So we've taken action to fix it. Beginning in 2023, we are changing the pay mix structure by increasing the cash component. This shift does not change total compensation for our management employees, but does increase cash. We also accelerated the vesting of stock rewards associated with our annual bonus plan. This was a onetime non-cash charge. Beginning in 2023, management incentive plan annual bonuses if earned will be paid in cash. Regarding our upcoming labor contract negotiations, we are well prepared for negotiations, and are focused on achieving an agreement that is a win for our employees, a win for the Teamsters and a win for UPS and our customers. We have great jobs with industry leading pay and benefits. Now, I suspect many of you listening today, we'd like to tell about our negotiating strategy. Well, we believe the best way to achieve a win win win outcome is for us leave the details of the negotiations at the bargaining table. So let's move on to the last leg of our strategy, innovation-driven. We believe innovation is one reason we've been able to provide our customers with industry-leading service for five peaks in a row. By leveraging the agility and efficiency of our integrated network, our engineers and operating teams quickly make decisions to adjust the network and keep service levels high.  This year, we supplemented our engineering tools with our total service plan, which further improved our on-time network and drove productivity. In the fourth quarter, hours deployed in the U.S. dropped 5.3% which was greater than a decrease in volume. And in terms of cube utilization, our efforts in the fourth quarter enabled us to eliminate nearly 1,500 trailer loads per day. We are relentlessly focused on making our network even more efficient. We were very pleased with the initial results of our Smart Package Smart Facility RFID Initiative, where we are seeing fewer missed loads and higher productivity. As a result, this year, we plan to complete the RFID deployment in the more than 900 remaining buildings across the U.S. In 2022, we created a new growth platform we call logistics-as-a-service, which combines digital capabilities with our best-in-class global integrated network. Under this platform, we launched our Delivery Density Solution, where we continue to add customers and are seeing positive results. Lastly, we can't talk about innovation without speaking into the progress we are making against our environmental sustainability targets. In 2022, we took delivery of over 2,300 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicle, bringing our rolling laboratory to more than 15,600. And in 2023, we plan to add more than 2,400 vehicles, as we move toward carbon neutrality by 2050.  We think the best way to measure innovation driven is by delivering higher returns on invested capital. For the full year 2022, we delivered a return on invested capital of 31.3%, 50 basis points above 2021. Let me close with a few comments related to 2023. The outlook for economic growth is cloudy at best, geopolitical tensions are rising, and we have a labor contract to negotiate. For us, it is a year of resilience. What does resilience mean? It means we will plan conservatively and pivot quickly. It means we will balance defensive and offensive mode and it means we will execute what we call our wildly important initiatives. Specifically, we will balance efficiency moves with growth opportunities. Think of that as better and bolder. We will stop certain initiatives and accelerate other thereby increasing investment in our business. Relative to 2022, we are increasing our 2023 expense and capital budget by over $900 million. Finally, we will focus on three widely important initiatives, improving the customer value proposition, increasing talent development and employee engagement, and leveraging our physical network with our digital platform to drive logistics-as-a-service. Given the uncertainty ahead, we are providing a range for our 2023 revenue and profit outlook. Brian will provide the details. As a demonstration of competence in our business going forward, and in concert with our capital allocation principles, the UPS board has approved a $0.10 increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.52 per share to $1.62 per share. This is the 14th consecutive year, we have increased the UPS dividend. Additionally, our board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization replacing our existing authorization. In closing, for the past two and a half years, we have fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business, and we're just getting started. Uncertainty creates opportunity, and this team has proven that it's up for the challenge.  So thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. \nBrian Newman : Thanks, Carol and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover three areas, starting with our fourth quarter results. Then I'll review our full year 2022 results including cash and shareholder returns. And lastly, I'll provide comments on expectations for the macro environment and our financial outlook for 2023.  In the fourth quarter, the macro environment was challenging. In the U.S. inflation-sensitive consumers returned to more pre pandemic shopping patterns and holiday retail sales were lower than expected, especially after Cyber week. Internationally, demand in Europe remained under pressure. Ocean and air freight rates declined and exports out of Asia worsened due to COVID conditions in China. Despite these conditions in the fourth quarter, we responded quickly and again delivered for our customers and shareholders. In the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenue was $27 billion, down 2.7% from the fourth quarter of last year, and operating profit was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 3.3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Consolidated operating margin was 14.1% for the quarter, down 10 basis points from the same time period last year. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was $3.62, up 0.8% from the same period last year. Now let's look at our business segments. In U.S. domestic, revenue quality initiatives more than offset the decline in volume and drove strong fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, average daily volume was down 3.8% versus the same time period last year, with about half of the decrease coming from our largest customer, per the mutually beneficial contractual agreement we reached some time ago. In the fourth quarter, volume in October and November came in as we expected, including a surge in late-November from Black Friday through Cyber week. In December, volume fell short of our expectations, reflecting consumer spending cutbacks at the height of the holiday season. B2C average daily volume declined 3% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. B2B average daily volume in the fourth quarter was down 5.2% year-over-year, driven by declines in retail and industry sectors that are more sensitive to rising interest rates, like manufacturing and distribution. In the fourth quarter, B2B represented 35.3% of our volume, which was down slightly from 35.8% in the same time period last year.  Looking at customer mix, SMBs made up 26.5% of our total U.S. domestic volume in the fourth quarter, an increase of 70 basis points from one year ago, and the 10th consecutive quarter of increased SMB penetration. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $18.3 billion, up 3.1%. Revenue per piece increased 7.2% driven by revenue quality, which more than offset the decline in volume. Improvements in base pricing more than offset a small decline due to product mix and together drove about half of the revenue per piece growth rate increase. The remaining half of the revenue per piece growth rate increase was driven by the combination of higher fuel price per gallon and our fuel pricing actions.  Turning to costs, total expense grew 2.5%. First, higher fuel costs contributed about 150 basis points of the total expense growth rate increase. Second, higher wages and benefit expense contributed 150 basis points of the increase. Total union wage rates were up 5.6% in the fourth quarter, driven by the annual wage increase and cost of living adjustment for our Teamster employees that went into effect in August of 2022.  Productivity initiatives help partially offset the increase in expense. For example, total service plan has improved driver dispatch time by 7.9% since its launch in July 2022. This is helping us run an on-time network. And in the fourth quarter we increased total productivity by 1.6% as defined by pieces per hour. Lower purchase transportation expenditures reduced the total expense growth rate by around 140 basis points, primarily from utilizing UPS feeder drivers to support our fastest ground ever and continued optimization efforts. And the remaining expense growth rate increase was driven by multiple factors including maintenance and depreciation. Looking specifically at our peak period, our sales, engineering and operating teams planned and executed another successful peak. We used our technology to maximize the agility of our integrated network, including our newest regional hub in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. All of which enabled us to respond to changes in volume levels and difficult weather as winter storms rolled across the country close to Christmas. Our network never stopped and we provided industry leading service to our customers for the fifth year in a row. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $2.3 billion in operating profit, up 7.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. And operating margin was 12.8% year-over-year increase of 60 basis points. Moving to our international segment. The macro environment was challenging and resulted in lower volume than we anticipated in the fourth quarter. We leveraged the agility of our global network to quickly adjust capacity while delivering excellent service to customers. In the fourth quarter, international average daily volume was down 8.6%. The decline was primarily driven by a 12.9% decrease in domestic average daily volume and weakness out of Asia due to COVID. Total export average daily volume in the fourth quarter declined 4% on a year-over-year basis. Asia export average daily volume declined 10.3% driven by lower global demand and disruptions to manufacturing output from the changes in China's COVID policy. In response, we quickly adjusted the network and cancelled over 200 of our China and Hong Kong origin flights maintained high service levels and achieved a payload utilization of over 98% on our Asia outbound intercontinental flights. In the fourth quarter, international revenue was $5 billion, down 8.3% from last year, due to the decline in volume and a $321 million negative impact currency. Revenue per piece was relatively flat year-over-year, but there were a number of moving parts including a 660 basis point decline due to a stronger U.S. dollar, a 540 basis point increase from fuel surcharges and the remaining increase of 100 basis points was due to the combination of multiple factors including favorable product mix, base price increases and lower demand related surcharge revenue. Operating profit in the international segment was $1.1 billion, down $240 million from last year due to $139 million reduction in demand related surcharge revenue and a $98 million negative impact from currency. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 22%.  Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions, in the fourth quarter revenue was $3.8 billion, down $846 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers in forwarding, software global demand drove down volume and market rates more than we expected, resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. Logistics partially offset the declines in forwarding and delivered double digit revenue in operating profit growth driven by gains in our complex healthcare business from coaching and clinical trials customers. In the fourth quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated an operating profit of $403 million and operating margin was 10.5%.  Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $182 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $297 million. And our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.4%.  Now let me comment on our full year 2022 results. In 2022, we remained focused on controlling what we could control and provided excellent service to our customers, which enabled us to deliver our consolidated operating margin and return on invested capital targets.  A few consolidated highlights. Revenue reached $100.3 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion over 2021. This was $1.7 billion below our $102 billion revenue target, but included a $1.3 billion year-over-year negative impact from currency. In 2022, we generated operating profit of $13.9 billion, an increase of 5.4% over full year 2021 consolidated operating margin was 13.8%, an increase of 30 basis points. We increased our ROIC to 31.3%, up 50 basis points compared to last year. We generated $14.1 billion in cash from operations and continue to follow our capital allocation priorities. We invested $4.8 billion in CapEx. Additionally, we acquired Bomi Group, a delivery solutions and made an investment in Commerce Hub. We distributed $5.1 billion in dividends, which represented a 49% increase on a per share basis over 2021. We've repaid $2 billion in debt that matured during the year and our net pension liability decreased by over $3 billion. Both of which helped us reach our targeted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 turns, giving us ample financial flexibility to continue deploying capital to create value for our shareholders.  Lastly, we completed $3.5 billion in share buybacks in 2022. And in the segments for the full year, a U.S. domestic operating profit was $7.6 billion up 12.8% and we expanded operating margin to 11.8%, a year-over-year increase of 70 basis points. The International segment generated $4.4 billion in operating profit and operating margin was 22.4%. And Supply Chain Solutions delivered operating profit of $1.9 billion, an increase of $153 million and operating margin was 11.3% an increase of 150 basis points over 2021. Moving to our outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 to be a bumpy year, due to rising interest rates, decades high inflation, recession forecasts, a war in Eastern Europe, COVID disruptions in China, and our U.S. labor negotiations. While we anchor our plans to S&P Global economic forecasts, we have developed multiple plans scenarios that will help us quickly pivot in an uncertain macro environment.  Further, given our financial strength and solid cash position, we are increasing strategic investments to enhance our ability to capture growth opportunities, as we come out of this cycle. I'd like to share two of those scenarios with you now, which are the basis for the guidance we are providing this year. The first is our base case that delivers the high end of the target range. And the second scenario includes additional top-line risks and represents the low end of the range.  Let's start with our assumptions for the base case at a segment level. In the U.S., we expect a mild recession in the first half the year, with a moderate recovery in the second half of the year. In the U.S. domestic segment, we anticipate average daily volume will be down slightly due to our continued volume glide down from our contractual agreements with our largest customer which will be nearly offset with growth from SMB and other enterprise customers. And we expect volume growth to be better in the second half of the year compared to the first. We also expect the revenue growth rate to be low-single digits.  On the cost side. While we will manage the network to match volume levels, we have increased both capital and operating expenses for projects that drive efficiency and growth. One example is the accelerated deployment of our smart package smart facility initiative to all remaining U.S. facilities, which we plan to complete by the end of the year. And on the growth front, we will continue to invest in improving customer experience. Putting it all together, we expect to grow revenue per piece at a faster rate than cost per piece, and expand full year domestic operating margins to 12%.  Turning to international in 2023. In our base case plan, we expect a recession in Europe in the first half of the year. And in China, we expect weak demand in the first quarter with recovery beginning in the second quarter. We are accelerating initiatives like international data to help us gain share and partially offset macroeconomic softness. We anticipate international average daily volume will decline by low-single digit, with volume growth better in the second half of the year compared to the first. We expect revenue to decline by low-single digits, including reduction in demand related surcharges. We will continue to manage our costs with agility and expect to generate an operating margin of around 21%.  Turning to Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue to be around $14.6 billion as forwarding volumes will remain challenged and market rates will fall from year-end 2022 levels. We expect to partially offset declines in forwarding revenue from double digit growth in our healthcare business, resulting in an operating margin of nearly 11%.  In our downside plan, which represents the low end of our range, we start with our base case assumptions for all segments and layer in the following. In U.S. domestic, we reduced expected enterprise and SMB volume growth rates, resulting in a full year volume decline of around 3% versus 2022. In international, we layer in weaker demand out of Asia for the entire first half of the year, and a slower recovery in Europe in the second half of the year, resulting in a mid-single digit decline in average daily volume. And in Supply Chain Solutions, we lowered our assumptions for air and ocean freight forwarding market volume and rates, which reduced full year revenue for supply chain solutions by around $200 million.  Bringing it all together for the full year 2023, we expect consolidated revenues to be between $97 billion and $99.4 billion and consolidated operating margins to be between 12.8% and 13.6%, with more than half of our operating profit coming in the second half of the year.  Now turning to pension. There are a couple of factors to keep in mind as you update your models. First, beginning in 2023, we froze our defined benefit pension plan for U.S. non-union employees and have replaced it with enhanced 401(k) benefits. Second, high discount rates at the end of 2022 will result in lower service costs in 2023. Above the line, we expect the combination of these two factors will reduce operating expenses by approximately $420 million in 2023, with around 90% of the reduction in the U.S. domestic segments.  Below the line, we expect pension income of around $260 million for the full year 2023, which is $930 million less than in 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates, resulting in an increase in pension interest expense and a reduction in the value of our pension assets for market performance in 2022.  We've included a few slides in the Appendix of today's webcast deck to provide you more detail. The webcast deck will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website following this call.  Now let's turn to full year 2023 capital allocation. Our capital priorities have not changed and we will continue to make the best long-term investment decisions that will keep us on strategy and enable us to strengthen our customer value proposition and capture growth coming out of this cycle. We expect 2023 capital expenditures to be about $5.3 billion.  And here are a few project highlights. We will invest $2.4 billion in buildings and facilities to add automated storage capabilities and increase efficiency across the network. And we'll add 2.4 million square feet of healthcare logistics space to our global network. We will invest $1.3 billion in vehicles, including adding more than 2,400 alternative fuel vehicles to our fleet. We will invest $745 million in our air fleet, including taking delivery of seven 767 aircraft in 2023.  And in terms of IT, we will invest $830 million, which includes accelerating the rollout of smart package smart facility in the U.S., continuing to develop our delivery density solutions, and building out our logistics-as-a-service platform. And lastly, across these projects, and others, over $1 billion of investment will support our carbon neutral goals.  Now, let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow to be around $8 billion in our base case. Consistent with our policy of a stable and growing dividend, the board has approved a dividend per share of $1.62 for the first quarter, which represents a 6.6% increase in our dividend. We are planning to payout around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023 subject to board approval. We plan to buy back around $3 billion of our shares. And finally, our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5%, with a tax rate higher in the first quarter compared to the rest of the year, due to the timing of our employee stock awards.  In closing, we are focused on controlling what we can control, but we will continue to invest in our business to balance efficiency and growth opportunities under our better and bolder framework. The fundamental changes we made to our business, coupled with the continued execution of our strategy will help us navigate what's ahead in 2023.  Thank you. And operator, please open the lines. \nKen Cook: And Stephen, one note before we do that, we did experience a technical difficulty with a webcast this morning. So apologies to those of you who've missed a portion of our prepared remarks. We plan to post the full recording of today's call to our Investor Relations website shortly after the completion of our call.  So Stephen, please open the lines. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. Brian, that was really helpful guidance framework. So appreciate that. A couple just clarification points. I guess the net service cost benefit is zero in domestic, if I look at the service component, I'm just trying to understand how much of that margin uplift is absolutely gross and net service. I don't know if you talked about -- I might have missed it. Sorry, there were a lot of numbers there. If you talked about the financial impact from what you're assuming on a new labor deal. So if you could just talk about those two items.  And then Carol, there's a lot of rhetoric that's heating up on a labor contract. Seems like every day we wake up, there's a new big article about it. Wondering what your message is to enterprise customers that may start to get a little bit uneasy with all the rhetoric that's heating up out there. Thank you.\nBrian Newman : Thanks, Amit, I'll get started. We had about $420 million benefit to our consolidated operating costs, and that Amit, is being offset with investments. So that 420 specifically, I think you were talking about the domestic business, which is 380 of the 420, which is worth about $0.07 on a CPP. So when you think about the investment we're going to make into the business, which are about $400 billion, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that basically offsets the pension service cost impacted domestic. So it's more of a one for one.  On the labor front, so we've modelled in rates in both our base and our downside scenario, Amit. And I'm not going to get into the wage and benefit component of that. But I guess there's a broader labor question in there.\nCarol Tome : Upon, I'm happy to address the labor question. Without getting into the details of what will take place at the bargaining table, I think it's important to remember that Teamsters have been part of the UPS family for more than 100 years. So over 10 decades, we've negotiated many, many contracts. This is not our first rodeo. Our approach with the Teamsters is a win win win. Win for the Teamsters, win for employees, and win for UPS and our customers.  Now, I mean to your observations, there have been a lot of articles and headlines recently, that with my cost so much a question whether or not a win win win is achievable. But I would submit that a win win win is very achievable, because we are not far apart on the issues.  And let me make this real for you by giving you a few examples. First, both Teamsters and UPS agree that a healthy and growing UPS is good, good for Teamsters, good for our people and good for our customers. In fact, we've added more than 70,000 Teamster jobs since 2018. So we're aligned that are growing and healthy UPS is good. To be growing and healthy, we need to be competitive and make sure that our offerings meet the needs of our customers. Then a lot has changed since the last time we negotiated our contract. Now recipients want their packages delivered when where and how they want them delivered, which means we can delivery well, it's become table stakes.  Teamsters fully acknowledge that, but have worried about the pressures placed on our workforce with weakened operations. And they refer to that to the sixth punch, which is when people work six days a week, or 22.4 drivers. We share the same concerns. I don't want people working six days a week unless they want to. So we're aligned on this. We just need to get to the bargaining table and work it out. And candidly, we think with just a few tweaks to our existing contract, we can work this out. So we're not far apart, we're aligned, we just need to work it out.  Another matter that's come up is heat. There can be no disputes, sadly, that the earth is heating up, and that puts an uncomfortable situation on our employees in the height of the summer. Safety is our number one priority for our people, so we're not a part on this issue. In fact, we're not waiting for the bargaining table. We've already kicked off a total revamp of our safety program, bringing in new technology, hydration, cooling systems, and a whole lot more to address heat. So we're not a part, we're going to do the right thing for our people.  So those are just a few examples of where I see a win win win is achievable. In fact, I'm committed to delivering with the rest of the team and win win win contract before the end of July.\nAmit Mehrotra: Very good. Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. \nBrian Newman : Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask if, Brian, if you could run through the productivity programs, and give -- put some ballpark around the impact that you expect, smart package smart facility, TSP if you have other programs that are notable, so we can have a little more visibility and how to think about productivity in. And I'm thinking in domestic package in 2023. Thank you. \nBrian Newman : Sure, Tom. Well, look, Nando and the team have done a great job in pivoting and really driving productivity in the fourth quarter, they did an outstanding job. And we're calling for low single digit CPP in 2023. I referenced some of the investments that I think you're talking about in terms of smart pack smart facility, maybe if I unpack those, you'll get a sense of where we're investing.  So smart pack smart facility that really drives productivity inside the buildings, but it also improves the customer experience by reducing misloads. I think misloads today are running about one in 400, post the smart pack smart facility we will be up in one in 800. And there's a path to something higher or beyond that. And then there's accelerating pilots for Phase 2 which is sort baggage car.  Another area we're investing in, probably the second largest is healthcare. That's a great growth business for us. We're going to be adding about 2.4 million square feet in warehouse space next year. Some of that outside the U.S., half of that in the EU and half in the Americas. And then DAP has been a great performer for us. We're going to continue to invest in the DAP program, both domestically and internationally, enhancing the plug and play and adding brokerage in UPS access points in terms of capability. And then there's further investments into the customer experience and next gen brokerage.  So Tom, I think we have a lot of confidence in terms of the ability to drive total service plan, the investments we're making in smart pack smart facility, healthcare, DAP, and that's what's contributing to the low single digit CPP in 2023. \nCarol Tome : And maybe just to dimensionalize that a little bit more, in the fourth quarter alone in the United States productivity reduced our expense by $271 million. I mean, that's a lot. That's a lot. I'm really proud of the team. And just on smart package smart facility because I was just so enthralled with this project. We have of the 100 buildings that we're in, we have 50 buildings, where the misloads are now one in 1,000, that's six sigma perfection. So we're really excited about rolling out to the 940 remaining buildings in the United States. And here's the cool thing. We're going to roll out the first part of those buildings with wearable devices. But then we got plans to move away from the devices and actually make the car smart.  And last week, I was able to load a package, this is in the laboratory. I was able to load a package onto a smart car and saw that car actually check in the package. No human being did that. So this is way cool technology and we're excited about the productivity that that's going to be as a result. \nBrian Newman : And to Tom just from a seasonality perspective, we have planned productivity gains year-over-year in every quarter in '23. And so now the team will be reducing hours more than volume in the U.S. through the programs Carol and I just alluded to TSP and the automated capacity. So it's a balanced program.\nTom Wadewitz : Okay, great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning, and thanks for the time. So if you step back from the guidance at the midpoint, your EBITDA number is down, call it 6% from 2023 levels. And obviously, we are coming into a choppy macro. And Carol or Brian, can you talk about, the levers that you need to pull to kind of get reaccelerating growth? And how much of that is going to be sort of macro dependent as we think about the bridge from wherever we end up at '23 to '24. I'm just curious to get your perspective on what are the catalyzing agents that would reverse the trend in overall EBIT growth?\nCarol Tome : Well, I think there are a number of catalyzing agents. We need to get through this choppy economic environment for sure. But if you think about where we've had some huge homeruns, let's talk about our Digital Access Program. We have seen enormous growth in this. When I started, it was less than $150 million, now over $2.3 billion in 2022 on its way to be $3 billion in 2023. And we're growing outside of the United States, had been just a U.S. program, now we're going outside the United States. And this is one area of investments for next year. So that's a catalyst for growth, because we're investing in a customer that's underserved today.  Another catalyst for growth is what we're doing on the customer journey. As we continue to move the needle on improving the experience with us, we see every year increasing penetration in our SMBs. Brian, that's part of the plan for next year. \nBrian Newman : That's right. So we'll be adding about 100 basis points, Carol, from a volume mix perspective on the SMB front. So that customer experience translating into continued growth on the SMB front. And from a macro perspective, obviously built into the guide is an improvement in the back half of the year. So we need to see a bit of a pickup in Asia, and the U.S. rebounding somewhat through a backdrop perspective. \nCarol Tome : Another catalyst for growth, of course, is healthcare logistics. Couldn't be more proud of the progress that we've made in this space. And we're just getting started. There's a huge opportunity for growth here around the world. And Kate and her team are doing a masterful job of leading us there.\nDavid Vernon : And as you think about the OpEx that you're putting in to offset some of the above the line sort of service costs. Is that sort of one time in nature? Is that just project-based work around implementing RFID in the facilities? Is there some cost drag there that that comes away, or is that just cost drag that moves on to the next initiative? I'm just trying to think from a puts and takes perspective. \nBrian Newman : Now, some of the investments, international DAP for example, we're investing in the first part of the year, that'll start to pay back latter part of the year. And then the deployment of smart packs, smart facilities, that's probably more of a payback in '24 than '23 as we phase, complete Phase 1, and start to move on to Phase 2.\nCarol Tome : And to dimensionalize the investment that we're making in smart package smart facility, it's about $140 million of expense this year, which will not repeat the following year, and about $106 million of capital.\nDavid Vernon : That's super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning. Carol, great to hear the target to have the contract done by the end of July. I think last year we had talked to you, you weren't even planning on sitting down early. So I think that's encouraging to hear.  Maybe you could talk a little bit about what the largest customer kind of represented full year for '22, your thoughts? I know you talked about the pace of the loss of that business, but it sounds like it's accelerating into '23. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that in perspective of your countering SMB wins.  And then on international to maintain that 21%, Brian, what's the assumptions in there to maintain that level?\nBrian Newman : Sure. On the Amazon front, Ken, we finished up a year ago at 11.7% in terms of the percentage of Amazon as a percentage of our business. That came down to 11.3% in last year. So it was really a decline of about 40 basis points.  We'll continue on a mutually agreed path to glide that business down in 2023, and that's factored into our guide. So we feel good about being able to manage that down. On the international front, Ken, it was the second part of your question. So we've got an assumption that Asia comes back in the second half of the year. So that's -- they're going through some challenges right now in the early part of the year. There was a two-week lunar holiday. We had some COVID challenges, particularly out of China. So Kate and the team, they've done a masterful job in the fourth quarter and also in the beginning of this year in terms of pivoting our air network. I think Kate took down about 200 flights in Asia, which was really remarkable that they were able to do that in such a short period of time.  So the air network, seeing a little bit of a rebound in China and then getting after the opportunities that we're investing in. International, DAP was one I just mentioned and then going after the premium side of the market. So lots of encouraging optimism for the back half of the year.\nCarol Tome : And agility really is the name of the game, isn't it. Here it is. It's the end of January. I would say our crystal ball is pretty murky, but I can tell you what we're seeing in the business today. The U.S. is actually doing a bit better than the base case. And International is doing a bit worse because we're in a now a two-week Lunar New Year holidays, who would have thought. But with herd immunity coming, we believe in China, things should get better outside the United States.\nKen Hoexter : And just to clarify, that 11.3. I think, Carol, you had mentioned that you were targeting maybe less than 11% on Amazon for '22. So it sounds like maybe it's not drifting away as fast as an accelerating decline.\nCarol Tome : No, Ken, it's really is a function of currency. FX impacted our top line by $1.3 billion. So having not had the pressure on the top line, the percentage would have been different. Does that make sense?\nKen Hoexter : Yeah. Absolutely. Of course. Thanks for the clarification. \nCarol Tome : Yeah, thanks, Ken. \nBrian Newman : Thanks Ken. \nKen Cook : And just a reminder, please limit yourself to one question, so that we can get through as many participants as possible. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So I just want to make sure I'm understanding the guidance piece this year. So I think you said in the base case, Brian, the U.S. margin is 12%. And can you talk about where you see it in the downside scenario? And then you talked about more than half of the operating profit in the second half of the year. I mean it's typically somewhere between 50% and 55%. Should we think anything differently? I don't know if you want to give us a little bit more color on first half or second half profit margins and any color there? Thank you.\nBrian Newman : Yeah, Scott. Good to hear from you. So I'll start with the latter question first. We expect about 56% of our profit to come in the second half of the year relative to 1H. And then I would also just give you a little bit of color. There will be a similar bathtub effect in the first half between 1Q and 2Q stepping up in 2Q.  From a domestic guide perspective, the other half of your question, Nando and the team are focused on 12%. That was actually the same number that we had guided to back in our Investor Day, and I'd say the world has changed a little bit since then, but we're getting after the 12% margin in 2023. The low end is based on 11%. And so there are a number of things that are factored in there. The biggest change would be a change in the top-line relative to volume. If the macro doesn't come back as quickly as we think it might. There's labor negotiations going on. So we thought it was prudent to put a floor in.\nScott Group : Thank you, guys. \nBrian Newman : Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTodd Fowler : Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. And thanks again for the detail. I wanted to ask on the expectations for revenue per piece in U.S. Domestic. If I kind of -- Brian you teased out kind of the comments, you've got revenue in the base case up low single digits, volume down slightly. So revenue per piece maybe low to mid-single digits, a bit of a deceleration from where you've been over the last two years. You've obviously done a good job of moving that up. But can you talk about the ability to see continued improvement in revenue per piece as you move through '23, how much of that's base pricing and mix and then the opportunity longer term? Thanks.\nBrian Newman : Yeah, it's a great question. So the GRI, as you know, was 6.9%. And with the service rates, we'll keep a decent amount of that. The guide for RPP that we're building in our base case is mid-single digit for RPP, and that is facing two headwinds off of that number. You've got product mix and fuel, which are each combined, about 150 to 200 basis points off of that mid-single digit. So that's how we're thinking about it. And the product mix is really less air, more sure post, so a shift in the product mix. And then the fuel component, fuel is not going to have a big net impact to the business in 2023. But obviously, there's a cost component versus a revenue component.\nTodd Fowler : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. I just want to turn to health care. You're quickly approaching sort of that original target of $10 billion in revenue there. Obviously, investing some more this year in that vertical. Is there a way to think of what kind of outgrowth you're seeing there? Sort of what's the base market case growth for health care this year versus what you guys are seeing or growing above? Just any color there.\nCarol Tome : Well, I think Kate is here. And Kate, it would be great if you could just take that question, please.\nKate Gutmann : Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, Allison. So we've really been able to grow healthcare beyond even lapping the vaccine distribution that we did over $1 billion. And that was because with that service that we're delivering and the capability around the globe, we're actually selling more into biologics and some of the developing treatments. So that continues to fuel us for the future growth. We've seen double-digit growth, and we're planning for double-digit growth this year as well with very strong margins.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger : Yeah, hi. Good morning. Knowing that the SMB penetration continues to be an important part of the strategy, just sort of curious in an environment that's tougher, does it get more difficult to penetrate them? And do you find it maybe when you do, they're sort of trading down in services? Just sort of curious, especially given your large customer will continue to sort of shrink over the coming years. Thanks. \nCarol Tome : Well, we've been investing in the experience because we think that's the way to not only grow, but to keep that very important customer. And I couldn't be more proud of what we -- the team has delivered in this regard.  So if you think about customer journeys, if you will, there are three really big pain points. One was negotiate value. And that's why we're so thrilled with deal manager because deal manager is a huge home run. Iur win rate is 22% higher than we thought it would be with better revenue quality and the customers are happy because they're getting a deal with us within seven days. It used to take weeks. So negotiated value is an important part of continuing to serve this customer.  Another is reroute a package. We had some issues systemically that needed to be addressed, and we fixed that. So now we can reroute a package. And then finally, resolving a claim. Here, we had a broken link. So when you had a claim, it was not a good experience for our customers. And we've seen our net promoter score in this area alone improve dramatically. And the speed to pay, if a claim needs to pay, has improved by 10 days. So we continue to lean into the experience.  And Brian, I know you want to add something here.\nBrian Newman : Thanks, Carol. Yeah, I would just follow up and say we're putting some OpEx investments, $400 million, into the business this year. We invested in a similar capacity in fastest ground ever and SMBs, et cetera, a couple of years ago. And as I think about the SMB journey by investing in those customer experience points Carol was talking about, those investments are paying off. That's what gives us confidence. We are seeing 40% higher SMBs today than in 2019 when we started that journey in that investment. And we're actually -- we've increased penetration, Carol, for the last 10 consecutive quarters. So it's a bit of a proof point on the SMB front in terms of the investment and the payoff.\nJordan Alliger : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee : I guess maybe I had a question on volume. I wanted to understand a little bit better sort of the growth outlook for some of the SMBs, the non -- sort of Amazon business because it sounds like that's going to be up. So kind of curious about sort of what gives you confidence there, how much market share you've been able to win sort of us around that. And then Brian, a quick point of clarification as well. I think you talked about sort of the first half, second half dynamic of profit being leading to the back half. And then again, in 1Q and 2Q, should we be using sort of similar numbers like 44 -- 56 somewhere in that ballpark is a reasonable way to think about that first half as well?\nCarol Tome : Maybe on the SMB question, let's look at our Digital Access Program. It's been a huge home run for us. Year-over-year, we saw $1 billion of growth in this program. Here's the important part. It's 3.5 million customers. It's -- these are very small customers who are shipping with us through the platform, and we see continued growth opportunities ahead for us. In fact, we think our DAP program will be over $3 billion in 2023.\nBrian Newman : On the seasonality, yes, so you should consider a similar step-up in mix from a Q1 to Q2 perspective. From a Q1 perspective, Chris, we've got some Q4 trends coming out from a consumer and a macro perspective that are challenged. We're seeing that product mix headwinds, and we're making some of these investments in the early part of the year. So you should apply that same bathtub effect for Q1, Q2.\nChris Wetherbee : Thank you. \nKen Cook : And then Stephen, we have time for one more.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. Just want to come back to pensions real quick. Brian, can you talk about maybe any changes to the sensitivity? It's a little bit different than what we thought maybe not as big of an impact to change expected returns assumption or anything along those lines?  And then maybe if you can just wrap up with a bit of commentary on pricing and yield and productivity. And how all those really relate and it can trend throughout the year in an environment where you're seeing volume decelerate. You talked about all the different sort of headwinds or uncertainties, some of which showed up in peak. So really just looking to see if you're seeing some demand destruction out there.  And if you're able to drive these productivity gains, if the volumes don't necessarily show up where you think they could and surprised a bit to the downside? Thank you.\nBrian Newman : Happy to, Brian. So on the pension front, look, we've been on a path to derisk the pension. And we actually feel good about the glide path there. We're up in the high-90s, about 98% funded level, which is great for our employees. From a liability perspective, we've taken that down from about $16 billion a couple of years ago to $4 billion, $4.8 billion now. So overall, the glide path has been good. The challenge we have is that we've seen historic rise in interest rates. And so that $900 million plus number that I gave you below the line, that is a non-cash number, but it moves up and down with the market. So we try to give you the transparency.  We do tend to look through that as it's a non-cash number when we think about our capital allocation vis-a-vis the dividend, et cetera. So net-net, I think we're doing the right thing for the company. Given the volatility in the interest rates, it is a challenging environment and will move up and down on a relative basis.\nCarol Tome : The way I think about productivity, it's a virtuous cycle here at UPS, and I couldn't be more proud of what our team has done quarter after quarter after quarter to drive productivity. And Nando, maybe you could share a few of the action items in 2023 to continue that flywheel.\nNando Cesarone : Sure. Just if you look at the shape of the volume, especially in the fourth quarter and quarters before that, we've shown tremendous agility making sure we're matching the hours and the activity in our operations to the actual volume and the revenue. That will continue. And quite frankly, our people are masters of efficiency. So as we rollout the second iteration of our total service plan, which kicks off on March 3, we're learning a lot about our network. And there's cost to be had in not just on-road activity or inside our facilities, but across the entire network. And we're laser-focused on those initiatives.  And whatever volume and how it comes into us in different shapes and sizes, we'll make sure that we're prepared to handle it effectively. And hopefully, we're building up a little bit of a track record to show that, that's exactly what we have been doing. So I appreciate it.\nKen Cook: Excellent. I want to thank everybody for joining the call this morning. We look forward to talking to you next quarter, and that concludes our call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover three areas, starting with our fourth quarter results. Then I'll review our full year 2022 results including cash and shareholder returns. And lastly, I'll provide comments on expectations for the macro environment and our financial outlook for 2023.  In the fourth quarter, the macro environment was challenging. In the U.S. inflation-sensitive consumers returned to more pre pandemic shopping patterns and holiday retail sales were lower than expected, especially after Cyber week. Internationally, demand in Europe remained under pressure. Ocean and air freight rates declined and exports out of Asia worsened due to COVID conditions in China. Despite these conditions in the fourth quarter, we responded quickly and again delivered for our customers and shareholders. In the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenue was $27 billion, down 2.7% from the fourth quarter of last year, and operating profit was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 3.3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Consolidated operating margin was 14.1% for the quarter, down 10 basis points from the same time period last year. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was $3.62, up 0.8% from the same period last year. Now let's look at our business segments. In U.S. domestic, revenue quality initiatives more than offset the decline in volume and drove strong fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, average daily volume was down 3.8% versus the same time period last year, with about half of the decrease coming from our largest customer, per the mutually beneficial contractual agreement we reached some time ago. In the fourth quarter, volume in October and November came in as we expected, including a surge in late-November from Black Friday through Cyber week. In December, volume fell short of our expectations, reflecting consumer spending cutbacks at the height of the holiday season. B2C average daily volume declined 3% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. B2B average daily volume in the fourth quarter was down 5.2% year-over-year, driven by declines in retail and industry sectors that are more sensitive to rising interest rates, like manufacturing and distribution. In the fourth quarter, B2B represented 35.3% of our volume, which was down slightly from 35.8% in the same time period last year.  Looking at customer mix, SMBs made up 26.5% of our total U.S. domestic volume in the fourth quarter, an increase of 70 basis points from one year ago, and the 10th consecutive quarter of increased SMB penetration. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $18.3 billion, up 3.1%. Revenue per piece increased 7.2% driven by revenue quality, which more than offset the decline in volume. Improvements in base pricing more than offset a small decline due to product mix and together drove about half of the revenue per piece growth rate increase. The remaining half of the revenue per piece growth rate increase was driven by the combination of higher fuel price per gallon and our fuel pricing actions.  Turning to costs, total expense grew 2.5%. First, higher fuel costs contributed about 150 basis points of the total expense growth rate increase. Second, higher wages and benefit expense contributed 150 basis points of the increase. Total union wage rates were up 5.6% in the fourth quarter, driven by the annual wage increase and cost of living adjustment for our Teamster employees that went into effect in August of 2022.  Productivity initiatives help partially offset the increase in expense. For example, total service plan has improved driver dispatch time by 7.9% since its launch in July 2022. This is helping us run an on-time network. And in the fourth quarter we increased total productivity by 1.6% as defined by pieces per hour. Lower purchase transportation expenditures reduced the total expense growth rate by around 140 basis points, primarily from utilizing UPS feeder drivers to support our fastest ground ever and continued optimization efforts. And the remaining expense growth rate increase was driven by multiple factors including maintenance and depreciation. Looking specifically at our peak period, our sales, engineering and operating teams planned and executed another successful peak. We used our technology to maximize the agility of our integrated network, including our newest regional hub in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. All of which enabled us to respond to changes in volume levels and difficult weather as winter storms rolled across the country close to Christmas. Our network never stopped and we provided industry leading service to our customers for the fifth year in a row. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $2.3 billion in operating profit, up 7.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. And operating margin was 12.8% year-over-year increase of 60 basis points. Moving to our international segment. The macro environment was challenging and resulted in lower volume than we anticipated in the fourth quarter. We leveraged the agility of our global network to quickly adjust capacity while delivering excellent service to customers. In the fourth quarter, international average daily volume was down 8.6%. The decline was primarily driven by a 12.9% decrease in domestic average daily volume and weakness out of Asia due to COVID. Total export average daily volume in the fourth quarter declined 4% on a year-over-year basis. Asia export average daily volume declined 10.3% driven by lower global demand and disruptions to manufacturing output from the changes in China's COVID policy. In response, we quickly adjusted the network and cancelled over 200 of our China and Hong Kong origin flights maintained high service levels and achieved a payload utilization of over 98% on our Asia outbound intercontinental flights. In the fourth quarter, international revenue was $5 billion, down 8.3% from last year, due to the decline in volume and a $321 million negative impact currency. Revenue per piece was relatively flat year-over-year, but there were a number of moving parts including a 660 basis point decline due to a stronger U.S. dollar, a 540 basis point increase from fuel surcharges and the remaining increase of 100 basis points was due to the combination of multiple factors including favorable product mix, base price increases and lower demand related surcharge revenue. Operating profit in the international segment was $1.1 billion, down $240 million from last year due to $139 million reduction in demand related surcharge revenue and a $98 million negative impact from currency. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 22%.  Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions, in the fourth quarter revenue was $3.8 billion, down $846 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers in forwarding, software global demand drove down volume and market rates more than we expected, resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. Logistics partially offset the declines in forwarding and delivered double digit revenue in operating profit growth driven by gains in our complex healthcare business from coaching and clinical trials customers. In the fourth quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated an operating profit of $403 million and operating margin was 10.5%.  Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $182 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $297 million. And our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.4%.  Now let me comment on our full year 2022 results. In 2022, we remained focused on controlling what we could control and provided excellent service to our customers, which enabled us to deliver our consolidated operating margin and return on invested capital targets.  A few consolidated highlights. Revenue reached $100.3 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion over 2021. This was $1.7 billion below our $102 billion revenue target, but included a $1.3 billion year-over-year negative impact from currency. In 2022, we generated operating profit of $13.9 billion, an increase of 5.4% over full year 2021 consolidated operating margin was 13.8%, an increase of 30 basis points. We increased our ROIC to 31.3%, up 50 basis points compared to last year. We generated $14.1 billion in cash from operations and continue to follow our capital allocation priorities. We invested $4.8 billion in CapEx. Additionally, we acquired Bomi Group, a delivery solutions and made an investment in Commerce Hub. We distributed $5.1 billion in dividends, which represented a 49% increase on a per share basis over 2021. We've repaid $2 billion in debt that matured during the year and our net pension liability decreased by over $3 billion. Both of which helped us reach our targeted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 turns, giving us ample financial flexibility to continue deploying capital to create value for our shareholders.  Lastly, we completed $3.5 billion in share buybacks in 2022. And in the segments for the full year, a U.S. domestic operating profit was $7.6 billion up 12.8% and we expanded operating margin to 11.8%, a year-over-year increase of 70 basis points. The International segment generated $4.4 billion in operating profit and operating margin was 22.4%. And Supply Chain Solutions delivered operating profit of $1.9 billion, an increase of $153 million and operating margin was 11.3% an increase of 150 basis points over 2021. Moving to our outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 to be a bumpy year, due to rising interest rates, decades high inflation, recession forecasts, a war in Eastern Europe, COVID disruptions in China, and our U.S. labor negotiations. While we anchor our plans to S&P Global economic forecasts, we have developed multiple plans scenarios that will help us quickly pivot in an uncertain macro environment.  Further, given our financial strength and solid cash position, we are increasing strategic investments to enhance our ability to capture growth opportunities, as we come out of this cycle. I'd like to share two of those scenarios with you now, which are the basis for the guidance we are providing this year. The first is our base case that delivers the high end of the target range. And the second scenario includes additional top-line risks and represents the low end of the range.  Let's start with our assumptions for the base case at a segment level. In the U.S., we expect a mild recession in the first half the year, with a moderate recovery in the second half of the year. In the U.S. domestic segment, we anticipate average daily volume will be down slightly due to our continued volume glide down from our contractual agreements with our largest customer which will be nearly offset with growth from SMB and other enterprise customers. And we expect volume growth to be better in the second half of the year compared to the first. We also expect the revenue growth rate to be low-single digits.  On the cost side. While we will manage the network to match volume levels, we have increased both capital and operating expenses for projects that drive efficiency and growth. One example is the accelerated deployment of our smart package smart facility initiative to all remaining U.S. facilities, which we plan to complete by the end of the year. And on the growth front, we will continue to invest in improving customer experience. Putting it all together, we expect to grow revenue per piece at a faster rate than cost per piece, and expand full year domestic operating margins to 12%.  Turning to international in 2023. In our base case plan, we expect a recession in Europe in the first half of the year. And in China, we expect weak demand in the first quarter with recovery beginning in the second quarter. We are accelerating initiatives like international data to help us gain share and partially offset macroeconomic softness. We anticipate international average daily volume will decline by low-single digit, with volume growth better in the second half of the year compared to the first. We expect revenue to decline by low-single digits, including reduction in demand related surcharges. We will continue to manage our costs with agility and expect to generate an operating margin of around 21%.  Turning to Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue to be around $14.6 billion as forwarding volumes will remain challenged and market rates will fall from year-end 2022 levels. We expect to partially offset declines in forwarding revenue from double digit growth in our healthcare business, resulting in an operating margin of nearly 11%.  In our downside plan, which represents the low end of our range, we start with our base case assumptions for all segments and layer in the following. In U.S. domestic, we reduced expected enterprise and SMB volume growth rates, resulting in a full year volume decline of around 3% versus 2022. In international, we layer in weaker demand out of Asia for the entire first half of the year, and a slower recovery in Europe in the second half of the year, resulting in a mid-single digit decline in average daily volume. And in Supply Chain Solutions, we lowered our assumptions for air and ocean freight forwarding market volume and rates, which reduced full year revenue for supply chain solutions by around $200 million.  Bringing it all together for the full year 2023, we expect consolidated revenues to be between $97 billion and $99.4 billion and consolidated operating margins to be between 12.8% and 13.6%, with more than half of our operating profit coming in the second half of the year.  Now turning to pension. There are a couple of factors to keep in mind as you update your models. First, beginning in 2023, we froze our defined benefit pension plan for U.S. non-union employees and have replaced it with enhanced 401(k) benefits. Second, high discount rates at the end of 2022 will result in lower service costs in 2023. Above the line, we expect the combination of these two factors will reduce operating expenses by approximately $420 million in 2023, with around 90% of the reduction in the U.S. domestic segments.  Below the line, we expect pension income of around $260 million for the full year 2023, which is $930 million less than in 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates, resulting in an increase in pension interest expense and a reduction in the value of our pension assets for market performance in 2022.  We've included a few slides in the Appendix of today's webcast deck to provide you more detail. The webcast deck will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website following this call.  Now let's turn to full year 2023 capital allocation. Our capital priorities have not changed and we will continue to make the best long-term investment decisions that will keep us on strategy and enable us to strengthen our customer value proposition and capture growth coming out of this cycle. We expect 2023 capital expenditures to be about $5.3 billion.  And here are a few project highlights. We will invest $2.4 billion in buildings and facilities to add automated storage capabilities and increase efficiency across the network. And we'll add 2.4 million square feet of healthcare logistics space to our global network. We will invest $1.3 billion in vehicles, including adding more than 2,400 alternative fuel vehicles to our fleet. We will invest $745 million in our air fleet, including taking delivery of seven 767 aircraft in 2023.  And in terms of IT, we will invest $830 million, which includes accelerating the rollout of smart package smart facility in the U.S., continuing to develop our delivery density solutions, and building out our logistics-as-a-service platform. And lastly, across these projects, and others, over $1 billion of investment will support our carbon neutral goals.  Now, let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow to be around $8 billion in our base case. Consistent with our policy of a stable and growing dividend, the board has approved a dividend per share of $1.62 for the first quarter, which represents a 6.6% increase in our dividend. We are planning to payout around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023 subject to board approval. We plan to buy back around $3 billion of our shares. And finally, our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5%, with a tax rate higher in the first quarter compared to the rest of the year, due to the timing of our employee stock awards.  In closing, we are focused on controlling what we can control, but we will continue to invest in our business to balance efficiency and growth opportunities under our better and bolder framework. The fundamental changes we made to our business, coupled with the continued execution of our strategy will help us navigate what's ahead in 2023.  Thank you. And operator, please open the lines. Thanks, Amit, I'll get started. We had about $420 million benefit to our consolidated operating costs, and that Amit, is being offset with investments. So that 420 specifically, I think you were talking about the domestic business, which is 380 of the 420, which is worth about $0.07 on a CPP. So when you think about the investment we're going to make into the business, which are about $400 billion, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that basically offsets the pension service cost impacted domestic. So it's more of a one for one.  On the labor front, so we've modelled in rates in both our base and our downside scenario, Amit. And I'm not going to get into the wage and benefit component of that. But I guess there's a broader labor question in there. Thanks. Sure, Tom. Well, look, Nando and the team have done a great job in pivoting and really driving productivity in the fourth quarter, they did an outstanding job. And we're calling for low single digit CPP in 2023. I referenced some of the investments that I think you're talking about in terms of smart pack smart facility, maybe if I unpack those, you'll get a sense of where we're investing.  So smart pack smart facility that really drives productivity inside the buildings, but it also improves the customer experience by reducing misloads. I think misloads today are running about one in 400, post the smart pack smart facility we will be up in one in 800. And there's a path to something higher or beyond that. And then there's accelerating pilots for Phase 2 which is sort baggage car.  Another area we're investing in, probably the second largest is healthcare. That's a great growth business for us. We're going to be adding about 2.4 million square feet in warehouse space next year. Some of that outside the U.S., half of that in the EU and half in the Americas. And then DAP has been a great performer for us. We're going to continue to invest in the DAP program, both domestically and internationally, enhancing the plug and play and adding brokerage in UPS access points in terms of capability. And then there's further investments into the customer experience and next gen brokerage.  So Tom, I think we have a lot of confidence in terms of the ability to drive total service plan, the investments we're making in smart pack smart facility, healthcare, DAP, and that's what's contributing to the low single digit CPP in 2023. And to Tom just from a seasonality perspective, we have planned productivity gains year-over-year in every quarter in '23. And so now the team will be reducing hours more than volume in the U.S. through the programs Carol and I just alluded to TSP and the automated capacity. So it's a balanced program. That's right. So we'll be adding about 100 basis points, Carol, from a volume mix perspective on the SMB front. So that customer experience translating into continued growth on the SMB front. And from a macro perspective, obviously built into the guide is an improvement in the back half of the year. So we need to see a bit of a pickup in Asia, and the U.S. rebounding somewhat through a backdrop perspective. Now, some of the investments, international DAP for example, we're investing in the first part of the year, that'll start to pay back latter part of the year. And then the deployment of smart packs, smart facilities, that's probably more of a payback in '24 than '23 as we phase, complete Phase 1, and start to move on to Phase 2. Sure. On the Amazon front, Ken, we finished up a year ago at 11.7% in terms of the percentage of Amazon as a percentage of our business. That came down to 11.3% in last year. So it was really a decline of about 40 basis points.  We'll continue on a mutually agreed path to glide that business down in 2023, and that's factored into our guide. So we feel good about being able to manage that down. On the international front, Ken, it was the second part of your question. So we've got an assumption that Asia comes back in the second half of the year. So that's -- they're going through some challenges right now in the early part of the year. There was a two-week lunar holiday. We had some COVID challenges, particularly out of China. So Kate and the team, they've done a masterful job in the fourth quarter and also in the beginning of this year in terms of pivoting our air network. I think Kate took down about 200 flights in Asia, which was really remarkable that they were able to do that in such a short period of time.  So the air network, seeing a little bit of a rebound in China and then getting after the opportunities that we're investing in. International, DAP was one I just mentioned and then going after the premium side of the market. So lots of encouraging optimism for the back half of the year. Thanks Ken. Yeah, Scott. Good to hear from you. So I'll start with the latter question first. We expect about 56% of our profit to come in the second half of the year relative to 1H. And then I would also just give you a little bit of color. There will be a similar bathtub effect in the first half between 1Q and 2Q stepping up in 2Q.  From a domestic guide perspective, the other half of your question, Nando and the team are focused on 12%. That was actually the same number that we had guided to back in our Investor Day, and I'd say the world has changed a little bit since then, but we're getting after the 12% margin in 2023. The low end is based on 11%. And so there are a number of things that are factored in there. The biggest change would be a change in the top-line relative to volume. If the macro doesn't come back as quickly as we think it might. There's labor negotiations going on. So we thought it was prudent to put a floor in. Thanks. Yeah, it's a great question. So the GRI, as you know, was 6.9%. And with the service rates, we'll keep a decent amount of that. The guide for RPP that we're building in our base case is mid-single digit for RPP, and that is facing two headwinds off of that number. You've got product mix and fuel, which are each combined, about 150 to 200 basis points off of that mid-single digit. So that's how we're thinking about it. And the product mix is really less air, more sure post, so a shift in the product mix. And then the fuel component, fuel is not going to have a big net impact to the business in 2023. But obviously, there's a cost component versus a revenue component. Thanks, Carol. Yeah, I would just follow up and say we're putting some OpEx investments, $400 million, into the business this year. We invested in a similar capacity in fastest ground ever and SMBs, et cetera, a couple of years ago. And as I think about the SMB journey by investing in those customer experience points Carol was talking about, those investments are paying off. That's what gives us confidence. We are seeing 40% higher SMBs today than in 2019 when we started that journey in that investment. And we're actually -- we've increased penetration, Carol, for the last 10 consecutive quarters. So it's a bit of a proof point on the SMB front in terms of the investment and the payoff. On the seasonality, yes, so you should consider a similar step-up in mix from a Q1 to Q2 perspective. From a Q1 perspective, Chris, we've got some Q4 trends coming out from a consumer and a macro perspective that are challenged. We're seeing that product mix headwinds, and we're making some of these investments in the early part of the year. So you should apply that same bathtub effect for Q1, Q2. Happy to, Brian. So on the pension front, look, we've been on a path to derisk the pension. And we actually feel good about the glide path there. We're up in the high-90s, about 98% funded level, which is great for our employees. From a liability perspective, we've taken that down from about $16 billion a couple of years ago to $4 billion, $4.8 billion now. So overall, the glide path has been good. The challenge we have is that we've seen historic rise in interest rates. And so that $900 million plus number that I gave you below the line, that is a non-cash number, but it moves up and down with the market. So we try to give you the transparency.  We do tend to look through that as it's a non-cash number when we think about our capital allocation vis-a-vis the dividend, et cetera. So net-net, I think we're doing the right thing for the company. Given the volatility in the interest rates, it is a challenging environment and will move up and down on a relative basis."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Carol Tome",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. And good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for delivering what matters to our customers this holiday season. In a quarter, we were faced with choppy demand, continued COVID lockdowns in China, a threat of a work strike in the United States, and a bomb cyclone in North America.  But no matter what came our way, our team delivered. We executed another outstanding peak and delivered industry leading service for the fifth consecutive year. I'm very proud of our team and what we accomplished, not just in the quarter, but for the entire year. Looking at our fourth quarter results, we expected volume levels to decline from last year and they did, but more than we planned due to macro conditions that Brian will discuss. We responded by managing our network with agility and a focus on service. Consolidated revenue was $27 billion, down 2.7% from last year, and operating profit was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 3.3%. While our consolidated operating margin declined by 10 basis points from last year, to 14.1%, our U.S. operating margin expanded to 12.8% and reached the levels not seen in 10 year. Reflecting back on 2022, much changed from when we originally set our plan. We experienced geopolitical tensions, including a war and global inflation drove food and energy costs higher. We saw both relief and concern as China pivoted away from its zero COVID policy. Global supply chains continue to adjust and demand and pricing for air and ocean freight softened accordingly. Consumers returned to pre-pandemic shopping behaviors, as retailers have been successful and attracting consumers back into stores. And we won't even talk about the weather, which candidly presented challenges throughout the year. Even in the face of so much change, UPSers remained focus on controlling what we can control. And we delivered our full year consolidated operating margins and return on invested capital targets. In 2022, consolidated revenue increased 3.1% to reach $100.3 billion. We missed our revenue target by about 2%, but as Brian will detail, nearly all of this mess was due to a stronger dollar than originally anticipated. Consolidated operating profit in 2022 totaled $13.9 billion, 5.4% higher than last year, and consolidated operating margin reached 13.8%. We generated $9 billion in free cash flow and diluted earnings per share were $12.94, an increase of 6.7%. During the year, we stayed on strategy, customer first, people-led, innovation-driven. As we've discussed, customer first is about creating a frictionless customer experience targeted at certain customer segments including SMBs and healthcare. Since its inception, we've had huge success with DAP, our Digital Access Program and making it easier for SMB customers to do business with UPS. In 2022, we generated more than $2.3 billion in DAP revenue exceeding our targets. We expect the momentum to continue and plan to generate around $3 billion in global DAP revenue in 2023. And with the launch of Deal Manager in 2022, we've made progress towards dynamic pricing. Deal Manager digitizes the pricing process, and applies pricing science to present the right offer to our SMB customers the first time, so we are able to close deals faster and with better revenue quality. In 2022, our U.S. win rate with Deal Manager was 22 percentage points higher than the baseline. So we are moving quickly to expand access to Deal Manager to more than 40 countries in 2023. Additionally, we recently launched a pilot that enables systematic day or week pricing, which is good for our customers and good for UPS. Early feedback is promising, and we'll share more updates on this pilot on future calls. Looking at SMBs, they made up 28% of our total U.S. volume in 2022, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2021. Turning to healthcare, in 2022, our healthcare portfolio reached $9.2 billion in revenue, and the quality of our offerings was best-in-class. Our goal is to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. Today, we have nearly 17 million square feet of healthcare compliance distribution space globally, with leading cold chain logistics capabilities. In 2023, we expect our healthcare portfolio to generate more than $10 billion in revenue. We don't just look at volume and revenue to measure our success, we also look at our net promoter score. In 2022, the improvements we saw in our net promoter score outpaced the competition. We made strong gains in all 16-customer journeys, including the three most important, negotiate value, reroute a package and resolve a claim. We are well on our way to our NPS target of 50. Turning to People led. Here we are focused on the employee experience, and making UPS a great place to work. For our frontline employees, we made organizational design changes to address certain work-life balance challenges. We've stepped up maintenance spending in our buildings, including updating break rooms and restrooms, refreshing paints, improving lighting, and adding cooling stations. And for our management employees, nearly 40,000 around the world, we've been laser focused on improving our likelihood to recommend score, or LTR. When I started with the company LTR stood at 51%. It is now 60%, and we would like it to be 80% or higher. And looking at the drivers of dissatisfaction, the largest area of concern was pay, not the total amount of pay, but rather than pay mix structure. So we've taken action to fix it. Beginning in 2023, we are changing the pay mix structure by increasing the cash component. This shift does not change total compensation for our management employees, but does increase cash. We also accelerated the vesting of stock rewards associated with our annual bonus plan. This was a onetime non-cash charge. Beginning in 2023, management incentive plan annual bonuses if earned will be paid in cash. Regarding our upcoming labor contract negotiations, we are well prepared for negotiations, and are focused on achieving an agreement that is a win for our employees, a win for the Teamsters and a win for UPS and our customers. We have great jobs with industry leading pay and benefits. Now, I suspect many of you listening today, we'd like to tell about our negotiating strategy. Well, we believe the best way to achieve a win win win outcome is for us leave the details of the negotiations at the bargaining table. So let's move on to the last leg of our strategy, innovation-driven. We believe innovation is one reason we've been able to provide our customers with industry-leading service for five peaks in a row. By leveraging the agility and efficiency of our integrated network, our engineers and operating teams quickly make decisions to adjust the network and keep service levels high.  This year, we supplemented our engineering tools with our total service plan, which further improved our on-time network and drove productivity. In the fourth quarter, hours deployed in the U.S. dropped 5.3% which was greater than a decrease in volume. And in terms of cube utilization, our efforts in the fourth quarter enabled us to eliminate nearly 1,500 trailer loads per day. We are relentlessly focused on making our network even more efficient. We were very pleased with the initial results of our Smart Package Smart Facility RFID Initiative, where we are seeing fewer missed loads and higher productivity. As a result, this year, we plan to complete the RFID deployment in the more than 900 remaining buildings across the U.S. In 2022, we created a new growth platform we call logistics-as-a-service, which combines digital capabilities with our best-in-class global integrated network. Under this platform, we launched our Delivery Density Solution, where we continue to add customers and are seeing positive results. Lastly, we can't talk about innovation without speaking into the progress we are making against our environmental sustainability targets. In 2022, we took delivery of over 2,300 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicle, bringing our rolling laboratory to more than 15,600. And in 2023, we plan to add more than 2,400 vehicles, as we move toward carbon neutrality by 2050.  We think the best way to measure innovation driven is by delivering higher returns on invested capital. For the full year 2022, we delivered a return on invested capital of 31.3%, 50 basis points above 2021. Let me close with a few comments related to 2023. The outlook for economic growth is cloudy at best, geopolitical tensions are rising, and we have a labor contract to negotiate. For us, it is a year of resilience. What does resilience mean? It means we will plan conservatively and pivot quickly. It means we will balance defensive and offensive mode and it means we will execute what we call our wildly important initiatives. Specifically, we will balance efficiency moves with growth opportunities. Think of that as better and bolder. We will stop certain initiatives and accelerate other thereby increasing investment in our business. Relative to 2022, we are increasing our 2023 expense and capital budget by over $900 million. Finally, we will focus on three widely important initiatives, improving the customer value proposition, increasing talent development and employee engagement, and leveraging our physical network with our digital platform to drive logistics-as-a-service. Given the uncertainty ahead, we are providing a range for our 2023 revenue and profit outlook. Brian will provide the details. As a demonstration of competence in our business going forward, and in concert with our capital allocation principles, the UPS board has approved a $0.10 increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.52 per share to $1.62 per share. This is the 14th consecutive year, we have increased the UPS dividend. Additionally, our board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization replacing our existing authorization. In closing, for the past two and a half years, we have fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business, and we're just getting started. Uncertainty creates opportunity, and this team has proven that it's up for the challenge.  So thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Upon, I'm happy to address the labor question. Without getting into the details of what will take place at the bargaining table, I think it's important to remember that Teamsters have been part of the UPS family for more than 100 years. So over 10 decades, we've negotiated many, many contracts. This is not our first rodeo. Our approach with the Teamsters is a win win win. Win for the Teamsters, win for employees, and win for UPS and our customers.  Now, I mean to your observations, there have been a lot of articles and headlines recently, that with my cost so much a question whether or not a win win win is achievable. But I would submit that a win win win is very achievable, because we are not far apart on the issues.  And let me make this real for you by giving you a few examples. First, both Teamsters and UPS agree that a healthy and growing UPS is good, good for Teamsters, good for our people and good for our customers. In fact, we've added more than 70,000 Teamster jobs since 2018. So we're aligned that are growing and healthy UPS is good. To be growing and healthy, we need to be competitive and make sure that our offerings meet the needs of our customers. Then a lot has changed since the last time we negotiated our contract. Now recipients want their packages delivered when where and how they want them delivered, which means we can delivery well, it's become table stakes.  Teamsters fully acknowledge that, but have worried about the pressures placed on our workforce with weakened operations. And they refer to that to the sixth punch, which is when people work six days a week, or 22.4 drivers. We share the same concerns. I don't want people working six days a week unless they want to. So we're aligned on this. We just need to get to the bargaining table and work it out. And candidly, we think with just a few tweaks to our existing contract, we can work this out. So we're not far apart, we're aligned, we just need to work it out.  Another matter that's come up is heat. There can be no disputes, sadly, that the earth is heating up, and that puts an uncomfortable situation on our employees in the height of the summer. Safety is our number one priority for our people, so we're not a part on this issue. In fact, we're not waiting for the bargaining table. We've already kicked off a total revamp of our safety program, bringing in new technology, hydration, cooling systems, and a whole lot more to address heat. So we're not a part, we're going to do the right thing for our people.  So those are just a few examples of where I see a win win win is achievable. In fact, I'm committed to delivering with the rest of the team and win win win contract before the end of July. And maybe just to dimensionalize that a little bit more, in the fourth quarter alone in the United States productivity reduced our expense by $271 million. I mean, that's a lot. That's a lot. I'm really proud of the team. And just on smart package smart facility because I was just so enthralled with this project. We have of the 100 buildings that we're in, we have 50 buildings, where the misloads are now one in 1,000, that's six sigma perfection. So we're really excited about rolling out to the 940 remaining buildings in the United States. And here's the cool thing. We're going to roll out the first part of those buildings with wearable devices. But then we got plans to move away from the devices and actually make the car smart.  And last week, I was able to load a package, this is in the laboratory. I was able to load a package onto a smart car and saw that car actually check in the package. No human being did that. So this is way cool technology and we're excited about the productivity that that's going to be as a result. Well, I think there are a number of catalyzing agents. We need to get through this choppy economic environment for sure. But if you think about where we've had some huge homeruns, let's talk about our Digital Access Program. We have seen enormous growth in this. When I started, it was less than $150 million, now over $2.3 billion in 2022 on its way to be $3 billion in 2023. And we're growing outside of the United States, had been just a U.S. program, now we're going outside the United States. And this is one area of investments for next year. So that's a catalyst for growth, because we're investing in a customer that's underserved today.  Another catalyst for growth is what we're doing on the customer journey. As we continue to move the needle on improving the experience with us, we see every year increasing penetration in our SMBs. Brian, that's part of the plan for next year. Another catalyst for growth, of course, is healthcare logistics. Couldn't be more proud of the progress that we've made in this space. And we're just getting started. There's a huge opportunity for growth here around the world. And Kate and her team are doing a masterful job of leading us there. And to dimensionalize the investment that we're making in smart package smart facility, it's about $140 million of expense this year, which will not repeat the following year, and about $106 million of capital. And agility really is the name of the game, isn't it. Here it is. It's the end of January. I would say our crystal ball is pretty murky, but I can tell you what we're seeing in the business today. The U.S. is actually doing a bit better than the base case. And International is doing a bit worse because we're in a now a two-week Lunar New Year holidays, who would have thought. But with herd immunity coming, we believe in China, things should get better outside the United States. No, Ken, it's really is a function of currency. FX impacted our top line by $1.3 billion. So having not had the pressure on the top line, the percentage would have been different. Does that make sense? Yeah, thanks, Ken. Well, I think Kate is here. And Kate, it would be great if you could just take that question, please. Well, we've been investing in the experience because we think that's the way to not only grow, but to keep that very important customer. And I couldn't be more proud of what we -- the team has delivered in this regard.  So if you think about customer journeys, if you will, there are three really big pain points. One was negotiate value. And that's why we're so thrilled with deal manager because deal manager is a huge home run. Iur win rate is 22% higher than we thought it would be with better revenue quality and the customers are happy because they're getting a deal with us within seven days. It used to take weeks. So negotiated value is an important part of continuing to serve this customer.  Another is reroute a package. We had some issues systemically that needed to be addressed, and we fixed that. So now we can reroute a package. And then finally, resolving a claim. Here, we had a broken link. So when you had a claim, it was not a good experience for our customers. And we've seen our net promoter score in this area alone improve dramatically. And the speed to pay, if a claim needs to pay, has improved by 10 days. So we continue to lean into the experience.  And Brian, I know you want to add something here. Maybe on the SMB question, let's look at our Digital Access Program. It's been a huge home run for us. Year-over-year, we saw $1 billion of growth in this program. Here's the important part. It's 3.5 million customers. It's -- these are very small customers who are shipping with us through the platform, and we see continued growth opportunities ahead for us. In fact, we think our DAP program will be over $3 billion in 2023. The way I think about productivity, it's a virtuous cycle here at UPS, and I couldn't be more proud of what our team has done quarter after quarter after quarter to drive productivity. And Nando, maybe you could share a few of the action items in 2023 to continue that flywheel."

Just if you look at the shape of the volume, especially in the fourth quarter and quarters before that, we've shown tremendous agility making sure we're matching the hours and the activity in our operations to the actual volume and the revenue. That will continue. And quite frankly, our people are masters of efficiency. So as we rollout the second iteration of our total service plan, which kicks off on March 3, we're learning a lot about our network. And there's cost to be had in not just on-road activity or inside our facilities, but across the entire network. And we're laser-focused on those initiatives.  And whatever volume and how it comes into us in different shapes and sizes, we'll make sure that we're prepared to handle it effectively. And hopefully, we're building up a little bit of a track record to show that, that's exactly what we have been doing. So I appreciate it."

So that continues to fuel us for the future growth. We've seen double-digit growth, and we're planning for double-digit growth this year as well with very strong margins."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nKen Cook: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS third quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we will make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2021 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports we file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results. For the third quarter of 2022, GAAP results include after-tax transformation and other charges of $27 million or $0.03 per diluted share. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website along with the webcast of today’s call. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions] And now, I will turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Ken, and good morning. I’d like to begin by thanking all UPSers for their hard work and dedication to service. I am proud of the unstoppable spirit of UPSers everywhere and how they leverage the agility of our global integrated network to deliver outstanding service for our customers and strong results for our shareowners. In the third quarter, the global economy softened, especially outside the United States. International and freight forwarding volumes were challenged, but we quickly responded. We adjusted our network to match volume levels and continue to win in the most attractive parts of the market. For the third quarter, consolidated revenue rose 4.2% from last year to $24.2 billion and operating profit grew 6% to $3.1 billion. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13%, a 20 basis point improvement from last year. This was our highest third quarter consolidated operating margin in 15 years. Turning to our strategic update. The execution of our customer first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy has fundamentally improved to nearly every aspect of our business, causing better revenue quality, higher operating margins and improved bottom line results. Building on the strong foundation created by our better not bigger approach, we are moving to the next phase of our strategic framework, better and bolder. What do we mean by better and bolder? First, the better part of our framework is not changing. We will continue to focus on growing value share, improving the customer experience and driving higher productivity from the assets we own. Bolder is about moving faster to grow in our targeted market segment. It’s also about combining digital solutions with our global integrated network to create more value for our customers and new revenue opportunities for UPS. We plan to combine the capabilities of our strong standalone digital services, including Roadie, Coyote, delivery solutions, UPS Capital and our partnership with CommerceHub, to create a powerful offering of logistics as a service. And when we combine logistics as a service with our integrated physical network, we believe we will be unstoppable. We will share more detail about better and bolder in the coming quarters, but let me give you two examples of what we are doing. On our second quarter earnings call, I introduced our upstream delivery density solution. Here we are building a digital platform that goes upstream to look at orders, in other words, packages at the shopping card level. We then match this new order with other orders that have the same delivery day commitment, which creates delivery density. We have gone live with one customer and we are delighted with the results we have seen. In fact, we are currently onboarding several new customers to the platform. Another example of better and bolder is our pending acquisition of Bomi Group, whose network of healthcare facilities in Europe and Latin America and expertise in cold chain will help accelerate growth in complex healthcare. Along with our recent expansion of UPS Premier in Europe, we are on track to generate at least $10 billion in healthcare revenue in 2023. Now, let’s look at the three legs of our strategy, starting with customer first. Customer first is about creating a frictionless customer experience targeted at the parts of the market where we want to grow, including SMBs, healthcare, international and certain large enterprise accounts. Given global economic softening, we are convinced that a relentless focus on customer first matters now more than ever before and we believe our strategy is working, because we have continued to gain share. For example, we are leveraging our time in transit and visibility advantages in Europe to win. In fact, we grew Europe export volume in the third quarter. Another example is the growth we are seeing in our digital access program, or DAP. In the third quarter, we grew U.S. SMB average daily volume, including platforms, by 1.9% and SMBs made up 28.3% of our total U.S. volume in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from last year. DAP continues to add partners and revenue with more than 3 million merchants shipping with DAP in the first 9 months of this year, we generated over $1.6 billion in DAP revenue and we expect to exceed our $2 billion DAP revenue target in 2022. Moving to the people-led part of our strategy, our people are our most valuable assets. And it’s important to us that every UPSer views our company as a great place to work. We know that when we take care of our people, they will take care of our customers. Recently, UPS reached contract extension agreements with the Independent Pilots Association and our aircraft maintenance technicians. Both contracts continued to reward these UPSers with industry-leading pay and benefits and will help ensure the company’s future success. And we are making other changes to improve our employee experience and satisfaction. For example, through what we call our operator experience program, we recently worked with our U.S. drivers to create individual lives’ dispatch plans, giving them more choice over the hours they work. We also automated tasks and reorganized our operations team to improve work life balance for our operating supervisors. And for our management employees globally, we are evaluating our overall pay mix composition. While total compensation compares favorably with the market, we may have some opportunities to rework the pay mix to make our compensation even more attractive. Now to the last leg of our strategy, innovation-driven. This is about driving more productivity from the assets we own. Our integrated network is the best in the industry, but we are leveraging data and technology to make it even smarter, more automated and more efficient. In the third quarter, our productivity improvements continued to deliver benefits. In the U.S., we optimize trailer loads by eliminating nearly 1,000 loads per day compared to the third quarter of last year and we successfully managed ours in line with volume level. We also launched total service plan, which is about running a predictable on-time network. Execution is going as planned. And as of last week, our on-time computer departures and arrivals improved 6.5% compared to last year, reducing idle time in the network. Additionally, this month, we completed the initial rollout of our smart package smart facility, which enables RFID label technology in 101 buildings in our network. Further, we opened our eighth regional hub in the United States. Located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, this 800,000 square foot automated hub provides significant processing horsepower to better serve the Northeast corridor. It helps enable greater network flexibility across the U.S. This hub is also home to UPS’ largest natural gas fueling station within our network. This fueling station will remove 8 million gallons of diesel fuel per year. That’s equivalent to removing more than 17,000 gasoline-powered passenger cars from the road. Turning to peak. For the last four holiday seasons, UPS has been the industry leader in on-time delivery performance and we intend for that to continue. This outperformance doesn’t happen by accident. We built our integrated network to flex with volume and our investments in our people, automation and technology enable greater agility. To prepare for peak, we made enhancements to all of the areas of our business that delivered a great peak last year. Let me share a few details about our peak plans for this year, starting with volume. This year, we anticipate our volumes will peak later in December compared to last year as we expect consumers will return to more pre-pandemic shopping behaviors. While we will continue to use technology to match daily capacity with customer demand, we are also optimizing air and ground volume to make room for new customers where we can add the most value. While we will have a peak, as Brian will detail, overall volume in the fourth quarter is expected to decline from last year due to contractual agreements. In terms of labor, we will bring on more than 100,000 seasonal hires this year related to hiring. We are ahead of where we were this time last year. One reason is because we have made the digital hiring process even faster and easier this year. We have also improved training for our new driver helpers, which shortens the amount of time from hire to dispatched. Newly hired driver helpers can complete training on their phones and begin work on Day 1. Bottom line, we are ready to deliver another successful peak. Let me end by reaffirming our 2022 targets of consolidated revenue of around $102 billion, consolidated operating margin of about 13.7% and return on invested capital greater than 30%. In the face of a very dynamic macro environment, we are demonstrating more agility than ever before. We are focused on controlling what we can control. And under our better and bolder framework, we are combining digital capabilities with our global integrated network to continue winning in the most attractive parts of the market, driving operational excellence and delivering best-in-class service for our customers. So thank you for listening. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol and good morning. In my comments, I’ll cover four areas, starting with the macro environment, then our third quarter results. Next, I will cover cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I will wrap up with some comments on our outlook for the rest of the year. In the third quarter, the macro environment remained dynamic. In the U.S., we continue to see cross currents driven by the strong job market and healthy consumer spending despite higher inflation and interest rates. Internationally, the macro environment weakened more than we expected due to high inflation, volatile energy prices, lockdowns in Asia, and the war in Eastern Europe. We responded quickly to the changing market conditions by leveraging the agility of our global integrated network to provide excellent service to our customers and deliver our bottom line commitments to shareowners. In the third quarter, consolidated revenue increased 4.2% to $24.2 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.1 billion, 6% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13% which was 20 basis points above last year. For the third quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.99, up 10.3% from the same period last year. Now, let’s look at our business segments. In U.S. domestic, our revenue quality efforts and the execution of our planned cost initiatives drove third quarter results above our expectations. In the third quarter, average daily volume was down 1.5% versus the same time period last year, but the growth rate was an improvement over the first half of 2022 as new volume from the record number of wins we had in the second quarter came into the network. In the third quarter, the gap between year-over-year B2C and B2B average daily volume growth rates narrowed as we lapped more normalized consumer shopping behaviors. B2C average daily volume declined 2.2% driven by contractual agreements we reached with certain enterprise customers. B2B average daily volume was down 0.5% year-over-year due to declines in manufacturing volumes, which was partially offset by growth in retail B2B driven by returns volume. In the third quarter, B2B represented 42.8% of our volume, which was up slightly from the 42.4% in the same period last year. Looking at customer mix, the execution of our strategy is continuing to drive improvement. In the third quarter, we grew SMB average daily volume, including platforms, 1.9% and SMBs made up 28.3% of our total U.S. domestic volume in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from 1 year ago. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $15.4 billion up 8.2%. Revenue per piece increased 9.8%, more than offsetting the decline in volume. Our revenue quality efforts continue to deliver results. In the third quarter, about one-third of the revenue per piece growth rate increase came from continued strength in base pricing. Another third of the revenue per piece growth rate increase came from changes in fuel price per gallon and the final third came from the combination of mix and our fuel pricing actions. Turning to costs, total expense grew 7%. Wages and benefits contributed about 310 basis points of the increase driven by the annual increase for our teams to employees that went into effect in August. Fuel drove 220 basis points of the expense growth rate increase due primarily to the rise in price per gallon compared to last year and the remaining variance was driven by multiple factors, including maintenance and depreciation. Cost in U.S. domestic came in as we expected due to our planned productivity initiatives, which drove our cost per piece growth rate to be lower in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter and partially offsetting wage and benefit increases. We are continuing to see the benefits of our cube utilization and other productivity efforts, including total service plan, which launched on July 11. I will share more about our productivity initiatives in a moment. To sum it up, revenue growth was above expense growth, which created positive operating leverage for the seventh consecutive quarter. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, an increase of $272 million or 19.2% compared to the third quarter of 2021. And operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 11%. Moving to our International segment. The global macro environment continued to soften, but we remained agile and flexed our network in response to changing market conditions and delivering excellent service to our customers. At the beginning of the quarter, we expected the international average daily volume growth rate to improve compared to the first half of 2022, and it did. However, it did not improve as much as we anticipated due to continued macro softening. In the third quarter, international average daily volume was down 5.2%. Total export average daily volume declined 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. China export volume declined due to lockdown and disruptions to manufacturing output. In response, we quickly adjusted the network and canceled 75 China and Hong Kong origin flights and rerouted 27 flights to other gateways in support of our customers. These changes enabled us to move volume for our customers where it was available, maintain high levels of service and achieve a payload utilization of over 98% on our Asia outbound intercontinental flights in the third quarter. Looking at Europe. We continue to win on our speed and service advantages at strong revenue quality despite softer market conditions. We grew transborder average daily volume 2.6%, and total Europe export average daily volume grew 0.6% in the third quarter. In the third quarter, international revenue increased 1.7% and to $4.8 billion, which included a negative currency impact of $335 million and a fuel benefit of $363 million. Revenue per piece increased 6.4%, which included the fuel and currency impacts I just covered and a 510 basis point increase from the combination of product mix and revenue quality actions we took. Operating profit in the International segment was $1 billion, which included an $82 million negative impact from currency. There was no year-over-year impact from fuel on international operating profit. Operating margin in the third quarter was 20.9%, which was down from the same period last year due to the delevering of our fixed costs and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. Our teams continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment in the third quarter and did an excellent job serving our customers and managing costs to deliver year-over-year operating margin expansion. In the third quarter, revenue was $4 billion down $268 million year-over-year, which included a $92 million negative impact from currency. Looking at the key drivers. In freight forwarding, declines in volume and market rates reduced revenue and operating profit. However, the team was able to effectively manage buy/sell spreads and continued supporting our customers. Within Forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit delivered strong operating profit growth driven by revenue quality initiatives. And Logistics delivered strong top and bottom-line growth driven by our complex healthcare business from cold chain, clinical trials and medical device customers. In the third quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $459 million and delivered a record third quarter operating margin of 11.5%, an increase of 100 basis points over last year. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $297 million, and our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21%, which was better than we expected due primarily to discrete items. Let’s turn to cash and shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we’ve generated $10.8 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow was $8.5 billion. And so far this year, UPS has paid $3.8 billion in dividends and completed $2.2 billion in share buybacks. Now I’ll make a few comments regarding our outlook. According to IHS, full year global GDP is expected to grow 2.8% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 1.7%. Both are lower than their forecast at the beginning of the year. We are continuing to pay close attention to macro elements, including lockdowns in Asia, inflationary pressures, the health of the consumer and the geopolitical environment. Needless to say, the macroeconomic environment is much different now versus our expectations when we started the year. But by controlling what we can control, quickly adjusting the network to match changes in volume levels and delivering excellent service to our customers, we are still on track to deliver our full year financial targets. We expect consolidated revenues to be around $102 billion. Consolidated operating margin is expected to be about 13.7% and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%. Now let me give a little color on the fourth quarter. Starting with U.S. domestic, we anticipate fourth quarter 2022 revenue growth of around 4.5% driven by strong revenue quality, and we expect fourth quarter operating margin to expand year-over-year to around 12.4%. Looking at peak in the U.S., we expect peak volume to come in heavier later in the peak period, and we have one additional delivery day compared to last year, which gives us more flexibility. As you update your models for U.S. domestic, there are a few things to keep in mind. We anticipate the average daily volume growth rate will be lower in the fourth quarter of 2022 than in the third quarter due to contractual agreements we have reached with certain enterprise customers. Second, we expect increases in wage and benefit rates will be higher than the same time period last year due to the annual increase our teams or employees received in August. And third, we are continuing to execute our productivity initiatives to help offset wage and benefit rate increases. Our biggest productivity initiative is total service plan, which is performing as planned. Since the launch on July 11, we’ve improved our driver dispatch timeliness by 13%. This is about getting our drivers out of the building on time, which creates a more predictable environment for our employees and better service for our customers. Also, in regard to productivity in the third quarter, we brought on additional automation in the network prior to peak, including automated tagging, robotic small store induction and autonomous – vehicles. As a result of all these efforts, we expect the U.S. domestic fourth quarter 2022 cost per piece growth rate to be lower than it was in the third quarter of 2022. Moving to international. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be relatively flat to the fourth quarter of last year. We anticipate our share growth and revenue quality initiatives will offset the weaker macroeconomic environment and negative currency impacts, and we expect international operating margin to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2022 to around 21.5% as we continue to respond to market changes with agility. In Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter to be above $4 billion as we partially offset declines in the air and ocean freight forwarding revenue with continued growth in logistics and our healthcare business. Operating margin for Supply Chain Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2022 is expected to be around 11.4% as we continue to effectively manage the buy/sell spreads in a dynamic environment. Turning to capital allocation for the full year. In 2022, we expect free cash flow to be above $9 billion, including pension contributions to fund annual service costs. Capital expenditures are now expected to be about $5 billion, which is $500 million less than our original plan. The largest driver of the variance is the result of our decision to lease certain facilities instead of purchasing them. This approach enables us to maintain higher levels of agility and further improve our overall capital structure. We plan to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval. We have repaid $2 billion in debt this year as planned, including $1 billion in October. We expect to complete at least $3 billion in share repurchases for the year. And lastly, we expect the tax rate for the full year to be around 22%. Before I wrap up, last week, we announced our U.S. general rate increase. The 2023 increase will be 6.9%, reflecting the value of the services we offer and cost inflation in the market. The details have been posted to ups.com. Executing our strategy under better not bigger has led to a greater agility across our business and stronger financial performance. Our move to better and bolder enables future growth in revenue and margin. By combining the strength of our physical network with new digital capabilities, we will continue providing excellent service to our customers, win in the most attractive parts of the market, increase the efficiency of our operations and create value for our shareowners. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Good morning. Just want to talk to the total service plan and some of the automation you put through. Brian, I think you had talked to $300 million of productivity. It sounds like you’re on your path there. Do we start to see that accelerate into Q4? Are these trending better than maybe you would have thought originally? Just any color there. Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Hey, Allison. Good morning. So we had talked about driving productivity of about $300 million in the back half of the year. No more than half of that is going to come in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, and TSP is one of the largest drivers of that. We’re actually on track, and we’re seeing the system running more on time. I called out in my prepared remarks 13% increase in terms of the efficiency and the drivers. So the idle time is decreasing, and we’re very pleased with the performance.\nCarol Tome: Maybe just a little more color there. Our overtime hours were down 1 million hours in the quarter. Our bench has dropped from 29% to 20% and we reduced fluctuations in driver pay days by 39%. So the plan is working, and we just got started with it on July 3.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. Congrats on the results. I just – I guess I had a quick two-parter. Carol, can you talk about market share trends? UPS has obviously been investing in time in transit. I think you said when we met after Labor Day that UPS is maybe at parity or better on 17 of the top 25 lanes in the U.S. So obviously, there is some room for improvement there. But can you just talk about what you’re seeing on market share trends, both driven by what you’re investing in times in transit and, obviously, some of the challenges in your direct competitor? And then Brian, there is obviously a lot of uncertainty beyond our borders. You have a massive – your road business over-the-road business, ground business in Europe. The international profits have held in there remarkably well. There is obviously some cracks and concerns on that market. Can you just talk about your confidence in being able to kind of maintain this level of earnings cadence in the international business, given all the uncertainty out there? Thank you very much.\nCarol Tome: Well, starting with the question on market share, a big turning point for our company is when we invested in fastest ground ever, improving our time in transit. And yes, we are advantaged or at parity in 17 of the top 25 markets. We offer 7-day residential service, Saturday pickup for our business customers. So this has made a significant difference in our business. And if you look at it through the lens of market share, just looking at SMB in the United States, we see that – we have seen that we’ve grown both revenue and ADB market share ahead of our competitors. And when we look at it through the lens of enterprise, we’ve grown revenue share. So we are delighted with the share gains that we’ve seen in United States, but the share gains continued outside of the United States as well. Super pleased of the time in transit advantage that we have in Europe and what that’s meant for share gains in Europe despite the very uncertain market.\nBrian Newman: Yes, Amit. In terms of the international side, it is a challenging macro environment out there. But we expect total volume levels in Q4 will actually be higher than Q3, improving utilization from an ADV perspective. Growth rates, we expect to improve. We’re looking to win share in Europe, execute on the initiatives to grow the U.S. export lane, which going into the peak season is helpful. So there are lots of cost initiatives that Kate and the team are executing real time. I think you saw that in sort of the flexibility with taking down flights in Asia and rerouting to where the customer needs were. So we feel great about the agility of the international business.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes, thanks. Good morning. And I want to look a little ahead to 2023 and maybe think a little bit more on the cost side. Obviously, the macro is challenging. As you noted, there is cross currency in the U.S. But it seems like we’re in a decelerating demand trend. So I wanted to get a sense of sort of the big picture initiatives you guys are working on from a cost perspective in 2023. And I think I’ve asked you this before, but as you think out to ‘23, assuming we are in a more cautious sort of potentially negative volume environment, are we still confident that we have the ability to sort of grow the domestic margins as well as domestic profit next year?\nCarol Tome: Well, maybe I’ll start with just a philosophical approach to building a plan for ‘23. And then we can have both Brian and Nando talk about some of our cost initiatives. Kate can join in too. So first, this is a very interesting time to be building a financial plan because there is so much uncertainty, there is economic uncertainty, there is still political uncertainty. We do have a contract that’s coming up for renewal next year as well. So there is a lot of uncertainty. But here is our philosophical approach to building the plan. One, we’re going to stay on strategy because we believe that we should invest through whatever comes our way so that we can continue to improve the customer experience as well as the employee experience. So we’re going to stay on strategy. We’re going to build more agility into our plan than we’ve seen before. And I would say we’re pretty agile today. Well, we’re going to – we have to be able to turn on a dime, and so we’re going to build agility into the plan. We’re going to build a plan of conservatism because if you’re too optimistic, then your expenses are too high and then there is a whole bunch of wood you have to chop to get those expenses out. So we will plan conservatively and we will factor into the plan some of the challenges that will come our way as a result of higher interest rates and what that may mean for our pension. But I am super excited about what I’m seeing in terms of momentum on the productivity initiatives inside of the business. And if I could just talk about one, and then I’ll turn over to Brian and the team to talk, about a year ago, we talked to you about smart package, smart facility and how we were going to introduce RFID labeling onto our packages. We said we’d get it done this year in about 100 of our buildings. We did. It’s live now in 101 of our buildings. Let me share with you some of the results that we’re seeing because this is pretty cool. On average, one out of every 400 packages is misloaded onto a package car. That means that it cannot be delivered because it’s misloaded. It has to come back into the center, go through the sorting process again and get reloaded the next day for delivery. Talk about productivity bleed-out. That is not how we operate a business. With RFID labels, we now see that the misloads are 1 in 800 moving to 1 in 1,000 which is Six Sigma levels. So as I think about how we are going to invest through, we are definitely going to invest in accelerating smart package, smart facility because of the benefits that we are seeing inside of our business. And it’s not just the misload though a lot of it is pretty cool, imagine the elimination of all those some annual scans by our pre-loaders everyday. It’s pretty doggone exciting. So what are the productivity initiatives that we are working on?\nBrian Newman: So, Carol, thanks. And I just go back to this control what we can control and a lot will happen with the macros on the top line. But we had guided to a 13.7% on the UPS operating profit margin. Embedded underneath that was a 12% domestic margin and a 21.5% international. So Nando and the team have got a lot of initiatives from total service plan to what Carol talked about, smart package, smart facility, pushing out automation. Nando, do you want to offer a little bit of color?\nNando Cesarone: Yes, sure. So I’ll just quickly discuss the oil service plan. And while we kicked that off mid-July, we are building muscle, and it’s also allowing us to look at other activities that occur within the network that aren’t perfectly aligned with that – the total service plan. And so as we start to refine those areas, such as our administrative and clerical areas for packages that are undeliverable and other activities that were closely linked to things like cube utilization where quality becomes much easier to first visualize and then improve the cost structure as a result. And then I think one of the bigger unlocks for us is to really manage our demand through day of week and we start to flatten the demand curve for the week. We see some really impressive cost results there as we start to achieve some of those moves.\nCarol Tome: So we will give you our thoughts on ‘23 when we release our fourth quarter earnings call because we’re still in the middle of building the plan, but we’ve got a lot of initiatives underway. It doesn’t stop just in the United States, but there is some interesting initiatives underway outside of the United States, too, Kate?\nKate Gutmann: Yes, absolutely. For international, as you can imagine of it, we are all about matching the network through demand. And in some markets, that’s very good because of the record competitive wins we’re having, as you heard Brian talk about, shifting 27 of our flights to Europe for that export growth at the same time, in the moment, pulling on the throttle when we saw the lockdowns for energy in China and pulling down the 75 flights that didn’t match with demand. But on top of that, we run a significant ground network in Europe, for instance, and it’s all about utilization on the ground in the trailers to cut back on trailers, and we have cut hundreds of trailers by driving the highest production rates within that cube so that you get more. You sweat the asset of the feeder network and, therefore, reduce cost of rentals as well as drivers and trailers, all the while maintaining best-in-class on-time service performance at 98%. And it’s resonating with customers. I mentioned the growth. We are seeing, again, that competitive win that we expect to play out in the upcoming quarters as well.\nChris Wetherbee: Thank you very much. Appreciate the comments. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning and congratulations on the strong results. I wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts about sensitivity to lower international air freight rates. I think your comment on 3Q, it sounds like currency was a bigger effect. I don’t think you mentioned the impact of lower rates. But how should we think about that impact on international margin if international airfreight rates keep falling? Does that flow through to your international export, or do you have some resiliency relative to that? And then also if you kind of look back at I think at your analyst meeting and you had talked about, I don’t know if it was 21% or 21.5%, but some type of a margin level where you say after the belly space capacity comes back, this is what we get to. So, a couple of questions for you on international margin. Thank you.\nBrian Newman: So, Tom, from a service perspective, Kate and the team are doing an outstanding job in terms of managing the international rates. The air freight decline over the rates that you mentioned, those will bleed through a bit, but the reality is the margin in the third quarter, it was really all about 80%-plus was due to currency and then some of it on the U.S. export land, which we don’t control as much. So, that’s where we de-levered. We expect that volume to go up in the fourth quarter. So, we will be able to pass some of the leverage through. So, I think we have a line of sight to manage that.\nCarol Tome: Our international margin will increase sequentially Q3 to Q4. And part of that is because of the great work that Kate and team are doing to move off of charter on to brown tills [ph]. Brown tills are just a better economic equation for us, and we are utilizing the aircraft that we own, which will certainly help that margin pressure. In terms of what a good operating margin is for international, well, I don’t know. We love what we have got. We want to continue to grow it. So, Kate has declared that we are going to be number one in the premium international logistics market. So, that means higher margins.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks Tom.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Carol, I just wanted to get your thoughts on durability of pricing in the industry, especially U.S. domestic. Is there a longer term trend here to reset expectations around service levels as you kind of alluded to, coming from the historical thought process that shipping is supposed to be free? And maybe you can offer some comments around price elasticity in some of your target markets and if you see any demand destruction yet. And then, Brian, just a quick one, early on to give too much on 2023, but it’s hard to ignore the move on interest rates. So, maybe you can just – back on pensions, both above the line when it comes to U.S. domestic margins and perhaps overall sensitivity for the whole company. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: So, in terms of pricing durability, value is defined by what a customer is willing to pay, and the customer is willing to pay for the service that we provide. So, the new business that we have won and we have been winning new business has come in at very, very solid revenue quality. Now, as I look back over the past several years, from 2019 to now, we have grown our RPP in the United States by 23%. And we did that through a number different ways by renegotiating on longer term contracts, by leaning into the parts of the market that really value our end-to-end network through some demand surcharges, a little bit of help from fuel. It’s been a real success story. We have also driven productivity during that timeframe, but the margin expansion has been really driven by the RPP growth. Looking ahead, we will continue to have RPP growth. You heard Brian talk about the GRI that we just announced. But there will be more of a balance between RPP and productivity to enable our margin expansion going forward. We think that’s just the right thing to do. In fact, as we continue to drive productivity inside of our business, we are willing to give some of that back to our customers through a revenue share, is why not. If we can increase delivery density and we are seeing some good proof in our both our pilots and now our live case, we will give some of that back because we should. I think about a third, a third, a third, a third for the customer, a third for the shareholder and a third for UPS. So, we have not seen any demand destruction at this point because value is defined by what the customer is willing to pay for and service matters.\nBrian Newman: I will pick up the second part of the question in terms of the pension, and Carol alluded to it in early answer this morning that rates are moving. And pension in ‘23, it’s going to be determined by discount rates and asset performance actually on December 31st. So, it’s too early to get into specifics, but I think the gist of your question is, if the year ended today, I would expect higher discount rates would actually reduce service costs and increase our profit in the domestic business above the line. But that’s unfortunately going to be probably more than offset by higher interest expense and lower pension income below the line. So, I think net-net, in the P&L, it will be a net headwind, some favorability above the line, offset by some headwinds below the line.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Ravi Shankar of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shankar: Thanks. Good morning everyone. A couple of questions on peak. I think you mentioned the kind of 4Q volume decline is due to some contractual agreements with enterprise customers. I think you said that in 3Q as well. Can you detail that a little bit more and maybe kind of what the kind of Amazon run rate looks like by the time you exit the year? And also just broadly on peak, where are you – why is your peak season hiring flat when volumes are lower and your – and then do you have more automation than last year? We have seen some other kind of peak season hiring kind of be materially lower. So, kind of maybe some rationale at the end, that would be great.\nCarol Tome: So, first on peak volume, if you go over last year, is the easy way to think about it, between Q3 and Q4, the volume grew 25%. And then obviously, during the peak time, which is Thanksgiving through Christmas, it’s even higher than that. As we look to this year, we expect to see the similar surge Q3 to Q4 but maybe more in the 24% area. Why, because we have, as we shared with you, reached agreement with our largest customer about the volume that we will take into our network and the volume that they will deliver. So, it’s just a function of that contractual arrangement. And what that does for us, actually, it gives us room to invite additional customers into our network and give them the rate service during peak, which we are doing. In terms of the hiring question, Ravi, there is turnover in the numbers because we don’t keep everybody that we hire. It’s also just a nice round number. So, I wouldn’t read anything into that other than it’s just a nice round number. What I am super pleased about is how we have changed some of our processes to make it easier to hire people into UPS for peak. For example, we have a QR code. If you open up the QR code on your phone, you can apply for a job and get a job offer in less than 30 minutes. That’s way cool. We have shortened the time it takes to onboard a driver into our company. Last year, it was eight weeks. This year, it’s 11 days. That’s way cool. We have really put the pedal to the metal on our social messaging, if you will, our social campaign. So, by amplifying our social messages, we saw that we had 1.4 million impressions in the month of September. That’s up 60% year-on-year. We had a very successful October job fest, and Brown Friday is coming up on November 4th. We are really excited about Brown Friday. Last year, we had 85,000 applications on Brown Friday. So, we are expecting a similar amount this year. So, we are ahead of where we were a year ago on the hiring front, feeling very good because we have got to get a lot of people in to manage the surge. Brian, do you want to add something?\nBrian Newman: I would just add, Carol, Ravi, we are sort of executing the play. We had called – we had guided what does it mean at the bottom line, 11.6 full year, and that was an 11.6 1H and 11.6 2H were actually delivered the first half of the year. Obviously, a lot of changes in dynamics in the market, but we are on track to deliver an 11.7 in the back half of the year. So, net-net, Ravi, I think we are delivering what we said we would do, slightly different playbook in terms of volume price cost. But at the end of the day, executing on those contracts, it was part of the original plan.\nRavi Shankar: Great. Thanks both.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi. Just sort of curious on peak, I know you mentioned higher ships or maybe back towards December. Sort of what gives you confidence in that? And does that sort of imply that maybe things have started a little slower, but you are hearing from your customers that it’s going to do that shift back to sort of traditional patterns, pre-COVID patterns? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: Remember last year, when there were all these supply chain dams and inventory was at very low levels, everyone was saying shop early, shop early, shop early. So, we just believe that the inventory levels are in much better shape than they were a year ago. So, we are going to return to a more normalized shopping pattern for peak. And if we can just talk about the tone of business, current business, here it is. It’s almost Halloween, October was good.\nBrian Newman: Yes. We have got an extra delivery day, Jordan, in December, so feeling good. We expect the peak to be a little bit later, and we are ready for it.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks and good morning. So, Carol, in your prepared remarks, you talked about Logistics-as-a-Service. And I was just curious if you could expand a little bit on that and kind of how you see that holding and if there is any external benchmarks that we should be looking at to kind of mark the progress on that. Thanks.\nCarol Tome: So, we are building Logistics-as-a-Service, and it’s very early days, but it includes components of what we have talked to you about in the past. One of the pillars of Logistics-as-a-Service is improving delivery density. And as you know, we have been partnering with CommerceHub to go upstream in the cart to improve delivery density with our live use case. It’s doing very well. So, we are adding additional customers on to that platform. The second pillar of Logistics-as-a-Service is improving visibility end-to-end and we have talked to you about this in the past, I think we called it project with all other project symphony. But it really is proving visibility from the manufacturer all the way to the end of distribution clients. That part of Logistics-as-a-Service, the third pillar is proving financial solutions. We do that today through UPS Capital, where we had a very robust insurance product. We are looking at adding some additional financial products to that filler. We then move to I will say, advanced capabilities, which is including technology to help you, understand how to optimize your supply chain, warehousing fulfillment for shipping. And then lastly, while we have a very good returns business, we think we could have a robust reverse logistics business, and all of this will be powered by technology. So, the way to measure this in the future will be in a number of different ways. But basically, this is going to create new revenue streams for us. So, as we build this out, we will put these new revenue streams into our plans, and then we will share those with you. And then you can hold us accountable to those plans.\nTodd Fowler: Sounds good. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey. Good morning guys. Two quick ones for me. Brian, you mentioned you quantified the productivity tailwind sort of accelerating into the fourth quarter. Should we be expecting that same sort of order of magnitude productivity on the domestic side as we go through the next couple of quarters here as you annualize the impact of the total service plan and the RFID tracking and that kind of stuff? Just wondering whether how much of that is sensitive to overall volume levels, or should we expect that same sort of dollar value or productivity in the first half of next year? And then with respect to the union agreements you guys have reached with the pilots and the mechanics, can you talk a little bit about kind of the level of adjustments that were made there and whether there is any read across to the broader negotiation for next year?\nBrian Newman: Happy to take the cost question. So look, the momentum with Nando and the team, they are really just getting started. We saw CPP growth about double digit in the first half. That will be high-single digit in the second half of the year. We would probably expect to see that trajectory continue to next year. I don’t want to get ahead of my skis though. So, we will come out at the end of the fourth quarter and give you some guidance for RPP and CPP for next year.\nCarol Tome: We were pleased with the contract extensions that we had both with our pilots as well as our aviation mechanics. The terms of those contract extensions were in line with the longer term financial plans that we had already built. So, we felt very good about that. But more importantly, with the percentage of the UPSers who voted in favor of the contract extension, I was delighted with that. It exceeded our expectations and it speaks volumes to the relationships that we have with our employees and the fact that these are really great jobs. So, the only read-through to the upcoming Teamster contract negotiation would be the – we have got a great relationship with our employees, and these are great jobs.\nDavid Vernon: Thanks for the time.\nBrian Newman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan: Hi. Good morning everyone and thanks operator. Just want to touch on equipment and capacity quickly. Brian, you mentioned higher maintenance costs. Is that just a function of inflation, or is that fleet age, too? And if it’s fleet age, when do you think that starts to normalize? And then maybe just to follow-up quickly on the aircraft fleet side. You had some other providers out there that are looking to reduce capacity? Any plans for you to do the same as we look at risk in ‘23? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: So, from a maintenance perspective, we have actually gone to a very systematic, programmatic approach and gone out with multiyear. On the airline, for example, we now have a 10-year maintenance program to manage the fleet age of the equipment. It is going up in terms of age and therefore we factor that in on more of a normalized run rate over the next decade.\nBruce Chan: Okay. And then just as far as capacity on the fleet side, any plans to reduce, or you are going to keep things fairly static?\nBrian Newman: So, right now, we announced some recent acquisitions with Boeing. And so we have the next several years outlined. We will remain fluid on that as we track volumes and shift the aircraft around.\nCarol Tome: I guess part of the advantage of having an aging fleet is that we can retire if need be.\nBrian Newman: That’s right.\nCarol Tome: But the best news is actually replacing the aircraft with better energy-efficient aircraft and more – and actually take our cost down.\nBrian Newman: As we set down, some of the MD11s from a sustainability standpoint, that’s a positive thing from an operating – productivity standpoint, that’s also a positive thing. So, that’s part of the overall strategy that we have run over the next 10 years.\nKen Cook: And Steven, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch on the upstream delivery density pilot, Carol, that you mentioned. Maybe if you could share any KPIs from that pilot, what you saw that gave you confidence to expand it with other customers and kind of what we should be looking for in terms of the eventual rollout of that platform? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yes. So, it’s still early days, Stephanie, but we are pleased with what we are seeing. We were in pilot, then we went live with one of our customers, and we started to see good matches. But to get that one-tenth improvement and delivery density, you really need a 5% match. And we weren’t seeing 5%. So, what we just did is we increased the whole time. We had been holding the orders in the car for an hour. We increased the whole time six hours. And now we are starting to see a creep up to that 5% match. That’s cool because a 5% match, then if you translate it out, to our opportunity set, that’s a one-tenth improvement in delivery density, which is a $300 million value unlock. So, early, early days, but really like what we are seeing.\nEnd of Q&A:\nKen Cook: Excellent. Alright. Well, thanks everybody for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you all next quarter. And that concludes our call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover four areas, starting with the macro environment, then our third quarter results. Next, I will cover cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I will wrap up with some comments on our outlook for the rest of the year. In the third quarter, the macro environment remained dynamic. In the U.S., we continue to see cross currents driven by the strong job market and healthy consumer spending despite higher inflation and interest rates. Internationally, the macro environment weakened more than we expected due to high inflation, volatile energy prices, lockdowns in Asia, and the war in Eastern Europe. We responded quickly to the changing market conditions by leveraging the agility of our global integrated network to provide excellent service to our customers and deliver our bottom line commitments to shareowners. In the third quarter, consolidated revenue increased 4.2% to $24.2 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.1 billion, 6% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13% which was 20 basis points above last year. For the third quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.99, up 10.3% from the same period last year. Now, let's look at our business segments. In U.S. domestic, our revenue quality efforts and the execution of our planned cost initiatives drove third quarter results above our expectations. In the third quarter, average daily volume was down 1.5% versus the same time period last year, but the growth rate was an improvement over the first half of 2022 as new volume from the record number of wins we had in the second quarter came into the network. In the third quarter, the gap between year-over-year B2C and B2B average daily volume growth rates narrowed as we lapped more normalized consumer shopping behaviors. B2C average daily volume declined 2.2% driven by contractual agreements we reached with certain enterprise customers. B2B average daily volume was down 0.5% year-over-year due to declines in manufacturing volumes, which was partially offset by growth in retail B2B driven by returns volume. In the third quarter, B2B represented 42.8% of our volume, which was up slightly from the 42.4% in the same period last year. Looking at customer mix, the execution of our strategy is continuing to drive improvement. In the third quarter, we grew SMB average daily volume, including platforms, 1.9% and SMBs made up 28.3% of our total U.S. domestic volume in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from 1 year ago. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $15.4 billion up 8.2%. Revenue per piece increased 9.8%, more than offsetting the decline in volume. Our revenue quality efforts continue to deliver results. In the third quarter, about one-third of the revenue per piece growth rate increase came from continued strength in base pricing. Another third of the revenue per piece growth rate increase came from changes in fuel price per gallon and the final third came from the combination of mix and our fuel pricing actions. Turning to costs, total expense grew 7%. Wages and benefits contributed about 310 basis points of the increase driven by the annual increase for our teams to employees that went into effect in August. Fuel drove 220 basis points of the expense growth rate increase due primarily to the rise in price per gallon compared to last year and the remaining variance was driven by multiple factors, including maintenance and depreciation. Cost in U.S. domestic came in as we expected due to our planned productivity initiatives, which drove our cost per piece growth rate to be lower in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter and partially offsetting wage and benefit increases. We are continuing to see the benefits of our cube utilization and other productivity efforts, including total service plan, which launched on July 11. I will share more about our productivity initiatives in a moment. To sum it up, revenue growth was above expense growth, which created positive operating leverage for the seventh consecutive quarter. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, an increase of $272 million or 19.2% compared to the third quarter of 2021. And operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 11%. Moving to our International segment. The global macro environment continued to soften, but we remained agile and flexed our network in response to changing market conditions and delivering excellent service to our customers. At the beginning of the quarter, we expected the international average daily volume growth rate to improve compared to the first half of 2022, and it did. However, it did not improve as much as we anticipated due to continued macro softening. In the third quarter, international average daily volume was down 5.2%. Total export average daily volume declined 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. China export volume declined due to lockdown and disruptions to manufacturing output. In response, we quickly adjusted the network and canceled 75 China and Hong Kong origin flights and rerouted 27 flights to other gateways in support of our customers. These changes enabled us to move volume for our customers where it was available, maintain high levels of service and achieve a payload utilization of over 98% on our Asia outbound intercontinental flights in the third quarter. Looking at Europe. We continue to win on our speed and service advantages at strong revenue quality despite softer market conditions. We grew transborder average daily volume 2.6%, and total Europe export average daily volume grew 0.6% in the third quarter. In the third quarter, international revenue increased 1.7% and to $4.8 billion, which included a negative currency impact of $335 million and a fuel benefit of $363 million. Revenue per piece increased 6.4%, which included the fuel and currency impacts I just covered and a 510 basis point increase from the combination of product mix and revenue quality actions we took. Operating profit in the International segment was $1 billion, which included an $82 million negative impact from currency. There was no year-over-year impact from fuel on international operating profit. Operating margin in the third quarter was 20.9%, which was down from the same period last year due to the delevering of our fixed costs and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. Our teams continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment in the third quarter and did an excellent job serving our customers and managing costs to deliver year-over-year operating margin expansion. In the third quarter, revenue was $4 billion down $268 million year-over-year, which included a $92 million negative impact from currency. Looking at the key drivers. In freight forwarding, declines in volume and market rates reduced revenue and operating profit. However, the team was able to effectively manage buy/sell spreads and continued supporting our customers. Within Forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit delivered strong operating profit growth driven by revenue quality initiatives. And Logistics delivered strong top and bottom-line growth driven by our complex healthcare business from cold chain, clinical trials and medical device customers. In the third quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $459 million and delivered a record third quarter operating margin of 11.5%, an increase of 100 basis points over last year. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $297 million, and our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21%, which was better than we expected due primarily to discrete items. Let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we've generated $10.8 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow was $8.5 billion. And so far this year, UPS has paid $3.8 billion in dividends and completed $2.2 billion in share buybacks. Now I'll make a few comments regarding our outlook. According to IHS, full year global GDP is expected to grow 2.8% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 1.7%. Both are lower than their forecast at the beginning of the year. We are continuing to pay close attention to macro elements, including lockdowns in Asia, inflationary pressures, the health of the consumer and the geopolitical environment. Needless to say, the macroeconomic environment is much different now versus our expectations when we started the year. But by controlling what we can control, quickly adjusting the network to match changes in volume levels and delivering excellent service to our customers, we are still on track to deliver our full year financial targets. We expect consolidated revenues to be around $102 billion. Consolidated operating margin is expected to be about 13.7% and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%. Now let me give a little color on the fourth quarter. Starting with U.S. domestic, we anticipate fourth quarter 2022 revenue growth of around 4.5% driven by strong revenue quality, and we expect fourth quarter operating margin to expand year-over-year to around 12.4%. Looking at peak in the U.S., we expect peak volume to come in heavier later in the peak period, and we have one additional delivery day compared to last year, which gives us more flexibility. As you update your models for U.S. domestic, there are a few things to keep in mind. We anticipate the average daily volume growth rate will be lower in the fourth quarter of 2022 than in the third quarter due to contractual agreements we have reached with certain enterprise customers. Second, we expect increases in wage and benefit rates will be higher than the same time period last year due to the annual increase our teams or employees received in August. And third, we are continuing to execute our productivity initiatives to help offset wage and benefit rate increases. Our biggest productivity initiative is total service plan, which is performing as planned. Since the launch on July 11, we've improved our driver dispatch timeliness by 13%. This is about getting our drivers out of the building on time, which creates a more predictable environment for our employees and better service for our customers. Also, in regard to productivity in the third quarter, we brought on additional automation in the network prior to peak, including automated tagging, robotic small store induction and autonomous – vehicles. As a result of all these efforts, we expect the U.S. domestic fourth quarter 2022 cost per piece growth rate to be lower than it was in the third quarter of 2022. Moving to international. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be relatively flat to the fourth quarter of last year. We anticipate our share growth and revenue quality initiatives will offset the weaker macroeconomic environment and negative currency impacts, and we expect international operating margin to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2022 to around 21.5% as we continue to respond to market changes with agility. In Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter to be above $4 billion as we partially offset declines in the air and ocean freight forwarding revenue with continued growth in logistics and our healthcare business. Operating margin for Supply Chain Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2022 is expected to be around 11.4% as we continue to effectively manage the buy/sell spreads in a dynamic environment. Turning to capital allocation for the full year. In 2022, we expect free cash flow to be above $9 billion, including pension contributions to fund annual service costs. Capital expenditures are now expected to be about $5 billion, which is $500 million less than our original plan. The largest driver of the variance is the result of our decision to lease certain facilities instead of purchasing them. This approach enables us to maintain higher levels of agility and further improve our overall capital structure. We plan to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval. We have repaid $2 billion in debt this year as planned, including $1 billion in October. We expect to complete at least $3 billion in share repurchases for the year. And lastly, we expect the tax rate for the full year to be around 22%. Before I wrap up, last week, we announced our U.S. general rate increase. The 2023 increase will be 6.9%, reflecting the value of the services we offer and cost inflation in the market. The details have been posted to ups.com. Executing our strategy under better not bigger has led to a greater agility across our business and stronger financial performance. Our move to better and bolder enables future growth in revenue and margin. By combining the strength of our physical network with new digital capabilities, we will continue providing excellent service to our customers, win in the most attractive parts of the market, increase the efficiency of our operations and create value for our shareowners. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines. Hey, Allison. Good morning. So we had talked about driving productivity of about $300 million in the back half of the year. No more than half of that is going to come in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, and TSP is one of the largest drivers of that. We're actually on track, and we're seeing the system running more on time. I called out in my prepared remarks 13% increase in terms of the efficiency and the drivers. So the idle time is decreasing, and we're very pleased with the performance. Yes, Amit. In terms of the international side, it is a challenging macro environment out there. But we expect total volume levels in Q4 will actually be higher than Q3, improving utilization from an ADV perspective. Growth rates, we expect to improve. We're looking to win share in Europe, execute on the initiatives to grow the U.S. export lane, which going into the peak season is helpful. So there are lots of cost initiatives that Kate and the team are executing real time. I think you saw that in sort of the flexibility with taking down flights in Asia and rerouting to where the customer needs were. So we feel great about the agility of the international business. So, Carol, thanks. And I just go back to this control what we can control and a lot will happen with the macros on the top line. But we had guided to a 13.7% on the UPS operating profit margin. Embedded underneath that was a 12% domestic margin and a 21.5% international. So Nando and the team have got a lot of initiatives from total service plan to what Carol talked about, smart package, smart facility, pushing out automation. Nando, do you want to offer a little bit of color? So, Tom, from a service perspective, Kate and the team are doing an outstanding job in terms of managing the international rates. The air freight decline over the rates that you mentioned, those will bleed through a bit, but the reality is the margin in the third quarter, it was really all about 80%-plus was due to currency and then some of it on the U.S. export land, which we don't control as much. So, that's where we de-levered. We expect that volume to go up in the fourth quarter. So, we will be able to pass some of the leverage through. So, I think we have a line of sight to manage that. Thanks Tom. I will pick up the second part of the question in terms of the pension, and Carol alluded to it in early answer this morning that rates are moving. And pension in ‘23, it's going to be determined by discount rates and asset performance actually on December 31st. So, it's too early to get into specifics, but I think the gist of your question is, if the year ended today, I would expect higher discount rates would actually reduce service costs and increase our profit in the domestic business above the line. But that's unfortunately going to be probably more than offset by higher interest expense and lower pension income below the line. So, I think net-net, in the P&L, it will be a net headwind, some favorability above the line, offset by some headwinds below the line. I would just add, Carol, Ravi, we are sort of executing the play. We had called – we had guided what does it mean at the bottom line, 11.6 full year, and that was an 11.6 1H and 11.6 2H were actually delivered the first half of the year. Obviously, a lot of changes in dynamics in the market, but we are on track to deliver an 11.7 in the back half of the year. So, net-net, Ravi, I think we are delivering what we said we would do, slightly different playbook in terms of volume price cost. But at the end of the day, executing on those contracts, it was part of the original plan. Yes. We have got an extra delivery day, Jordan, in December, so feeling good. We expect the peak to be a little bit later, and we are ready for it. Happy to take the cost question. So look, the momentum with Nando and the team, they are really just getting started. We saw CPP growth about double digit in the first half. That will be high-single digit in the second half of the year. We would probably expect to see that trajectory continue to next year. I don't want to get ahead of my skis though. So, we will come out at the end of the fourth quarter and give you some guidance for RPP and CPP for next year. Thank you. So, from a maintenance perspective, we have actually gone to a very systematic, programmatic approach and gone out with multiyear. On the airline, for example, we now have a 10-year maintenance program to manage the fleet age of the equipment. It is going up in terms of age and therefore we factor that in on more of a normalized run rate over the next decade. So, right now, we announced some recent acquisitions with Boeing. And so we have the next several years outlined. We will remain fluid on that as we track volumes and shift the aircraft around. That's right. As we set down, some of the MD11s from a sustainability standpoint, that's a positive thing from an operating – productivity standpoint, that's also a positive thing. So, that's part of the overall strategy that we have run over the next 10 years."

            "name": "Carol Tome",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking all UPSers for their hard work and dedication to service. I am proud of the unstoppable spirit of UPSers everywhere and how they leverage the agility of our global integrated network to deliver outstanding service for our customers and strong results for our shareowners. In the third quarter, the global economy softened, especially outside the United States. International and freight forwarding volumes were challenged, but we quickly responded. We adjusted our network to match volume levels and continue to win in the most attractive parts of the market. For the third quarter, consolidated revenue rose 4.2% from last year to $24.2 billion and operating profit grew 6% to $3.1 billion. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13%, a 20 basis point improvement from last year. This was our highest third quarter consolidated operating margin in 15 years. Turning to our strategic update. The execution of our customer first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy has fundamentally improved to nearly every aspect of our business, causing better revenue quality, higher operating margins and improved bottom line results. Building on the strong foundation created by our better not bigger approach, we are moving to the next phase of our strategic framework, better and bolder. What do we mean by better and bolder? First, the better part of our framework is not changing. We will continue to focus on growing value share, improving the customer experience and driving higher productivity from the assets we own. Bolder is about moving faster to grow in our targeted market segment. It's also about combining digital solutions with our global integrated network to create more value for our customers and new revenue opportunities for UPS. We plan to combine the capabilities of our strong standalone digital services, including Roadie, Coyote, delivery solutions, UPS Capital and our partnership with CommerceHub, to create a powerful offering of logistics as a service. And when we combine logistics as a service with our integrated physical network, we believe we will be unstoppable. We will share more detail about better and bolder in the coming quarters, but let me give you two examples of what we are doing. On our second quarter earnings call, I introduced our upstream delivery density solution. Here we are building a digital platform that goes upstream to look at orders, in other words, packages at the shopping card level. We then match this new order with other orders that have the same delivery day commitment, which creates delivery density. We have gone live with one customer and we are delighted with the results we have seen. In fact, we are currently onboarding several new customers to the platform. Another example of better and bolder is our pending acquisition of Bomi Group, whose network of healthcare facilities in Europe and Latin America and expertise in cold chain will help accelerate growth in complex healthcare. Along with our recent expansion of UPS Premier in Europe, we are on track to generate at least $10 billion in healthcare revenue in 2023. Now, let's look at the three legs of our strategy, starting with customer first. Customer first is about creating a frictionless customer experience targeted at the parts of the market where we want to grow, including SMBs, healthcare, international and certain large enterprise accounts. Given global economic softening, we are convinced that a relentless focus on customer first matters now more than ever before and we believe our strategy is working, because we have continued to gain share. For example, we are leveraging our time in transit and visibility advantages in Europe to win. In fact, we grew Europe export volume in the third quarter. Another example is the growth we are seeing in our digital access program, or DAP. In the third quarter, we grew U.S. SMB average daily volume, including platforms, by 1.9% and SMBs made up 28.3% of our total U.S. volume in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from last year. DAP continues to add partners and revenue with more than 3 million merchants shipping with DAP in the first 9 months of this year, we generated over $1.6 billion in DAP revenue and we expect to exceed our $2 billion DAP revenue target in 2022. Moving to the people-led part of our strategy, our people are our most valuable assets. And it's important to us that every UPSer views our company as a great place to work. We know that when we take care of our people, they will take care of our customers. Recently, UPS reached contract extension agreements with the Independent Pilots Association and our aircraft maintenance technicians. Both contracts continued to reward these UPSers with industry-leading pay and benefits and will help ensure the company's future success. And we are making other changes to improve our employee experience and satisfaction. For example, through what we call our operator experience program, we recently worked with our U.S. drivers to create individual lives' dispatch plans, giving them more choice over the hours they work. We also automated tasks and reorganized our operations team to improve work life balance for our operating supervisors. And for our management employees globally, we are evaluating our overall pay mix composition. While total compensation compares favorably with the market, we may have some opportunities to rework the pay mix to make our compensation even more attractive. Now to the last leg of our strategy, innovation-driven. This is about driving more productivity from the assets we own. Our integrated network is the best in the industry, but we are leveraging data and technology to make it even smarter, more automated and more efficient. In the third quarter, our productivity improvements continued to deliver benefits. In the U.S., we optimize trailer loads by eliminating nearly 1,000 loads per day compared to the third quarter of last year and we successfully managed ours in line with volume level. We also launched total service plan, which is about running a predictable on-time network. Execution is going as planned. And as of last week, our on-time computer departures and arrivals improved 6.5% compared to last year, reducing idle time in the network. Additionally, this month, we completed the initial rollout of our smart package smart facility, which enables RFID label technology in 101 buildings in our network. Further, we opened our eighth regional hub in the United States. Located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, this 800,000 square foot automated hub provides significant processing horsepower to better serve the Northeast corridor. It helps enable greater network flexibility across the U.S. This hub is also home to UPS' largest natural gas fueling station within our network. This fueling station will remove 8 million gallons of diesel fuel per year. That's equivalent to removing more than 17,000 gasoline-powered passenger cars from the road. Turning to peak. For the last four holiday seasons, UPS has been the industry leader in on-time delivery performance and we intend for that to continue. This outperformance doesn't happen by accident. We built our integrated network to flex with volume and our investments in our people, automation and technology enable greater agility. To prepare for peak, we made enhancements to all of the areas of our business that delivered a great peak last year. Let me share a few details about our peak plans for this year, starting with volume. This year, we anticipate our volumes will peak later in December compared to last year as we expect consumers will return to more pre-pandemic shopping behaviors. While we will continue to use technology to match daily capacity with customer demand, we are also optimizing air and ground volume to make room for new customers where we can add the most value. While we will have a peak, as Brian will detail, overall volume in the fourth quarter is expected to decline from last year due to contractual agreements. In terms of labor, we will bring on more than 100,000 seasonal hires this year related to hiring. We are ahead of where we were this time last year. One reason is because we have made the digital hiring process even faster and easier this year. We have also improved training for our new driver helpers, which shortens the amount of time from hire to dispatched. Newly hired driver helpers can complete training on their phones and begin work on Day 1. Bottom line, we are ready to deliver another successful peak. Let me end by reaffirming our 2022 targets of consolidated revenue of around $102 billion, consolidated operating margin of about 13.7% and return on invested capital greater than 30%. In the face of a very dynamic macro environment, we are demonstrating more agility than ever before. We are focused on controlling what we can control. And under our better and bolder framework, we are combining digital capabilities with our global integrated network to continue winning in the most attractive parts of the market, driving operational excellence and delivering best-in-class service for our customers. So thank you for listening. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian. Maybe just a little more color there. Our overtime hours were down 1 million hours in the quarter. Our bench has dropped from 29% to 20% and we reduced fluctuations in driver pay days by 39%. So the plan is working, and we just got started with it on July 3. Well, starting with the question on market share, a big turning point for our company is when we invested in fastest ground ever, improving our time in transit. And yes, we are advantaged or at parity in 17 of the top 25 markets. We offer 7-day residential service, Saturday pickup for our business customers. So this has made a significant difference in our business. And if you look at it through the lens of market share, just looking at SMB in the United States, we see that – we have seen that we've grown both revenue and ADB market share ahead of our competitors. And when we look at it through the lens of enterprise, we've grown revenue share. So we are delighted with the share gains that we've seen in United States, but the share gains continued outside of the United States as well. Super pleased of the time in transit advantage that we have in Europe and what that's meant for share gains in Europe despite the very uncertain market. Well, maybe I'll start with just a philosophical approach to building a plan for ‘23. And then we can have both Brian and Nando talk about some of our cost initiatives. Kate can join in too. So first, this is a very interesting time to be building a financial plan because there is so much uncertainty, there is economic uncertainty, there is still political uncertainty. We do have a contract that's coming up for renewal next year as well. So there is a lot of uncertainty. But here is our philosophical approach to building the plan. One, we're going to stay on strategy because we believe that we should invest through whatever comes our way so that we can continue to improve the customer experience as well as the employee experience. So we're going to stay on strategy. We're going to build more agility into our plan than we've seen before. And I would say we're pretty agile today. Well, we're going to – we have to be able to turn on a dime, and so we're going to build agility into the plan. We're going to build a plan of conservatism because if you're too optimistic, then your expenses are too high and then there is a whole bunch of wood you have to chop to get those expenses out. So we will plan conservatively and we will factor into the plan some of the challenges that will come our way as a result of higher interest rates and what that may mean for our pension. But I am super excited about what I'm seeing in terms of momentum on the productivity initiatives inside of the business. And if I could just talk about one, and then I'll turn over to Brian and the team to talk, about a year ago, we talked to you about smart package, smart facility and how we were going to introduce RFID labeling onto our packages. We said we'd get it done this year in about 100 of our buildings. We did. It's live now in 101 of our buildings. Let me share with you some of the results that we're seeing because this is pretty cool. On average, one out of every 400 packages is misloaded onto a package car. That means that it cannot be delivered because it's misloaded. It has to come back into the center, go through the sorting process again and get reloaded the next day for delivery. Talk about productivity bleed-out. That is not how we operate a business. With RFID labels, we now see that the misloads are 1 in 800 moving to 1 in 1,000 which is Six Sigma levels. So as I think about how we are going to invest through, we are definitely going to invest in accelerating smart package, smart facility because of the benefits that we are seeing inside of our business. And it's not just the misload though a lot of it is pretty cool, imagine the elimination of all those some annual scans by our pre-loaders everyday. It's pretty doggone exciting. So what are the productivity initiatives that we are working on? So we will give you our thoughts on ‘23 when we release our fourth quarter earnings call because we're still in the middle of building the plan, but we've got a lot of initiatives underway. It doesn't stop just in the United States, but there is some interesting initiatives underway outside of the United States, too, Kate? Our international margin will increase sequentially Q3 to Q4. And part of that is because of the great work that Kate and team are doing to move off of charter on to brown tills [ph]. Brown tills are just a better economic equation for us, and we are utilizing the aircraft that we own, which will certainly help that margin pressure. In terms of what a good operating margin is for international, well, I don't know. We love what we have got. We want to continue to grow it. So, Kate has declared that we are going to be number one in the premium international logistics market. So, that means higher margins. Thank you. So, in terms of pricing durability, value is defined by what a customer is willing to pay, and the customer is willing to pay for the service that we provide. So, the new business that we have won and we have been winning new business has come in at very, very solid revenue quality. Now, as I look back over the past several years, from 2019 to now, we have grown our RPP in the United States by 23%. And we did that through a number different ways by renegotiating on longer term contracts, by leaning into the parts of the market that really value our end-to-end network through some demand surcharges, a little bit of help from fuel. It's been a real success story. We have also driven productivity during that timeframe, but the margin expansion has been really driven by the RPP growth. Looking ahead, we will continue to have RPP growth. You heard Brian talk about the GRI that we just announced. But there will be more of a balance between RPP and productivity to enable our margin expansion going forward. We think that's just the right thing to do. In fact, as we continue to drive productivity inside of our business, we are willing to give some of that back to our customers through a revenue share, is why not. If we can increase delivery density and we are seeing some good proof in our both our pilots and now our live case, we will give some of that back because we should. I think about a third, a third, a third, a third for the customer, a third for the shareholder and a third for UPS. So, we have not seen any demand destruction at this point because value is defined by what the customer is willing to pay for and service matters. So, first on peak volume, if you go over last year, is the easy way to think about it, between Q3 and Q4, the volume grew 25%. And then obviously, during the peak time, which is Thanksgiving through Christmas, it's even higher than that. As we look to this year, we expect to see the similar surge Q3 to Q4 but maybe more in the 24% area. Why, because we have, as we shared with you, reached agreement with our largest customer about the volume that we will take into our network and the volume that they will deliver. So, it's just a function of that contractual arrangement. And what that does for us, actually, it gives us room to invite additional customers into our network and give them the rate service during peak, which we are doing. In terms of the hiring question, Ravi, there is turnover in the numbers because we don't keep everybody that we hire. It's also just a nice round number. So, I wouldn't read anything into that other than it's just a nice round number. What I am super pleased about is how we have changed some of our processes to make it easier to hire people into UPS for peak. For example, we have a QR code. If you open up the QR code on your phone, you can apply for a job and get a job offer in less than 30 minutes. That's way cool. We have shortened the time it takes to onboard a driver into our company. Last year, it was eight weeks. This year, it's 11 days. That's way cool. We have really put the pedal to the metal on our social messaging, if you will, our social campaign. So, by amplifying our social messages, we saw that we had 1.4 million impressions in the month of September. That's up 60% year-on-year. We had a very successful October job fest, and Brown Friday is coming up on November 4th. We are really excited about Brown Friday. Last year, we had 85,000 applications on Brown Friday. So, we are expecting a similar amount this year. So, we are ahead of where we were a year ago on the hiring front, feeling very good because we have got to get a lot of people in to manage the surge. Brian, do you want to add something? Remember last year, when there were all these supply chain dams and inventory was at very low levels, everyone was saying shop early, shop early, shop early. So, we just believe that the inventory levels are in much better shape than they were a year ago. So, we are going to return to a more normalized shopping pattern for peak. And if we can just talk about the tone of business, current business, here it is. It's almost Halloween, October was good. So, we are building Logistics-as-a-Service, and it's very early days, but it includes components of what we have talked to you about in the past. One of the pillars of Logistics-as-a-Service is improving delivery density. And as you know, we have been partnering with CommerceHub to go upstream in the cart to improve delivery density with our live use case. It's doing very well. So, we are adding additional customers on to that platform. The second pillar of Logistics-as-a-Service is improving visibility end-to-end and we have talked to you about this in the past, I think we called it project with all other project symphony. But it really is proving visibility from the manufacturer all the way to the end of distribution clients. That part of Logistics-as-a-Service, the third pillar is proving financial solutions. We do that today through UPS Capital, where we had a very robust insurance product. We are looking at adding some additional financial products to that filler. We then move to I will say, advanced capabilities, which is including technology to help you, understand how to optimize your supply chain, warehousing fulfillment for shipping. And then lastly, while we have a very good returns business, we think we could have a robust reverse logistics business, and all of this will be powered by technology. So, the way to measure this in the future will be in a number of different ways. But basically, this is going to create new revenue streams for us. So, as we build this out, we will put these new revenue streams into our plans, and then we will share those with you. And then you can hold us accountable to those plans. Thank you. We were pleased with the contract extensions that we had both with our pilots as well as our aviation mechanics. The terms of those contract extensions were in line with the longer term financial plans that we had already built. So, we felt very good about that. But more importantly, with the percentage of the UPSers who voted in favor of the contract extension, I was delighted with that. It exceeded our expectations and it speaks volumes to the relationships that we have with our employees and the fact that these are really great jobs. So, the only read-through to the upcoming Teamster contract negotiation would be the – we have got a great relationship with our employees, and these are great jobs. I guess part of the advantage of having an aging fleet is that we can retire if need be. But the best news is actually replacing the aircraft with better energy-efficient aircraft and more – and actually take our cost down. Yes. So, it's still early days, Stephanie, but we are pleased with what we are seeing. We were in pilot, then we went live with one of our customers, and we started to see good matches. But to get that one-tenth improvement and delivery density, you really need a 5% match. And we weren't seeing 5%. So, what we just did is we increased the whole time. We had been holding the orders in the car for an hour. We increased the whole time six hours. And now we are starting to see a creep up to that 5% match. That's cool because a 5% match, then if you translate it out, to our opportunity set, that's a one-tenth improvement in delivery density, which is a $300 million value unlock. So, early, early days, but really like what we are seeing."

            "content": "Yes, sure. So I'll just quickly discuss the oil service plan. And while we kicked that off mid-July, we are building muscle, and it's also allowing us to look at other activities that occur within the network that aren't perfectly aligned with that – the total service plan. And so as we start to refine those areas, such as our administrative and clerical areas for packages that are undeliverable and other activities that were closely linked to things like cube utilization where quality becomes much easier to first visualize and then improve the cost structure as a result. And then I think one of the bigger unlocks for us is to really manage our demand through day of week and we start to flatten the demand curve for the week. We see some really impressive cost results there as we start to achieve some of those moves."

And in some markets, that's very good because of the record competitive wins we're having, as you heard Brian talk about, shifting 27 of our flights to Europe for that export growth at the same time, in the moment, pulling on the throttle when we saw the lockdowns for energy in China and pulling down the 75 flights that didn't match with demand. But on top of that, we run a significant ground network in Europe, for instance, and it's all about utilization on the ground in the trailers to cut back on trailers, and we have cut hundreds of trailers by driving the highest production rates within that cube so that you get more. You sweat the asset of the feeder network and, therefore, reduce cost of rentals as well as drivers and trailers, all the while maintaining best-in-class on-time service performance at 98%. And it's resonating with customers. I mentioned the growth. We are seeing, again, that competitive win that we expect to play out in the upcoming quarters as well."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nKen Cook: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2021 Form 10-K, our first quarter 2022 Form 10-Q and other reports we file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results.  For the second quarter of 2022, GAAP results include after-tax transformation and other charges of $31 million or $0.04 per diluted share. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website along with the webcast of today's call.  Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions]. And now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Ken, and good morning. Let me begin by recognizing our more than 500,000 UPSers around the world for their dedication, hard work and efforts. Our founder, Jim Casey, said, \"We do what we promise.\" And in the second quarter, our UPSers did just that. They not only met, they exceeded our promises to our customers, our shareowners and each other.  In the second quarter, the macro environment remained dynamic. We expected volume levels to decline from last year. They did, but more than we planned, given a number of factors that Brian will detail. Despite the decline in volume, we continue to win in the most attractive parts of the market with strong gains and revenue quality. Under our better, not bigger strategy, our actions are creating a more resilient UPS. We are delivering better service for our customers and stronger financial results for our shareowners.  For the second quarter, consolidated revenue rose 5.7% from last year to $24.8 billion and operating profit grew 9.3% to $3.6 billion. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14.4%, a 40 basis point improvement from last year, and it was our highest quarterly consolidated operating margin in nearly 15 years. All business segments delivered operating profit growth. And I'd like to give a shout-out to our Supply Chain Solutions businesses, which delivered operating profit of $517 million, a record high performance.  Moving to our strategic update. Our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy is powering consistent improvement across our company. Starting with customer-first, which is about creating a frictionless customer experience, we are growing in the parts of the market where we want to grow, like SMBs, health care, B2B and certain large enterprise accounts.  How are we doing that? By providing outstanding service and focusing on the capabilities that matter the most to our customers. Let me share a few new highlights with you.  Starting with our recent acquisition of Delivery Solutions. This is a carrier-agnostic digital platform that enables companies to easily optimize their deliveries across dozens of physical networks through a single connection. Carriers include routing and other same-day services, along with curbside pickup and small package shipping, further adding to UPS' array of digital commerce solutions for our customers.  Next, we are continuing to win with SMBs by making it easier for them to ship with us. Our new digital pricing platform called Deal Manager, that we discussed last quarter simplifies and accelerates the pricing process for larger SMB customers and is performing better than we expected. Our win rate is 12 percentage points higher than we anticipated, which helped drive our U.S. SMB growth rate in the second quarter. Later this year, Deal Manager will be rolled out to our international small package business, starting with Canada and Germany.  Additionally, DAP, our digital access program, is continuing to grow in the U.S. and internationally. In the first 6 months of this year, DAP generated more than $1 billion in revenue putting this well on our way to achieving our $2 billion revenue target in 2022.  And looking at SMBs, in the U.S., in the second quarter, we grew SMB average daily volume, including platforms by 3.3%, which was faster than the market. SMBs made up 29.2% of our total U.S. volume in the quarter, an increase of 200 basis points from 1 year ago.  While our international volume levels were challenged in the second quarter, due to the ongoing war in Eastern Europe and COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia, that didn't stop us from investing in our business. We recently launched a new daily flight from our Cologne air hub that connects key manufacturing cities in Asia. This flight speeds up transit times across multiple intra-Asia tradelanes and provides greater connectivity to the UPS global network, including to the U.S. and Europe.  And speaking of Europe, did you know that UPS has the fastest ground network in Europe? In fact, we are faster by at least 1 day on the ground in over 1/3 of the market, and we will continue to leverage our competitive advantage here to win on speed and service.  Our international expansion didn't stop in the air. In the second quarter, we announced a new joint venture in India, which we call MOVIN. MOVIN offers a range of extensive, express and premium service coverage across India with a strong portfolio of B2B domestic services.  Moving to health care. We've expanded UPS Premier, our advanced technology solution. UPS Premier gives complex health care shipments, a priority lane in our network with enhanced visibility and near-perfect service. So far this year, we've added 14 new countries to UPS Premier, bringing the total availability to 33 countries. And by the end of this year, we will add another 15 countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. These efforts and more are keeping us on track to hit our $10 billion health care revenue target in 2023.  Moving to people-led. I'm delighted that Bala Subramanian has joined the company as UPS' new Chief Digital and Technology Officer. He is tasked with supercharging digital transformation across every aspect of our business and will unleash even more innovation for our customers.  We are moving from digital literacy to digital fluency. And to help us get there, we are investing in our people and have created training to equip them with new skills. The entire executive leadership team, including me, has completed this digital fluency training. And we are moving quickly to train our next 2 levels of leadership, which brings me to innovation driven.  This is about the future of UPS and driving more productivity from the assets we own. The changes we've already made have significantly increased the agility of our network and are driving productivity improvements. In the second quarter in the United States, we were able to manage hours in line with volume leads, and we optimized our trailer loads by eliminating 1,600 loads per day compared to the same time frame last year. And we will continue to deploy additional technology prior to peak.  To give you a couple of examples, we are on track with our deployment of smart package smart facility to the first 100 buildings in our network. And prior to peak this year, we will bring 2 automated facilities online, including the first 2 phases of our new 800,000 square foot regional hub in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  Additionally, on July 11, we launched our total service plan across the U.S. network. Brian will share the details, but our total service plan approach creates a more predictable operating environment enabling us to take more cost out and make our industry-leading service even better.  We are also working on another big efficiency opportunity, and that's how to improve delivery density. We are approaching this differently by attacking density upstream and fulfillment. We recently completed 2 pilots, and we're really excited about the results. We are building a new digital platform that can scale, and we look forward to sharing more detail with you in the coming quarters.  Innovation-driven will also help us reach carbon neutrality by 2050. On Thursday of this week, we will publish our set of annual sustainability report, which includes our 20th GRI Content Index. In these reports, we share some new technologies that we are using, like the eQuad electric-assist bikes we are piloting in New York and London. These eQuads are a great zero-emission last-mile solution for super-urban environment.  Before I turn it over to Brian, let me end by reaffirming our 2022 consolidated financial targets. In 2022, we expect to generate about $102 billion in revenue, consolidated operating margin of approximately 13.7%, and we expect return on invested capital to be greater than 30%.  Lastly, we are again increasing our targeted share repurchases for 2022, taking the target up to $3 billion for the year. In the face of a very dynamic macro environment, we remain agile and on strategy. We have multiple revenue and cost levers to pull, and we remain focused on controlling what we can control.  And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover 4 areas. Starting with the macro environment; then our second quarter results; next, I'll cover cash and shareowner returns; and lastly, I'll wrap up with our financial outlook for the second half of 2022.  In the second quarter, there were many cross-currents that contributed to a dynamic macro environment. In the U.S., even with high inflation and increasing interest rates, the job market and consumer spending remains strong with a growing share of wallet spent on services.  Internationally, the environment continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia and geopolitical issues, both of which drove complexity in the market for customers. Despite these external factors, we remained agile and delivered strong second quarter results as we expected.  In the second quarter, consolidated revenue increased 5.7% to $24.8 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.6 billion, 9.3% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14.4%, which was 40 basis points above last year and was our highest consolidated operating margin in nearly 15 years. For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was $3.29, up 7.5% from the same period last year.  Now let's look at our business segments. In U.S. Domestic, revenue quality initiatives more than offset the volume decline and drove strong second quarter results. Average daily volume in the U.S. was down 4% or 823,000 packages per day versus the second quarter of last year. More than half of the decrease was due to actions we took with a few of our largest customers, to optimize air and ground volume we bring into our network. And the majority of the volume reduction from these customers was residential. We expected to fill this gap with other enterprise volume, but macro conditions made that challenging.  In the second quarter, residential volume declined 8.2% and was partially offset by a 2.3% increase in B2B average daily volume. B2B represented 43% of our volume, which was up from 40% in the second quarter of 2021. We are continuing to win in the most attractive parts of the market due to our industry-leading service and enabling capabilities.  In the second quarter, SMB average daily volume, including platforms, grew 3.3% year-over-year. And SMBs made up 29.2% of our U.S. domestic volume, an increase of 200 basis points over last year, putting us well on our way to achieving our 2023 target of 30%. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $15.5 billion, up 7.3%.  Revenue per piece increased 11.9%, with double-digit increases across all products. Changes to price per gallon for fuel drove 400 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate increase, and the remaining 790 basis points of revenue per piece improvement came from the actions we took, which included base rates, fuel pricing and mix improvements.  Turning to costs. Total expense grew 6.9%, primarily driven by 2 factors: first, fuel drove 370 basis points of the expense growth rate increase due primarily to the rise in price per gallon compared to last year; and second, wages and benefits contributed about 200 basis points of the increase due to the rise in health, welfare and pension rates. The remaining variance was driven by multiple factors, including maintenance and depreciation.  Had we managed our second quarter cost for the short term, they could have been better. But we made the decision to manage for the longer term. So we pulled on most cost levers, but not all of them. Knowing that we would need to hire for peak soon, we did not want to make a short-term decision that would negatively impact service later in the year.  Our industry-leading service is driving revenue quality and is bringing new customers in the door. Helping to offset cost increases, we are continuing to see the benefits of our cube utilization and other productivity efforts. Our latest initiative is called Total Service Plan, which we launched earlier this month across the U.S. network. This is about running an on-time precision network every day.  Specifically, we've optimized our operating plans to minimize driver wait times and execute an on-time dispatch across our network. We are happy with the early results, including a marked improvement in on-time feeder departures, which reduces idle time across the network. Total Service Plan is a key initiative that will drive lower cost and provide greater predictability for our customers and our operators.  To wrap up U.S. Domestic, the segment delivered $1.9 billion in operating profit, an increase of $180 million or 10.7% compared to the second quarter of 2021. And operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 12%.  Moving to our International segment. A softer macro environment, the war in Eastern Europe and lockdowns in China pressured volumes, but our team stayed agile in the air and on the ground as we adjusted the network to match our volume levels.  Total average daily volume was down 9.2% in the second quarter, reflecting more-than-normal shopping behaviors in parts of the world like Canada and Germany. In the second quarter of this year, international domestic average daily volume was down 13.4%, which represented more than 3/4 of the total decrease in international volume.  Total export average daily volume declined 4.4% due to a combination of factors, including high global inflation and COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia, which disrupted manufacturing output. As we did last quarter, we adjusted the network and we're able to keep our operations moving in Asia to serve our customers.  In the second quarter, international revenue increased 5.3% to $5.1 billion. Revenue per piece increased 14.8%, including a 610 basis point decline due to currency, which was more than offset by a 1,300 basis point benefit from fuel. The remaining revenue per piece growth rate increased 790 basis points was from base pricing, product mix and revenue quality actions that we took. Operating profit grew to $1.2 billion, including a $60 million negative impact from currency. Operating margin in the second quarter was 23.7%.  Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. Our team did a great job leaning into the dynamic macro conditions and responding to the needs of our customers. In the second quarter, revenue was $4.2 billion, up 0.7% despite the divestiture of UPS Freight, which accounted for $297 million of Supply Chain Solutions revenue in the second quarter of 2021.  Looking at the key performance drivers. In Forwarding, our Ocean Freight product had strong revenue growth due to higher rates, and both Air and Ocean Freight forwarding generated strong operating profit growth by managing the buy sell spreads.  Within Forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit delivered excellent operating profit growth driven by revenue quality initiatives and customer mix. And our Healthcare business again delivered record top and bottom line results driven by complex customers in cold chain, clinical trials and labs.  In the second quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated record operating profit of $517 million and delivered a record operating margin of 12.2%, an increase of 250 basis points from last year. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $171 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $298 million, and our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23%.  Now let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we've generated $8.3 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow was $6.9 billion. And in the first half of 2022, UPS paid $2.6 billion in dividends and completed $1.2 billion in share buybacks, which brings us to our outlook for the second half of 2022.  According to IHS, GDP expectations for the full year have again been lowered from previous forecasts. Global GDP is now expected to grow 2.9% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 1.4%. We are continuing to pay close attention to macro elements, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures, the health of the consumer and the geopolitical environment.  The execution of our strategy under our better, not bigger framework is enabling greater agility and resiliency against an uncertain macro environment. Despite this backdrop, we are reaffirming our consolidated financial targets for 2022, driven by our results in the first half of the year and the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives.  For the full year 2022, consolidated revenues are expected to be about $102 billion, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight. Consolidated operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7%, and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%.  Looking specifically at the second half of 2022, in U.S. Domestic, we anticipate back half 2022 revenue growth of around 5.5%, driven by strong revenue quality, and we expect second half operating margin to expand to about 11.6%, which is consistent with our full year guidance.  As you update your models for U.S. Domestic, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, we anticipate volume growth rates will improve slightly in the second half of the year compared to the first half, and we expect revenue per piece to continue to increase year-over-year, but at a slower rate than in the front half of the year.  Second, we expect an increase in compensation expense in the second half of the year. Our annual wage increase for our Teamster employees goes into effect in August and is $1 per hour, which is higher than last year. Additionally, our current contract includes a cost of living adjustment that will be significantly higher this year compared to last year, and we expect to continue to pay market rate adjustments in certain geographies around the country.  And third, union benefit rates will also increase in August. Together with pension service costs, these union wage and benefit rate increases will add nearly $600 million to our costs in the second half of 2022 compared to the second half of 2021.  The investments we are making in our integrated network, like our new Harrisburg, Pennsylvania automated hub, smart package smart facility, additional labeling and bagging automation, plus our total service plan will help to offset the increase in wages and benefits in the back half of the year. And we expect our cost per piece growth rate will be lower than in the first half of the year as we continue to implement our productivity initiatives. The combination of our revenue and cost initiatives will enable us to grow revenue per piece faster than cost per piece and achieve our 11.6% full year operating margin target.  Moving to the International segment. In the second half of the year, we anticipate volume growth rates will improve relative to the first half, driven by our speed and service advantages in Europe. We expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits. Additionally, we expect currency will remain a headwind in the second half of the year. Operating margin in the International segment is anticipated to be about 23%.  In Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue in the second half of 2022 of nearly $9 billion, driven by our logistics and health care businesses. We've already begun to see ocean forwarding rates moderate, and we expect that trend to continue further year-over-year. Operating margin in the Supply Chain Solutions segment is expected to be about 10%. On a consolidated basis, we anticipate operating margin will be around 13.6% in the back half of 2022, with the fourth quarter increasing about 20 basis points year-over-year. And lastly, we expect the tax rate to be around 23% for the remainder of the year.  Turning to capital allocation. For the full year, in 2022, we still expect free cash flow to be around $9 billion, including our annual pension contributions. Capital expenditures are still planned to be about 5.4% of revenue or $5.5 billion. We plan to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval. We plan to repay $2 billion in debt at maturity this year, including the $1 billion we've already paid in the first half of the year.  Lastly, in terms of share repurchases, we are, again, increasing the amount of cash we plan to allocate to share repurchases, taking the target up from $2 billion to $3 billion in 2022, further rewarding our shareowners. The execution of our strategy is enabling greater agility and has driven fundamental changes to nearly every aspect of our business.  As we discussed last quarter, there are multiple ways for us to deliver our targets, including offsetting softer volume through revenue quality and productivity. We have many levers to pull, and we are confident that we will deliver the targets we've laid out.  Thank you, and operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi.\nChristian Wetherbee: Maybe starting, Brian, where you left off on sort of the cost side, thinking about the ramp-up in the back half of the year. I know it's early, but I want to get a sense of what you think sort of the expense profile of the business, particularly on the domestic side is going to look like exiting '22?  And as we think about 2023, I know you have the Teamster contract coming up next year, probably a little too early to talk about that. But it seems like there's some cost inflation kind of picking up. I want to get a sense of maybe how you think about that exiting the year? And what are the buckets you can kind of attack to maybe offset that?\nBrian Newman: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Look, we expect CPP in the back half of the year to actually improve versus the first half. As I think about 2H, we're looking to put about $1.7 billion up in revenue growth in domestic, and there'll be a comparable increase in cost of about $1.7 billion.  But Nando and the team in the U.S. are taking a number of actions to actually drive productivity and efficiency. We just launched Total Service Plan. We've got Smart Package/Smart facility, cube automation, a number of initiatives. Those will drive about $300 million to reduce that $1.7 billion in cost increase. So as I think about exiting, I actually think CPP will be high single digit in the second half of the year. And so as we exit, I think we'll be in good shape going into '23.\nCarol Tome: And maybe just a little color on the Total Service Plan. This is a formative initiative for our company. And it's really running our integrated network the way it was designed to run. And to make that real for you, sometimes we're a little light with feeder arrivals and departures. And with the initiative that we just kicked off on July 11 is about getting back on time and to dimensionalize that for you, a 10-minute improvement within the integrated network is worth $257 million.  So we're really excited about this. We've just kicked it off. It was a monumental effort. Get this, Nando and his team had to have one-on-one conversations with 64,000 drivers in our company, talking to them about their individualized service plan because some people want to get home for dinner at night and some people want to have some overtime. So we've built individualized plans for our drivers, and we retrained hundreds of thousands of people in our methods. And we're very, very excited about the Total Service Plan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Ann Poliniak of Wells Fargo.\nAllison Ann Poliniak: I just want to ask a question on SMBs. Obviously, you're growing faster than the market, Deal Manager obviously impacting that as well. Is there a way to think about that as we kind of look to the back half? Does that outperformance still continue? And I think Deal Manager also touches on pricing a little bit. Does that, I guess, strength in that revenue quality, the SMBs that you guys are onboarding at this point?\nBrian Newman: Yes. From a numbers perspective, Allison, we had guided to 150 basis points of SMB improvement as a percentage of volume mix in the U.S. We're right on track to do that. We had a bit stronger performance in the second quarter, 200 bps, but we're holding to that full year 150. So that obviously does contribute to the revenue quality that we saw in the first half and we'll see in the second half.\nCarol Tome: Our SMB initiative is multifaceted. And certainly, Deal Manager is part of it. We saw our win rate at 71% in the second quarter, that was 12 percentage points higher than we had planned. So we were super excited about that, and we're looking forward to rolling that outside the United States.  But it's not just the Deal Manager. By the way, I should say with Deal Manager, we're holding more of the base rate, which is great, too. That's part of the RPP strategy here. But it's much more the Deal Manager thinking about that, we have $1 billion of DAP revenue in the first 6 months of the year. And in fact, the revenue in the second quarter grew by about 100%. So we are on track to have $2 billion in DAP in the back half of the year.  We've got 18 key partners, 2.5 million merchants on the DAP platform, and we're taking that outside the United States as well. But there's more to it. It's about creating a seamless and frictionless experience for our customers. And as you know we have 16 customer journeys, we've actually identified 3 of those that really matter. And one of those is we've kind of thrown our wallet in the middle of the road, and we're going after it. And that's how to manage claims.  The claims process here is pretty clunky and it's not a good customer experience. So we are staffing that, Brian. We're staffing that and we're going to fix the claims experience because we think if we eliminate that pain point, we're going to grow even faster than the market, which we're already doing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Congratulations. So the inbound questions I'm getting on this release are volumes came in a little lower than expected. Why isn't this a negative economic signal? Now you had a couple of anomalies that Brian went through in the quarter, and you talked about second half growth improving. So how do you read the economic tea leaves?  I know you mentioned that GDP forecast had come down, but it sounds like you're more optimistic about volume returning to the network in the second half in part because you're deemphasizing the volumes you don't want. But what are our takeaways here?\nCarol Tome: Well, maybe I'll start, Brian, and then you could add. So -- if you recall, at the end of the first quarter, we told you we thought our volumes would be down in the second quarter. They were. They were down a little bit more than we thought. We missed our forecast by 222,000 packages a day. And that miss was split evenly between the U.S. business and the international business.  So I would call that pretty close to being on forecast. As Brian detailed in his prepared remarks, more than half of the volume decline in the United States was based on actions that we took with a few of our customers under our better, not bigger framework. One of those customers is Amazon. So I'm just going to talk about Amazon right now.  We have a great relationship with Amazon. They are our largest customer. But as we've shared with you in the past, we have reached a contractual agreement with Amazon about the volume that we will take into our network and the volume that they will deliver.  No, by the way, they got a lot of volume to deliver. The last time I looked, they have $35 billion of inventory. So they've got a lot of volume to deliver. But we've contractually agreed on what makes sense for us versus what makes sense for them. That means that both volume and revenue for Amazon is coming down. We project by the end of this year that Amazon revenue will be less than 11% of our total revenue. That gives us room to grow in the parts of the market that we want to grow, like SMB and B2B and health care and others.  So part of this is a glide path that's occurring. We thought we could fill up the divot with more enterprise volumes than we got. Part of that is macro, but here are a few fun facts. Of our top 20 customers in the second quarter, more than 65% of them grew volume with us. Another fun fact is that in the second quarter, we won new great revenue quality business in the enterprise part of our segment than we have in the past 5 years.  Now that volume hasn't come into the network yet because we just won it, but it's coming in the back half. So we are running our business the way that we want to run it in this better, not bigger framework despite the macro environment.  And Brian, what else do you want to share?\nBrian Newman: I only had the RPP side of that equation. Carol just painted a better, not bigger picture that we're running, Jeff. But on the back of that is revenue quality, and you see that in the domestic margin of 12% in the second quarter. I think we committed to 11.6% in the first half and 11.6% in the second half. We feel good about that running this play Carol just described.\nCarol Tome: And we're holding on to the more of the GRI aren't we? We're not discounting as much. And part of that is because our customers value the service that we provide. Our end-to-end network is allowing us to deliver record high service levels, and that matters. That really matters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.\nKenneth Hoexter: Carol, Brian and Ken, maybe thoughts to continue that discussion a bit. Maybe thoughts on the RPP there, Brian. As fuel comes down, we're moving under $100 per barrel. You talked about a bit about the splits. Does that start to impact? Is there a profitability built into that revenue stream from fuel? Maybe just kind of walk through that a bit.\nBrian Newman: Yes, Ken. Thanks for the question. And I think we feel fine about the fuel. It's obviously gone up at record levels in terms of the increase versus last year. And as we see fuel costs rise, Ken, our profit dollars actually increased. Margins contract a bit on the upside.  In the quarter, about 1/3 of RPP growth came from fuel, and we're splitting that out. That's fuel price per gallon. We're splitting that out from the management actions we've taken on pricing, which would go into a different bucket. So we've tried to provide more transparency.  As fuel goes down, I think the efficiency of our 1-week lag on the fuel service charge we feel like we're protected or insulated from a margin perspective. So feel okay and the constructive Q2 RPP. 1/3 was fuel, 1/3 was what Carol talked about, the revenue quality led by service, and then the last piece of that was the combination of mix, Ken, plus the management actions on fuel. So that's how we're looking at it and thinking about it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: I guess just related to the domestic margin question. I think the algorithm when you guys provided your multiyear forecast was kind of 20-ish percent incremental margins. And you're pretty darn close in the second quarter. I think you're actually forecasting that or pretty close in the back half of the year.  The world has changed since then from an inflation perspective. So I think it's pretty impressive that you're still hitting that number. But is that -- Brian, as you look out in '23, which is still within that multiyear forecast period, is that 20%-plus still hold in terms of an incremental margin target for domestic?  And then, Carol, I think one of the key questions and the overhang on the stock, at least, is this union renegotiation that's coming up next year. I understand it's sensitive and highly strategic, but any color? Because it is a $30 billion to $35 billion expense base for the company.  And any additional color, at least in terms of how you're strategically thinking about that renegotiation, that helps us form what type of inflation the company is going to be -- have over the next several years starting next year would be helpful?\nBrian Newman: Yes, Amit, good question. So the answer to the first part of the question is, as we think about the walk on margins, that low 20s number that we're delivering it's a bit challenged in a down volume environment. And so we need to pull other levers to make sure we get there.  What we're focused on guidance that I had given at the investor conference in '21, which is 12% op margin in the U.S. We are still very much on track to do that. I think the guidance we gave for this year was to go from 11.1 to 11.6. We're on track to do that and then to lift the balance next year. So still tracking to the 12% and looking to expand margin on a longer-term basis.\nCarol Tome: We have additional productivity levers today that we didn't have in our investor conference 1 year ago. One of those would be the Total Service Plan. Maybe Nando was thinking about it, but we haven't kicked it off or actually put it into any of our financial plans 1 year ago.  We're also seeing some real opportunities with our Smart Packaged/ Smart Facility initiative, which we hadn't thought of 1 year ago. When we get that rolled out, we're going to eliminate all the manual scans, all those preload scans that are done manually, all that will be eliminated. All of the tens of thousands of misloads that occur every day, sorry to say, we do misload a package from time to time or lots of times.  So all of that's got to be eliminated. So we've got additional productivity initiatives that we didn't have 1 year ago, which even in an environment where, yes, costs are up more than we thought they would be, we're able to offset those costs. I think it's pretty impressive that we didn't -- we planned for the $1 an hour increase for our Teamster starting in August. We didn't plan for the COLA that we're seeing. We knew there would be some inflation, but not the amount that we are seeing and we're able to offset all of that, aren't we Brian?\nBrian Newman: Yes, that's -- Carol, it's actually a big number. We're going to see -- we saw $0.33 in COLA, the cost-of-living adjustment last year. We're going to see $0.82 this year. So you combine that to $1 in contractual wage increase. Last year, we went $1.23. This year, it will be $1.82. The fact that we're able to manage through that and drive the additional productivity you talked about when the environment turns around in an up volume environment, should be cooking on all cylinders.\nCarol Tome: And to your question on the union negotiation first, these are incredibly important to us, and we've had Teamsters in our company for 100 years or thereabout. As we think about the upcoming contract negotiation, we're going to leave the negotiations at the bargaining table.  But just a few things for you to remember. Our Teamsters are the highest paid in the industry, both wage and benefits. In fact, if you're a 4-year driver here, you're making $40 an hour and fully loaded with benefits close to $150,000 a year. So our workforce is very different than a lot of the workforce that you hear in the media every day that are trying to be organized. They're not paid the way that our Teamsters are paid. These are great jobs that we value very much.  Our goal with the Teamsters is win-win-win, and that's our goal. And again, we'll keep the details of that win-win-win strategy at the bargaining table. The other thing I'll leave with you, and this is, I think, an important point is we're winning business today with customers who know, we have an upcoming negotiation because we've told our customers, we're going to take care of them. We are building contingency plans, and we will take care of our customers.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Brian, just a couple of few things I want to just follow up with you. Can you talk about the net impact of fuel in the quarter? How you're thinking about currency in the back half of the year? And I think you gave a comment about fourth quarter margins, but I didn't hear anything about third quarter margins. So if you could just help there.\nBrian Newman: Sure, Scott. From a margin perspective, look, we -- I guess, as a whole company, we'd expect all business segments to have higher margins in Q4 relative to Q3 based on the seasonality, Scott, we expect the back half domestic margin seasonality to be very similar to last year relative to Q2.  So if you go back last year and look at Q2, the sequential Q3, Q4, the change should be comparable. As far as the currency and fuel that you laid in, look a stronger USD in Q2, it reduced our reported international revenue by, I think it was $261 million and reduced international profit by $60 million.  And I think you're familiar, Scott, with the lard hedge we use as a percentage of our revenue to manage that. In terms of fuel, fuel prices increased. We take a layered approach and start hedging that out about a few years in advance. We try to be 100% hedged. So the revenue impact will be more than the profit impact. But net-net, I think we feel fuel prices will moderate in the back end of the year.  The net impact in the quarter was 400 basis points. And as we look at dimensionalizing further, we're splitting out the elements of management control pricing actions versus the price per gallon, Scott, to give you more transparency.\nCarol Tome: Yes. I think, Scott, the way I think about it is the change in the price per gallon is one component of the RPP. And as Brian called it out, that was 400 basis points on the RPP in the second quarter. The costs associated that also impacted cost per piece or our overall increase in expenses, up 370 basis points related to fuel.  So as the price per gallon goes up or down, the margin is pretty protected. To the change in price per gallon, we also have a pricing algorithm, but it has -- it's just used it fuel as a simple way to price. It's just price. So don't think of those pricing actions as anything different than price. And fuel margins will just hold tight if you look at change in price per gallon on the revenue line and change on pricing gallon on the expense line. That's how I think about it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: So I guess I wanted to ask on your peak expectations. It sounds like that there was maybe a little bit of cost here in the quarter from a hiring standpoint as you prepare for the peak. I guess I'm curious what your expectation would be. It seems like that the second half outlook. It's a little bit uncertain just how the peak this year would compare to last year.  And then with the $300 million of productivity improvement that you're expecting in the back half of the year, is that something that you hold on to and carries forward into '23? Or how do we think about the sustainability of those cost improvements?\nBrian Newman: Yes. Certainly, the productivity piece, we would hold on to that. And to Carol's earlier comment, we're going to build on it. So that would carry forward.\nCarol Tome: On peak, we're getting forecast from all of our large customers now as we build our peak planning and we expect it to be a good peak. Inventory levels are good. Retailers are brought in to sell. Where last year, they didn't. So that should help the peak demand.  And then the comment about expenses, and we could have done better, is we managed hours relative to the volume. I'm really proud of that. A few years ago, we wouldn't have been able to do that. We would have delevered, but we were able to manage our hours. Nando and his team and Kate and her team did a great job on that.  We kept the bench though. Because if we let the bench go, then we'd have to rehire them for peak, and that doesn't seem like a good idea. Now the bench, obviously, we won't be an hourly wage if they're not working, but they do get benefits. So I would say that's the money that we left on the table, but we'll get that back in spade by giving great service to our customers during peak.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: I was wondering can you talk a little bit more about the Total Service Plan? Just trying to understand a little bit perhaps what the implementation or rollout aspect of that may be? And how quickly that starts to dig in? And is that a part of the contribution to this year's second half cost saves, et cetera?\nBrian Newman: Yes, Jordan, it's included in my $300 million that I talked about in terms of driving productivity. And as Carol mentioned, it just kicked off, I think, July 11. So we're just getting going here. Net-net, it's to run a precision on-time network. So we don't have late deliveries or late departures. And it's worth quite a bit to us. It will ramp up over time. Carol mentioned that Nando and the team met with over 60,000 people talking about their specific service plans. Pretty exciting when you think about what can be accomplished from a TSP perspective.\nCarol Tome: And Brian, Ken, I'm going to call an audible here, and I'm going to throw that question over to Nando. Nando, do you want to talk a little bit more about the Total Service Plan?\nNando Cesarone: Yes, sure. So the plan is really based on, as Brian mentioned, a predictable environment where our operators can plan with a lot of confidence on start time, finish time, sorts bands, how we can better utilize our automated facilities and move volume from legacy facilities to our newer, more automated facilities.  In addition to that, we've catered a very unique dispatch for our full-time drivers. And so we expect that the efficiencies coming out of those customized dispatches and the service we provide are going to allow us to run a really, really great efficient network for our customers and our employees.\nCarol Tome: Thanks, Nando. And the cool thing is that we're not trying to integrate the network. We already have an integrated network. Now we're just running it the way it was designed.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: I wanted to see if you could comment a little bit about sort of revenue quality and the efforts you're making on revenue quality and how sensitive they might be to sort of a weaker economic environment. You did a great job, I guess, managing down hours to volume.  I think the market is looking at the global financial crisis past recessions to kind of get a sense for earnings cyclicality. And I'm just trying to get a sense for what's different about the business today that might limit some of that downside to a downturn or pullback in overall shipping volume versus kind of maybe what we've seen in the past?\nCarol Tome: Yes. I think in the past, as I understand it, when air volume softened up, the end was near. Prices softened up. That's just not happening now. As Brian detailed in his prepared remarks, more than half of the volume decline in our business, including air, was because of agreements that we reached with a few of our customers on the volume that we will take and the volume that we won't take.  The revenue quality is very good. It is sticky. As we bring in new customers, we're bringing them in and at very good revenue quality. Why? Because of what we have to offer. And in services are life. So part of it is what we have to offer from a service perspective, dependability, reliability. And what else do you want to add in terms of revenue quality, perhaps talk a little bit about the technology of the future?\nBrian Newman: Yes. I think we've talked before as we think about dynamic pricing, and we're running some pilots that we feel good about. There's a technology component to that, but from a lag perspective, but the tools that we've been running out -- rolling out with our accounts, whether it's Deal Manager or some of the others, it allows us to be more efficient, more timely.  And quite candidly, the revenue quality is showing 11.9% was the growth in revenue quality for the RPP growth in the second quarter. that's a good number. We expect that to moderate for a few reasons in the back half of the year to high single digit. What's critical there is managing that spread. As Carol talked about, driving the productivity, will bring the CPP down and then deliver on our margin commitments.\nCarol Tome: I love Deal Manager for so many ways. It makes it easier for our salespeople first, it makes it better and faster for our customers, which is awesome, but we're also bringing intelligence to the decision-making. Before [indiscernible] a bit of tribal knowledge. But now we're using AI to help inform the decisions, and we're coming in at better pricing as a result.\nDavid Vernon: All right. And then maybe, Brian, can you just clarify the EBIT dollar impact of fuel in the quarter? And if there's any risk that the fuel prices moderate, there's going to be an earnings headwind in sort of 3Q, 4Q?\nBrian Newman: I don't see a headwind with the dollar -- with the fuel prices moderating, it's factored into our guidance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel.\nJizong Chan: Just want to get your sense of how supply chains are flowing right now. Maybe just broadly upfront, but also in the context of your CapEx plans for rolling stock and automated facility rollouts. And Brian, maybe if you see any risk to guidance there if we see any additional delays on the supply chain?\nBrian Newman: Yes. Why don't I pick up the first -- the back half of that on CapEx, Carol, if you want to add any color on supply chains. But the guide we're holding at $5.5 billion, we feel good about. We're not immune. There are supply chain challenges around the world, and some of the parts and motors and trucks are more challenging to get.  But I think we look at capital now from a sort of a perpetual rolling cycle. It's not episodic. And so we're looking at opportunities to invest in different areas that may not have been in the original plan to drive automation, et cetera. So we're hold to $5.5 billion. That you can hold and we'll continue to remain agile, keep you updated if there's any change. I don't expect a big change.\nCarol Tome: Supply chains are flowing better than they were a year ago. But we're not out of the woods. And a lot of it has to do with the rolling COVID lockdowns in China. We're shutdown in Shenzhen again. And we thought we'd gone through the worst in the second quarter. Kate and her team did a masterful job of managing through this. Get this, because of the rolling lockdowns in China in different cities, when you add up the number of days that we were effectively shut down cumulatively and if you look at all the cities combined, 106 days, we had people -- UPSers sleeping on the floor of our hubs to try to keep commerce moving.  Manufacturers couldn't manufacture because they were shutdown. Ocean Freight volume levels were down in the second quarter because of the lockdowns in China. So -- and then we see what's happening with the current variant of COVID. And you just wonder about when will we ever get through it?  But what you have to do is get through it. You have to manage through it. And that's what we, as a team said we will do. We are going to run our business. We're not going to let the business run us. We're going to get through it, and that's what we're doing.\nKen Cook: And Stephen, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: So maybe one more quick one for Brian on fuel. Can you just talk about the management actions on fuel that you've quantified? I think, about 1/3 of the RPP was that and mix. I think where some of the concern is that you might not be able to hang on to that in a weaker fuel price environment? Or are those getting built into these contracts and these renegotiations that you're talking about?  And then for Carol, if you can just give us a little more update on the upstream density program. It sounds like another new initiative, but I think the company tried that a few years ago, didn't quite pan out. So maybe what's different this time? What sort of visibility in partnership do you think you can drive to pretty much help everybody in the supply chain, including those who sign up for these pilots?\nBrian Newman: Yes, Brian, thanks. On the fuel surcharge, look, as Carol mentioned, we run a pass-through on the fuel surcharge on the price per gallon piece, and we've isolated that for you for transparency. That's a very efficient mechanism and we'll move up and down.  The pricing actions, we've taken over the last couple of years, we've actually taken 4 or 5 pricing actions. And those we feel are embedded. As Carol said, it's a different type of price. We don't think of it as fuel. It's an element of pricing, and we're embedding some of that in the base rate.\nCarol Tome: And I'm just so happy you asked about delivery density. Because we've tried to move the needle in this area for a long time, and we haven't been successful, principally because we've been focused on downstream, improving delivery density through access points or SurePost Redirect. And we just really haven't moved the needle.  Yes, the density was the best this quarter since 2019, fractionally. So we're like, \"All right, what we're doing isn't working. We've got to go upstream.\" And when I mean upstream, when you think about e-commerce retailers, their upstream supply chain is from the manufacturer to their warehouse or store. Their upstream supply chain is also their order management system.  So we have been in a pilot with a third-party technology company that powers order management systems for most of the retailers in the country. The pilot is a virtual halt. We're in the order management system, the third-party technology company is holding the order until it can match another order going to the same address, and then it releases 2 orders. This pilot has been working very well.  Now you may say, well, what about service level agreement to the customer? Well, the virtual hold is only as long as the service level agreement allows. But there's a lot of hours in that service-level agreement, 9 hours, 12 hours. So what we found through the pilot is enough time to be able to match, then we release and we deliver the density.  And just to make this real for you, and this is just an estimate, but we estimate the cost of last mile for us is $5.50. That incremental package cost us $0.60. So imagine the value that can be released if we improve the density. So we're going to give some of that value back to our customers.  Why not? Their service level is not disruptive, and we are going to value share. So the pilot has been so successful. We're going live in the third quarter with the customer. We've got 9 other customers lined up who are anxious to talk to us about this. So more to come, early days, but super excited because it's different from what we've done in the past.\nKen Cook: All right. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today and look forward to talking to you all next quarter. That concludes our call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover 4 areas. Starting with the macro environment; then our second quarter results; next, I'll cover cash and shareowner returns; and lastly, I'll wrap up with our financial outlook for the second half of 2022.  In the second quarter, there were many cross-currents that contributed to a dynamic macro environment. In the U.S., even with high inflation and increasing interest rates, the job market and consumer spending remains strong with a growing share of wallet spent on services.  Internationally, the environment continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia and geopolitical issues, both of which drove complexity in the market for customers. Despite these external factors, we remained agile and delivered strong second quarter results as we expected.  In the second quarter, consolidated revenue increased 5.7% to $24.8 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.6 billion, 9.3% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14.4%, which was 40 basis points above last year and was our highest consolidated operating margin in nearly 15 years. For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was $3.29, up 7.5% from the same period last year.  Now let's look at our business segments. In U.S. Domestic, revenue quality initiatives more than offset the volume decline and drove strong second quarter results. Average daily volume in the U.S. was down 4% or 823,000 packages per day versus the second quarter of last year. More than half of the decrease was due to actions we took with a few of our largest customers, to optimize air and ground volume we bring into our network. And the majority of the volume reduction from these customers was residential. We expected to fill this gap with other enterprise volume, but macro conditions made that challenging.  In the second quarter, residential volume declined 8.2% and was partially offset by a 2.3% increase in B2B average daily volume. B2B represented 43% of our volume, which was up from 40% in the second quarter of 2021. We are continuing to win in the most attractive parts of the market due to our industry-leading service and enabling capabilities.  In the second quarter, SMB average daily volume, including platforms, grew 3.3% year-over-year. And SMBs made up 29.2% of our U.S. domestic volume, an increase of 200 basis points over last year, putting us well on our way to achieving our 2023 target of 30%. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $15.5 billion, up 7.3%.  Revenue per piece increased 11.9%, with double-digit increases across all products. Changes to price per gallon for fuel drove 400 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate increase, and the remaining 790 basis points of revenue per piece improvement came from the actions we took, which included base rates, fuel pricing and mix improvements.  Turning to costs. Total expense grew 6.9%, primarily driven by 2 factors: first, fuel drove 370 basis points of the expense growth rate increase due primarily to the rise in price per gallon compared to last year; and second, wages and benefits contributed about 200 basis points of the increase due to the rise in health, welfare and pension rates. The remaining variance was driven by multiple factors, including maintenance and depreciation.  Had we managed our second quarter cost for the short term, they could have been better. But we made the decision to manage for the longer term. So we pulled on most cost levers, but not all of them. Knowing that we would need to hire for peak soon, we did not want to make a short-term decision that would negatively impact service later in the year.  Our industry-leading service is driving revenue quality and is bringing new customers in the door. Helping to offset cost increases, we are continuing to see the benefits of our cube utilization and other productivity efforts. Our latest initiative is called Total Service Plan, which we launched earlier this month across the U.S. network. This is about running an on-time precision network every day.  Specifically, we've optimized our operating plans to minimize driver wait times and execute an on-time dispatch across our network. We are happy with the early results, including a marked improvement in on-time feeder departures, which reduces idle time across the network. Total Service Plan is a key initiative that will drive lower cost and provide greater predictability for our customers and our operators.  To wrap up U.S. Domestic, the segment delivered $1.9 billion in operating profit, an increase of $180 million or 10.7% compared to the second quarter of 2021. And operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 12%.  Moving to our International segment. A softer macro environment, the war in Eastern Europe and lockdowns in China pressured volumes, but our team stayed agile in the air and on the ground as we adjusted the network to match our volume levels.  Total average daily volume was down 9.2% in the second quarter, reflecting more-than-normal shopping behaviors in parts of the world like Canada and Germany. In the second quarter of this year, international domestic average daily volume was down 13.4%, which represented more than 3/4 of the total decrease in international volume.  Total export average daily volume declined 4.4% due to a combination of factors, including high global inflation and COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia, which disrupted manufacturing output. As we did last quarter, we adjusted the network and we're able to keep our operations moving in Asia to serve our customers.  In the second quarter, international revenue increased 5.3% to $5.1 billion. Revenue per piece increased 14.8%, including a 610 basis point decline due to currency, which was more than offset by a 1,300 basis point benefit from fuel. The remaining revenue per piece growth rate increased 790 basis points was from base pricing, product mix and revenue quality actions that we took. Operating profit grew to $1.2 billion, including a $60 million negative impact from currency. Operating margin in the second quarter was 23.7%.  Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. Our team did a great job leaning into the dynamic macro conditions and responding to the needs of our customers. In the second quarter, revenue was $4.2 billion, up 0.7% despite the divestiture of UPS Freight, which accounted for $297 million of Supply Chain Solutions revenue in the second quarter of 2021.  Looking at the key performance drivers. In Forwarding, our Ocean Freight product had strong revenue growth due to higher rates, and both Air and Ocean Freight forwarding generated strong operating profit growth by managing the buy sell spreads.  Within Forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit delivered excellent operating profit growth driven by revenue quality initiatives and customer mix. And our Healthcare business again delivered record top and bottom line results driven by complex customers in cold chain, clinical trials and labs.  In the second quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated record operating profit of $517 million and delivered a record operating margin of 12.2%, an increase of 250 basis points from last year. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $171 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $298 million, and our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23%.  Now let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we've generated $8.3 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow was $6.9 billion. And in the first half of 2022, UPS paid $2.6 billion in dividends and completed $1.2 billion in share buybacks, which brings us to our outlook for the second half of 2022.  According to IHS, GDP expectations for the full year have again been lowered from previous forecasts. Global GDP is now expected to grow 2.9% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 1.4%. We are continuing to pay close attention to macro elements, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures, the health of the consumer and the geopolitical environment.  The execution of our strategy under our better, not bigger framework is enabling greater agility and resiliency against an uncertain macro environment. Despite this backdrop, we are reaffirming our consolidated financial targets for 2022, driven by our results in the first half of the year and the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives.  For the full year 2022, consolidated revenues are expected to be about $102 billion, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight. Consolidated operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7%, and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%.  Looking specifically at the second half of 2022, in U.S. Domestic, we anticipate back half 2022 revenue growth of around 5.5%, driven by strong revenue quality, and we expect second half operating margin to expand to about 11.6%, which is consistent with our full year guidance.  As you update your models for U.S. Domestic, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, we anticipate volume growth rates will improve slightly in the second half of the year compared to the first half, and we expect revenue per piece to continue to increase year-over-year, but at a slower rate than in the front half of the year.  Second, we expect an increase in compensation expense in the second half of the year. Our annual wage increase for our Teamster employees goes into effect in August and is $1 per hour, which is higher than last year. Additionally, our current contract includes a cost of living adjustment that will be significantly higher this year compared to last year, and we expect to continue to pay market rate adjustments in certain geographies around the country.  And third, union benefit rates will also increase in August. Together with pension service costs, these union wage and benefit rate increases will add nearly $600 million to our costs in the second half of 2022 compared to the second half of 2021.  The investments we are making in our integrated network, like our new Harrisburg, Pennsylvania automated hub, smart package smart facility, additional labeling and bagging automation, plus our total service plan will help to offset the increase in wages and benefits in the back half of the year. And we expect our cost per piece growth rate will be lower than in the first half of the year as we continue to implement our productivity initiatives. The combination of our revenue and cost initiatives will enable us to grow revenue per piece faster than cost per piece and achieve our 11.6% full year operating margin target.  Moving to the International segment. In the second half of the year, we anticipate volume growth rates will improve relative to the first half, driven by our speed and service advantages in Europe. We expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits. Additionally, we expect currency will remain a headwind in the second half of the year. Operating margin in the International segment is anticipated to be about 23%.  In Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue in the second half of 2022 of nearly $9 billion, driven by our logistics and health care businesses. We've already begun to see ocean forwarding rates moderate, and we expect that trend to continue further year-over-year. Operating margin in the Supply Chain Solutions segment is expected to be about 10%. On a consolidated basis, we anticipate operating margin will be around 13.6% in the back half of 2022, with the fourth quarter increasing about 20 basis points year-over-year. And lastly, we expect the tax rate to be around 23% for the remainder of the year.  Turning to capital allocation. For the full year, in 2022, we still expect free cash flow to be around $9 billion, including our annual pension contributions. Capital expenditures are still planned to be about 5.4% of revenue or $5.5 billion. We plan to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval. We plan to repay $2 billion in debt at maturity this year, including the $1 billion we've already paid in the first half of the year.  Lastly, in terms of share repurchases, we are, again, increasing the amount of cash we plan to allocate to share repurchases, taking the target up from $2 billion to $3 billion in 2022, further rewarding our shareowners. The execution of our strategy is enabling greater agility and has driven fundamental changes to nearly every aspect of our business.  As we discussed last quarter, there are multiple ways for us to deliver our targets, including offsetting softer volume through revenue quality and productivity. We have many levers to pull, and we are confident that we will deliver the targets we've laid out.  Thank you, and operator, please open the lines. Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Look, we expect CPP in the back half of the year to actually improve versus the first half. As I think about 2H, we're looking to put about $1.7 billion up in revenue growth in domestic, and there'll be a comparable increase in cost of about $1.7 billion.  But Nando and the team in the U.S. are taking a number of actions to actually drive productivity and efficiency. We just launched Total Service Plan. We've got Smart Package/Smart facility, cube automation, a number of initiatives. Those will drive about $300 million to reduce that $1.7 billion in cost increase. So as I think about exiting, I actually think CPP will be high single digit in the second half of the year. And so as we exit, I think we'll be in good shape going into '23. Yes. From a numbers perspective, Allison, we had guided to 150 basis points of SMB improvement as a percentage of volume mix in the U.S. We're right on track to do that. We had a bit stronger performance in the second quarter, 200 bps, but we're holding to that full year 150. So that obviously does contribute to the revenue quality that we saw in the first half and we'll see in the second half. I only had the RPP side of that equation. Carol just painted a better, not bigger picture that we're running, Jeff. But on the back of that is revenue quality, and you see that in the domestic margin of 12% in the second quarter. I think we committed to 11.6% in the first half and 11.6% in the second half. We feel good about that running this play Carol just described. Yes, Ken. Thanks for the question. And I think we feel fine about the fuel. It's obviously gone up at record levels in terms of the increase versus last year. And as we see fuel costs rise, Ken, our profit dollars actually increased. Margins contract a bit on the upside.  In the quarter, about 1/3 of RPP growth came from fuel, and we're splitting that out. That's fuel price per gallon. We're splitting that out from the management actions we've taken on pricing, which would go into a different bucket. So we've tried to provide more transparency.  As fuel goes down, I think the efficiency of our 1-week lag on the fuel service charge we feel like we're protected or insulated from a margin perspective. So feel okay and the constructive Q2 RPP. 1/3 was fuel, 1/3 was what Carol talked about, the revenue quality led by service, and then the last piece of that was the combination of mix, Ken, plus the management actions on fuel. So that's how we're looking at it and thinking about it. Yes, Amit, good question. So the answer to the first part of the question is, as we think about the walk on margins, that low 20s number that we're delivering it's a bit challenged in a down volume environment. And so we need to pull other levers to make sure we get there.  What we're focused on guidance that I had given at the investor conference in '21, which is 12% op margin in the U.S. We are still very much on track to do that. I think the guidance we gave for this year was to go from 11.1 to 11.6. We're on track to do that and then to lift the balance next year. So still tracking to the 12% and looking to expand margin on a longer-term basis. Yes, that's -- Carol, it's actually a big number. We're going to see -- we saw $0.33 in COLA, the cost-of-living adjustment last year. We're going to see $0.82 this year. So you combine that to $1 in contractual wage increase. Last year, we went $1.23. This year, it will be $1.82. The fact that we're able to manage through that and drive the additional productivity you talked about when the environment turns around in an up volume environment, should be cooking on all cylinders. Sure, Scott. From a margin perspective, look, we -- I guess, as a whole company, we'd expect all business segments to have higher margins in Q4 relative to Q3 based on the seasonality, Scott, we expect the back half domestic margin seasonality to be very similar to last year relative to Q2.  So if you go back last year and look at Q2, the sequential Q3, Q4, the change should be comparable. As far as the currency and fuel that you laid in, look a stronger USD in Q2, it reduced our reported international revenue by, I think it was $261 million and reduced international profit by $60 million.  And I think you're familiar, Scott, with the lard hedge we use as a percentage of our revenue to manage that. In terms of fuel, fuel prices increased. We take a layered approach and start hedging that out about a few years in advance. We try to be 100% hedged. So the revenue impact will be more than the profit impact. But net-net, I think we feel fuel prices will moderate in the back end of the year.  The net impact in the quarter was 400 basis points. And as we look at dimensionalizing further, we're splitting out the elements of management control pricing actions versus the price per gallon, Scott, to give you more transparency. Yes. Certainly, the productivity piece, we would hold on to that. And to Carol's earlier comment, we're going to build on it. So that would carry forward. Yes, Jordan, it's included in my $300 million that I talked about in terms of driving productivity. And as Carol mentioned, it just kicked off, I think, July 11. So we're just getting going here. Net-net, it's to run a precision on-time network. So we don't have late deliveries or late departures. And it's worth quite a bit to us. It will ramp up over time. Carol mentioned that Nando and the team met with over 60,000 people talking about their specific service plans. Pretty exciting when you think about what can be accomplished from a TSP perspective. Yes. I think we've talked before as we think about dynamic pricing, and we're running some pilots that we feel good about. There's a technology component to that, but from a lag perspective, but the tools that we've been running out -- rolling out with our accounts, whether it's Deal Manager or some of the others, it allows us to be more efficient, more timely.  And quite candidly, the revenue quality is showing 11.9% was the growth in revenue quality for the RPP growth in the second quarter. that's a good number. We expect that to moderate for a few reasons in the back half of the year to high single digit. What's critical there is managing that spread. As Carol talked about, driving the productivity, will bring the CPP down and then deliver on our margin commitments. I don't see a headwind with the dollar -- with the fuel prices moderating, it's factored into our guidance. Yes. Why don't I pick up the first -- the back half of that on CapEx, Carol, if you want to add any color on supply chains. But the guide we're holding at $5.5 billion, we feel good about. We're not immune. There are supply chain challenges around the world, and some of the parts and motors and trucks are more challenging to get.  But I think we look at capital now from a sort of a perpetual rolling cycle. It's not episodic. And so we're looking at opportunities to invest in different areas that may not have been in the original plan to drive automation, et cetera. So we're hold to $5.5 billion. That you can hold and we'll continue to remain agile, keep you updated if there's any change. I don't expect a big change. Yes, Brian, thanks. On the fuel surcharge, look, as Carol mentioned, we run a pass-through on the fuel surcharge on the price per gallon piece, and we've isolated that for you for transparency. That's a very efficient mechanism and we'll move up and down.  The pricing actions, we've taken over the last couple of years, we've actually taken 4 or 5 pricing actions. And those we feel are embedded. As Carol said, it's a different type of price. We don't think of it as fuel. It's an element of pricing, and we're embedding some of that in the base rate."

            "name": "Carol Tome",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good morning. Let me begin by recognizing our more than 500,000 UPSers around the world for their dedication, hard work and efforts. Our founder, Jim Casey, said, \"We do what we promise.\" And in the second quarter, our UPSers did just that. They not only met, they exceeded our promises to our customers, our shareowners and each other.  In the second quarter, the macro environment remained dynamic. We expected volume levels to decline from last year. They did, but more than we planned, given a number of factors that Brian will detail. Despite the decline in volume, we continue to win in the most attractive parts of the market with strong gains and revenue quality. Under our better, not bigger strategy, our actions are creating a more resilient UPS. We are delivering better service for our customers and stronger financial results for our shareowners.  For the second quarter, consolidated revenue rose 5.7% from last year to $24.8 billion and operating profit grew 9.3% to $3.6 billion. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14.4%, a 40 basis point improvement from last year, and it was our highest quarterly consolidated operating margin in nearly 15 years. All business segments delivered operating profit growth. And I'd like to give a shout-out to our Supply Chain Solutions businesses, which delivered operating profit of $517 million, a record high performance.  Moving to our strategic update. Our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy is powering consistent improvement across our company. Starting with customer-first, which is about creating a frictionless customer experience, we are growing in the parts of the market where we want to grow, like SMBs, health care, B2B and certain large enterprise accounts.  How are we doing that? By providing outstanding service and focusing on the capabilities that matter the most to our customers. Let me share a few new highlights with you.  Starting with our recent acquisition of Delivery Solutions. This is a carrier-agnostic digital platform that enables companies to easily optimize their deliveries across dozens of physical networks through a single connection. Carriers include routing and other same-day services, along with curbside pickup and small package shipping, further adding to UPS' array of digital commerce solutions for our customers.  Next, we are continuing to win with SMBs by making it easier for them to ship with us. Our new digital pricing platform called Deal Manager, that we discussed last quarter simplifies and accelerates the pricing process for larger SMB customers and is performing better than we expected. Our win rate is 12 percentage points higher than we anticipated, which helped drive our U.S. SMB growth rate in the second quarter. Later this year, Deal Manager will be rolled out to our international small package business, starting with Canada and Germany.  Additionally, DAP, our digital access program, is continuing to grow in the U.S. and internationally. In the first 6 months of this year, DAP generated more than $1 billion in revenue putting this well on our way to achieving our $2 billion revenue target in 2022.  And looking at SMBs, in the U.S., in the second quarter, we grew SMB average daily volume, including platforms by 3.3%, which was faster than the market. SMBs made up 29.2% of our total U.S. volume in the quarter, an increase of 200 basis points from 1 year ago.  While our international volume levels were challenged in the second quarter, due to the ongoing war in Eastern Europe and COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia, that didn't stop us from investing in our business. We recently launched a new daily flight from our Cologne air hub that connects key manufacturing cities in Asia. This flight speeds up transit times across multiple intra-Asia tradelanes and provides greater connectivity to the UPS global network, including to the U.S. and Europe.  And speaking of Europe, did you know that UPS has the fastest ground network in Europe? In fact, we are faster by at least 1 day on the ground in over 1/3 of the market, and we will continue to leverage our competitive advantage here to win on speed and service.  Our international expansion didn't stop in the air. In the second quarter, we announced a new joint venture in India, which we call MOVIN. MOVIN offers a range of extensive, express and premium service coverage across India with a strong portfolio of B2B domestic services.  Moving to health care. We've expanded UPS Premier, our advanced technology solution. UPS Premier gives complex health care shipments, a priority lane in our network with enhanced visibility and near-perfect service. So far this year, we've added 14 new countries to UPS Premier, bringing the total availability to 33 countries. And by the end of this year, we will add another 15 countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. These efforts and more are keeping us on track to hit our $10 billion health care revenue target in 2023.  Moving to people-led. I'm delighted that Bala Subramanian has joined the company as UPS' new Chief Digital and Technology Officer. He is tasked with supercharging digital transformation across every aspect of our business and will unleash even more innovation for our customers.  We are moving from digital literacy to digital fluency. And to help us get there, we are investing in our people and have created training to equip them with new skills. The entire executive leadership team, including me, has completed this digital fluency training. And we are moving quickly to train our next 2 levels of leadership, which brings me to innovation driven.  This is about the future of UPS and driving more productivity from the assets we own. The changes we've already made have significantly increased the agility of our network and are driving productivity improvements. In the second quarter in the United States, we were able to manage hours in line with volume leads, and we optimized our trailer loads by eliminating 1,600 loads per day compared to the same time frame last year. And we will continue to deploy additional technology prior to peak.  To give you a couple of examples, we are on track with our deployment of smart package smart facility to the first 100 buildings in our network. And prior to peak this year, we will bring 2 automated facilities online, including the first 2 phases of our new 800,000 square foot regional hub in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  Additionally, on July 11, we launched our total service plan across the U.S. network. Brian will share the details, but our total service plan approach creates a more predictable operating environment enabling us to take more cost out and make our industry-leading service even better.  We are also working on another big efficiency opportunity, and that's how to improve delivery density. We are approaching this differently by attacking density upstream and fulfillment. We recently completed 2 pilots, and we're really excited about the results. We are building a new digital platform that can scale, and we look forward to sharing more detail with you in the coming quarters.  Innovation-driven will also help us reach carbon neutrality by 2050. On Thursday of this week, we will publish our set of annual sustainability report, which includes our 20th GRI Content Index. In these reports, we share some new technologies that we are using, like the eQuad electric-assist bikes we are piloting in New York and London. These eQuads are a great zero-emission last-mile solution for super-urban environment.  Before I turn it over to Brian, let me end by reaffirming our 2022 consolidated financial targets. In 2022, we expect to generate about $102 billion in revenue, consolidated operating margin of approximately 13.7%, and we expect return on invested capital to be greater than 30%.  Lastly, we are again increasing our targeted share repurchases for 2022, taking the target up to $3 billion for the year. In the face of a very dynamic macro environment, we remain agile and on strategy. We have multiple revenue and cost levers to pull, and we remain focused on controlling what we can control.  And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. And maybe just a little color on the Total Service Plan. This is a formative initiative for our company. And it's really running our integrated network the way it was designed to run. And to make that real for you, sometimes we're a little light with feeder arrivals and departures. And with the initiative that we just kicked off on July 11 is about getting back on time and to dimensionalize that for you, a 10-minute improvement within the integrated network is worth $257 million.  So we're really excited about this. We've just kicked it off. It was a monumental effort. Get this, Nando and his team had to have one-on-one conversations with 64,000 drivers in our company, talking to them about their individualized service plan because some people want to get home for dinner at night and some people want to have some overtime. So we've built individualized plans for our drivers, and we retrained hundreds of thousands of people in our methods. And we're very, very excited about the Total Service Plan. Our SMB initiative is multifaceted. And certainly, Deal Manager is part of it. We saw our win rate at 71% in the second quarter, that was 12 percentage points higher than we had planned. So we were super excited about that, and we're looking forward to rolling that outside the United States.  But it's not just the Deal Manager. By the way, I should say with Deal Manager, we're holding more of the base rate, which is great, too. That's part of the RPP strategy here. But it's much more the Deal Manager thinking about that, we have $1 billion of DAP revenue in the first 6 months of the year. And in fact, the revenue in the second quarter grew by about 100%. So we are on track to have $2 billion in DAP in the back half of the year.  We've got 18 key partners, 2.5 million merchants on the DAP platform, and we're taking that outside the United States as well. But there's more to it. It's about creating a seamless and frictionless experience for our customers. And as you know we have 16 customer journeys, we've actually identified 3 of those that really matter. And one of those is we've kind of thrown our wallet in the middle of the road, and we're going after it. And that's how to manage claims.  The claims process here is pretty clunky and it's not a good customer experience. So we are staffing that, Brian. We're staffing that and we're going to fix the claims experience because we think if we eliminate that pain point, we're going to grow even faster than the market, which we're already doing. Well, maybe I'll start, Brian, and then you could add. So -- if you recall, at the end of the first quarter, we told you we thought our volumes would be down in the second quarter. They were. They were down a little bit more than we thought. We missed our forecast by 222,000 packages a day. And that miss was split evenly between the U.S. business and the international business.  So I would call that pretty close to being on forecast. As Brian detailed in his prepared remarks, more than half of the volume decline in the United States was based on actions that we took with a few of our customers under our better, not bigger framework. One of those customers is Amazon. So I'm just going to talk about Amazon right now.  We have a great relationship with Amazon. They are our largest customer. But as we've shared with you in the past, we have reached a contractual agreement with Amazon about the volume that we will take into our network and the volume that they will deliver.  No, by the way, they got a lot of volume to deliver. The last time I looked, they have $35 billion of inventory. So they've got a lot of volume to deliver. But we've contractually agreed on what makes sense for us versus what makes sense for them. That means that both volume and revenue for Amazon is coming down. We project by the end of this year that Amazon revenue will be less than 11% of our total revenue. That gives us room to grow in the parts of the market that we want to grow, like SMB and B2B and health care and others.  So part of this is a glide path that's occurring. We thought we could fill up the divot with more enterprise volumes than we got. Part of that is macro, but here are a few fun facts. Of our top 20 customers in the second quarter, more than 65% of them grew volume with us. Another fun fact is that in the second quarter, we won new great revenue quality business in the enterprise part of our segment than we have in the past 5 years.  Now that volume hasn't come into the network yet because we just won it, but it's coming in the back half. So we are running our business the way that we want to run it in this better, not bigger framework despite the macro environment.  And Brian, what else do you want to share? And we're holding on to the more of the GRI aren't we? We're not discounting as much. And part of that is because our customers value the service that we provide. Our end-to-end network is allowing us to deliver record high service levels, and that matters. That really matters. We have additional productivity levers today that we didn't have in our investor conference 1 year ago. One of those would be the Total Service Plan. Maybe Nando was thinking about it, but we haven't kicked it off or actually put it into any of our financial plans 1 year ago.  We're also seeing some real opportunities with our Smart Packaged/ Smart Facility initiative, which we hadn't thought of 1 year ago. When we get that rolled out, we're going to eliminate all the manual scans, all those preload scans that are done manually, all that will be eliminated. All of the tens of thousands of misloads that occur every day, sorry to say, we do misload a package from time to time or lots of times.  So all of that's got to be eliminated. So we've got additional productivity initiatives that we didn't have 1 year ago, which even in an environment where, yes, costs are up more than we thought they would be, we're able to offset those costs. I think it's pretty impressive that we didn't -- we planned for the $1 an hour increase for our Teamster starting in August. We didn't plan for the COLA that we're seeing. We knew there would be some inflation, but not the amount that we are seeing and we're able to offset all of that, aren't we Brian? And to your question on the union negotiation first, these are incredibly important to us, and we've had Teamsters in our company for 100 years or thereabout. As we think about the upcoming contract negotiation, we're going to leave the negotiations at the bargaining table.  But just a few things for you to remember. Our Teamsters are the highest paid in the industry, both wage and benefits. In fact, if you're a 4-year driver here, you're making $40 an hour and fully loaded with benefits close to $150,000 a year. So our workforce is very different than a lot of the workforce that you hear in the media every day that are trying to be organized. They're not paid the way that our Teamsters are paid. These are great jobs that we value very much.  Our goal with the Teamsters is win-win-win, and that's our goal. And again, we'll keep the details of that win-win-win strategy at the bargaining table. The other thing I'll leave with you, and this is, I think, an important point is we're winning business today with customers who know, we have an upcoming negotiation because we've told our customers, we're going to take care of them. We are building contingency plans, and we will take care of our customers. Yes. I think, Scott, the way I think about it is the change in the price per gallon is one component of the RPP. And as Brian called it out, that was 400 basis points on the RPP in the second quarter. The costs associated that also impacted cost per piece or our overall increase in expenses, up 370 basis points related to fuel.  So as the price per gallon goes up or down, the margin is pretty protected. To the change in price per gallon, we also have a pricing algorithm, but it has -- it's just used it fuel as a simple way to price. It's just price. So don't think of those pricing actions as anything different than price. And fuel margins will just hold tight if you look at change in price per gallon on the revenue line and change on pricing gallon on the expense line. That's how I think about it. On peak, we're getting forecast from all of our large customers now as we build our peak planning and we expect it to be a good peak. Inventory levels are good. Retailers are brought in to sell. Where last year, they didn't. So that should help the peak demand.  And then the comment about expenses, and we could have done better, is we managed hours relative to the volume. I'm really proud of that. A few years ago, we wouldn't have been able to do that. We would have delevered, but we were able to manage our hours. Nando and his team and Kate and her team did a great job on that.  We kept the bench though. Because if we let the bench go, then we'd have to rehire them for peak, and that doesn't seem like a good idea. Now the bench, obviously, we won't be an hourly wage if they're not working, but they do get benefits. So I would say that's the money that we left on the table, but we'll get that back in spade by giving great service to our customers during peak. And Brian, Ken, I'm going to call an audible here, and I'm going to throw that question over to Nando. Nando, do you want to talk a little bit more about the Total Service Plan? Thanks, Nando. And the cool thing is that we're not trying to integrate the network. We already have an integrated network. Now we're just running it the way it was designed. Yes. I think in the past, as I understand it, when air volume softened up, the end was near. Prices softened up. That's just not happening now. As Brian detailed in his prepared remarks, more than half of the volume decline in our business, including air, was because of agreements that we reached with a few of our customers on the volume that we will take and the volume that we won't take.  The revenue quality is very good. It is sticky. As we bring in new customers, we're bringing them in and at very good revenue quality. Why? Because of what we have to offer. And in services are life. So part of it is what we have to offer from a service perspective, dependability, reliability. And what else do you want to add in terms of revenue quality, perhaps talk a little bit about the technology of the future? I love Deal Manager for so many ways. It makes it easier for our salespeople first, it makes it better and faster for our customers, which is awesome, but we're also bringing intelligence to the decision-making. Before [indiscernible] a bit of tribal knowledge. But now we're using AI to help inform the decisions, and we're coming in at better pricing as a result. Supply chains are flowing better than they were a year ago. But we're not out of the woods. And a lot of it has to do with the rolling COVID lockdowns in China. We're shutdown in Shenzhen again. And we thought we'd gone through the worst in the second quarter. Kate and her team did a masterful job of managing through this. Get this, because of the rolling lockdowns in China in different cities, when you add up the number of days that we were effectively shut down cumulatively and if you look at all the cities combined, 106 days, we had people -- UPSers sleeping on the floor of our hubs to try to keep commerce moving.  Manufacturers couldn't manufacture because they were shutdown. Ocean Freight volume levels were down in the second quarter because of the lockdowns in China. So -- and then we see what's happening with the current variant of COVID. And you just wonder about when will we ever get through it?  But what you have to do is get through it. You have to manage through it. And that's what we, as a team said we will do. We are going to run our business. We're not going to let the business run us. We're going to get through it, and that's what we're doing. And I'm just so happy you asked about delivery density. Because we've tried to move the needle in this area for a long time, and we haven't been successful, principally because we've been focused on downstream, improving delivery density through access points or SurePost Redirect. And we just really haven't moved the needle.  Yes, the density was the best this quarter since 2019, fractionally. So we're like, \"All right, what we're doing isn't working. We've got to go upstream.\" And when I mean upstream, when you think about e-commerce retailers, their upstream supply chain is from the manufacturer to their warehouse or store. Their upstream supply chain is also their order management system.  So we have been in a pilot with a third-party technology company that powers order management systems for most of the retailers in the country. The pilot is a virtual halt. We're in the order management system, the third-party technology company is holding the order until it can match another order going to the same address, and then it releases 2 orders. This pilot has been working very well.  Now you may say, well, what about service level agreement to the customer? Well, the virtual hold is only as long as the service level agreement allows. But there's a lot of hours in that service-level agreement, 9 hours, 12 hours. So what we found through the pilot is enough time to be able to match, then we release and we deliver the density.  And just to make this real for you, and this is just an estimate, but we estimate the cost of last mile for us is $5.50. That incremental package cost us $0.60. So imagine the value that can be released if we improve the density. So we're going to give some of that value back to our customers.  Why not? Their service level is not disruptive, and we are going to value share. So the pilot has been so successful. We're going live in the third quarter with the customer. We've got 9 other customers lined up who are anxious to talk to us about this. So more to come, early days, but super excited because it's different from what we've done in the past."

So the plan is really based on, as Brian mentioned, a predictable environment where our operators can plan with a lot of confidence on start time, finish time, sorts bands, how we can better utilize our automated facilities and move volume from legacy facilities to our newer, more automated facilities.  In addition to that, we've catered a very unique dispatch for our full-time drivers. And so we expect that the efficiencies coming out of those customized dispatches and the service we provide are going to allow us to run a really, really great efficient network for our customers and our employees."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to our host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nKen Cook: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2021 Form 10-K and other reports we file with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. For the first quarter of 2022, GAAP results include a net charge of $19 million or $0.02 per diluted share, comprised of after-tax transformation and other charges of $43 million offset by an after-tax gain of $24 million resulting from the curtailment of benefits in a Canadian retirement plan. Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude pension adjustments and transformation and other charges. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, is available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. If you wish to ask a question, press one and then zero on your phone to enter the queue. Please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, Ken, and good morning. This is my eighth earnings call at UPS. Since I joined the company, we faced a pandemic, social unrest, political unrest, the fallout from Brexit and now a war. Through it all I continue to be so impressed by the resiliency of UPSers and their commitment to moving our world forward by delivering what matters. I want to thank our team for their hard work and efforts in serving the needs of our customers each other and our communities during these most trying times. Before I discuss our results, I'd like to address our situation in Ukraine. Our hearts are with the people of Ukraine, who are feeling the effects of this tragedy firsthand. We have suspended all commercial operations in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, where we can – we are supporting humanitarian relief efforts and our focus is on the safety of our people. Putting the issues in Eastern Europe aside, as we discussed in February, we expected the macro environment to be dynamic and it was. Our average daily volume fell short of our plan due to several external factors that Brian will detail, but we remain focused on controlling what we can control. And looking at the first quarter, we were pleased with our results. Consolidated revenue rose 6.4% from last year to $24.4 billion and operating profit grew 12.1% from last year to $3.3 billion. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13.6%, which was 70 basis points above last year. All of our business segments delivered operating profit growth. Of note our Supply Chain Solutions businesses generated record operating profit of $481 million with a record operating margin of 11% driven by strength and forwarding in healthcare. We continue to pivot toward opportunity. We've made tremendous progress over the last two years. We are leveraging the power of our data to become much more agile. Under our Better not Bigger framework, we are investing in the capabilities that matter the most to our customers and we are winning in the parts of the market that value our end to end network like SMBs, healthcare, B2B and large enterprise accounts. How do we know we are winning because we've gained market share. Winning comes down to successfully executing our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy. Looking at customer-first, this is about creating a frictionless customer experience. Here we've made two significant enhancements to digitize the onboarding experience, making it easier for SMBs to ship with us. The first change I'll share is for our smallest customers. In the U.S., they can now go online at ups.com, answer just three questions and get a contract that includes pricing. This enables them to begin shipping in under two minutes, instead of our old process where they had to wait an average of 10 days to get started. The second enhancement is for larger SMBs. Here we are leveraging best-in-class technology to enhance the experience for our customers and our sales people. We've moved from a slow manual pricing process to a new digital platform that we call deal manager. This platform, which will be fully deployed to all U.S. SMB sales people by the end of this month, operationalizes our data and applies pricing science to present the customer with the right price the first time. For our customers, this means they no longer need to submit cumbersome sample data just to get a quote. For our sales people, they can close deals on the spot, making them more efficient and freeing them up to spend more time selling. And because this platform uses advanced analytics, the more we use it, the smarter it becomes. It's a key building block toward dynamic pricing. Our Digital Access Program, or DAP, is another important SMB growth driver. In the first quarter, we created more than 500,000 new DAP customer accounts. That's more than three times the number of new accounts created in the first quarter of last year, what's more near the end of the first quarter we began shipping DAP packages that originated outside of the U.S. As of today, DAP is available in 27 countries around the world and we are continuing to add DAP partners, putting us well on our way to achieving our $2 billion DAP revenue target in 2022. The enhancements we are making are resonating with SMB customers. In the first quarter, the U.S. SMB average daily volume growth rate including platforms outpaced the enterprise volume growth rate. In fact, in the first quarter, SMBs made up 28.4% of our total U.S. volume, up 140 basis points from one year ago. Looking at our international and supply chain solutions segments, the flexibility of our network allowed us to continue delivering for our customers within a dynamic environment. In many ways, this was one of our more challenging quarters as our international small package business faced tough year-over-year comparisons and demand was negatively impacted by ongoing disruptions due to the pandemic, but at the same time we scurried to keep up with heightened demand in our forwarding and healthcare businesses, no matter what came our way, we kept delivering with outstanding service levels. Moving to people-led, as previously announced, in the quarter we realigned our executive leadership team. First, Nando Cesarone, who has been leading our U.S. operations since 2020 assumed additional responsibility for U.S. sales and parts of engineering. This change gets us even closer to the customer, helping us better go to market as one UPS and enabling our teams to move even faster to unlock value for our customers and our shareowners. Second, Kate Gutmann assumed a new role leading both the international and supply chain solution segments in addition to our healthcare business. This allows us to better serve our global customers with our full range of services and provides opportunity for synergies in both revenue and cost. Finally, we have an external search underway for our new Chief Digital and Technology Officer. I'm delighted with the candidates that have surfaced for this role and hope to fill the position soon, which brings us to innovation driven. This is about driving higher returns from the capital we deploy. Here we are continuing to leverage the technology investments we've made to power our global smart logistics network. Throughout the quarter, we leveraged our network planning tools, automated facilities and other technologies to optimize the network and run it with greater agility. These efforts coupled with a laser focus on revenue quality contributed to a 90 basis point improvement in U.S. operating margin year-over-year. As we've discussed, we've turned productivity into a virtuous cycle at UPS. We have started the rollout of our RFID technology that we call smart package with the intense of completing 100 centers in 2022. This year, we will also begin the implementation of automated bagging, automated label application, and robotic small sort induction, all this to drive increased productivity. As an innovation driven company, we are marching down the path toward our goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050. Here is one example, we have two data centers that drive our global integrated network. These data centers are now powered 100% by renewable energy sources to give you some context, the power used to run these two data centers is the equivalent of the electricity needed to run 5,000 homes for one year. As we look ahead, we think the macro environment will be very dynamic, but we see many positives inside our business. We continue to deliver high service levels. We are gaining market share. We are more agile today than what I onboarded and we are focused on controlling what we can control to achieve the financial targets we've laid out. Brian will share the details regarding our outlook, but let me end by reaffirming our 2022 consolidated financial goals. In 2022, we expect to generate about $102 billion in revenue, consolidated operating margin of approximately 13.7%. And we expect return on invested capital to be greater than 30%. We are confident in our outlook and our financial condition. As a result, we are increasing our share repurchases for 2022, taking the target up to $2 billion for the year. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks Carol and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover four areas, starting with the macro environment, then our first quarter results. Next, I'll cover cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll provide an update on our financial outlook for 2022. As Carol mentioned, external factors resulted in a challenging operating environment in the first quarter. Early in January, Omicron negatively impacted retail sales and pressured volumes. The impact of Omicron subsided in February and volume growth turned slightly positive. Then late in the quarter, the combination of record high inflation, a surge energy prices, COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia and geopolitical uncertainty resulted in our consolidated volume growth rates turning negative. Despite these external factors, we remain agile and delivered strong first quarter results by continuing to execute our strategy and quickly adjusting our network to match capacity with the needs of our customers. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue increased 6.4% to $24.4 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.3 billion, 12.1% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13.6%, which was 70 basis points above last year. For the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was $3.05 up 10.1% from the same period last year. Now let's look at our business segments, U.S. domestic delivered strong first quarter results. Our success was driven by continued gains in revenue quality and by leveraging the agility of our network to control costs. We had planned for volume to be down slightly in the first quarter, based on volume projections from a few of our largest customers, we expected to fill this gap with other enterprise volume, but market conditions did not support. And our volume was lower than planned. Total average daily volume in the U.S. was down 3% or 611,000 packages per day versus the first quarter of last year, driven by a 7.4% decline in residential volume. Looking back to March 2021, stimulus checks arrived at many U.S. households and contributed to difficult year-over-year comps in the first quarter of this year. The decline in residential deliveries included a reduction in SurePost volume of about 312,000 packages per day. The decrease in residential volume was partially offset by a 3.6% increase in B2B average daily volume with growth from both enterprise and SMB customers. In the first quarter, B2B represented 43% of our volume, which was up from 40% in the first quarter of 2021. Even within the current environment, the execution of our strategy is continuing to drive improvement in customer mix. In the first quarter, SMB average daily volume, including platforms was up 1.9% and SMBs made up 28.4% of U.S. domestic volume, an increase of 140 basis points over last year. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $15.1 billion, up 8%, which included the benefit of one additional operating day. Revenue per piece increased 9.5% more than offsetting the volume decline in the first quarter. Together, fuel surcharges and base rates drove 820 basis points of the revenue per piece improvement with mix contributing the rest of the growth. Additionally, revenue per piece grew across all products and customer segments with ground revenue per piece up 8.4%. Turning to costs, total expense grew 6.9%, total payroll and benefits, which included market rate adjustments drove 390 basis points of the increase and fuel drove 230 basis points of the expense growth rate increase. The remaining expense growth rate increase was driven by multiple factors, including weaken expansion and depreciation. The investments we've made in our automated facilities coupled with our productivity improvement initiatives enabled us to eliminate more than 1,300 trailer loads per day, compared to the same period last year, which contributed to the positive operating leverage in the quarter. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, an increase of $242 million or 16.5% compared to the first quarter of 2021. And operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 11.3%. Looking outside of the U.S., let me start by providing some information on our direct exposure to Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. Revenue from these three countries represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenue in 2021, while the direct financial impact is not material to our business. We are closely monitoring the broader impacts across the global economy. Moving to our international segment performance by leveraging the agility of our global network and focusing on revenue quality, international executed well in a challenging global market, navigating through increases in global inflation, a war and COVID-19 disruptions. In contrast to the U.S., we planned for international volume to grow in the first quarter and it did not. Total average daily volume was down 256,000 packages per day or 6.7% in the first quarter. Part of the decline was due to tough comps from one year ago. When looking at performance on a two year stack basis, total international average daily volume was up 16.4%. In the first quarter of 2022 international domestic average daily volume was down 10.1%, representing nearly 80% of the decrease in international volume. Total export average daily volume declined 2.9% due to a combination of factors, including COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia. In response, we adjusted the network and were able to keep our operations moving in Asia and at the same time shifted capacity where it was needed to serve our customers globally. For example, average daily volume on the Europe to U.S. lane grew 10.7%. In the first quarter, international revenue increased 5.8% to $4.9 billion. Revenue per piece increased 10.5%, including a 710 basis point benefit from fuel and a 680 basis point benefit from revenue quality and mix, offset by a 340 basis point negative impact due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of 2.7% and operating margin was 23% down 70 basis points year-over-year. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. In the first quarter, the segment delivered record operating profit in a dynamic environment. Revenue increased to $4.4 billion up 2%, despite the divestiture of UPS Freight, which accounted for $767 million of Supply Chain Solutions revenue in the first quarter of 2021. Looking at the key performance drivers. Forwarding revenue was up 25% and operating profit more than doubled by managing the buy-sell spreads, while global market demand continued to outpace supply. Our teams did an outstanding job helping our customers manage through this challenging market. Within forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit delivered strong operating profit growth driven by revenue quality initiatives. And our Healthcare business delivered record revenue and operating profit results in the first quarter led by pharma, clinical trials and lab customers. In the first quarter Supply Chain Solutions generated an operating profit of $481 million and delivered a record operating margin of 11%, 180 basis points above last year. Walking through the rest of the income statement. We had $174 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $298 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate in the first quarter came in at 21.5% flat to last year and lower than planned due to discrete items. For the full year and 2022, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 23%. Now let’s turn to cash and shareowner returns. We are continuing to generate strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and bottom line results. In the first quarter, we generated $4.5 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $3.9 billion, a 5.5% increase year-over-year. And in the first quarter UPS distributed $1.3 billion in dividends and completed $260 million in share buybacks, which brings us to our outlook for the remainder of 2022. According to IHS, GDP expectations for the full year have been lowered from previous forecasts. Global GDP is now expected to grow 3.2% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 3% and the macroenvironment is expected to be bumpy for the remainder of 2022. We are continuing to pay close attention to macro elements, including COVID-19, upstream supply chain constraints, inventory and inflationary pressures and the geopolitical environment. Despite this backdrop, we are reaffirming our consolidated financial targets for 2022 driven by our results in the first quarter and the momentum we are seeing in the second quarter. Consolidated revenues are expected to be about $102 billion, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight. Consolidated operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7% and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%. We expect our path to achieve these financial targets will be different than we shared with you in February. We have proven our ability to adapt in a dynamic environment and we have many levers to pull that give us confidence in our ability to achieve our targets. In U.S. Domestic, our revenue guidance is not changing. We anticipate revenue growth of around 5.5% with revenue per piece growing faster than volume. In terms of volume, however, we anticipate volume growth rates will be lower than we originally expected. The volume growth rate in the first half of the year is expected to be negative and we expect it to improve in the second half of the year. Pricing is expected to remain firm and will continue to price based on the value we provide to our customers. Lastly, in U.S. Domestic, we expect operating margin to expand around 50 basis points for the full year in 2022. In International, our revenue guidance is unchanged. Revenue growth is anticipated to be approximately 7.7% driven by revenue quality initiatives. We anticipate volume will be lower than originally planned and given the value we offer our customers, we expect pricing to remain firm. Operating margin in the International segment is anticipated to be about 23.6%. In Supply Chain Solutions, our revenue expectation is unchanged at around $17 billion driven by our healthcare portfolio and forwarding. We expect ocean rates to moderate below 2021 peak levels. Operating margin is expected to be about 9.4%. As a reminder, we will lap the sale of UPS Freight at the end of April. Turning to capital allocation. For the full year and 2022, we still expect free cash flow to be around $9 billion, including our annual pension contributions. Capital expenditures are still expected to be about 5.4% of revenue or $5.5 billion, which includes two 747-8 aircraft, two automated hubs, more than 3,700 alternative fuel vehicles and additional technology investments. All of which will enable greater efficiency in our integrated network and move us further down the path to achieving our 2050 carbon neutral goal. And in 2022, we are planning to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval. Regarding debt repayment, as of today, our plan is to repay $2 billion in debt at maturity this year. Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, we are doubling the amount of cash we plan to allocate share repurchases to $2 billion in 2022, further rewarding our shareowners. We are executing our strategy and we will remain agile, as we continue to navigate the dynamic macroenvironment. We are laser focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve and disciplined capital allocation. And by controlling what we can control, we are confident in our outlook and our financial condition. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Brian, what impact did fuel have on RPP in domestic? I know, you said 800 bps fuel plus base rates. Wanted to see if you can just give us – just isolate the fuel piece of that. And Carol, I was hoping you can talk about the recent Amazon Buy with Prime initiative. It seems like that eats into the SMB strategy or potentially eats into the SMB strategy. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that strategy that Amazon is pursuing and the implications for UPS and also UPS’ relationship with Amazon as well?\nBrian Newman: Hi, Amit. Good morning. Happy to break down the fuel piece. And then I’ll turn it over to Carol for the Amazon question. You saw the 9.5% RPP growth in domestic and think of that as about 80% rate and 20% mix approximately the mix being driven by our continued performance on the SMB side. But the split of the 80% is roughly equal, it’s about half fuel and then half base pricing as you split it out. And Amit, I would just make one comment. As we think about pricing and as we go down further down this journey, fuel is one component of our pricing lever. We have surcharges, we have base rate GRI. So within that it was approximately split between base pricing and fuel. Carol, did you want to take Amazon?\nCarol Tome: Yes. Happy to take the Amazon question. Thank you, Amit. We have a very good relationship with Amazon. They are our largest customer. And as we talked about at the end of the fourth quarter, we’ve reached agreement with Amazon about the packages that we will take into our network and the packages that they will deliver on their behalf. And it’s a mutually beneficial relationship. As it relates to their latest announcement, we see that as a very clever marketing play by Amazon, but just putting Amazon Prime badge on a SMB website, if the website even exists, doesn’t put that much risk to us, we believe.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit – for a little bit more perspective, just on the volume framework. What – I mean, I’m guessing you don’t want to give us a kind of precise month by month. But what did – if you do great, but what did March look like in terms of how much weaker? And then what does April look like? I don’t know if you want to comment on. I mean, I’m asking primarily on domestic package, if you want to offer international thought as well. But just kind of that volume trajectory and how that fits into the overall outlook and expectation for second quarter?\nCarol Tome: Well, I’ll start. Brian, and then please join in. So Tom, as Brian mentioned, we planned for our U.S. Domestic volumes to decline slightly in the first quarter. We actually missed our plan by about 500,000 pieces per day. And when we started to peel back the layers of the onion to understand what happened because there was a lot of variability in the demand. January was soft because of Omicron and then February came back and was nicely positive and then March turned negative again. And we’re like, why? Well, as we looked at the impact of the stimulus, we found a aha moment. When the stimulus checks hit last year, we saw our average daily volume jump by 400,000 pieces per day. We and our customers thought we could comp that this year, but because of all of the external factors that we’re facing consumers, that proved to be tough. And in fact, if you look at the performance of our SurePost product, last year SurePost grew 35%. This year SurePost declined in the first quarter, 10.5%. And if you look through that, you can see that five customers actually drove more than 60% of the year-over-year decline. And in talking to those customers, they tell us it was just too hard to comp those stimulus checks. So that explains what happens in the quarter. Why do we feel good about the volume going forward? Well, the comparisons get easier. And I can look at what’s happening in April. Our April volume is better than our March volume, so we’re trending in the right direction. And then I look at the volume that’s coming into the network at great revenue quality for deals that we’ve just cut. So over the next several months, we’ve got new volume coming into our business, both from enterprise customers, as well as SMB customers. So we feel very good about the volume projections that are coming into our new network. Just a comment on the international volume, if I could. We thought we’d have export volume growth in the quarter. We did not. It really was because of the COVID rolling lockdowns in Asia. We had flight cancellations it was a tough environment. In fact, we still have people who are sleeping in sleeping bags in the hub. It’s a tough environment there. If you back out the COVID lockdowns and some shift from air to freight, our Asia export business would’ve been up in the quarter. So we’re going to get through this. We are convinced we’re going to get through this and expect the volume to improve internationally. Brian, what would you like to add?\nBrian Newman: Carol, I think you covered it well. The only thing I would add is one point in international though, we did prove agile with the COVID lockdowns in Asia, as you referenced. We were able to move some of that aircraft and airlift over to Europe. And as I mentioned, the Europe to U.S. air lane was up 10%. So moving the equipment despite the volume softness, I think plays very well in the integrated network.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: [Indiscernible] (32:20) talk a little bit more in detail. I think you mentioned productivity levers a few times. If you need to be agile depending on what happens with overall demand. Can you maybe hit on a couple of those fine points and how you could flex the network if need be to get to your targets. Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Sure. Happy to Jordan. Good morning. We do have cost inflation and pressures like everyone else out there and obviously payroll and benefits and fuel are the two biggest in our system. But we are driving productivity, as we think about it. We’re leveraging automated facilities. We’re bringing two automated hubs online this year, one in Pennsylvania, one in California and that will allow us to leverage automated bagging, label applications, et cetera. Carol’s talked before about the smart package, smart facility. We’re rolling that out in 2022. And so that will be a further driver of productivity this year as we think about it. And then within the quarter, ADV was actually down 3% as we mentioned, but hours per day were down 3%. So pieces per hour were basically flat. And then lastly, one of the things that the team is doing very effectively in the U.S., Jordan is the cube utilization, leveraging data to cube out the trucks. It reduced our loads per day better than the volume decline or outpaced it.\nCarol Tome: And I just want to give a shout out to our operators in the U.S. for managing through this very choppy volume environment to have pieces per hour flat when volumes up and down in a quarter is, is just as a sign of agility. And as to your question about levers, we are able to manage hours very well. If there were to be sustained volume down and we’re not counting on that. But if that were the case, then we would actually take head cut out. But now we’re just managing the hours and doing a matchable job of it.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTodd Fowler: Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. So I wanted to ask on the cadence of U.S. Domestic margins throughout the year. I think Brian previously you had given some guidance for first half versus second half. And I’m just curious with the change in the volume expectations with what you’re seeing on the pricing front. If that pushes out kind of the cadence of how we see U.S. Domestic volumes trend throughout the year? Or are we going to be kind of in a more steady state and kind of reducing some of that seasonality, like you’ve talked about in the past? Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Todd. Yes, happy to talk about domestic margin. We’re sticking with the guidance I had given previously, which was 11.6% domestically for the full year. And it was pretty balanced, pretty close to that the first half and second half. We printed an 11.3% in the first quarter. We’re still holding to that 11.6% for the first half and we think the second half will look similar. So net-net up 90 bps in the first quarter, but looking for a 60 basis point improvement in the first half.\nTodd Fowler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Thanks. Good morning. Can you just talk about – I think you said that the volumes would be better or positive in the second half of the year. What changes first half or second half? Is that just a comp? And then if are in a period of more sustained volume pressure, what’s the ability to maintain this level of pricing improvement and margin improvement if the volumes, I guess, stay negative for longer?\nCarol Tome: So in terms of our confidence of the volume and getting better, the comparisons do get easier, Scott, for sure. But we also are winning in the marketplace because of the service we provide. And I'm super proud of our sales team, who are out there knocking on doors, bringing back customers, some of which candidly had left us but they love the service that we provide, they're coming in a great revenue quality and that's very important too. So we have – we feel very good about what we see coming into the network. And I just want to go back and talk a moment about DAP. Our DAP revenue grew over 50% and in the first quarter that – that platform is on fire and we're taking it outside of the United States now, which is very exciting and in our case looking forward to having DAP come to Europe. So we're well on our way to get to that $2 billion DAP target by the end of this year. In terms of sustained pricing, pricing is really a function of demand and supply, and there still is a demand and supply imbalance, particularly in certain geos around the world, where for whatever reason be it COVID, or labor shortages, or just challenges, the service levels are there. We price for the service that we provide and are not seeing any pressure on the pricing environment right now.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, good morning. Thank you, operator. So, Carol, as you look out in the back half of the year, can you talk to kind of what's embedded in the guide with respect to mix? And whether you're seeing any sort of pickup in B2B traction, given the fact that the FedEx ground network seems to be running at service levels, we probably haven't seen in, I don't know, 20-some-odd years?\nCarol Tome: Well, Brian, perhaps you want to talk more about the guidance?\nBrian Newman: Sure, so happy to. Look, in the first quarter, our resi B2C was 57% of the mix and commercial was 43%. We had guided for the full year to a 60:40 spread and we still think that's a pretty good number. As we think about mix changes in the business, we're looking for SMB to actually grow about 150 basis points improved from a mix perspective. We saw 140 in the first quarter, so we think that 150 is a good number. So Dave, I think as you split the year, a 60:40 on the resi to comm and about 150 improvement in the SMB is probably good – still stands.\nCarol Tome: I would say, interestingly in the SMB space, it's now split 50:50, commercial-residential. And we saw our commercial business grow almost 4% in the first quarter. So we're going to take every opportunity to win in that space as well because service matters to that customer base.\nDavid Vernon: And do you have any thoughts on where that long-term mix like what are you kind of designing the network to be for, say, three years out? Is it that 60:40 going to hold? Or like how do you think about what you want this business to look like in three years?\nCarol Tome: We want the business to be the best of our context as that meets the needs of the customers. And so, we haven't declared what that mix should be, but that's actually a pretty interesting challenge for us as team at our June strategy meeting to think about what – where – what do we want declare that mix to be.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thank you guys for the time.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Carol, maybe to follow up on that last one. Can you just give us an update on where you think that the market sizing is when you look at the small – the short zone rather in the long and mid-zone? Last time I think the update was in the Investor Day in 2021. Has that really changed at all given all the various puts and takes and dynamics that we've seen here unfold in the last couple of quarters? And then maybe for Brian, have you seen any price sensitivity with fuel going up so much? If customers started to trade down and make other adjustments, given how much those prices will run up? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: So we haven't updated the market sizing in any material way since our June Investor Day. And when we do, we will certainly share that with you.\nBrian Newman: And just on the – Brian, the price sensitivity comment, no, I think, as Carol mentioned, probably the most important piece is the service we provide and with the service numbers we're printing not getting a lot of pushback on that because I think we're – from delivering good service. Also when you think about the pricing, there is a split, as I mentioned, between fuel and the base rate. So we're managing holistically, but I think the pricing holding firm is probably the guide.\nKen Cook: Yes. If I could just give a quick reminder to limit the questions to one, and then you can jump back in queue for follow up opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Great. Thank you. I guess when you're thinking about the B2B, B2C mix, and I think you saw a 7% decline in residential, B2B was up for the quarter. I know 64 is sort of what you're looking for, for the full year. I'm guessing in the interim, it's probably more likely that we're seeing B2B grow faster than residential. And does that provide you any sort of margin tailwind when you think about sort of the outlook for the full year on the domestic side, 11.6? Are we expecting any sort of tailwind that you could get from pickup in B2B? And then maybe, Carol, just a little bit more finer point and sort of what you're seeing from the consumer. Just kind of curious, I know you mentioned the stimulus last year being part of that impact on volume. But are you seeing sort of anything else that might suggest either a pivot from goods to services or other deceleration in the consumer end market?\nCarol Tome: So we don't have direct insight to the consumer behavior. It's more from what we're hearing from our customers, who are telling us there has been a bit of a shift from goods to services. And you're probably experiencing that if you've gone on vacations, it seems like the hotels are full, all the planes are full, and people are going out to eat. And gosh I was in Washington, D.C. last week, and the bar was hoping at midnight. So people are spending money differently than they would. But as it relates to the guidance that we've given and we feel good about the volume that's coming back into our network and the guidance that we've laid out.\nBrian Newman: Yes. And I just pick up one point on the commercial. Certainly, the B2B from a density standpoint is better than the resi, so we like that. But you have to remember, SurePost was down 10%, so that's impacting the mix as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker:\n[indiscernible] (0:43:15):\nBrian Newman: Yes, Helane, happy to address the CapEx. We are holding at the $5.5 billion for the year, so not coming off that. There's a little bit of timing noise in the first quarter, so it looked like we understand, but that was simply timing. As far as where we're investing, certainly putting into automation that – that's the one area we're trying to double down in. On the technology side, some of those are OpEx versus CapEx investments. So in terms of splitting the type of investments we're making, but certainly we are – we have two large automated hubs going in this year. We're looking at the smart package, smart facilities, so we're investing there. Whatever we can do to drive more automation is a positive thing from a cost expense standpoint.\nCarol Tome: Yes. What I've asked the team to do is to tell me how fast they can go because the – the capital is not going to get in the way of speed here. Automation is critically important to deliver service for our customers as well as drive productivity. Of the automation activities we have underway, be it automated label application or automated bagging or robotic sort induction, it's a head count opportunity this year alone of 1,200 people inside our buildings and that's going to double next year and continue to take off. So we're not going to let perfection get in the way, good enough here. We're going to go fast. As it relates to cybersecurity, that's the one budget I will not touch. We continue to invest in cyber. It's a scary time for all of us, but we are leaning in from a cyber perspective. Clearly, if you think about the challenges coming out of Eastern Europe, we have taken every system down. So we're at no risk there. But of course, we could – we have attacks on our company every day, but our cyber team does a masterful job awarding off those attacks. And we're spending a lot of money to ensure that we protect our customer data, our personal information of our people and all the incredible pricing information that we have that gives us a competitive advantage. So knock on wood, of course, because every company is vulnerable here, but we're certainly investing in protection.\nHelane Becker: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. Just to clarify, Carol, Brian, if you see volumes more negative in the near-term, is then there a bigger push on pricing or mix gains to get to those same margin and revenue targets? And then, I guess just a follow-up on CapEx, you only spent, I guess, $0.5 billion in the first quarter yet you kept the CapEx at $5.5 billion. Is there increased confidence you can get, the targets by year end or maybe just talk about your CapEx target a bit?\nBrian Newman: So Ken, on the CapEx, I mentioned a minute ago that it was more timing related in terms of the year-over-year. I think it was about $300 million decline year-over-year in the first quarter. So that basically was just timing. So that won't impact us. We'll come back in the middle of the year and re-look the full year number, but as of now holding to the $5.5 billion in CapEx.\nCarol Tome: We freed up some capacity in our network to allow us to go out and win, where in the past couple of years, it was harder because of peak gating, there's only so much volume a company like UPS can take into the network during peak. You only have so many doors for cars, you only have so many buildings, but because we've freed up some capacity, we can actually give our customers more peak availability that's allowing us to win with great revenue quality. So right now, we don't view that the revenue quality is at risk. And remember there is still a demand/supply imbalance, and it's exasperated in certain parts of the country. So we are winning because of the SurePost.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning everyone. And thank you for taking my question. I want to come back to the fuel issue because it looks like you guys have adjusted your fuel surcharge, maybe three or four times in the better part of the past year. Is there any risk that if fuel prices were to materially come down from here that that's potentially a margin or profit headwind? Can you just tell us why adjusting surcharge still frequently is the right way to go?\nCarol Tome: So if we look at our fuel surcharge, as Brian mentioned is just part of our overall pricing algorithm and yes, it does move off of the weekly change in the PPG index. But to that, we add a pricing modifier. So think of it known differently than a demand surcharge or a network surcharge or just a plain price. And people are willing to pay for this because of the service we provide. If we look at the impact to our business in the first quarter for the domestic business alone, 55% of the fuel benefit came from changes in the PPG index. 45% of the benefit came from actions that we took from a pricing perspective. We are always thoughtful about changes in pricing of course. We price for the services we provide. Many of our published prices, as you know, are also discounted. So I think that's something you need to keep in mind too, as you think about, are you adjusting too frequently? We price for the services we provide and then we also will discount, but just on a discounting, if I could, we mentioned the new tool that we just introduced to, which we call bill manager. And this is providing pricing analytics to our sales team as they go about negotiating deals. And in fact, as we looked at our pilots, 41% of our volume one and our volume rate wins or volume wins have increased from where they were trending. The discounting is lower in 41% of the volume wins than it had been using our old pricing science. So science rules in many ways, when it comes to pricing, you ask a lot of questions here about elasticity and what are you doing with pricing, science really rules here as we think about providing the best overall equation for our customers.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jairam Nathan of Daiwa. Please go ahead.\nJairam Nathan: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig a little deeper on international. I think the original guidance for Jan, Feb was that intra-Europe volumes will improve. And we did see that kind of coming below expectations in the first quarter. So what are you thinking right now on that?\nBrian Newman: So from a intra-Europe perspective obviously there's been a lot of dislocation with the conflict over there and – but as Carol mentioned at the top of the call, we had actually planned for volume growth internationally and it came down. So we continue to monitor the COVID situation lockdowns in Asia, the European geopolitical conflict and will continue to manage from a volume perspective. But we anticipate the second quarter to look somewhat like the first quarter from a volume perspective.\nJairam Nathan: So would you – is the plan to offset the volume lesser – lower volume with mix or price?\nBrian Newman: Well, I think we did that in the first quarter, we were down 70 basis points on a margin perspective. And I think the full year guide was for down 60 basis points. So we were basically trending in line with our full year guide in the first quarter to do exactly what you just said.\nJairam Nathan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. Carol, in this inflationary environment, obviously managing costs is important. I know it's a big folks years, now that we're about a third of the way through the year. Any update on how you're progressing on the $500 million of cost savings, managing the discussion of a little bit more in depth on how the RFIDs improving there and cube utilization package selection time, any metrics there? Are you – and is there upside opportunity there with presumably an enhanced focus? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: So the $500 million cost out target related to what we call non-ops or overhead and we initially had $1 billion target in which we delivered $500 million last year, we're going to do it again this year. So that's tracking as we laid out, very proud of the team for that. When you introduce technology, it can free up a lot of manual activities. And we're really all about putting our resources where we can get the highest return. As it relates to the RFID technology, boy, we were worried about putting it in this year because of supply chain jams, but we were able to procure all the batteries and labels that we need. So we will get it up this year before peak and a hundred of our centers. And what this will do long-term for us, it looks pretty powerful, wave one alone. It will eliminate all the manual scans done by our pre-loaders. If that doesn't drive productivity, I don't know what will, and it will avoid all the miss sorts, when a package gets miss sorted and it goes into the wrong package car, that's not a very good experience for our customer and it actually just a drag on productivity. So really excited about where that's going to take us long-term and the project is on tech. Nando is also driving what he calls total service, which is running this network, which was designed for perfection at perfection. We haven't been there for lots of reasons, COVID and all kinds of reasons, but it's pretty powerful because if you think about just delays and traffic or delays leaving the package centers, it can cost a hundred of millions of dollars that relate. So running the network for the way it was designed is powerful and Nando just kicked this off. And will bringing you up to speed along this initiative as we go along.\nKen Cook: Hey, Steven, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nChristyne McGarvey: Hey everyone. This is Christyne McGarvey on for Ravi. Thanks for sweeping me in here at the end. Maybe I'll just going back to some of the B2C, B2B commentary from earlier in the call, but maybe I can ask it in a slightly different way. I think last week there was a Wall Street Journal article about e-commerce gains, kind of that we saw through the pandemic, at least as a percentage of overall, retail had been normalizing pretty sharply. I'd be curious if you guys are seeing something similar. And if not, maybe you can just touch on your thoughts on how much of those e-commerce gains, you think will be permanent versus kind of reverting to trend line?\nCarol Tome: Well, look, I applaud the retail stores who are doing a masterful job of offering buy online pickup in a store, buy online return in store, come to my store, come to my store, come to my store because if they don't get traffic into their store, well, they'll deleverage that fixed cost. And then we'll have to close stores. So I admire what they're doing, but there's still been a permanent shift in customer preferences. Customers want to shop when, where, and how they want to shop. And they want their packages delivered to them when, where, and how they want them. It might be inside of the store. It might be at their home or at their workplace or at a consolidated pickup point. So we're not going to see the kind of growth that we experience during COVID clearly, but e-commerce sales will continue to grow. We want to serve that customer, but we also want to serve the commercial customer because that's a very good customer for us. So while we may have said a 60/40 mix, the mix is going to go where the volume is, and we will lean into that growth appropriately.\nChristyne McGarvey: Excellent.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the conference back over to our host, Mr. Ken Cook.\nKen Cook: Excellent. Thanks everybody for joining today and have a great day.",

            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks Carol and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover four areas, starting with the macro environment, then our first quarter results. Next, I'll cover cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll provide an update on our financial outlook for 2022. As Carol mentioned, external factors resulted in a challenging operating environment in the first quarter. Early in January, Omicron negatively impacted retail sales and pressured volumes. The impact of Omicron subsided in February and volume growth turned slightly positive. Then late in the quarter, the combination of record high inflation, a surge energy prices, COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia and geopolitical uncertainty resulted in our consolidated volume growth rates turning negative. Despite these external factors, we remain agile and delivered strong first quarter results by continuing to execute our strategy and quickly adjusting our network to match capacity with the needs of our customers. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue increased 6.4% to $24.4 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.3 billion, 12.1% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13.6%, which was 70 basis points above last year. For the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was $3.05 up 10.1% from the same period last year. Now let's look at our business segments, U.S. domestic delivered strong first quarter results. Our success was driven by continued gains in revenue quality and by leveraging the agility of our network to control costs. We had planned for volume to be down slightly in the first quarter, based on volume projections from a few of our largest customers, we expected to fill this gap with other enterprise volume, but market conditions did not support. And our volume was lower than planned. Total average daily volume in the U.S. was down 3% or 611,000 packages per day versus the first quarter of last year, driven by a 7.4% decline in residential volume. Looking back to March 2021, stimulus checks arrived at many U.S. households and contributed to difficult year-over-year comps in the first quarter of this year. The decline in residential deliveries included a reduction in SurePost volume of about 312,000 packages per day. The decrease in residential volume was partially offset by a 3.6% increase in B2B average daily volume with growth from both enterprise and SMB customers. In the first quarter, B2B represented 43% of our volume, which was up from 40% in the first quarter of 2021. Even within the current environment, the execution of our strategy is continuing to drive improvement in customer mix. In the first quarter, SMB average daily volume, including platforms was up 1.9% and SMBs made up 28.4% of U.S. domestic volume, an increase of 140 basis points over last year. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $15.1 billion, up 8%, which included the benefit of one additional operating day. Revenue per piece increased 9.5% more than offsetting the volume decline in the first quarter. Together, fuel surcharges and base rates drove 820 basis points of the revenue per piece improvement with mix contributing the rest of the growth. Additionally, revenue per piece grew across all products and customer segments with ground revenue per piece up 8.4%. Turning to costs, total expense grew 6.9%, total payroll and benefits, which included market rate adjustments drove 390 basis points of the increase and fuel drove 230 basis points of the expense growth rate increase. The remaining expense growth rate increase was driven by multiple factors, including weaken expansion and depreciation. The investments we've made in our automated facilities coupled with our productivity improvement initiatives enabled us to eliminate more than 1,300 trailer loads per day, compared to the same period last year, which contributed to the positive operating leverage in the quarter. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, an increase of $242 million or 16.5% compared to the first quarter of 2021. And operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 11.3%. Looking outside of the U.S., let me start by providing some information on our direct exposure to Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. Revenue from these three countries represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenue in 2021, while the direct financial impact is not material to our business. We are closely monitoring the broader impacts across the global economy. Moving to our international segment performance by leveraging the agility of our global network and focusing on revenue quality, international executed well in a challenging global market, navigating through increases in global inflation, a war and COVID-19 disruptions. In contrast to the U.S., we planned for international volume to grow in the first quarter and it did not. Total average daily volume was down 256,000 packages per day or 6.7% in the first quarter. Part of the decline was due to tough comps from one year ago. When looking at performance on a two year stack basis, total international average daily volume was up 16.4%. In the first quarter of 2022 international domestic average daily volume was down 10.1%, representing nearly 80% of the decrease in international volume. Total export average daily volume declined 2.9% due to a combination of factors, including COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia. In response, we adjusted the network and were able to keep our operations moving in Asia and at the same time shifted capacity where it was needed to serve our customers globally. For example, average daily volume on the Europe to U.S. lane grew 10.7%. In the first quarter, international revenue increased 5.8% to $4.9 billion. Revenue per piece increased 10.5%, including a 710 basis point benefit from fuel and a 680 basis point benefit from revenue quality and mix, offset by a 340 basis point negative impact due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of 2.7% and operating margin was 23% down 70 basis points year-over-year. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. In the first quarter, the segment delivered record operating profit in a dynamic environment. Revenue increased to $4.4 billion up 2%, despite the divestiture of UPS Freight, which accounted for $767 million of Supply Chain Solutions revenue in the first quarter of 2021. Looking at the key performance drivers. Forwarding revenue was up 25% and operating profit more than doubled by managing the buy-sell spreads, while global market demand continued to outpace supply. Our teams did an outstanding job helping our customers manage through this challenging market. Within forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit delivered strong operating profit growth driven by revenue quality initiatives. And our Healthcare business delivered record revenue and operating profit results in the first quarter led by pharma, clinical trials and lab customers. In the first quarter Supply Chain Solutions generated an operating profit of $481 million and delivered a record operating margin of 11%, 180 basis points above last year. Walking through the rest of the income statement. We had $174 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $298 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate in the first quarter came in at 21.5% flat to last year and lower than planned due to discrete items. For the full year and 2022, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 23%. Now let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. We are continuing to generate strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and bottom line results. In the first quarter, we generated $4.5 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $3.9 billion, a 5.5% increase year-over-year. And in the first quarter UPS distributed $1.3 billion in dividends and completed $260 million in share buybacks, which brings us to our outlook for the remainder of 2022. According to IHS, GDP expectations for the full year have been lowered from previous forecasts. Global GDP is now expected to grow 3.2% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 3% and the macroenvironment is expected to be bumpy for the remainder of 2022. We are continuing to pay close attention to macro elements, including COVID-19, upstream supply chain constraints, inventory and inflationary pressures and the geopolitical environment. Despite this backdrop, we are reaffirming our consolidated financial targets for 2022 driven by our results in the first quarter and the momentum we are seeing in the second quarter. Consolidated revenues are expected to be about $102 billion, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight. Consolidated operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7% and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%. We expect our path to achieve these financial targets will be different than we shared with you in February. We have proven our ability to adapt in a dynamic environment and we have many levers to pull that give us confidence in our ability to achieve our targets. In U.S. Domestic, our revenue guidance is not changing. We anticipate revenue growth of around 5.5% with revenue per piece growing faster than volume. In terms of volume, however, we anticipate volume growth rates will be lower than we originally expected. The volume growth rate in the first half of the year is expected to be negative and we expect it to improve in the second half of the year. Pricing is expected to remain firm and will continue to price based on the value we provide to our customers. Lastly, in U.S. Domestic, we expect operating margin to expand around 50 basis points for the full year in 2022. In International, our revenue guidance is unchanged. Revenue growth is anticipated to be approximately 7.7% driven by revenue quality initiatives. We anticipate volume will be lower than originally planned and given the value we offer our customers, we expect pricing to remain firm. Operating margin in the International segment is anticipated to be about 23.6%. In Supply Chain Solutions, our revenue expectation is unchanged at around $17 billion driven by our healthcare portfolio and forwarding. We expect ocean rates to moderate below 2021 peak levels. Operating margin is expected to be about 9.4%. As a reminder, we will lap the sale of UPS Freight at the end of April. Turning to capital allocation. For the full year and 2022, we still expect free cash flow to be around $9 billion, including our annual pension contributions. Capital expenditures are still expected to be about 5.4% of revenue or $5.5 billion, which includes two 747-8 aircraft, two automated hubs, more than 3,700 alternative fuel vehicles and additional technology investments. All of which will enable greater efficiency in our integrated network and move us further down the path to achieving our 2050 carbon neutral goal. And in 2022, we are planning to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval. Regarding debt repayment, as of today, our plan is to repay $2 billion in debt at maturity this year. Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, we are doubling the amount of cash we plan to allocate share repurchases to $2 billion in 2022, further rewarding our shareowners. We are executing our strategy and we will remain agile, as we continue to navigate the dynamic macroenvironment. We are laser focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve and disciplined capital allocation. And by controlling what we can control, we are confident in our outlook and our financial condition. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines. Hi, Amit. Good morning. Happy to break down the fuel piece. And then I'll turn it over to Carol for the Amazon question. You saw the 9.5% RPP growth in domestic and think of that as about 80% rate and 20% mix approximately the mix being driven by our continued performance on the SMB side. But the split of the 80% is roughly equal, it's about half fuel and then half base pricing as you split it out. And Amit, I would just make one comment. As we think about pricing and as we go down further down this journey, fuel is one component of our pricing lever. We have surcharges, we have base rate GRI. So within that it was approximately split between base pricing and fuel. Carol, did you want to take Amazon? Carol, I think you covered it well. The only thing I would add is one point in international though, we did prove agile with the COVID lockdowns in Asia, as you referenced. We were able to move some of that aircraft and airlift over to Europe. And as I mentioned, the Europe to U.S. air lane was up 10%. So moving the equipment despite the volume softness, I think plays very well in the integrated network. Sure. Happy to Jordan. Good morning. We do have cost inflation and pressures like everyone else out there and obviously payroll and benefits and fuel are the two biggest in our system. But we are driving productivity, as we think about it. We're leveraging automated facilities. We're bringing two automated hubs online this year, one in Pennsylvania, one in California and that will allow us to leverage automated bagging, label applications, et cetera. Carol's talked before about the smart package, smart facility. We're rolling that out in 2022. And so that will be a further driver of productivity this year as we think about it. And then within the quarter, ADV was actually down 3% as we mentioned, but hours per day were down 3%. So pieces per hour were basically flat. And then lastly, one of the things that the team is doing very effectively in the U.S., Jordan is the cube utilization, leveraging data to cube out the trucks. It reduced our loads per day better than the volume decline or outpaced it. Thanks, Jordan. Thanks, Todd. Yes, happy to talk about domestic margin. We're sticking with the guidance I had given previously, which was 11.6% domestically for the full year. And it was pretty balanced, pretty close to that the first half and second half. We printed an 11.3% in the first quarter. We're still holding to that 11.6% for the first half and we think the second half will look similar. So net-net up 90 bps in the first quarter, but looking for a 60 basis point improvement in the first half. Sure, so happy to. Look, in the first quarter, our resi B2C was 57% of the mix and commercial was 43%. We had guided for the full year to a 60:40 spread and we still think that's a pretty good number. As we think about mix changes in the business, we're looking for SMB to actually grow about 150 basis points improved from a mix perspective. We saw 140 in the first quarter, so we think that 150 is a good number. So Dave, I think as you split the year, a 60:40 on the resi to comm and about 150 improvement in the SMB is probably good – still stands. Thank you. And just on the – Brian, the price sensitivity comment, no, I think, as Carol mentioned, probably the most important piece is the service we provide and with the service numbers we're printing not getting a lot of pushback on that because I think we're – from delivering good service. Also when you think about the pricing, there is a split, as I mentioned, between fuel and the base rate. So we're managing holistically, but I think the pricing holding firm is probably the guide. Yes. And I just pick up one point on the commercial. Certainly, the B2B from a density standpoint is better than the resi, so we like that. But you have to remember, SurePost was down 10%, so that's impacting the mix as well. Yes, Helane, happy to address the CapEx. We are holding at the $5.5 billion for the year, so not coming off that. There's a little bit of timing noise in the first quarter, so it looked like we understand, but that was simply timing. As far as where we're investing, certainly putting into automation that – that's the one area we're trying to double down in. On the technology side, some of those are OpEx versus CapEx investments. So in terms of splitting the type of investments we're making, but certainly we are – we have two large automated hubs going in this year. We're looking at the smart package, smart facilities, so we're investing there. Whatever we can do to drive more automation is a positive thing from a cost expense standpoint. Thanks, Helane. So Ken, on the CapEx, I mentioned a minute ago that it was more timing related in terms of the year-over-year. I think it was about $300 million decline year-over-year in the first quarter. So that basically was just timing. So that won't impact us. We'll come back in the middle of the year and re-look the full year number, but as of now holding to the $5.5 billion in CapEx. So from a intra-Europe perspective obviously there's been a lot of dislocation with the conflict over there and – but as Carol mentioned at the top of the call, we had actually planned for volume growth internationally and it came down. So we continue to monitor the COVID situation lockdowns in Asia, the European geopolitical conflict and will continue to manage from a volume perspective. But we anticipate the second quarter to look somewhat like the first quarter from a volume perspective. Well, I think we did that in the first quarter, we were down 70 basis points on a margin perspective. And I think the full year guide was for down 60 basis points. So we were basically trending in line with our full year guide in the first quarter to do exactly what you just said. Thank you."

            "name": "Carol Tome",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good morning. This is my eighth earnings call at UPS. Since I joined the company, we faced a pandemic, social unrest, political unrest, the fallout from Brexit and now a war. Through it all I continue to be so impressed by the resiliency of UPSers and their commitment to moving our world forward by delivering what matters. I want to thank our team for their hard work and efforts in serving the needs of our customers each other and our communities during these most trying times. Before I discuss our results, I'd like to address our situation in Ukraine. Our hearts are with the people of Ukraine, who are feeling the effects of this tragedy firsthand. We have suspended all commercial operations in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, where we can – we are supporting humanitarian relief efforts and our focus is on the safety of our people. Putting the issues in Eastern Europe aside, as we discussed in February, we expected the macro environment to be dynamic and it was. Our average daily volume fell short of our plan due to several external factors that Brian will detail, but we remain focused on controlling what we can control. And looking at the first quarter, we were pleased with our results. Consolidated revenue rose 6.4% from last year to $24.4 billion and operating profit grew 12.1% from last year to $3.3 billion. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13.6%, which was 70 basis points above last year. All of our business segments delivered operating profit growth. Of note our Supply Chain Solutions businesses generated record operating profit of $481 million with a record operating margin of 11% driven by strength and forwarding in healthcare. We continue to pivot toward opportunity. We've made tremendous progress over the last two years. We are leveraging the power of our data to become much more agile. Under our Better not Bigger framework, we are investing in the capabilities that matter the most to our customers and we are winning in the parts of the market that value our end to end network like SMBs, healthcare, B2B and large enterprise accounts. How do we know we are winning because we've gained market share. Winning comes down to successfully executing our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy. Looking at customer-first, this is about creating a frictionless customer experience. Here we've made two significant enhancements to digitize the onboarding experience, making it easier for SMBs to ship with us. The first change I'll share is for our smallest customers. In the U.S., they can now go online at ups.com, answer just three questions and get a contract that includes pricing. This enables them to begin shipping in under two minutes, instead of our old process where they had to wait an average of 10 days to get started. The second enhancement is for larger SMBs. Here we are leveraging best-in-class technology to enhance the experience for our customers and our sales people. We've moved from a slow manual pricing process to a new digital platform that we call deal manager. This platform, which will be fully deployed to all U.S. SMB sales people by the end of this month, operationalizes our data and applies pricing science to present the customer with the right price the first time. For our customers, this means they no longer need to submit cumbersome sample data just to get a quote. For our sales people, they can close deals on the spot, making them more efficient and freeing them up to spend more time selling. And because this platform uses advanced analytics, the more we use it, the smarter it becomes. It's a key building block toward dynamic pricing. Our Digital Access Program, or DAP, is another important SMB growth driver. In the first quarter, we created more than 500,000 new DAP customer accounts. That's more than three times the number of new accounts created in the first quarter of last year, what's more near the end of the first quarter we began shipping DAP packages that originated outside of the U.S. As of today, DAP is available in 27 countries around the world and we are continuing to add DAP partners, putting us well on our way to achieving our $2 billion DAP revenue target in 2022. The enhancements we are making are resonating with SMB customers. In the first quarter, the U.S. SMB average daily volume growth rate including platforms outpaced the enterprise volume growth rate. In fact, in the first quarter, SMBs made up 28.4% of our total U.S. volume, up 140 basis points from one year ago. Looking at our international and supply chain solutions segments, the flexibility of our network allowed us to continue delivering for our customers within a dynamic environment. In many ways, this was one of our more challenging quarters as our international small package business faced tough year-over-year comparisons and demand was negatively impacted by ongoing disruptions due to the pandemic, but at the same time we scurried to keep up with heightened demand in our forwarding and healthcare businesses, no matter what came our way, we kept delivering with outstanding service levels. Moving to people-led, as previously announced, in the quarter we realigned our executive leadership team. First, Nando Cesarone, who has been leading our U.S. operations since 2020 assumed additional responsibility for U.S. sales and parts of engineering. This change gets us even closer to the customer, helping us better go to market as one UPS and enabling our teams to move even faster to unlock value for our customers and our shareowners. Second, Kate Gutmann assumed a new role leading both the international and supply chain solution segments in addition to our healthcare business. This allows us to better serve our global customers with our full range of services and provides opportunity for synergies in both revenue and cost. Finally, we have an external search underway for our new Chief Digital and Technology Officer. I'm delighted with the candidates that have surfaced for this role and hope to fill the position soon, which brings us to innovation driven. This is about driving higher returns from the capital we deploy. Here we are continuing to leverage the technology investments we've made to power our global smart logistics network. Throughout the quarter, we leveraged our network planning tools, automated facilities and other technologies to optimize the network and run it with greater agility. These efforts coupled with a laser focus on revenue quality contributed to a 90 basis point improvement in U.S. operating margin year-over-year. As we've discussed, we've turned productivity into a virtuous cycle at UPS. We have started the rollout of our RFID technology that we call smart package with the intense of completing 100 centers in 2022. This year, we will also begin the implementation of automated bagging, automated label application, and robotic small sort induction, all this to drive increased productivity. As an innovation driven company, we are marching down the path toward our goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050. Here is one example, we have two data centers that drive our global integrated network. These data centers are now powered 100% by renewable energy sources to give you some context, the power used to run these two data centers is the equivalent of the electricity needed to run 5,000 homes for one year. As we look ahead, we think the macro environment will be very dynamic, but we see many positives inside our business. We continue to deliver high service levels. We are gaining market share. We are more agile today than what I onboarded and we are focused on controlling what we can control to achieve the financial targets we've laid out. Brian will share the details regarding our outlook, but let me end by reaffirming our 2022 consolidated financial goals. In 2022, we expect to generate about $102 billion in revenue, consolidated operating margin of approximately 13.7%. And we expect return on invested capital to be greater than 30%. We are confident in our outlook and our financial condition. As a result, we are increasing our share repurchases for 2022, taking the target up to $2 billion for the year. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Yes. Happy to take the Amazon question. Thank you, Amit. We have a very good relationship with Amazon. They are our largest customer. And as we talked about at the end of the fourth quarter, we've reached agreement with Amazon about the packages that we will take into our network and the packages that they will deliver on their behalf. And it's a mutually beneficial relationship. As it relates to their latest announcement, we see that as a very clever marketing play by Amazon, but just putting Amazon Prime badge on a SMB website, if the website even exists, doesn't put that much risk to us, we believe. Well, I'll start. Brian, and then please join in. So Tom, as Brian mentioned, we planned for our U.S. Domestic volumes to decline slightly in the first quarter. We actually missed our plan by about 500,000 pieces per day. And when we started to peel back the layers of the onion to understand what happened because there was a lot of variability in the demand. January was soft because of Omicron and then February came back and was nicely positive and then March turned negative again. And we're like, why? Well, as we looked at the impact of the stimulus, we found a aha moment. When the stimulus checks hit last year, we saw our average daily volume jump by 400,000 pieces per day. We and our customers thought we could comp that this year, but because of all of the external factors that we're facing consumers, that proved to be tough. And in fact, if you look at the performance of our SurePost product, last year SurePost grew 35%. This year SurePost declined in the first quarter, 10.5%. And if you look through that, you can see that five customers actually drove more than 60% of the year-over-year decline. And in talking to those customers, they tell us it was just too hard to comp those stimulus checks. So that explains what happens in the quarter. Why do we feel good about the volume going forward? Well, the comparisons get easier. And I can look at what's happening in April. Our April volume is better than our March volume, so we're trending in the right direction. And then I look at the volume that's coming into the network at great revenue quality for deals that we've just cut. So over the next several months, we've got new volume coming into our business, both from enterprise customers, as well as SMB customers. So we feel very good about the volume projections that are coming into our new network. Just a comment on the international volume, if I could. We thought we'd have export volume growth in the quarter. We did not. It really was because of the COVID rolling lockdowns in Asia. We had flight cancellations it was a tough environment. In fact, we still have people who are sleeping in sleeping bags in the hub. It's a tough environment there. If you back out the COVID lockdowns and some shift from air to freight, our Asia export business would've been up in the quarter. So we're going to get through this. We are convinced we're going to get through this and expect the volume to improve internationally. Brian, what would you like to add? And I just want to give a shout out to our operators in the U.S. for managing through this very choppy volume environment to have pieces per hour flat when volumes up and down in a quarter is, is just as a sign of agility. And as to your question about levers, we are able to manage hours very well. If there were to be sustained volume down and we're not counting on that. But if that were the case, then we would actually take head cut out. But now we're just managing the hours and doing a matchable job of it. So in terms of our confidence of the volume and getting better, the comparisons do get easier, Scott, for sure. But we also are winning in the marketplace because of the service we provide. And I'm super proud of our sales team, who are out there knocking on doors, bringing back customers, some of which candidly had left us but they love the service that we provide, they're coming in a great revenue quality and that's very important too. So we have – we feel very good about what we see coming into the network. And I just want to go back and talk a moment about DAP. Our DAP revenue grew over 50% and in the first quarter that – that platform is on fire and we're taking it outside of the United States now, which is very exciting and in our case looking forward to having DAP come to Europe. So we're well on our way to get to that $2 billion DAP target by the end of this year. In terms of sustained pricing, pricing is really a function of demand and supply, and there still is a demand and supply imbalance, particularly in certain geos around the world, where for whatever reason be it COVID, or labor shortages, or just challenges, the service levels are there. We price for the service that we provide and are not seeing any pressure on the pricing environment right now. Well, Brian, perhaps you want to talk more about the guidance? I would say, interestingly in the SMB space, it's now split 50:50, commercial-residential. And we saw our commercial business grow almost 4% in the first quarter. So we're going to take every opportunity to win in that space as well because service matters to that customer base. We want the business to be the best of our context as that meets the needs of the customers. And so, we haven't declared what that mix should be, but that's actually a pretty interesting challenge for us as team at our June strategy meeting to think about what – where – what do we want declare that mix to be. Thank you. So we haven't updated the market sizing in any material way since our June Investor Day. And when we do, we will certainly share that with you. So we don't have direct insight to the consumer behavior. It's more from what we're hearing from our customers, who are telling us there has been a bit of a shift from goods to services. And you're probably experiencing that if you've gone on vacations, it seems like the hotels are full, all the planes are full, and people are going out to eat. And gosh I was in Washington, D.C. last week, and the bar was hoping at midnight. So people are spending money differently than they would. But as it relates to the guidance that we've given and we feel good about the volume that's coming back into our network and the guidance that we've laid out. Yes. What I've asked the team to do is to tell me how fast they can go because the – the capital is not going to get in the way of speed here. Automation is critically important to deliver service for our customers as well as drive productivity. Of the automation activities we have underway, be it automated label application or automated bagging or robotic sort induction, it's a head count opportunity this year alone of 1,200 people inside our buildings and that's going to double next year and continue to take off. So we're not going to let perfection get in the way, good enough here. We're going to go fast. As it relates to cybersecurity, that's the one budget I will not touch. We continue to invest in cyber. It's a scary time for all of us, but we are leaning in from a cyber perspective. Clearly, if you think about the challenges coming out of Eastern Europe, we have taken every system down. So we're at no risk there. But of course, we could – we have attacks on our company every day, but our cyber team does a masterful job awarding off those attacks. And we're spending a lot of money to ensure that we protect our customer data, our personal information of our people and all the incredible pricing information that we have that gives us a competitive advantage. So knock on wood, of course, because every company is vulnerable here, but we're certainly investing in protection. Thank you. We freed up some capacity in our network to allow us to go out and win, where in the past couple of years, it was harder because of peak gating, there's only so much volume a company like UPS can take into the network during peak. You only have so many doors for cars, you only have so many buildings, but because we've freed up some capacity, we can actually give our customers more peak availability that's allowing us to win with great revenue quality. So right now, we don't view that the revenue quality is at risk. And remember there is still a demand/supply imbalance, and it's exasperated in certain parts of the country. So we are winning because of the SurePost. So if we look at our fuel surcharge, as Brian mentioned is just part of our overall pricing algorithm and yes, it does move off of the weekly change in the PPG index. But to that, we add a pricing modifier. So think of it known differently than a demand surcharge or a network surcharge or just a plain price. And people are willing to pay for this because of the service we provide. If we look at the impact to our business in the first quarter for the domestic business alone, 55% of the fuel benefit came from changes in the PPG index. 45% of the benefit came from actions that we took from a pricing perspective. We are always thoughtful about changes in pricing of course. We price for the services we provide. Many of our published prices, as you know, are also discounted. So I think that's something you need to keep in mind too, as you think about, are you adjusting too frequently? We price for the services we provide and then we also will discount, but just on a discounting, if I could, we mentioned the new tool that we just introduced to, which we call bill manager. And this is providing pricing analytics to our sales team as they go about negotiating deals. And in fact, as we looked at our pilots, 41% of our volume one and our volume rate wins or volume wins have increased from where they were trending. The discounting is lower in 41% of the volume wins than it had been using our old pricing science. So science rules in many ways, when it comes to pricing, you ask a lot of questions here about elasticity and what are you doing with pricing, science really rules here as we think about providing the best overall equation for our customers. So the $500 million cost out target related to what we call non-ops or overhead and we initially had $1 billion target in which we delivered $500 million last year, we're going to do it again this year. So that's tracking as we laid out, very proud of the team for that. When you introduce technology, it can free up a lot of manual activities. And we're really all about putting our resources where we can get the highest return. As it relates to the RFID technology, boy, we were worried about putting it in this year because of supply chain jams, but we were able to procure all the batteries and labels that we need. So we will get it up this year before peak and a hundred of our centers. And what this will do long-term for us, it looks pretty powerful, wave one alone. It will eliminate all the manual scans done by our pre-loaders. If that doesn't drive productivity, I don't know what will, and it will avoid all the miss sorts, when a package gets miss sorted and it goes into the wrong package car, that's not a very good experience for our customer and it actually just a drag on productivity. So really excited about where that's going to take us long-term and the project is on tech. Nando is also driving what he calls total service, which is running this network, which was designed for perfection at perfection. We haven't been there for lots of reasons, COVID and all kinds of reasons, but it's pretty powerful because if you think about just delays and traffic or delays leaving the package centers, it can cost a hundred of millions of dollars that relate. So running the network for the way it was designed is powerful and Nando just kicked this off. And will bringing you up to speed along this initiative as we go along. Well, look, I applaud the retail stores who are doing a masterful job of offering buy online pickup in a store, buy online return in store, come to my store, come to my store, come to my store because if they don't get traffic into their store, well, they'll deleverage that fixed cost. And then we'll have to close stores. So I admire what they're doing, but there's still been a permanent shift in customer preferences. Customers want to shop when, where, and how they want to shop. And they want their packages delivered to them when, where, and how they want them. It might be inside of the store. It might be at their home or at their workplace or at a consolidated pickup point. So we're not going to see the kind of growth that we experience during COVID clearly, but e-commerce sales will continue to grow. We want to serve that customer, but we also want to serve the commercial customer because that's a very good customer for us. So while we may have said a 60/40 mix, the mix is going to go where the volume is, and we will lean into that growth appropriately."

And I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Mr. PJ Guido, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nPJ Guido: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO, and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2022 Form 10-K and other reports we filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results. For the fourth quarter of 2023, GAAP results include a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $274 million, after-tax transformation and other charges of $154 million, and a non-cash after-tax impairment charge of $84 million relating to our Coyote trade name in our truckload brokerage unit. The after-tax total for these items is $512 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Additional details regarding year-end pension charges are included in the appendix of our fourth quarter 2023 Earnings Presentation that will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website following this call. A reconciliation to GAAP financial result is available on the UPS Investor Relations website, and also available in the webcast of today's call. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions] And now, I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, PJ, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for their hard work and effort. I'm proud of our team for their commitment to customer service. And for once again making UPS the industry leader in on-time performance, not only during peak, but throughout 2023. Looking at our volume trends for the fourth quarter, while total average daily volume or ADV declined 7.5% from last year, our performance was a marked improvement from what we reported in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, our salespeople did an outstanding job of winning back diverted volume and pulling through new volumes. In fact, US Domestic ADV surged 30% from the third quarter to the fourth which was our highest sequential volume ramp ever. By the end of December, we had one back and pull through nearly 60% of the volume diverted during our labor negotiations. Winning back and winning new volume is part of a program we call Project Brown. And this program will continue into 2024. You will recall that at the end of the third quarter, we provided a range of expected revenue and operating profit for the fourth quarter. Looking at our fourth quarter results versus last year, consolidated revenue declined 7.8% to $24.9 billion, which was slightly below the low end of our expectation. Operating profit was $2.8 billion, a decrease of 27.1% from last year, but slightly higher than the low end of our expectations. As a result, our consolidated operating margin was 11.2%, which was well within our expectation. For the year, consolidated revenue was $91 billion, a decrease of 9.3%. Consolidated operating profit totaled $9.9 billion, 28.7% lower than last year. And consolidated operating margin was 10.9%. We generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow during 2023 and we returned $7.6 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Brian will provide more detail about our financial results in a moment. 2023 was a unique and quite candidly a difficult and disappointing year. We experienced declines in volume, revenue, and operating profit in all three of our business segments. Some of this performance was due to the macroenvironment and some of it was due to the disruption associated with our labor contract negotiations as well as higher costs associated with the new contract. Through the year, however, we controlled what we could control and in many areas, we delivered the highest productivity results in our company history. And I think most importantly, we stayed on our strategy of customer first, people led, and innovation driven. Let me share a few examples of how our strategy is establishing a foundation for future growth. Starting with customer first. In 2023, our healthcare portfolio achieved our target of $10 billion in revenue. Here we've made strong progress towards our goal of becoming the number-one complex healthcare provider in the growing $130 billion global healthcare logistics market. Our global network of healthcare-compliant distribution space topped 17 million square feet in 2023. And our acquisitions of Bomi Group and MNX Global Logistics have expanded our cold-chain capabilities and are enabling us to reach new markets and customers. To support growth in our international small package business, in December, we announced plans to build a new air hub at Hong Kong International Airport. This new air hub supports our plans to grow in the best parts of the market, including highly profitable Asia trade lines and will enable us to expand our export and import business in the region. During the year, we continue to grow our SMB penetration. In 2023, SMBs made up 28.6% of our total US volume, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. Part of this growth came from DAP, our Digital Access Program. DAP has transformed how small companies do business with UPS. And in 2023, we generated $2.9 billion in DAP revenue, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Moving to People Led. In 2023, we delivered a labor agreement that provides certainty for the next five years. And because I'm a big believer in the power of One UPS. This year, we are returning to a policy of everyone back in the office five days a week. In terms of our culture, we are a network company not just of logistics capabilities, but a personal relationships too which brings me to innovation driven. On our busiest peak days, we sort over 50 million packages in the US and deliver more than 30 million packages worldwide. How do we do it? By leveraging the agility of our integrated network powered by UPS technologies and the skills of our engineers and operating team. Our network planning tools enabled us to quickly match capacity with volume across the network and drive productivity. Technology also enabled improvements to driver and help our route planning and dispatch, resulting in improvements in density and fewer seasonal support drivers than in prior year. It might surprise you to learn that we typically see an increase in returns volume before Christmas. In the fourth quarter, we moved lightening fast to integrate Happy Returns. We made box-free, label-free returns available in over 5,000 UPS store locations just eight days after the acquisition close. Happy Returns digital experience helped drive returns volume in the fourth quarter with momentum extending into the first quarter of 2024. Finally, we continue to deploy transformative technology to increase efficiency within our warehousing facilities. The latest example is our state-of-the-art pick, pack, and ship center in Louisville, Kentucky, that we call UPS Velocity. We named it Velocity because it leverages robotics, automation, machine-learning, and artificial intelligence to streamline fulfillment operations. This facility is capable of processing over 350,000 units per day and enables a best-in-class experience for our customers and their customers. Our customer first, people led innovation driven strategy is the foundation of our business. And our continued execution of the strategy enables us to exit 2023 with momentum. But momentum is not enough. We have decided to take some bold moves to right-size our company for the future and to focus on the key enablers of growth. So today, we are announcing two actions. First, we plan to explore strategic alternatives for our truckload brokerage business known as Coyote. Coyote is part of Supply Chain Solutions, and it's a business that's highly cyclical with considerable earnings volatility. We will keep you apprised as we move forward with this analysis. Second, we are going to fit our organization to our strategy and align our resources against what's wildly important. This will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 12,000 positions and around $1 billion in cost out this year. Here, we've identified new ways of working and are calling this fit to serve. Let me end by sharing our 2024 outlook. In 2024, the small package market in the US, excluding Amazon, is expected to grow by less than 1%. And projected market growth rates for the rest of our business segments picked up some improvement, but not until the latter part of the year. In building our 2024 financial targets, we incurred the low end of our guidance on market growth. And for the high-end of our guidance included growth we should experience if we capture market share. In 2024, we expect to generate consolidated revenue ranging from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion and a consolidated operating margin ranging from approximately 10% to 10.6%. Given the nuances of our new labor contract, there will be stark contrast between our first-half and our second-half performance. First-half earnings will be compressed and second-half earnings will expand. In both the low and high end of our guidance range, we expect to exit the year with US operating margin of 10%. Brian will provide more details in a moment. UPS remains rock-solid strong. While our dividend payout is currently higher than our targeted payout of 50% of our prior year's adjusted earnings per share, we are confident in our future. As a result, the UPS Board approved $0.01 increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.62 per share to $1.63 per share. This is the 15th consecutive year we have increased the UPS dividend. So now that 2023 is behind us, we look forward to seeing you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day on March 26th. At that time, we will share our three-year plans to grow and drive shareowner value. With that, thank you for listening. And now I will turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover three areas, starting with the macro and our fourth-quarter results, then I'll review our full-year 2023 results, including cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll provide comments on expectations for the markets and our financial outlook for 2024. The macroenvironment in the fourth quarter showed improvements. However, in the transportation and logistics sector conditions remained under pressure, both in the US and internationally due to soft demand and overcapacity in the market. Throughout the quarter, we leveraged the agility of our integrated network to match capacity with demand. And we were recognized by an independent third party for providing industry-leading service for the sixth peak in a row. Looking at our financial results, in the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $24.9 billion, down 7.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022. All three of our segments demonstrated agility and on a combined basis drove down total expense by $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This enabled us to deliver operating profit within the range we communicated to you last quarter. Consolidated operating margin was 11.2% for the quarter and in line with our expectations. For the fourth-quarter, diluted earnings per share was $2.47, down 31.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Now, let's look at our business segments. In US Domestic, we knew going into the fourth quarter that volume will be ramping up of an exceptionally low third quarter. Our efforts to win back diverted volume and pull through new volume resulted in a record sequential volume surge. Throughout peak, we delivered excellent service to our customers while managing expenses. In the fourth quarter, average daily volume came in at the low end of our range and was down 7.4% year-over-year. B2B average daily volume in the fourth quarter was down 6.8% year-over-year, driven by declines in the retail, manufacturing, and high-tech sectors. In the fourth quarter, B2B represented 35.5% of our volume, which was up slightly from 35.3% in the same period last year. Also in the fourth quarter, continued macro pressures drove customers to seek economy products as we saw customers shift volumes out of the air onto the ground. Total air average daily volume was down 15% year-over-year, and ground average daily volume was down 5.8% versus the fourth quarter of last year. For the quarter, US Domestic generated revenue of $16.9 billion, down 7.3%. Revenue per piece was slightly positive year-over-year with a number of moving parts. A combination of strong base rates and customer mix increased the revenue per piece growth rates by about 390 basis points. This was offset by a few factors. First, changes in product mix and package characteristics decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 140 basis points. Second, reflecting the lower volume in the quarter, peak season surcharge revenue declined, which reduced the revenue per piece growth rate by about 120 basis points. And lastly, changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 110 basis points. Turning to costs, total expense was down 3.6%. And in the face of a 12.1% increase in union wage rates, which was driven by the contractual increase that went into effect last August, we pulled several levers to more than offset the higher expense. First, we leveraged our network planning tools and total service plan to reduce total hours in the fourth quarter by 10.2% which was more than the decline in average daily volume. This enabled us to decrease compensation and benefits, which drove down the total expense growth rate by around 30 basis points. Second, lower purchase transportation expenditures reduced the expense growth rate by around 70 basis points, primarily from lower-volume levels and our continued optimization efforts. Next, lower fuel costs contributed 160 basis points to the decrease in the total expense growth rate. And lastly, the net of all other expense items and allocations, reduced the expense growth rate by 100 basis points. Pulling it all together, these actions helped us reduce US Domestic expense in the fourth quarter by $578 million, which was our largest fourth quarter dollar cost reduction ever. Looking specifically at peak, as volume returned to the network and our biggest customers drove a surge in peak volume, we ran our integrated network with agility. In fact, in 2023, we closed over 30 sorts and they remain closed during peak. By leveraging our network planning tools, we took advantage of the flexibility of our integrated networks and flowed more volumes into our automated buildings. And with smart package smart facility in over 1,000 buildings, misload frequency improved 67%, contributing to the superior service we deliver to our customers. The US Domestic segment delivered $1.6 billion in operating profit, down 32.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. However, compared to the third quarter of 2023, operating profit in US Domestic increased $904 million and was our highest sequential operating profit increase ever. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 9.3%, a 440 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2023 Moving to our International segment. Soft demand continue to pressure volumes out of Asia. And in Europe, several key economies remain in recession, which pressured demand and drilled the shift away from Express Services. In response, we focused on revenue quality and adjusted our global network to match changes in geographic demand. Looking at volume, in the fourth quarter, International total average daily volume was down 8.3% year-over-year. The decline was primarily due to lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 10.8% driven by declines in Europe and Canada. Areas of the world that continue to face persistent inflationary pressures. On the export side, total average daily volume declined 5.9% on a year-over-year basis, driven by declines in Europe due to weak macro conditions. Looking at Asia, export average daily volume was down 8.9% driven by soft demand in the retail and high-tech sectors. However, export volume on the China to US lane, which is our most profitable lane increased 2.7% driven by SMBs. Nearly offsetting the decline in Asia over in the Americas region export average daily volume grew 11.9%, led by customers in Canada and Mexico, leveraging our cross-border ground service. In the fourth quarter, International revenue was $4.6 billion, which was down 6.9% from last year, primarily due to the decline in volumes. Revenue per piece increased 3.1%. Strong base pricing and a change in customer mix drove a 420 basis-point increase in the revenue per piece growth rate. A reduction in fuel surcharge revenue negatively impacted the revenue per piece growth rate by 60 basis points. And lower demand-related surcharge revenue, which was partially offset by the impact of a weaker US dollar decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 50 basis points. Moving to expense. In the fourth quarter, total international expense was down $152 million, primarily driven by lower fuel expense. Additionally, in response to the lower demand environment, we managed our network to match capacity with demand, which included reducing international block hours by 9.4%. Operating profit in the International segment was $899 million, down $192 million year-over-year. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 19.5%. Now, looking at Supply Chain Solutions. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $3.4 billion, down $435 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, in international air freight, overall volumes were down despite a mid-quarter spike in e-commerce. Market rates continue to be pressured, resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. On the ocean side, volume increased, driven by the retail sector. However, excess market capacity pressured revenue and operating profit. Within forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit known as Coyote continued to face pressure from excess capacity in the market, which drove revenue and operating profit down. In the fourth quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $319 million and an operating margin of 9.4%. Walking through the rest of the income statements, we had $207 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $66 million, and our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.5%. Now, let me comment on our full-year 2023 results. For the full-year 2023, revenue declined 9.3% to $91 billion and we generated operating profit of $9.9 billion, a decrease of 28.7% compared to full-year 2022. Consolidated operating margin was 10.9%. We generated $10.2 billion in cash from operations and continue to follow our capital allocation priorities. We invested $5.2 billion in CapEx. Additionally, we acquired MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns. We distributed $5.4 billion in dividends, which represented a 6.6% increase on a per share basis over 2022. We repaid $2.4 billion in debt that matured during the year. And at the end of the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2 turns. Lastly, we completed $2.25 billion in share buybacks in 2023. And in the segments for the full year, in US Domestic, operating profit was $5.4 billion and operating margin was 9%. The International segment generated $3.3 billion in operating profit and operating margin was 18.4%. And Supply Chain Solutions delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion and an operating margin was 9%. With 2023 behind us, let us move to our outlook for 2024. S&P Global is forecasting an improvement in global macro conditions as the year progresses. Outside the US, real exports in Europe are expected to improve each quarter throughout the year. Looking at Asia, we saw positive momentum on the China to US lane exiting the year, and remain cautious on the outlook for 2024. In the US, the projected small package market growth rate is just under 1% excluding Amazon. A slight improvement is expected in US manufacturing and the consumer is expected to remain resilient despite lingering inflationary pressures. We've built a plan that reflects the current environment and potential risks that we see. This includes getting our organization to our strategy and aligning execution to our wildly important initiatives under what we call fit to serve. As Carol mentioned, we are exploring strategic alternatives for Coyote, our truckload brokerage business, which will enable us to address some of the cyclical impacts in our forwarding business. And we are reducing our workforce by approximately 12,000 positions. This will cut around $1 billion in costs in 2024. Moving to our 2024 financial outlook, we are providing a range based on volume growth. The low end of the range has UPS growing at market rate and the high-end of the range as us gaining share. For the full year 2024, on a consolidated basis, revenues are expected to range from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion, and operating margin is expected to range from approximately 10% to 10.6%. In the range provided, we expect to move total average daily volume from negative growth in the first half of the year to positive growth in the back half. This is primarily driven by lapping the volume diversion we experienced in the US last year during our labor negotiations. Additionally, cost will weigh on us in the first half of the year, primarily due to the higher labor cost inflation associated with the new contract. Looking at consolidated revenue, in the first half of the year, we expect the growth rate to decline with a range of approximately 1% to 2% with the first quarter driving the decline. And in the back half of the year, revenue growth is anticipated to be up within a range of mid-to-high single-digits. Looking at consolidated operating profit, we expect material improvement as the year progresses with the second half of the year outperforming the first half. Lastly, we expect to generate our lowest consolidated operating margin of the year in the first quarter. Now let me give you a little color on the segments. Looking at US Domestic, average daily volume growth is expected to be within a range of approximately flat-to-up 2% for the full year. At both the low and high end of the range, we expect the revenue per piece growth rate to outpace the cost per piece growth rate beginning in the third quarter and we expect to exit the year at a 10% operating margin. Moving to the International segment, we expect 2024 average daily volume to be within a range of approximately flat-to-up around 3%. At both ends of the guidance range, operating margin is anticipated to be in the high teens. And in Supply Chain Solutions, for the full year in 2024, we expect revenue to be within a range of approximately $13 billion to $13.5 billion. At both ends of the guidance range, operating margin for SCS is expected to be high-single-digits. And for modeling purposes, in total below the line, we expect approximately $400 million in expense in 2024. This is net of $262 million in pension income. We included a slide in the appendix of today's webcast deck to provide you more detail on pension. The webcast deck will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website following this call. Now, let's turn to full year 2024 capital allocation. Our capital allocation priorities have not changed. We are staying on strategy and we'll make the best long-term decisions to capture growth, improve efficiency, and deliver value to our shareowners. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be within our target of around 5% of revenue or $4.5 billion. Now, let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow to be within a range of approximately $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion including our annual pension contributions of $1.4 billion, which are equal to our expected service costs. As Carol mentioned, the Board has approved a dividend per share of $1.63 for the first quarter. We are planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2024 subject to Board approval. Finally, our effective tax rate in 2024 is expected to be approximately 23.5%. In closing, we look at 2024 as a year to pivot away from negative volume to positive volume growth and from high labor cost inflation to a much lower growth rate. We are laser-focused on executing our strategy, controlling what we can control, and improving our financial performance. We look forward to sharing our multi-year targets in detail on our strategy at our Investor Day event on March 26th. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Yeah. Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess I wanted to start on maybe some of the cost out. You mentioned the 12,000 positions that you're reducing and the $1 billion of cost in 2024. I was hoping maybe you could help us sort of understand the timing of that. So based on a 10% kind of run rate exiting '24, it would imply that the first quarter is fairly low. So I just want to make sure I understand some of those moving pieces and when that $1 billion is going to start to accrue?\nBrian Newman: Sure. Happy to give you some color. So we talked about 12,000 heads out. 75% of the reductions will come in the first half, which drive the $1 billion in the 2024 calendar year. But you're absolutely right in terms of the timing and announcement, it will be back-end weighted. And really the thing I'd like to point out is it's a change in the way we work. So as volume returns to the system, we don't expect these jobs to come back. It's changing the effective way that we operate.\nCarol Tome: And I might just add a little more color, if I could, Chris. Today we have about 495,000 UPSers around the world. A few years ago, when the COVID demand was peaking, we had 540,000 UPSers. So Kate and Nando have done a masterful job of managing our operational headcount to meet the volume in our company. And they've done that by managing turnover and attrition and closing sorts and reducing block hours, et cetera. We have about 85,000 UPSers who are management, and this can be full-time and part-time management. The targeted headcount falls really within that group as well as some contractors that will be leaving us. And to Brian's point, this is really about a new way of working. So it's a $1 billion of cost out now, but there's even more cost out to come as we have a full-year benefit in 2025.\nChris Wetherbee: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. So, just wanted to ask, on the productivity side, obviously hours down more than volume. We've had a couple of quarters of that, obviously not the third quarter this year. Is there a point where volume declines are become more difficult to offset? I'm just trying to understand the downside risk, right, if volumes continue to remain flat or weaker than you expect, how should we be thinking about the downside risk on the margin side?\nCarol Tome: So we believe that productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS. And I'll give you one example, then I'm going to throw it over to Nando to address this. But if I look at just one metric, cube utilization, we reach the highest cube utilization in our company history at 60%. That's the equivalent of reducing 1,500 loads per day. So that's not in hours, but it's just a cost out. So we've got productivity across the operations. And Nando, why don't you talk about what you're going to do in 2024?\nNando Cesarone: Yeah. So, David, thanks for the question. For us, it is a virtuous cycle. So we're working ahead of any type of volume variability. So whether it goes up or down, we've got some of our best engineers, operations folks, finance folks, identifying additional cost-outs as we move forward, as we're executing the ones that we have in front of us. So we feel good that there's a good pipeline of opportunity no matter what the volume does. And as Carol had mentioned, we lever our hourly headcount and match that to the volume and the activity. And so far so good, but still lots in front of us and they're pretty meaty. So we feel really good about those initiatives.\nCarol Tome: And at our Investor Day in March, we're going to talk to you about network of the future. We've got an integrated network. We don't have to integrate, but we can transform our network with some very exciting ideas. So we're going to share that with you in March.\nDavid Vernon: And the rate at which resource needs is going to need to be added back on the other side you know maybe we get some volume expansion. Can you talk to the expectations for operating leverage on the upside?\nBrian Newman: Yeah, I think as we look to the back end of the year, certainly the volume projections that are in there, in terms of the volume growth for the back end of the year, in that 2% to 4% range, domestically, we start to see CPP growing slower than RPP. And so that balance is what's going to create the operating margin. With the sorts we closed over 30 sorts did not reopen them during peak. So we're changing. Nando's doing an effective job of basically managing more volume with less. So we'll continue to drive that.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thank you, guys.\nBrian Newman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, everyone. I just wanted to, Brian, on the guidance, I guess the guidance implies $9.6 billion in operating profits. You've been pretty helpful historically about giving us kind of the first-half, second-half cadence of that. And then just related to that, I want to make sure, so you said the $1 billion is included in the guidance. Can you just expand on that a little bit? Because if I take out the $1 billion, the implied change in profits relative to the improvement in revenue is quite a bit worse. So I'm just trying to understand what's actually included in the guidance from the $1 billion and how that kind of translates to what you're assuming underneath it in terms of change of profit, relative change of revenue?\nBrian Newman: Sure. Happy to Amit. So, from a shape of the year perspective, the full year we called revenue at 1% to 4%. But based on lapping of the volumes and the contract overlap, we would expect revenue to be flat to down 2% in the first half, up 4% to 8% in the back half. And from a profit perspective, I had mentioned that it's a tale of two cities. In terms of halves of the year, the second half of the year, we'd expect profit to grow about 20% to 30%. So Q1 will be the biggest challenge because we're lapping from a volume comp perspective and a full contract. But on a full-year basis, we're looking at OP margin 10% to 10.6%. I think you can expect the second half of the year to be 11% to 12% in that range and you can back into the first half. In terms of your question of backing out the $1 billion in cost, that $1 billion will be a cost-benefit in 2024. But I think we've said in the past, Amit, it would take twelve months to digest the new labor cost. We are confident we can get back to consistent expansion of US margins as we lap the first year of the contract. That'll be a combination of pricing and productivity. So, net-net, it's really lapping that contract and then you start to get the benefits. As Carol said, some of those benefits would accrue over to 2025 as well.\nAmit Mehrotra: And are we done there on the $1 billion or is there like there's $55 billion in total cost? I mean, are we just getting started or like what's the actual opportunity there beyond the $1 billion?\nBrian Newman: So Carol talked about the differences between the Nando and Kate, the operating cost and what we're talking about management headcount. If you bifurcate the two, I think you're going to hear more at the Investor Day through things like network of the future, how we go after additional headcount in that area. But this would be about a 14% reduction in that 85,000 heads.\nCarol Tome: Yeah, we're never done. We continue to drive productivity. It's a virtuous cycle here, and technology has changed so much in the past year. When you think about the advent of Generative AI and the applications inside of our business, we're just getting started and I'm really excited about what the future will mean in terms of driving productivity and as well as improving the customer experience.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you very much.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Amit.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Just to stick with the productivity side, you've been obviously pretty dynamic with your network and you mentioned, I think, 30 close outs -- sort closures and whatnot. Can you just talk about the consolidation opportunity in '24 and how that may play out to drive further efficiencies in the business? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yeah. We'd be happy to do that. But we're going to kick that question to our March conference because we've got a great presentation to share with you regarding network of the future, and it would take up way too much time today to go through that. We want to spend a good amount of time talking to you about that in March. So thank you for understanding.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Conor.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning. Just want to turn to the growth aspect of it, I guess, more specifically the market share capture. Could you maybe walk through the different levers in terms of -- I know you mentioned Project Brown, your ability to recapture diverted volume, but also talking to the SMB penetration, your opportunity on the healthcare side, just any color in terms of where those levers can be pulled for that market share growth in '24? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: I'll start with a few comments about Project Brown. Project Brown really is a new way of going after business and it has many elements to it, and I'll make some of those real to you. First of all, we looked at ourselves and said, what's getting in the way of speed? Because it was taking us too long to respond to a customer. And we found that we hadn't really declared service level agreements amongst the various groups that participate in this exercise of providing offers to our customers. So we shortened up the time to response and that's important and that's going to be with us now forever. I can make that real for you. Outside of the United States, it used to take 22 days. We dropped it to six days. We're now at two days. That's best in class. And we've made similar improvements in the United States. Project Brown was also looking at Deal Manager. Deal Manager is the new tool that we introduced that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to score a deal and avoid the need for our salespeople to go up to our pricing people for appeals, they can actually see the score of their deal. We've had great acceptance and win rates, 79% win rates with this tool. But we found through Project Brown that we weren't offering all of our products in the tool and one of the products we weren't offering was SurePost, which is a great product. So we introduced SurePost into the Deal Manager, and we're getting some good return on that. That's particularly attractive for our small and medium-sized customers. Another thing that we did is that we improved and increased weekend pickups in several key markets during the year. So and I could go on and on and on, but this is a way of operationalizing excellence to drive the business and capture share. So where are we going to capture share? We're going to continue to lean into the small and medium-sized segment opportunities, we're seeing some real success in that area. We're going to continue to lean into healthcare. When I started here, the healthcare revenues are around $6 billion, now at $10 billion, and we're going to continue to grow. We'll lay out our three-year growth plans for you at our March Investor Day. I think you'll be very pleased with that. We're going to continue to sell off the service that we provide and the capabilities that we have that actually no one else has, that's our integrated network. So at our Investor Day in March, we'll lay out market share capture. Let me just make the market real for you because this might be helpful too. As we think about the addressable market, the addressable market in the United States. It's a little over 52 million packages a day. So there's plenty of addressable market for us to go get. And plenty of market for us to get outside of the United States because we are underpenetrated in so many areas. One reason I called out our new air hub in the Hong Kong International Airport is that the greater China Bay area is unbelievable economic power base, the 13th largest economy in the world, 37% of all China exports go through that airport. And today, we have small way overcapacity hubs and buildings that are inefficient with lease rates that are sky high. So we are building a 20,000 square meter facility. It will make us the second largest air hub in that important part of the market. So expect to see a lot of growth coming off of that over time.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, good morning. So I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic in the market. I know the backdrop is that you had some share loss associated with the Teamster contract, but it also seems like there might be risks that other competitors are gaining traction in the market. So if you look at postal service had, I think, up 7% volumes and they had a new product, the ground advantage. And so I guess the question is, is there a risk that the competitive set has got more challenging? And how do we think about what you need to do to have a better volume outcome in 2024? Is there more pressure on price, or is it a different formula to get the better volume outcome in '24? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: So I would say that the pricing environment is very rational. And you can see that as Brian ticked out the RPP performance in the fourth quarter, we had very strong base rate performance. Now the RPP was muted because of lower fuel costs and product characteristics and the product mix change and lower demand surcharges, but the base was very strong. And we expect the base to continue into 2024, our GRI for 2024 is 5.9%. Will we keep all of it? No. But will we keep a lot of it? Yes, just like we did in 2023, we kept about 60% of the GRI in 2023. So the pricing environment is rational. In terms of competitive products, it's incumbent upon us to stay at leading edge and meeting our customers where they want us to be. That's one reason we offered a hyper-local product beginning last quarter, which is really a short-zone product. We haven't had that before. And as we look at the offerings that we will go to market with this year, we've got some things underway, not ready for prime time, but I suspect looking over at our new Chief Commercial Officer, Matt Guffey, that we might be able to talk about that at our March investor conference and he's nodding his head. So stay tuned for that.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. I'm going to defer the big picture stuff to March. But I'm just kind of curious, how did your global view changed between when we were discussing the labor deal back in August, September to the year-end? You mentioned the softness in Europe. You mentioned the shift from air to ground, but kind of what were the big changes in your outlook over that four, five-month period?\nCarol Tome: Well, what really softened up was Europe. If you look at our volume decline, both domestic and export, it was heavily weighted in Europe. In fact, the decline in our export was 94%, driven by the softness in Europe. So you see what's happening with industrial manufacturing there is just way off. So that is a big change. There are also dynamics happening in air and ocean freight as you've been watching. We've all been watching the drama in the Red Sea, the fact that the water levels in the Panama Canal are low, and that certainly is causing a lot of chaos actually in ocean and air freights. Interestingly, on the air side, both rates and volumes were down. On the ocean side, volumes are up. But as Brian called out, the rates were considerably down. As we sit here today, it's a very dynamic market and ever-changing. A little hard to predict candid like is what we're seeing today is for shippers who have high value packages, they're actually -- they're worried about the ocean conditions, so they're moving to the air. So air rates are tightening a bit. And on the ocean side, because shippers are starting to have to reroute away from the Red Sea or the Panama Canal, the routing is taking longer, so there's some change to the dynamics of the pricing there too. We just have to stay super nimble here and Kate and her team are doing a great job at that. Kate, what would you like to add here?\nKate Gutmann: Yeah, I would say that the market remains volatile, even in Europe with the drop off in the inflationary softening. We were able to pull back on the cost to deliver a great margin, and that's our commitment. And then to ensure that in the forwarding side of the house, as we've done, stay just razor sharp to ensure that we are right on track with any trend that we see. And I'm really proud of the team because we have got the initiative to gain those customers with high-value goods and that international air freight that's coming as a result.\nJeff Kauffman: And just if I could follow up on that answer. So given the global events with Suez Canal, Panama Canal, looking at the lemonade out of lemons side of this, is this a bigger opportunity for you in Europe? Or is this a bigger opportunity for air out of Asia?\nKate Gutmann: It actually is first showing up Asia to Europe lane. And -- but I will say this is going to be repositioning of vessels around the globe. It's going to be a global event. So we see it as an opportunity throughout and our sales resources are global. Our portfolio is global. So UPS is very well positioned to take advantage of it.\nJeff Kauffman: Okay, thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Can you guys speak to your enterprise customers and the volume trends that you saw in the fourth quarter and expectations going into 2024? And maybe compare and contrast that with B2B as well as your small, medium business mix?\nBrian Newman: So happy to, Brandon. We were actually pleased with the volume momentum. We were at a low watermark in August of last year, down 15%, and we saw sequential monthly improvement as we looked at our volume domestically from an ADV perspective, down to mid-single-digit declines in the month of December. So that trend continues to play out well. We're going to see some tough comps, though, in the first quarter, so I wouldn't expect positive volume growth in Q1. We start to see positive volume growth in Q2 and then certainly in the back half of the year as the comps change. SMB, Carol mentioned, very focused on penetration on the SMB side and specifically some of the medium SMB customers. We've stated we would like to see that mix trend up to 30% plus. We finished the year at 28%. So we're well on our way in that direction.\nCarol Tome: Maybe another comment because this is just an interesting observation on the market. If I look at our top five decliners in the quarter, that would include our largest customer and there's an intentional decline there. But then if I look at the remaining decliners, it's really interesting to see what's happening. Of those, only one has diverted some volume. They're a dual sourcer and they have diverted some volume. And I suspect they'll stay dual-sourcing. The rest, either their business is just way off or they have worked really hard to create a better experience inside the store to encourage buy online pick up in store. So there is a bit of dynamic happening within our large enterprise customers. I think for all of us, we're delighted to have anniversaried the demand that we saw through COVID. Now that that's behind us, now that the volume for the small package market has reverted back to the mean, this is an opportunity now for everyone to grow.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you both.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Brandon.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Yeah, guys. Thanks very much, everybody, and thanks team for the time. So on Coyote, when you did the acquisition, what did you think the benefits would be that made it important to do the acquisition? And then what really would actually happened that is causing you to rethink how Coyote fits in the network? And my follow-up question is then related. You recently bought two 747-8 freighters, I saw. And I'm just wondering if you bought those off lease or where they came from since Boeing doesn't make the 747 anymore? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: I'm happy to address the Coyote question to the best of my ability. I was on the Board in 2015 when we bought the company but the strategic rationale was really about expanding the portfolio. And it was a very thoughtful strategic rationale to expand the portfolio. But I don't think we fully understood at the time was just how cyclical this business is. And I'll make it real for you. When we acquired Coyote in 2015, the revenue in the previous year for Coyote were $2.1 billion. During COVID, Coyote peaked up to over $4 billion in revenue. Well, it's gone way down since then. In fact, if you look at our Supply Chain Solutions business, it was down $3 billion year-on-year, which is a third of the overall company decline. Within that $3 billion, Coyote made up 38% of the decline for the year and 48% of the decline for the fourth quarter. So you can see the volatility in the revenue line, and then we've got a business that has a very low margin. So if you've got that kind of volatility on the revenue line, you're going to have even more volatility on the earnings line. So we're like, gosh, is there are another way to skin this cat. Can we think about an alternative that continues to allow us to provide the service but without all the overhead? Or perhaps this business is worth more to someone else than it is to us. We don't know. We don't know the outcome of our alternative work. But as soon as we do, we'll share that with you. And on the freighter question.\nBrian Newman: So the two planes were picked up through Qatar and really it's part of a broader airline strategy to retire some of the MD11s in terms of efficiency and sustainability.\nHelane Becker: Got it. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on a couple of things on the guidance. Brian, I know you said 10% US margin exiting the year. Any color on the shape of the year? You also talked a couple of times about just Q1 being hard. Any more specific color on Q1 and then just lastly, I know every year on this call, you typically give an update on the biggest customer exposure, if you can give us an update there? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Happy to, Scott. So from a domestic margin perspective, we're looking at the back half of the year being in the range of -- from an OP profit perspective, we're looking at 20% to 30% growth, Scott, from a margin will be in the 10-plus range for the fourth quarter. The challenge we have is the first quarter, we actually expect to be down in the neighborhood. We had a low mortar mark in Q3 of last year. So we're not going to be down to that point, but I don't think we'll be much better from a margin perspective in the US in the first quarter of this year. From an Amazon perspective, we finished the year at 11.8%. And that was not due to an increase in the business. We're still executing our plan with them in terms of a glide-down. It was more to the overall enterprise revenue coming down as a part of the enterprise.\nCarol Tome: It just came down faster than Amazon, yeah.\nBrian Newman: Exactly.\nPJ Guido: Steven, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.\nJordan Alliger: Hi, good morning. So I was sort of thinking about the small package growth that you guys targeted at less than 1% this year. Feels pretty conservative after a couple of years of probably negative industry growth as well. So I'm just sort of curious what's informing that? Is that your economic outlook, your forecast? And then maybe this is your Analyst Day, you'll address it, but sort of on a normalized basis, what kind of small package domestic growth, underlying industry growth you think about over a longer-term basis? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: Yeah. The longer-term view is very good. It's 3%. So that's really good growth actually. And we're looking forward to getting into that growth mode. We use a number of external factors to inform our perspective on the market growth. We triangulate from a number of different sources and come up with our best view. This is our best view.\nJordan Alliger: Okay, thanks.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Jordan.\nOperator: I will now turn the floor back over to our host, Mr. PJ Guido. Please go ahead, sir.\nPJ Guido: Thank you, Steven. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining, and have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover three areas, starting with the macro and our fourth-quarter results, then I'll review our full-year 2023 results, including cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll provide comments on expectations for the markets and our financial outlook for 2024. The macroenvironment in the fourth quarter showed improvements. However, in the transportation and logistics sector conditions remained under pressure, both in the US and internationally due to soft demand and overcapacity in the market. Throughout the quarter, we leveraged the agility of our integrated network to match capacity with demand. And we were recognized by an independent third party for providing industry-leading service for the sixth peak in a row. Looking at our financial results, in the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $24.9 billion, down 7.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022. All three of our segments demonstrated agility and on a combined basis drove down total expense by $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This enabled us to deliver operating profit within the range we communicated to you last quarter. Consolidated operating margin was 11.2% for the quarter and in line with our expectations. For the fourth-quarter, diluted earnings per share was $2.47, down 31.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Now, let's look at our business segments. In US Domestic, we knew going into the fourth quarter that volume will be ramping up of an exceptionally low third quarter. Our efforts to win back diverted volume and pull through new volume resulted in a record sequential volume surge. Throughout peak, we delivered excellent service to our customers while managing expenses. In the fourth quarter, average daily volume came in at the low end of our range and was down 7.4% year-over-year. B2B average daily volume in the fourth quarter was down 6.8% year-over-year, driven by declines in the retail, manufacturing, and high-tech sectors. In the fourth quarter, B2B represented 35.5% of our volume, which was up slightly from 35.3% in the same period last year. Also in the fourth quarter, continued macro pressures drove customers to seek economy products as we saw customers shift volumes out of the air onto the ground. Total air average daily volume was down 15% year-over-year, and ground average daily volume was down 5.8% versus the fourth quarter of last year. For the quarter, US Domestic generated revenue of $16.9 billion, down 7.3%. Revenue per piece was slightly positive year-over-year with a number of moving parts. A combination of strong base rates and customer mix increased the revenue per piece growth rates by about 390 basis points. This was offset by a few factors. First, changes in product mix and package characteristics decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 140 basis points. Second, reflecting the lower volume in the quarter, peak season surcharge revenue declined, which reduced the revenue per piece growth rate by about 120 basis points. And lastly, changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 110 basis points. Turning to costs, total expense was down 3.6%. And in the face of a 12.1% increase in union wage rates, which was driven by the contractual increase that went into effect last August, we pulled several levers to more than offset the higher expense. First, we leveraged our network planning tools and total service plan to reduce total hours in the fourth quarter by 10.2% which was more than the decline in average daily volume. This enabled us to decrease compensation and benefits, which drove down the total expense growth rate by around 30 basis points. Second, lower purchase transportation expenditures reduced the expense growth rate by around 70 basis points, primarily from lower-volume levels and our continued optimization efforts. Next, lower fuel costs contributed 160 basis points to the decrease in the total expense growth rate. And lastly, the net of all other expense items and allocations, reduced the expense growth rate by 100 basis points. Pulling it all together, these actions helped us reduce US Domestic expense in the fourth quarter by $578 million, which was our largest fourth quarter dollar cost reduction ever. Looking specifically at peak, as volume returned to the network and our biggest customers drove a surge in peak volume, we ran our integrated network with agility. In fact, in 2023, we closed over 30 sorts and they remain closed during peak. By leveraging our network planning tools, we took advantage of the flexibility of our integrated networks and flowed more volumes into our automated buildings. And with smart package smart facility in over 1,000 buildings, misload frequency improved 67%, contributing to the superior service we deliver to our customers. The US Domestic segment delivered $1.6 billion in operating profit, down 32.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. However, compared to the third quarter of 2023, operating profit in US Domestic increased $904 million and was our highest sequential operating profit increase ever. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 9.3%, a 440 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2023 Moving to our International segment. Soft demand continue to pressure volumes out of Asia. And in Europe, several key economies remain in recession, which pressured demand and drilled the shift away from Express Services. In response, we focused on revenue quality and adjusted our global network to match changes in geographic demand. Looking at volume, in the fourth quarter, International total average daily volume was down 8.3% year-over-year. The decline was primarily due to lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 10.8% driven by declines in Europe and Canada. Areas of the world that continue to face persistent inflationary pressures. On the export side, total average daily volume declined 5.9% on a year-over-year basis, driven by declines in Europe due to weak macro conditions. Looking at Asia, export average daily volume was down 8.9% driven by soft demand in the retail and high-tech sectors. However, export volume on the China to US lane, which is our most profitable lane increased 2.7% driven by SMBs. Nearly offsetting the decline in Asia over in the Americas region export average daily volume grew 11.9%, led by customers in Canada and Mexico, leveraging our cross-border ground service. In the fourth quarter, International revenue was $4.6 billion, which was down 6.9% from last year, primarily due to the decline in volumes. Revenue per piece increased 3.1%. Strong base pricing and a change in customer mix drove a 420 basis-point increase in the revenue per piece growth rate. A reduction in fuel surcharge revenue negatively impacted the revenue per piece growth rate by 60 basis points. And lower demand-related surcharge revenue, which was partially offset by the impact of a weaker US dollar decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 50 basis points. Moving to expense. In the fourth quarter, total international expense was down $152 million, primarily driven by lower fuel expense. Additionally, in response to the lower demand environment, we managed our network to match capacity with demand, which included reducing international block hours by 9.4%. Operating profit in the International segment was $899 million, down $192 million year-over-year. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 19.5%. Now, looking at Supply Chain Solutions. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $3.4 billion, down $435 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, in international air freight, overall volumes were down despite a mid-quarter spike in e-commerce. Market rates continue to be pressured, resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. On the ocean side, volume increased, driven by the retail sector. However, excess market capacity pressured revenue and operating profit. Within forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit known as Coyote continued to face pressure from excess capacity in the market, which drove revenue and operating profit down. In the fourth quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $319 million and an operating margin of 9.4%. Walking through the rest of the income statements, we had $207 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $66 million, and our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.5%. Now, let me comment on our full-year 2023 results. For the full-year 2023, revenue declined 9.3% to $91 billion and we generated operating profit of $9.9 billion, a decrease of 28.7% compared to full-year 2022. Consolidated operating margin was 10.9%. We generated $10.2 billion in cash from operations and continue to follow our capital allocation priorities. We invested $5.2 billion in CapEx. Additionally, we acquired MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns. We distributed $5.4 billion in dividends, which represented a 6.6% increase on a per share basis over 2022. We repaid $2.4 billion in debt that matured during the year. And at the end of the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2 turns. Lastly, we completed $2.25 billion in share buybacks in 2023. And in the segments for the full year, in US Domestic, operating profit was $5.4 billion and operating margin was 9%. The International segment generated $3.3 billion in operating profit and operating margin was 18.4%. And Supply Chain Solutions delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion and an operating margin was 9%. With 2023 behind us, let us move to our outlook for 2024. S&P Global is forecasting an improvement in global macro conditions as the year progresses. Outside the US, real exports in Europe are expected to improve each quarter throughout the year. Looking at Asia, we saw positive momentum on the China to US lane exiting the year, and remain cautious on the outlook for 2024. In the US, the projected small package market growth rate is just under 1% excluding Amazon. A slight improvement is expected in US manufacturing and the consumer is expected to remain resilient despite lingering inflationary pressures. We've built a plan that reflects the current environment and potential risks that we see. This includes getting our organization to our strategy and aligning execution to our wildly important initiatives under what we call fit to serve. As Carol mentioned, we are exploring strategic alternatives for Coyote, our truckload brokerage business, which will enable us to address some of the cyclical impacts in our forwarding business. And we are reducing our workforce by approximately 12,000 positions. This will cut around $1 billion in costs in 2024. Moving to our 2024 financial outlook, we are providing a range based on volume growth. The low end of the range has UPS growing at market rate and the high-end of the range as us gaining share. For the full year 2024, on a consolidated basis, revenues are expected to range from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion, and operating margin is expected to range from approximately 10% to 10.6%. In the range provided, we expect to move total average daily volume from negative growth in the first half of the year to positive growth in the back half. This is primarily driven by lapping the volume diversion we experienced in the US last year during our labor negotiations. Additionally, cost will weigh on us in the first half of the year, primarily due to the higher labor cost inflation associated with the new contract. Looking at consolidated revenue, in the first half of the year, we expect the growth rate to decline with a range of approximately 1% to 2% with the first quarter driving the decline. And in the back half of the year, revenue growth is anticipated to be up within a range of mid-to-high single-digits. Looking at consolidated operating profit, we expect material improvement as the year progresses with the second half of the year outperforming the first half. Lastly, we expect to generate our lowest consolidated operating margin of the year in the first quarter. Now let me give you a little color on the segments. Looking at US Domestic, average daily volume growth is expected to be within a range of approximately flat-to-up 2% for the full year. At both the low and high end of the range, we expect the revenue per piece growth rate to outpace the cost per piece growth rate beginning in the third quarter and we expect to exit the year at a 10% operating margin. Moving to the International segment, we expect 2024 average daily volume to be within a range of approximately flat-to-up around 3%. At both ends of the guidance range, operating margin is anticipated to be in the high teens. And in Supply Chain Solutions, for the full year in 2024, we expect revenue to be within a range of approximately $13 billion to $13.5 billion. At both ends of the guidance range, operating margin for SCS is expected to be high-single-digits. And for modeling purposes, in total below the line, we expect approximately $400 million in expense in 2024. This is net of $262 million in pension income. We included a slide in the appendix of today's webcast deck to provide you more detail on pension. The webcast deck will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website following this call. Now, let's turn to full year 2024 capital allocation. Our capital allocation priorities have not changed. We are staying on strategy and we'll make the best long-term decisions to capture growth, improve efficiency, and deliver value to our shareowners. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be within our target of around 5% of revenue or $4.5 billion. Now, let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow to be within a range of approximately $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion including our annual pension contributions of $1.4 billion, which are equal to our expected service costs. As Carol mentioned, the Board has approved a dividend per share of $1.63 for the first quarter. We are planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2024 subject to Board approval. Finally, our effective tax rate in 2024 is expected to be approximately 23.5%. In closing, we look at 2024 as a year to pivot away from negative volume to positive volume growth and from high labor cost inflation to a much lower growth rate. We are laser-focused on executing our strategy, controlling what we can control, and improving our financial performance. We look forward to sharing our multi-year targets in detail on our strategy at our Investor Day event on March 26th. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines. Sure. Happy to give you some color. So we talked about 12,000 heads out. 75% of the reductions will come in the first half, which drive the $1 billion in the 2024 calendar year. But you're absolutely right in terms of the timing and announcement, it will be back-end weighted. And really the thing I'd like to point out is it's a change in the way we work. So as volume returns to the system, we don't expect these jobs to come back. It's changing the effective way that we operate. Yeah, I think as we look to the back end of the year, certainly the volume projections that are in there, in terms of the volume growth for the back end of the year, in that 2% to 4% range, domestically, we start to see CPP growing slower than RPP. And so that balance is what's going to create the operating margin. With the sorts we closed over 30 sorts did not reopen them during peak. So we're changing. Nando's doing an effective job of basically managing more volume with less. So we'll continue to drive that. Thanks. Sure. Happy to Amit. So, from a shape of the year perspective, the full year we called revenue at 1% to 4%. But based on lapping of the volumes and the contract overlap, we would expect revenue to be flat to down 2% in the first half, up 4% to 8% in the back half. And from a profit perspective, I had mentioned that it's a tale of two cities. In terms of halves of the year, the second half of the year, we'd expect profit to grow about 20% to 30%. So Q1 will be the biggest challenge because we're lapping from a volume comp perspective and a full contract. But on a full-year basis, we're looking at OP margin 10% to 10.6%. I think you can expect the second half of the year to be 11% to 12% in that range and you can back into the first half. In terms of your question of backing out the $1 billion in cost, that $1 billion will be a cost-benefit in 2024. But I think we've said in the past, Amit, it would take twelve months to digest the new labor cost. We are confident we can get back to consistent expansion of US margins as we lap the first year of the contract. That'll be a combination of pricing and productivity. So, net-net, it's really lapping that contract and then you start to get the benefits. As Carol said, some of those benefits would accrue over to 2025 as well. So Carol talked about the differences between the Nando and Kate, the operating cost and what we're talking about management headcount. If you bifurcate the two, I think you're going to hear more at the Investor Day through things like network of the future, how we go after additional headcount in that area. But this would be about a 14% reduction in that 85,000 heads. Thanks, Amit. Thanks, Conor. Thanks, Jeff. So happy to, Brandon. We were actually pleased with the volume momentum. We were at a low watermark in August of last year, down 15%, and we saw sequential monthly improvement as we looked at our volume domestically from an ADV perspective, down to mid-single-digit declines in the month of December. So that trend continues to play out well. We're going to see some tough comps, though, in the first quarter, so I wouldn't expect positive volume growth in Q1. We start to see positive volume growth in Q2 and then certainly in the back half of the year as the comps change. SMB, Carol mentioned, very focused on penetration on the SMB side and specifically some of the medium SMB customers. We've stated we would like to see that mix trend up to 30% plus. We finished the year at 28%. So we're well on our way in that direction. Thanks, Brandon. So the two planes were picked up through Qatar and really it's part of a broader airline strategy to retire some of the MD11s in terms of efficiency and sustainability. Happy to, Scott. So from a domestic margin perspective, we're looking at the back half of the year being in the range of -- from an OP profit perspective, we're looking at 20% to 30% growth, Scott, from a margin will be in the 10-plus range for the fourth quarter. The challenge we have is the first quarter, we actually expect to be down in the neighborhood. We had a low mortar mark in Q3 of last year. So we're not going to be down to that point, but I don't think we'll be much better from a margin perspective in the US in the first quarter of this year. From an Amazon perspective, we finished the year at 11.8%. And that was not due to an increase in the business. We're still executing our plan with them in terms of a glide-down. It was more to the overall enterprise revenue coming down as a part of the enterprise. Exactly. Thanks, Jordan."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Carol Tome",
            "content": "Thank you, PJ, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for their hard work and effort. I'm proud of our team for their commitment to customer service. And for once again making UPS the industry leader in on-time performance, not only during peak, but throughout 2023. Looking at our volume trends for the fourth quarter, while total average daily volume or ADV declined 7.5% from last year, our performance was a marked improvement from what we reported in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, our salespeople did an outstanding job of winning back diverted volume and pulling through new volumes. In fact, US Domestic ADV surged 30% from the third quarter to the fourth which was our highest sequential volume ramp ever. By the end of December, we had one back and pull through nearly 60% of the volume diverted during our labor negotiations. Winning back and winning new volume is part of a program we call Project Brown. And this program will continue into 2024. You will recall that at the end of the third quarter, we provided a range of expected revenue and operating profit for the fourth quarter. Looking at our fourth quarter results versus last year, consolidated revenue declined 7.8% to $24.9 billion, which was slightly below the low end of our expectation. Operating profit was $2.8 billion, a decrease of 27.1% from last year, but slightly higher than the low end of our expectations. As a result, our consolidated operating margin was 11.2%, which was well within our expectation. For the year, consolidated revenue was $91 billion, a decrease of 9.3%. Consolidated operating profit totaled $9.9 billion, 28.7% lower than last year. And consolidated operating margin was 10.9%. We generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow during 2023 and we returned $7.6 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Brian will provide more detail about our financial results in a moment. 2023 was a unique and quite candidly a difficult and disappointing year. We experienced declines in volume, revenue, and operating profit in all three of our business segments. Some of this performance was due to the macroenvironment and some of it was due to the disruption associated with our labor contract negotiations as well as higher costs associated with the new contract. Through the year, however, we controlled what we could control and in many areas, we delivered the highest productivity results in our company history. And I think most importantly, we stayed on our strategy of customer first, people led, and innovation driven. Let me share a few examples of how our strategy is establishing a foundation for future growth. Starting with customer first. In 2023, our healthcare portfolio achieved our target of $10 billion in revenue. Here we've made strong progress towards our goal of becoming the number-one complex healthcare provider in the growing $130 billion global healthcare logistics market. Our global network of healthcare-compliant distribution space topped 17 million square feet in 2023. And our acquisitions of Bomi Group and MNX Global Logistics have expanded our cold-chain capabilities and are enabling us to reach new markets and customers. To support growth in our international small package business, in December, we announced plans to build a new air hub at Hong Kong International Airport. This new air hub supports our plans to grow in the best parts of the market, including highly profitable Asia trade lines and will enable us to expand our export and import business in the region. During the year, we continue to grow our SMB penetration. In 2023, SMBs made up 28.6% of our total US volume, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. Part of this growth came from DAP, our Digital Access Program. DAP has transformed how small companies do business with UPS. And in 2023, we generated $2.9 billion in DAP revenue, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Moving to People Led. In 2023, we delivered a labor agreement that provides certainty for the next five years. And because I'm a big believer in the power of One UPS. This year, we are returning to a policy of everyone back in the office five days a week. In terms of our culture, we are a network company not just of logistics capabilities, but a personal relationships too which brings me to innovation driven. On our busiest peak days, we sort over 50 million packages in the US and deliver more than 30 million packages worldwide. How do we do it? By leveraging the agility of our integrated network powered by UPS technologies and the skills of our engineers and operating team. Our network planning tools enabled us to quickly match capacity with volume across the network and drive productivity. Technology also enabled improvements to driver and help our route planning and dispatch, resulting in improvements in density and fewer seasonal support drivers than in prior year. It might surprise you to learn that we typically see an increase in returns volume before Christmas. In the fourth quarter, we moved lightening fast to integrate Happy Returns. We made box-free, label-free returns available in over 5,000 UPS store locations just eight days after the acquisition close. Happy Returns digital experience helped drive returns volume in the fourth quarter with momentum extending into the first quarter of 2024. Finally, we continue to deploy transformative technology to increase efficiency within our warehousing facilities. The latest example is our state-of-the-art pick, pack, and ship center in Louisville, Kentucky, that we call UPS Velocity. We named it Velocity because it leverages robotics, automation, machine-learning, and artificial intelligence to streamline fulfillment operations. This facility is capable of processing over 350,000 units per day and enables a best-in-class experience for our customers and their customers. Our customer first, people led innovation driven strategy is the foundation of our business. And our continued execution of the strategy enables us to exit 2023 with momentum. But momentum is not enough. We have decided to take some bold moves to right-size our company for the future and to focus on the key enablers of growth. So today, we are announcing two actions. First, we plan to explore strategic alternatives for our truckload brokerage business known as Coyote. Coyote is part of Supply Chain Solutions, and it's a business that's highly cyclical with considerable earnings volatility. We will keep you apprised as we move forward with this analysis. Second, we are going to fit our organization to our strategy and align our resources against what's wildly important. This will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 12,000 positions and around $1 billion in cost out this year. Here, we've identified new ways of working and are calling this fit to serve. Let me end by sharing our 2024 outlook. In 2024, the small package market in the US, excluding Amazon, is expected to grow by less than 1%. And projected market growth rates for the rest of our business segments picked up some improvement, but not until the latter part of the year. In building our 2024 financial targets, we incurred the low end of our guidance on market growth. And for the high-end of our guidance included growth we should experience if we capture market share. In 2024, we expect to generate consolidated revenue ranging from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion and a consolidated operating margin ranging from approximately 10% to 10.6%. Given the nuances of our new labor contract, there will be stark contrast between our first-half and our second-half performance. First-half earnings will be compressed and second-half earnings will expand. In both the low and high end of our guidance range, we expect to exit the year with US operating margin of 10%. Brian will provide more details in a moment. UPS remains rock-solid strong. While our dividend payout is currently higher than our targeted payout of 50% of our prior year's adjusted earnings per share, we are confident in our future. As a result, the UPS Board approved $0.01 increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.62 per share to $1.63 per share. This is the 15th consecutive year we have increased the UPS dividend. So now that 2023 is behind us, we look forward to seeing you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day on March 26th. At that time, we will share our three-year plans to grow and drive shareowner value. With that, thank you for listening. And now I will turn the call over to Brian. And I might just add a little more color, if I could, Chris. Today we have about 495,000 UPSers around the world. A few years ago, when the COVID demand was peaking, we had 540,000 UPSers. So Kate and Nando have done a masterful job of managing our operational headcount to meet the volume in our company. And they've done that by managing turnover and attrition and closing sorts and reducing block hours, et cetera. We have about 85,000 UPSers who are management, and this can be full-time and part-time management. The targeted headcount falls really within that group as well as some contractors that will be leaving us. And to Brian's point, this is really about a new way of working. So it's a $1 billion of cost out now, but there's even more cost out to come as we have a full-year benefit in 2025. So we believe that productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS. And I'll give you one example, then I'm going to throw it over to Nando to address this. But if I look at just one metric, cube utilization, we reach the highest cube utilization in our company history at 60%. That's the equivalent of reducing 1,500 loads per day. So that's not in hours, but it's just a cost out. So we've got productivity across the operations. And Nando, why don't you talk about what you're going to do in 2024? And at our Investor Day in March, we're going to talk to you about network of the future. We've got an integrated network. We don't have to integrate, but we can transform our network with some very exciting ideas. So we're going to share that with you in March. Yeah, we're never done. We continue to drive productivity. It's a virtuous cycle here, and technology has changed so much in the past year. When you think about the advent of Generative AI and the applications inside of our business, we're just getting started and I'm really excited about what the future will mean in terms of driving productivity and as well as improving the customer experience. Yeah. We'd be happy to do that. But we're going to kick that question to our March conference because we've got a great presentation to share with you regarding network of the future, and it would take up way too much time today to go through that. We want to spend a good amount of time talking to you about that in March. So thank you for understanding. I'll start with a few comments about Project Brown. Project Brown really is a new way of going after business and it has many elements to it, and I'll make some of those real to you. First of all, we looked at ourselves and said, what's getting in the way of speed? Because it was taking us too long to respond to a customer. And we found that we hadn't really declared service level agreements amongst the various groups that participate in this exercise of providing offers to our customers. So we shortened up the time to response and that's important and that's going to be with us now forever. I can make that real for you. Outside of the United States, it used to take 22 days. We dropped it to six days. We're now at two days. That's best in class. And we've made similar improvements in the United States. Project Brown was also looking at Deal Manager. Deal Manager is the new tool that we introduced that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to score a deal and avoid the need for our salespeople to go up to our pricing people for appeals, they can actually see the score of their deal. We've had great acceptance and win rates, 79% win rates with this tool. But we found through Project Brown that we weren't offering all of our products in the tool and one of the products we weren't offering was SurePost, which is a great product. So we introduced SurePost into the Deal Manager, and we're getting some good return on that. That's particularly attractive for our small and medium-sized customers. Another thing that we did is that we improved and increased weekend pickups in several key markets during the year. So and I could go on and on and on, but this is a way of operationalizing excellence to drive the business and capture share. So where are we going to capture share? We're going to continue to lean into the small and medium-sized segment opportunities, we're seeing some real success in that area. We're going to continue to lean into healthcare. When I started here, the healthcare revenues are around $6 billion, now at $10 billion, and we're going to continue to grow. We'll lay out our three-year growth plans for you at our March Investor Day. I think you'll be very pleased with that. We're going to continue to sell off the service that we provide and the capabilities that we have that actually no one else has, that's our integrated network. So at our Investor Day in March, we'll lay out market share capture. Let me just make the market real for you because this might be helpful too. As we think about the addressable market, the addressable market in the United States. It's a little over 52 million packages a day. So there's plenty of addressable market for us to go get. And plenty of market for us to get outside of the United States because we are underpenetrated in so many areas. One reason I called out our new air hub in the Hong Kong International Airport is that the greater China Bay area is unbelievable economic power base, the 13th largest economy in the world, 37% of all China exports go through that airport. And today, we have small way overcapacity hubs and buildings that are inefficient with lease rates that are sky high. So we are building a 20,000 square meter facility. It will make us the second largest air hub in that important part of the market. So expect to see a lot of growth coming off of that over time. So I would say that the pricing environment is very rational. And you can see that as Brian ticked out the RPP performance in the fourth quarter, we had very strong base rate performance. Now the RPP was muted because of lower fuel costs and product characteristics and the product mix change and lower demand surcharges, but the base was very strong. And we expect the base to continue into 2024, our GRI for 2024 is 5.9%. Will we keep all of it? No. But will we keep a lot of it? Yes, just like we did in 2023, we kept about 60% of the GRI in 2023. So the pricing environment is rational. In terms of competitive products, it's incumbent upon us to stay at leading edge and meeting our customers where they want us to be. That's one reason we offered a hyper-local product beginning last quarter, which is really a short-zone product. We haven't had that before. And as we look at the offerings that we will go to market with this year, we've got some things underway, not ready for prime time, but I suspect looking over at our new Chief Commercial Officer, Matt Guffey, that we might be able to talk about that at our March investor conference and he's nodding his head. So stay tuned for that. Well, what really softened up was Europe. If you look at our volume decline, both domestic and export, it was heavily weighted in Europe. In fact, the decline in our export was 94%, driven by the softness in Europe. So you see what's happening with industrial manufacturing there is just way off. So that is a big change. There are also dynamics happening in air and ocean freight as you've been watching. We've all been watching the drama in the Red Sea, the fact that the water levels in the Panama Canal are low, and that certainly is causing a lot of chaos actually in ocean and air freights. Interestingly, on the air side, both rates and volumes were down. On the ocean side, volumes are up. But as Brian called out, the rates were considerably down. As we sit here today, it's a very dynamic market and ever-changing. A little hard to predict candid like is what we're seeing today is for shippers who have high value packages, they're actually -- they're worried about the ocean conditions, so they're moving to the air. So air rates are tightening a bit. And on the ocean side, because shippers are starting to have to reroute away from the Red Sea or the Panama Canal, the routing is taking longer, so there's some change to the dynamics of the pricing there too. We just have to stay super nimble here and Kate and her team are doing a great job at that. Kate, what would you like to add here? Maybe another comment because this is just an interesting observation on the market. If I look at our top five decliners in the quarter, that would include our largest customer and there's an intentional decline there. But then if I look at the remaining decliners, it's really interesting to see what's happening. Of those, only one has diverted some volume. They're a dual sourcer and they have diverted some volume. And I suspect they'll stay dual-sourcing. The rest, either their business is just way off or they have worked really hard to create a better experience inside the store to encourage buy online pick up in store. So there is a bit of dynamic happening within our large enterprise customers. I think for all of us, we're delighted to have anniversaried the demand that we saw through COVID. Now that that's behind us, now that the volume for the small package market has reverted back to the mean, this is an opportunity now for everyone to grow. I'm happy to address the Coyote question to the best of my ability. I was on the Board in 2015 when we bought the company but the strategic rationale was really about expanding the portfolio. And it was a very thoughtful strategic rationale to expand the portfolio. But I don't think we fully understood at the time was just how cyclical this business is. And I'll make it real for you. When we acquired Coyote in 2015, the revenue in the previous year for Coyote were $2.1 billion. During COVID, Coyote peaked up to over $4 billion in revenue. Well, it's gone way down since then. In fact, if you look at our Supply Chain Solutions business, it was down $3 billion year-on-year, which is a third of the overall company decline. Within that $3 billion, Coyote made up 38% of the decline for the year and 48% of the decline for the fourth quarter. So you can see the volatility in the revenue line, and then we've got a business that has a very low margin. So if you've got that kind of volatility on the revenue line, you're going to have even more volatility on the earnings line. So we're like, gosh, is there are another way to skin this cat. Can we think about an alternative that continues to allow us to provide the service but without all the overhead? Or perhaps this business is worth more to someone else than it is to us. We don't know. We don't know the outcome of our alternative work. But as soon as we do, we'll share that with you. And on the freighter question. Thank you. It just came down faster than Amazon, yeah. Yeah. The longer-term view is very good. It's 3%. So that's really good growth actually. And we're looking forward to getting into that growth mode. We use a number of external factors to inform our perspective on the market growth. We triangulate from a number of different sources and come up with our best view. This is our best view."

            "content": "Yeah. So, David, thanks for the question. For us, it is a virtuous cycle. So we're working ahead of any type of volume variability. So whether it goes up or down, we've got some of our best engineers, operations folks, finance folks, identifying additional cost-outs as we move forward, as we're executing the ones that we have in front of us. So we feel good that there's a good pipeline of opportunity no matter what the volume does. And as Carol had mentioned, we lever our hourly headcount and match that to the volume and the activity. And so far so good, but still lots in front of us and they're pretty meaty. So we feel really good about those initiatives."

We were able to pull back on the cost to deliver a great margin, and that's our commitment. And then to ensure that in the forwarding side of the house, as we've done, stay just razor sharp to ensure that we are right on track with any trend that we see. And I'm really proud of the team because we have got the initiative to gain those customers with high-value goods and that international air freight that's coming as a result. It actually is first showing up Asia to Europe lane. And -- but I will say this is going to be repositioning of vessels around the globe. It's going to be a global event. So we see it as an opportunity throughout and our sales resources are global. Our portfolio is global. So UPS is very well positioned to take advantage of it."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. PJ Guido, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nPJ Guido: Good morning and welcome to the UPS third quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements, within the federal securities laws, and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2022 Form 10-K and other reports we filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website, and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results. For the third quarter of 2023, GAAP results include an after-tax charge of $219 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, comprised of a one-time payment of $46 million to certain US-based non-union part-time supervisors, transformation and other charges of $70 million, and non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $103 million. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website along with the webcast of today's call. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Please ask only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue, for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thanks, PJ, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for their hard work and effort. Our US labor contract wasn't fully ratified until early September and I'm proud of our UPSers for staying focused during the entire labor negotiation and for providing industry-leading service to our customer. We expected conditions in the third quarter to be challenging and they were. The global macroenvironment remained weak, with some countries in recession, which pressured international and freight forwarding volume. And in the US, labor uncertainty negatively impacted volume from most of the quarter. From a demand perspective, August proved to be the most challenging, as some customers waited for the ratification of our Teamster contract, before returning volume to our network. Since contract ratification, we've been gaining volume momentum. We exited the last week of September with US average daily volume or ADV down 7.4%, a marked improvement from the rest of the quarter. Our sales people have produced record results and the combination of win-back and new customers. To-date, we've won back roughly 600,000 ADV of diverted volume and we are working to win back all diverted volume by the end of the year. And looking at our sales pipeline, we're pulling through new customers that value our superior on-time performance, and want to come to UPS, prior to the busy peak holiday season. Moving to our financial results, our third quarter performance while down considerably from last year, was in line with our expectations, and factored in both the timing of contract ratification, and higher labor costs, resulting from the new labor contract. Consolidated revenue in the third quarter was $21.1 billion, down 12.8% compared to last year. Operating profit was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 48.7% from last year, and consolidated operating margin was 7.7%. Brian will provide more details on our performance in a moment. With the third quarter behind us, we are laser-focused on restoring volume in our network, and executing our strategy to deliver shareowner value. So let me turn to our strategic update. Our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy is enabling us to stay focused on our core business, and invest to grow in the most attractive parts of the market like healthcare and with SMB. Starting with customer first, under our better and bolder framework, we recently announced two acquisitions that will further drive growth in healthcare logistics and in end-to-end returns solution. One of our strategic objectives is to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world and we are making bold moves to get us there. Last year's acquisition of Bomi, and our recently announced pending acquisition of MNX Global Logistics are two examples of bold moves in healthcare. MNX is an industry leader in time-critical and temperature-sensitive logistics, tailor-made for the complex needs of global healthcare. By combining MNX with UPS Express Critical, and our Global Integrated Network, we will enhance the speed and reliability of our healthcare portfolio. With MNX, UPS will be able to reach new healthcare markets like in Asia, and new customers like the radiopharmaceutical sector. To further support our healthcare strategy, this year, we've opened seven dedicated healthcare facilities in Europe and in the US. And the acquisition of Bomi, further strengthen our healthcare footprint in Europe and Latin America. Since 2020, we have more than doubled our healthcare distribution space globally. These efforts and more are keeping us on track to reach our $10 billion healthcare revenue target this year, and we're just getting started. Turning to returns, with the explosion of e-commerce demand, our returns business has been a key area of growth over the last several years. What we've seen over this time is an increasing desire on the part of both our customers and our recipient, for a frictionless, and simple end-to-end returns experience. We've been building out this experience. But to help us get there faster, we just entered into an agreement to acquire Happy Returns, a technology-focused company that enables frictionless, no-box, no-label return. By combining Happy Returns' easy digital experience, and established drop-off point, with UPS's small package network, and footprint of both to 5,200 UPS store locations, box-free, label-free returns will soon be available at more than 12,000 convenient locations in the US, but our plans for returns don't stop at convenience. For our enterprise retail customers, we plan to provide a consolidated return solution that will lower their costs, and improve their experience. And for UPS, Happy Returns expands our returns portfolio, with an innovative solution, that will generate profitable B2B volume, and help drive pickup and delivery density. For us, customer first isn't just about growth, it's about meeting customer needs. To that end, we are continuing to improve the delivery experience, with the expansion of UPS delivery photo. 92% of our residential stops globally include a photo that shows exactly where the package was delivered. Not only does delivery photo provide peace of mind to recipient, but we get fewer calls about missing packages. With delivery photo, UPS has seen a reduction in US delivery-related support requests of more than 15%. We're also harnessing our data to deliver more agile, and targeted products that meet our customers' needs. Our latest example is a new product we call hyperlocal, which leverages the footprint of our US facilities, to provide select customers with a fast next-day delivery option, within a metro area. Hyperlocal enables us to capture new profitable B2C and B2B volume, and was launched in October as a new service offering. Let me quickly touch on DAP, our digital access program. We are continuing to grow SMB volume with DAP. In the third quarter, we launched 10 new partners in time for peak. In the first nine months of this year, we generated $2.1 billion in DAP revenues, and we expect to deliver $3 billion in DAP revenue for the year. Let's turn to innovation driven. UPS has been a technology company since our founding, and we are adding transformative technology in our operations, that will increase efficiency, and improve the employee experience. Smart package, smart facility, our RFID solution, is one way we're driving efficiency, and I'm pleased that we are wrapping up our Phase 1 rollout in our US facility. The improvements we are seeing in our preload operations are even better than we expected, with nearly 200 of our buildings seeing this load rates in one and 2,500 packages are better. Deployment of Phase 2 is already underway, which equipped our packaged cars with RFID readers. Over time, this will allow us to virtually scan smart packages during pickup, and eliminate delivery scans during bulk delivery stops. Both of which will enhance customer visibility, and make our drivers more efficient. Another example of transformative technology is robotics. Specifically, starting a Supply Chain Solutions, we are implementing robotics unload technology inside our trailers to unload packages more efficiently. These robots navigate the inside of the trailer, and can unload multiple box types and sizes autonomously. Now, it's still early days with this technology, but we are seeing many opportunities to further expand the use of robotics across our networks. Turning to the fourth quarter, we are preparing for peak. Over the past five years, our service during peak has been better than our closest competitor by an average of 310 basis points. Service matters all the time, but especially at peak. So to prepare, we are collaborating with customers on volume projections, and the timing of their promotions. We will also leverage technology, like our network planning tools, to control how the volume comes in, utilize available capacity, and adjust the networks to operate as efficiently as possible. Regarding peak hiring, our people-led strategy enables greater flexibility to serve our customers during the holiday rush. For example, our experienced part-time employees have now become seasonal support drivers. This enables them to deliver packages using their own vehicles, before or after their regular shifts. In addition, we plan to hire over 100,000 seasonal employees to help process and deliver holiday volume. This year, we've made it even easier and faster to apply for a job, as we shorten the digital process to less than 20 minutes, and building out an online application to receiving a job offer. Regarding our financial outlook, we made changes based on what we're seeing in the market. We still expect to have healthy peak volume in the fourth quarter. So based on what appears to be slowing demand in all business segments, we are revising our guidance accordingly. Brian will share more detail in a moment. Back in January, I said that 2023 would be a year of resilience, and it has been. Our Founder Jim Casey said, determined people working together can do anything. During the year, we accelerated the deployment of smart package, smart facility, and made strategic acquisitions to grow in the best parts of the market. We delivered a labor agreement, that provides certainty for the next five years. We are operating with greater speed and agility, controlling what we can control, and we are staying on strategy. With that thank you for listening and now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I'll cover four areas. I'll start with the macro, followed by our third quarter results. Next, I'll cover cash and shareowner returns. Then, I'll provide detail around our updated guidance. The macroenvironment in the third quarter was challenging. The weakness we saw in the second quarter continued into the third quarter, especially in Asia and Europe. Real exports and industrial production moved lower due to falling demand, and global consumer conditions did not significantly change. In the US, we faced tough conditions due to several factors. To begin, the volume diversion we experienced in the second quarter continued into the third quarter, which led to more volume diversions than we anticipated. Next, some customers that diverted, waited until our Teamster contract was fully ratified in September, before returning volume to our network. And lastly, we incurred higher labor costs associated with new contract, and added headcount earlier than normal to ramp-up for peak, so that we can ensure we maintain our industry-leading service levels. Through the end of the quarter, we adjusted our integrated network, to support our customers' needs, managed cost, and stayed focused on bringing volume back into our network. Looking at our financial results for the quarter, consolidated revenue was $21.1 billion, down 12.8% from last year. Consolidated operating profit was $1.6 billion, down 48.7% compared to the same period last year. Consolidated operating margin was 7.7%. For the third quarter, diluted earnings per share was $1.57 down 47.5% from the same period last year. Now, let's look at our business segments. In US Domestic, we knew the third quarter would be a challenge, and it was, due to our labor negotiations, higher costs, and a dynamic economic backdrop. As we discussed on our last call, we ended the second quarter with an average daily volume in June, down 12.2%. As contract negotiations became later and louder, we saw more volume diversion than we anticipated. August represented the low watermark when average daily volume was down 15.2% year-over-year. Post ratification, we exited the third quarter half that way, and we're continuing to see our week-over-week volume levels improve, despite a challenging retail backdrop. In the US, in the third quarter, average daily volume was down 11.5%, and we estimate the impact of volume diversion reduced our volume by approximately 1.5 million packages per day. Moving to mix, in the third quarter, we saw lower volumes across all industry sectors, with the largest declines from retail and high-tech. B2C average daily volume declined 13.4% compared to last year, and B2B, average daily volume was down 9%. In the third quarter, B2B represented 44% of our volume, which was an increase of 120 basis points from a year ago. Also in the third quarter, we continued to see customers shift volumes out of the air, onto the ground. Total air average daily volume was down 15.8% year-over-year, with about half of the decline coming from our largest customer, as anticipated. Ground average daily volume was down 10.7%. In terms of customer mix, in the third quarter, SMBs, including platforms, made up 28.5% of our total US volume, an increase of 20 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, US Domestic generated revenue of $13.7 billion, down 11.1%. Despite lower volume, we remained disciplined on revenue quality. In the third quarter, revenue per piece increased 2%. Looking at the key drivers, the combination of strong base rates, and improved customer and product mix increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 410 basis points. Changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 190 basis points. The remaining 20 basis points of decline was driven by multiple factors including package characteristics. Turning to costs, total expense was down 5.1% in the third quarter. Compensation and benefits decreased the total expense growth rate by around 50 basis points. Total union wage rates were up 11.5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the contractual wage increase that went into effect on August 1st. Additionally, we began network preparations for peak. Offsetting the total increase in compensation and benefits, we leveraged our total service plan, and network planning tools, to reduce total hours in the third quarter by 11.4%. We reduced the expense growth rate for purchase transportation by around 190 basis points, primarily from lower volume levels, and our continued optimization efforts. Lower fuel costs contributed 170 basis points to the decrease in total expense growth rate. The net of all other expense items and allocations reduced the expense growth rate by 100 basis points. The US Domestic segment delivered $665 million in operating profit, down 60.6% compared to the third quarter of 2022, and operating margin was 4.9%. Moving to our International segment, macro conditions were uneven in the third quarter with some regions of the world were challenged than others. Continued falling demand pressured Asia, and in Europe, consumers continued to contend with high inflation, and tight financial conditions. In response, we adjusted headcount and block hours, in our global networks to match changes in geographic demand. In the quarter, international total average daily volume was down 6.6% year-over-year. Nearly three quarters of the decline came from lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 9.1%, driven primarily by declines in Europe. On the export side, average daily volume declined 4.1% on a year-over-year basis. Looking at Asia, export average daily volume was down 8%, and export volume on the China to US lane, which is our most profitable lane, was down 10.3% year-over-year. One bright spot was the Americas region, where export average daily volume grew 4.7%, led by Canada and Mexico, leveraging our cross-border ground service. In the third quarter, International revenue was $4.3 billion, which was down 11.1% from last year, due to the decline in volume and a 1.4% reduction in revenue per piece. The decline in revenue per piece was driven by several factors. Lower fuel surcharge revenue contributed 230 basis points to the revenue per piece growth rate decrease, a reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue contributed 200 basis points to the decline, partially offsetting the decline multiple factors increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 290 basis points, including strong base rates, and a weaker US dollar. Moving to costs, in the third quarter, total international costs was down $203 million, primarily driven by lower fuel expense. In response to lower demand, we adjusted our integrated network and cut costs, which included reducing international block hours by 13.9% compared to last year, and reducing headcount in operations and overhead functions by a total of 2,300 positions, and we did all of this while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers. Operating profit in the International segment was $675 million, down $329 million year-over-year, which included a $98 million reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue. Operating margin in the third quarter was 15.8%. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions, in the third quarter, revenue was $3.1 billion, down $854 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, let's start with forwarding. In international air freight, softer global demand, and lower volume, resulted in a decline in revenue and operating profit. On the ocean side, demand flipped positive, driven by the retail sector, and generated volume growth. However, excess market capacity pressured revenue and operating profit. In response to the dynamic forwarding market, we cut operating costs. Within forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit continued to face pressure from excess capacity in the market, which drove revenue and operating profit down. Logistics delivered revenue and operating profit growth. In the third quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $275 million, and an operating margin of 8.8%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $199 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $66 million, and our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 12.6%, which benefited from certain discrete items, including tax credits and global audit resolutions. Now, let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. Year-to-date, we generated $7.8 billion in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $4.9 billion. And so far this year, UPS has paid $4 billion in dividends, and we've completed $2.25 billion in share buybacks. Now, I'll share a few comments about our outlook. We expected 2023 to be a bumpy year, and it has been. We've navigated record-high inflation, rising interest rates, disruptions in China, a war in Eastern Europe, now a humanitarian crisis in Israel and Gaza, and the disruption around our US labor negotiations. Through all of this, we remained focused on controlling what we can control, and are continuing to adjust the network to match volume levels, and deliver industry-leading service to our customers. Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed, and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. As a result, we've lowered our full-year guidance, and have provided a range to reflect the uncertainty in the market. We now expect consolidated revenue to be between $91.3 billion and $92.3 billion, and consolidated operating margin to be between 10.8% and 11.3%. Let me walk you through our assumptions for the guidance range. In the US, we are winning back volume at a rapid pace, but we've also seen demand softness due to several factors, with many of our customers who did not divert. Additionally, while consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter, and looking at estimates for holiday retail sales this year, increases range from over 4% to 12%. Moving to international, a further downturn in exports and lower consumer spending in some of the largest European markets, including Germany and the UK are negatively impacting volume. And exports on our most profitable trade lane, which is China to the US, are not improving at the pace we had expected. Finally in forwarding, air and ocean capacity has increased, which is putting additional downward pressure on market rates. In fact, in ocean, there was extreme overcapacity versus demand in the market, and the forwarding demand outlook in the fourth quarter remains weak. Turning to capital allocation for the full-year, capital expenditures are still expected to be about $5.3 billion. We are still planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023, subject to Board approval. We have repaid $1.6 billion in debt this year as planned, and expect to repay an additional EUR700 million of debt in the fourth quarter. We now expect $2.25 billion in share buybacks in 2023, which we have already completed. In the fourth quarter, we're redeploying cash, back into the business for growth initiatives, such as strategic acquisitions to drive shareowner value. And lastly, we expect the tax rate for the full-year to be approximately 22%. In closing, while navigating a very challenging macroenvironment, we remain focused on the job in hand. For the past five years, we've held the record as the industry-leader in service during peak. We intend to do it again this year. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines.\nPJ Guido: Steven, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: We will begin the question-and-answer period and our first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks, good morning guys. Maybe to start on the guidance, and specifically for the fourth quarter, so I think it implies a pretty meaningful step-up in operating profit, and we understand that, you know, I'm guessing ADV probably has a significant piece to do with that improvement in the operating profit for how low it was in the third quarter, but maybe you could help us bridge from how we're going to get from the third quarter, which, obviously, was quite challenged to what is a significant improvement sequentially. In that context, maybe if you could give us with the help of with what October ADV looks like on the domestic side. I think it's a very important number, so kind of curious if you can help us with that too.\nBrian Newman: Sure, happy to, Chris. Good morning. So, if you look at the bridge, I'll take the low end from -- so Q3, we put -- posted $665 million in operating profit. To get to the low end of the guide, it would require about $800 million in profit. The two biggest drivers of that are volume and revenue quality. The productivity that the teams are generating, Nando in the US, is offsetting the labor contract step-up because you realize we have three months in the third and fourth quarter, and we had two months of the new labor contract in the second. Your question on volume, as we think about volume and revenue quality, those two alone provide a majority of the 800 step up, but if you think about where we were in August, and where we are in October, the momentum is increasing. We had a low watermark as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, down 15% in terms of ADV volume in August. That translates to around 16 million pieces from an ADV perspective. That's actually, in October, we're seeing 19 million pieces, so we've seen that step-up. I went back, Chris, and looked at last year, and the August to October step-up, was 1.5 million pieces. This year, the August to October step-up is 2.7 million pieces, so from a glide path and a trajectory, we're seeing momentum, the absolute levels are coming up, and that's what led to the guide.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just want to go back to the comments on the recapture trends. I think you mentioned it's really starting in September in terms of that recapture rate. Is that like a huge acceleration in terms of what you're seeing in October? Is it from that recapture? And then, also related to that, is there any cost associated with that volume you're recapturing today? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: So we're really pleased with how we're recapturing volume back in our business. We have recaptured over 600,000 pieces per day of the volume that was lost and I will say, 50% of that recapture is coming from our largest competitor. The recapture continues day by day, but it's not just about recapturing what we lost, it's about growing new business. You may recall, Allison, at the end of the second quarter, we said we had about a $7 billion pipeline of new business. Today, we've won about 25% of that pipeline. Now, that $7 billion is an annualized number. So, all those packages and volume haven't come into the network yet, it will come in over the next year. So, I couldn't be more pleased with how our sales team is performing, and winning new accounts, and winning back volume that deferred.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then, just as a follow-up to the recapture, any cost associated with that recapture that you have to make?\nCarol Tome: There's no material costs associated with the recapture. Customers are coming back because of our superior service.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys. So, Brian, you mentioned the $800 million step-up. That's incremental sequential from 3Q to 4Q. I just want to make sure that I heard that correctly. That's the low end of your guidance range assumption?\nBrian Newman: That's right, Dave.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then -- and maybe more bigger picture, right. As we think about the exit rate kind of implied in the guide, I think, it works out to something like down 20% year-over-year at EBIT. How do we think about that build back in 2024. You know, in the front half, obviously, you have inflation, which you've got the GRI to offset. Should we be expecting that sort of, you know, second derivative rate of change to slowly get better, and then snapback, or does it get, you know, meaningfully better in sort of 1Q, 2Q? How do we think about the shape of 2024, and how it's stepping up to recover in the domestic margin side?\nBrian Newman: So two big pieces of sort of forward momentum, Dave. One is the exit rate on volume. Carol just talked about the win-back, and also the pipeline of new business. So going into next year, getting back on level footing with a system that has higher ADV will help us certainly from a cost and margin perspective, the revenue per piece we announced a 5.9% GRI, so that will be coming in. We talked to you recently about the cost overhang of the contract, that goes from August-to-August, so I would tell you from a shape, certainly the first half of the year will be more challenged than the back half of the year. Back half of the year, we get into two to three-year glide path with lower inflation per year, and then, so pricing and productivity can help expand the margins. But those are the pluses and minuses as we look into '24. Obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail March '26 when we get together with you all for our next Investor Day.\nDavid Vernon: And that rate of change in the first half better than 4Q?\nBrian Newman: Let me come back to you, Dave, but we're certainly building momentum.\nCarol Tome: Let's finish of the year, Dave, and then, we'll give you some color about 2024.\nDavid Vernon: So always about 2024. Thanks for the time.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. I was wondering if you could give some color on your confidence level on the new revenue range. How much certainty do you feel the visibility, and what frames the high end, low end? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: So thanks, Jordan, for the question. Look, we feel good about the revenue range. We've narrowed it to $1 billion, and I think the thing that's going to drive the upper end versus the lower end, really has to do with the retail backdrop. I mentioned in my script, there's sort of the broad range of the online retail sales for the holiday period. To the extent it's in the higher end of that, we'll have more volume, and more revenue, to the extent it comes in with some of the risks we're seeing is towards the lower end.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question --\nCarol Tome: Maybe one other comment, if I could, Brian, on the volume range. We know which of our customers peak during peak. There are about a 117 customers in the US that make up about 86% of our peak volume. We're sitting down with each of those customers, understanding what their plans are, as we work on our operating plans to make sure we deliver superior service, having that insight, if you will, gives us a lot of confidence in the US volume numbers that Brian shared with you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. You made a couple of comments on the volume that you're recapturing, and I just want to make sure I understand it. I guess, it's an important point. So, I think, Carol, you said 600,000 pieces a day have been recaptured. But then, Brian, you said kind of last year, the August to October was 1.5 million and it's 2.7 million increase this year. So that implies, I guess 1.2 million increase. So, I just wondered if you could give a little more perspective of kind of where we're at in October, and how much of that loss business has been recaptured, and then, I guess, another way you framed it was December. You were going to get back to flat volumes before. I think it was a prior comment. Do you still think you can do that, or are we thinking December volumes are down? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Yeah, Tom. So, to frame it up for you, we were trying to get December back to flat versus prior year. I think the guide now implies from a low-single-digit to a mid-single-digit in the month of December, and that's pending some of the backdrop I just talked about in terms of the retail outlook. So, from a momentum perspective, I gave in August to an October number, but as Carol mentioned, we lost 1.5 million or we had diverted 1.5 million pieces. We've seen 40% of that, roughly 600,000 pieces already come back to the system. We're also pushing forward with new business that Carol referenced as well.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJoe Hafling: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the questions. This is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie Moore. I had maybe a conceptual question on sort of the recapture, looking at the near term. Given its peak season, and customers are focused on their own execution right now, does this limit your ability to win back volumes in the near term, and shippers don't want to disrupt any of the plans that they've already got in place? Obviously, you've highlighted the capture rates sort of September-October, but just wondering if that slows down as we kind of get into November-December, just as shippers don't want to disrupt their own operations right now?\nCarol Tome: Actually, it's accelerating. Customers want to come back into our network before peak because of our superior service that we've exhibited over the past five years.\nJoe Hafling: Got you. Thank you so much and helpful.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey. Great. Good morning. If I could just clarify one thing on the step-up, I think to Allison, do you say you're not using increasing pricing as you get towards the tail end of that volume gain? And then, my question is on international, right. You're looking, I guess, Brian, to really snapback closer back to that 20% range. Is that kind of what you are still looking at in terms of margins at international as we move into the fourth quarter? I just want to understand the shift from peak versus belly space coming back on, and the impacts to margin there?\nBrian Newman: Yeah. On the first question, Ken, obviously, you've got volume and pricing. I was talking to with Allison about the volume component. We have announced a 6% to 7% peak season surcharge. So that's, obviously, flowing through from a revenue standpoint in the fourth quarter as well.\nCarol Tome: I think Allison's question was, are there costs associated with winning back volume. And as I responded, not meaningful. Ken, from time to time, we have found customers who diverted, and they entered into longer-term contracts, and we might help them to exit those longer-term contracts, but it's not a meaningful discount. It's just we might help them. It's nothing measurable.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, hey, Brian, one of the earlier questions about the bridge from Q3 to Q4, you answered it sort of how do we get to the low end. So, should we think that the low end of the range is more of your base case? I just want to understand sort of that answer. And then, can you just maybe, more explicitly, just talk about what your -- the margin expectations are for each of the segments in Q4? Just -- I wasn't sure what you were -- what you're thinking for each business. Margin or profit, however you want to answer, yeah.\nBrian Newman: I have a walk in front of me for the high end and the low end, so I can give it to either range, and I think it's retail backdrop uncertainty that drives the delta in volume, which drives the delta in profit. So, it's the same levers. It's the volume and the revenue quality, really driving the majority at a higher component, at the high end versus the $800 million I referenced at the lower end. So net-net, I think from a margin shape standpoint, we finished Q3 mid-single-digit in the US. Obviously, that's a very low watermark, driven by the volumes we saw in the quarter. We're looking in the fourth quarter to step back up into that high-single-digit, low-double-digit range. And so, getting back to the trajectory, and then from an international perspective, we were at 15.8% in the third quarter. I think Kate and the team have planned largely through controlling what we can control, whether it's block hours, whether it's headcount. Taking that and they've done a good job of demonstrating that Q1 was 18% margin International, Q2 was a 20%, so we're probably in the middle of that range for the fourth quarter. Hopefully that helps.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you, operator. Hi, everybody. I guess maybe just a very simple question, I guess, is when do we return to margin expansion in domestic? I mean RPP, CPP spread was really negatively wide in the third quarter. I assume it's still negative, albeit less so in the fourth quarter. Can we get to a situation where we get back to year-on-year margin expansion in early next year or do we have to wait until August when the labor really -- inflation really steps down?\nCarol Tome: Well, maybe just an observation on the US margin in the third quarter. Recall that we had $500 million of expense related to our Teamster contract in the third quarter. If we back that out, the US margin would have been 8.5%. 8.5% on volume down a 11% is not a bad margin. So, we've got a bit of pressure on the margin that we shared with you because of our new contract. The contract is front-end loaded. We're bearing the pain of that front-end load. For a five-year contract that's very attractive. The compounded annual growth rate on the five years is 3.3%. So once we get through this first front-end load with 46% of the cost in the first year, once we get through that, the margin is going to grow. It's going to grow in a big way. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nAmit Mehrotra: I mean, it kind of is helpful, but I mean, I guess, the question is that, are we stuck in this return profile through the first half of next year, and then we see a step function improvement, or can we see improvement as you guys maybe rip off some of the -- rip out some of those seasonal costs in the first quarter, and we can get back to year-on-year growth in the first quarter even?\nCarol Tome: No again -- absolutely fair question, Amit. Let us finish this year. Then, we will give you guidance for 2024, and we can break it down by quarter, if that's going to be helpful.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yep.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nChristyne McGarvey: Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Christyne McGarvey on for Ravi. I wanted to take a step back and ask about kind of the path to some of the longer-term targets that you set out at your previous Investor Day particularly just on some of the macro assumptions that you think you'll need to get there. You've seen definitely muted consumer spending in the last 18 months, but not a collapse. So how much of an uptick in consumer spending do you need to get there or maybe said another way, kind of how much do you feel is in -- directly in your control?\nCarol Tome: So, as we look at the small package volume in the United States, what we're seeing is basically a reversion to mean. So, we're at pre-pandemic levels. And I think our learning -- all of our learnings is that, if the pipeline spikes because of an event, things are going to revert back to the main. If you look at the growth rates projected for the small package market in the United States, it's low single-digits for the next couple of years. So we plan to grow not just at the market, but ahead of the market because of the investments that we're making with new products, new capabilities and actually new acquisitions, which we're very excited about. And maybe I'll just take a minute to talk about Happy Returns, which we just announced last night. Our returns business has been pretty growthy because of the explosion of e-commerce. It's grown 25% since 2020. And we like this business a lot. But we know we can offer a better experience for our retailers because it's expensive. Retailers estimate that between 20% and 30% of all online orders are returned, and it cost them on average, about $33 to process that return. So it's Happy Returns. We're going to offer consolidated returns for our customers, which will reduce their handling costs. Actually improve our delivery density. So it's a win-win-win. And so we're going to put the pedal to the metal in terms of growing the returns business because it's a very good business for us and one that our customers need a sale force. So I'm excited about that. The other acquisition that I'm excited about is in health care. Our health care business will be $10 billion this year against an addressable market that's over $100 billion. We're going to grow that market. It's got double-digit margins. We're going to grow it because we need to grow it. It's important for the world. It's important for humanity. And we are the best in the world access. So that doesn't require any consumer spending. That's just leading into a market share capture with the capabilities that we are investing in, be it cold chain capabilities and more.\nChristyne McGarvey: Really helpful. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. I'd like to drill down a little bit on the macro comments as they relate to domestic. I think it's pretty straightforward. What you're saying about Europe and Asia. But can you help put some understanding around your concern for the weaker consumer with student loans and what have you. It does sound like we're going to be in for a reasonable holiday season. Where are you seeing the weakness, whether it's a -- an industry segment or a consumer segment. What concerns you on e-commerce and the domestic consumer?\nCarol Tome: Well we've seen clearly a shift from goods to services and people through the pandemic started going back to work, taking vacations, eating out at restaurants, going to amusement park. They're spending their dollars differently. It's like source. It's not that the consumer is not healthy, they're spending their dollars different way. And what we're seeing with many of our retail customers. It's a real desire to bring people back into the stores and they should bring people back into the stores, because it's their largest investment. So you see retailers offering buy online pickup in-store, where they hadn't offered that before. So I can give you example after example of customers, not by name, obviously, but customers that are in our top 20 where they're seeing their same-store sales down year-on year, because their anniversary in that COVID peak, if you will, and they're seeing their online sales down even more. And part of that is because people are going back into stores -- part of that and shifting. So that's that comment that Brian made in his remarks about just some demand softening Is that, we do see that with some of our larger customers who didn't divert but their overall business and you can look at their guy, so I'm not talking about anything that's not public. You can look at our guidance, were they not only have reported declining sales, but they are guiding softer.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you for the clarification.\nCarol Tome: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go-ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Brian, you did talk about revenue quality initiatives. I know folks have brought up price quite a bit on this call, but can you talk about not just your pricing outlook. But maybe the mix impact from some of these initiatives you've had in the past on small and medium enterprises.\nBrian Newman: Yeah, SMBs, Brandon, are very attractive part of the business and we've continued to penetrate that market. So that's been favorable from a mix perspective. We are seeing customers trade-down though from air product to ground. And so we've seen that in the numbers. Air was down more than ground volume. So there's a bit of a headwind there from a customer mix perspective. So overall, we have a customer mix impact as well that's going on, we're gliding down with our largest customer. So there is a shift there. That tends to help from an RPP perspective.\nCarol Tome: No, it's interesting if you go back to 2019, our volumes by the same as in the third quarter as it was back in 2019. But our SMB mix has moved from 23% to 29%. And our net revenue per piece has moved from $9.99 to $12.54. So we've been laser-focused on improving the revenue quality in our business and we will continue to do that. Value is defined by what the customer is willing to pay for and we are improving our experience every day. A good example of that is delivery photo. We're now 92% of all of our residential drops are photographed which is creating a better experience for our recipients for our customers and for us candidly. We're leaning into simplifying the experience of how does that work with us and we'll talk to you about the widgets that we have with DAP or improvements that we've made in our claim process. You see our net promoter score now in the high 40s, so we believe that experience because it helps grow the revenue quality and we're going to continue to do that.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Brandon.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just two quick follow-ups actually. Can you talk about the pace of getting the share back, is you go into the fourth-quarter. Do you think, perhaps, you have the lower-hanging fruit easier ones to convert back, do you think that those came back sooner and maybe the pace from here just little bit harder. And then on the buybacks, you mentioned you're cutting your list your staffing the buyback for the quarter. You've got two acquisitions targeted. I just wanted to make sure I was clear in terms of what these are, if those were the Happy Returns and MNX or if there is potentially something else that was on the horizon.\nCarol Tome: We have nothing else planned, Brian, today. So we'll be buying MNX and Happy Returns this quarter, and it's about $1.3 billion in total that we'll be spending on those two companies. In terms of the pace of getting share. As I mentioned earlier is accelerating because of the fact that the peak is nearly on us. So people want to come into the network. Here's the truth though. It does take time to come back in. I get weekly updates Fernando and the team, from Kate and the team about how is the volume coming back in. And I see that, oh, we've gotten a handshake. We've got an agreement from a customer that's coming back in. And then I see it takes 30 days to get it back into on-car. And so now I'm like I want photos when it's on car because I want to make sure that's actually in the network. And that's what we're getting. We're having some fun with that actually because we're seeing it. picked up from our competitors. That's always done when you're picking up volume from your competitors. So it accelerates.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Steven, we have time for one more question. Okay, with no further questions. Thank you for your time and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now hang up.\nBrian Newman: Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I'll cover four areas. I'll start with the macro, followed by our third quarter results. Next, I'll cover cash and shareowner returns. Then, I'll provide detail around our updated guidance. The macroenvironment in the third quarter was challenging. The weakness we saw in the second quarter continued into the third quarter, especially in Asia and Europe. Real exports and industrial production moved lower due to falling demand, and global consumer conditions did not significantly change. In the US, we faced tough conditions due to several factors. To begin, the volume diversion we experienced in the second quarter continued into the third quarter, which led to more volume diversions than we anticipated. Next, some customers that diverted, waited until our Teamster contract was fully ratified in September, before returning volume to our network. And lastly, we incurred higher labor costs associated with new contract, and added headcount earlier than normal to ramp-up for peak, so that we can ensure we maintain our industry-leading service levels. Through the end of the quarter, we adjusted our integrated network, to support our customers' needs, managed cost, and stayed focused on bringing volume back into our network. Looking at our financial results for the quarter, consolidated revenue was $21.1 billion, down 12.8% from last year. Consolidated operating profit was $1.6 billion, down 48.7% compared to the same period last year. Consolidated operating margin was 7.7%. For the third quarter, diluted earnings per share was $1.57 down 47.5% from the same period last year. Now, let's look at our business segments. In US Domestic, we knew the third quarter would be a challenge, and it was, due to our labor negotiations, higher costs, and a dynamic economic backdrop. As we discussed on our last call, we ended the second quarter with an average daily volume in June, down 12.2%. As contract negotiations became later and louder, we saw more volume diversion than we anticipated. August represented the low watermark when average daily volume was down 15.2% year-over-year. Post ratification, we exited the third quarter half that way, and we're continuing to see our week-over-week volume levels improve, despite a challenging retail backdrop. In the US, in the third quarter, average daily volume was down 11.5%, and we estimate the impact of volume diversion reduced our volume by approximately 1.5 million packages per day. Moving to mix, in the third quarter, we saw lower volumes across all industry sectors, with the largest declines from retail and high-tech. B2C average daily volume declined 13.4% compared to last year, and B2B, average daily volume was down 9%. In the third quarter, B2B represented 44% of our volume, which was an increase of 120 basis points from a year ago. Also in the third quarter, we continued to see customers shift volumes out of the air, onto the ground. Total air average daily volume was down 15.8% year-over-year, with about half of the decline coming from our largest customer, as anticipated. Ground average daily volume was down 10.7%. In terms of customer mix, in the third quarter, SMBs, including platforms, made up 28.5% of our total US volume, an increase of 20 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, US Domestic generated revenue of $13.7 billion, down 11.1%. Despite lower volume, we remained disciplined on revenue quality. In the third quarter, revenue per piece increased 2%. Looking at the key drivers, the combination of strong base rates, and improved customer and product mix increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 410 basis points. Changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 190 basis points. The remaining 20 basis points of decline was driven by multiple factors including package characteristics. Turning to costs, total expense was down 5.1% in the third quarter. Compensation and benefits decreased the total expense growth rate by around 50 basis points. Total union wage rates were up 11.5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the contractual wage increase that went into effect on August 1st. Additionally, we began network preparations for peak. Offsetting the total increase in compensation and benefits, we leveraged our total service plan, and network planning tools, to reduce total hours in the third quarter by 11.4%. We reduced the expense growth rate for purchase transportation by around 190 basis points, primarily from lower volume levels, and our continued optimization efforts. Lower fuel costs contributed 170 basis points to the decrease in total expense growth rate. The net of all other expense items and allocations reduced the expense growth rate by 100 basis points. The US Domestic segment delivered $665 million in operating profit, down 60.6% compared to the third quarter of 2022, and operating margin was 4.9%. Moving to our International segment, macro conditions were uneven in the third quarter with some regions of the world were challenged than others. Continued falling demand pressured Asia, and in Europe, consumers continued to contend with high inflation, and tight financial conditions. In response, we adjusted headcount and block hours, in our global networks to match changes in geographic demand. In the quarter, international total average daily volume was down 6.6% year-over-year. Nearly three quarters of the decline came from lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 9.1%, driven primarily by declines in Europe. On the export side, average daily volume declined 4.1% on a year-over-year basis. Looking at Asia, export average daily volume was down 8%, and export volume on the China to US lane, which is our most profitable lane, was down 10.3% year-over-year. One bright spot was the Americas region, where export average daily volume grew 4.7%, led by Canada and Mexico, leveraging our cross-border ground service. In the third quarter, International revenue was $4.3 billion, which was down 11.1% from last year, due to the decline in volume and a 1.4% reduction in revenue per piece. The decline in revenue per piece was driven by several factors. Lower fuel surcharge revenue contributed 230 basis points to the revenue per piece growth rate decrease, a reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue contributed 200 basis points to the decline, partially offsetting the decline multiple factors increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 290 basis points, including strong base rates, and a weaker US dollar. Moving to costs, in the third quarter, total international costs was down $203 million, primarily driven by lower fuel expense. In response to lower demand, we adjusted our integrated network and cut costs, which included reducing international block hours by 13.9% compared to last year, and reducing headcount in operations and overhead functions by a total of 2,300 positions, and we did all of this while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers. Operating profit in the International segment was $675 million, down $329 million year-over-year, which included a $98 million reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue. Operating margin in the third quarter was 15.8%. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions, in the third quarter, revenue was $3.1 billion, down $854 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, let's start with forwarding. In international air freight, softer global demand, and lower volume, resulted in a decline in revenue and operating profit. On the ocean side, demand flipped positive, driven by the retail sector, and generated volume growth. However, excess market capacity pressured revenue and operating profit. In response to the dynamic forwarding market, we cut operating costs. Within forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit continued to face pressure from excess capacity in the market, which drove revenue and operating profit down. Logistics delivered revenue and operating profit growth. In the third quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $275 million, and an operating margin of 8.8%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $199 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $66 million, and our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 12.6%, which benefited from certain discrete items, including tax credits and global audit resolutions. Now, let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. Year-to-date, we generated $7.8 billion in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $4.9 billion. And so far this year, UPS has paid $4 billion in dividends, and we've completed $2.25 billion in share buybacks. Now, I'll share a few comments about our outlook. We expected 2023 to be a bumpy year, and it has been. We've navigated record-high inflation, rising interest rates, disruptions in China, a war in Eastern Europe, now a humanitarian crisis in Israel and Gaza, and the disruption around our US labor negotiations. Through all of this, we remained focused on controlling what we can control, and are continuing to adjust the network to match volume levels, and deliver industry-leading service to our customers. Since our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed, and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. As a result, we've lowered our full-year guidance, and have provided a range to reflect the uncertainty in the market. We now expect consolidated revenue to be between $91.3 billion and $92.3 billion, and consolidated operating margin to be between 10.8% and 11.3%. Let me walk you through our assumptions for the guidance range. In the US, we are winning back volume at a rapid pace, but we've also seen demand softness due to several factors, with many of our customers who did not divert. Additionally, while consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in the fourth quarter, and looking at estimates for holiday retail sales this year, increases range from over 4% to 12%. Moving to international, a further downturn in exports and lower consumer spending in some of the largest European markets, including Germany and the UK are negatively impacting volume. And exports on our most profitable trade lane, which is China to the US, are not improving at the pace we had expected. Finally in forwarding, air and ocean capacity has increased, which is putting additional downward pressure on market rates. In fact, in ocean, there was extreme overcapacity versus demand in the market, and the forwarding demand outlook in the fourth quarter remains weak. Turning to capital allocation for the full-year, capital expenditures are still expected to be about $5.3 billion. We are still planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023, subject to Board approval. We have repaid $1.6 billion in debt this year as planned, and expect to repay an additional EUR700 million of debt in the fourth quarter. We now expect $2.25 billion in share buybacks in 2023, which we have already completed. In the fourth quarter, we're redeploying cash, back into the business for growth initiatives, such as strategic acquisitions to drive shareowner value. And lastly, we expect the tax rate for the full-year to be approximately 22%. In closing, while navigating a very challenging macroenvironment, we remain focused on the job in hand. For the past five years, we've held the record as the industry-leader in service during peak. We intend to do it again this year. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines. Sure, happy to, Chris. Good morning. So, if you look at the bridge, I'll take the low end from -- so Q3, we put -- posted $665 million in operating profit. To get to the low end of the guide, it would require about $800 million in profit. The two biggest drivers of that are volume and revenue quality. The productivity that the teams are generating, Nando in the US, is offsetting the labor contract step-up because you realize we have three months in the third and fourth quarter, and we had two months of the new labor contract in the second. Your question on volume, as we think about volume and revenue quality, those two alone provide a majority of the 800 step up, but if you think about where we were in August, and where we are in October, the momentum is increasing. We had a low watermark as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, down 15% in terms of ADV volume in August. That translates to around 16 million pieces from an ADV perspective. That's actually, in October, we're seeing 19 million pieces, so we've seen that step-up. I went back, Chris, and looked at last year, and the August to October step-up, was 1.5 million pieces. This year, the August to October step-up is 2.7 million pieces, so from a glide path and a trajectory, we're seeing momentum, the absolute levels are coming up, and that's what led to the guide. That's right, Dave. So two big pieces of sort of forward momentum, Dave. One is the exit rate on volume. Carol just talked about the win-back, and also the pipeline of new business. So going into next year, getting back on level footing with a system that has higher ADV will help us certainly from a cost and margin perspective, the revenue per piece we announced a 5.9% GRI, so that will be coming in. We talked to you recently about the cost overhang of the contract, that goes from August-to-August, so I would tell you from a shape, certainly the first half of the year will be more challenged than the back half of the year. Back half of the year, we get into two to three-year glide path with lower inflation per year, and then, so pricing and productivity can help expand the margins. But those are the pluses and minuses as we look into '24. Obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail March '26 when we get together with you all for our next Investor Day. Let me come back to you, Dave, but we're certainly building momentum. Thanks, Dave. So thanks, Jordan, for the question. Look, we feel good about the revenue range. We've narrowed it to $1 billion, and I think the thing that's going to drive the upper end versus the lower end, really has to do with the retail backdrop. I mentioned in my script, there's sort of the broad range of the online retail sales for the holiday period. To the extent it's in the higher end of that, we'll have more volume, and more revenue, to the extent it comes in with some of the risks we're seeing is towards the lower end. Thanks, Jordan. Yeah, Tom. So, to frame it up for you, we were trying to get December back to flat versus prior year. I think the guide now implies from a low-single-digit to a mid-single-digit in the month of December, and that's pending some of the backdrop I just talked about in terms of the retail outlook. So, from a momentum perspective, I gave in August to an October number, but as Carol mentioned, we lost 1.5 million or we had diverted 1.5 million pieces. We've seen 40% of that, roughly 600,000 pieces already come back to the system. We're also pushing forward with new business that Carol referenced as well. Thanks. Yeah. On the first question, Ken, obviously, you've got volume and pricing. I was talking to with Allison about the volume component. We have announced a 6% to 7% peak season surcharge. So that's, obviously, flowing through from a revenue standpoint in the fourth quarter as well. I have a walk in front of me for the high end and the low end, so I can give it to either range, and I think it's retail backdrop uncertainty that drives the delta in volume, which drives the delta in profit. So, it's the same levers. It's the volume and the revenue quality, really driving the majority at a higher component, at the high end versus the $800 million I referenced at the lower end. So net-net, I think from a margin shape standpoint, we finished Q3 mid-single-digit in the US. Obviously, that's a very low watermark, driven by the volumes we saw in the quarter. We're looking in the fourth quarter to step back up into that high-single-digit, low-double-digit range. And so, getting back to the trajectory, and then from an international perspective, we were at 15.8% in the third quarter. I think Kate and the team have planned largely through controlling what we can control, whether it's block hours, whether it's headcount. Taking that and they've done a good job of demonstrating that Q1 was 18% margin International, Q2 was a 20%, so we're probably in the middle of that range for the fourth quarter. Hopefully that helps. Yeah. Yeah, SMBs, Brandon, are very attractive part of the business and we've continued to penetrate that market. So that's been favorable from a mix perspective. We are seeing customers trade-down though from air product to ground. And so we've seen that in the numbers. Air was down more than ground volume. So there's a bit of a headwind there from a customer mix perspective. So overall, we have a customer mix impact as well that's going on, we're gliding down with our largest customer. So there is a shift there. That tends to help from an RPP perspective. Thanks, Brandon. Steven, we have time for one more question. Okay, with no further questions. Thank you for your time and have a good day. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, PJ, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for their hard work and effort. Our US labor contract wasn't fully ratified until early September and I'm proud of our UPSers for staying focused during the entire labor negotiation and for providing industry-leading service to our customer. We expected conditions in the third quarter to be challenging and they were. The global macroenvironment remained weak, with some countries in recession, which pressured international and freight forwarding volume. And in the US, labor uncertainty negatively impacted volume from most of the quarter. From a demand perspective, August proved to be the most challenging, as some customers waited for the ratification of our Teamster contract, before returning volume to our network. Since contract ratification, we've been gaining volume momentum. We exited the last week of September with US average daily volume or ADV down 7.4%, a marked improvement from the rest of the quarter. Our sales people have produced record results and the combination of win-back and new customers. To-date, we've won back roughly 600,000 ADV of diverted volume and we are working to win back all diverted volume by the end of the year. And looking at our sales pipeline, we're pulling through new customers that value our superior on-time performance, and want to come to UPS, prior to the busy peak holiday season. Moving to our financial results, our third quarter performance while down considerably from last year, was in line with our expectations, and factored in both the timing of contract ratification, and higher labor costs, resulting from the new labor contract. Consolidated revenue in the third quarter was $21.1 billion, down 12.8% compared to last year. Operating profit was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 48.7% from last year, and consolidated operating margin was 7.7%. Brian will provide more details on our performance in a moment. With the third quarter behind us, we are laser-focused on restoring volume in our network, and executing our strategy to deliver shareowner value. So let me turn to our strategic update. Our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy is enabling us to stay focused on our core business, and invest to grow in the most attractive parts of the market like healthcare and with SMB. Starting with customer first, under our better and bolder framework, we recently announced two acquisitions that will further drive growth in healthcare logistics and in end-to-end returns solution. One of our strategic objectives is to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world and we are making bold moves to get us there. Last year's acquisition of Bomi, and our recently announced pending acquisition of MNX Global Logistics are two examples of bold moves in healthcare. MNX is an industry leader in time-critical and temperature-sensitive logistics, tailor-made for the complex needs of global healthcare. By combining MNX with UPS Express Critical, and our Global Integrated Network, we will enhance the speed and reliability of our healthcare portfolio. With MNX, UPS will be able to reach new healthcare markets like in Asia, and new customers like the radiopharmaceutical sector. To further support our healthcare strategy, this year, we've opened seven dedicated healthcare facilities in Europe and in the US. And the acquisition of Bomi, further strengthen our healthcare footprint in Europe and Latin America. Since 2020, we have more than doubled our healthcare distribution space globally. These efforts and more are keeping us on track to reach our $10 billion healthcare revenue target this year, and we're just getting started. Turning to returns, with the explosion of e-commerce demand, our returns business has been a key area of growth over the last several years. What we've seen over this time is an increasing desire on the part of both our customers and our recipient, for a frictionless, and simple end-to-end returns experience. We've been building out this experience. But to help us get there faster, we just entered into an agreement to acquire Happy Returns, a technology-focused company that enables frictionless, no-box, no-label return. By combining Happy Returns' easy digital experience, and established drop-off point, with UPS's small package network, and footprint of both to 5,200 UPS store locations, box-free, label-free returns will soon be available at more than 12,000 convenient locations in the US, but our plans for returns don't stop at convenience. For our enterprise retail customers, we plan to provide a consolidated return solution that will lower their costs, and improve their experience. And for UPS, Happy Returns expands our returns portfolio, with an innovative solution, that will generate profitable B2B volume, and help drive pickup and delivery density. For us, customer first isn't just about growth, it's about meeting customer needs. To that end, we are continuing to improve the delivery experience, with the expansion of UPS delivery photo. 92% of our residential stops globally include a photo that shows exactly where the package was delivered. Not only does delivery photo provide peace of mind to recipient, but we get fewer calls about missing packages. With delivery photo, UPS has seen a reduction in US delivery-related support requests of more than 15%. We're also harnessing our data to deliver more agile, and targeted products that meet our customers' needs. Our latest example is a new product we call hyperlocal, which leverages the footprint of our US facilities, to provide select customers with a fast next-day delivery option, within a metro area. Hyperlocal enables us to capture new profitable B2C and B2B volume, and was launched in October as a new service offering. Let me quickly touch on DAP, our digital access program. We are continuing to grow SMB volume with DAP. In the third quarter, we launched 10 new partners in time for peak. In the first nine months of this year, we generated $2.1 billion in DAP revenues, and we expect to deliver $3 billion in DAP revenue for the year. Let's turn to innovation driven. UPS has been a technology company since our founding, and we are adding transformative technology in our operations, that will increase efficiency, and improve the employee experience. Smart package, smart facility, our RFID solution, is one way we're driving efficiency, and I'm pleased that we are wrapping up our Phase 1 rollout in our US facility. The improvements we are seeing in our preload operations are even better than we expected, with nearly 200 of our buildings seeing this load rates in one and 2,500 packages are better. Deployment of Phase 2 is already underway, which equipped our packaged cars with RFID readers. Over time, this will allow us to virtually scan smart packages during pickup, and eliminate delivery scans during bulk delivery stops. Both of which will enhance customer visibility, and make our drivers more efficient. Another example of transformative technology is robotics. Specifically, starting a Supply Chain Solutions, we are implementing robotics unload technology inside our trailers to unload packages more efficiently. These robots navigate the inside of the trailer, and can unload multiple box types and sizes autonomously. Now, it's still early days with this technology, but we are seeing many opportunities to further expand the use of robotics across our networks. Turning to the fourth quarter, we are preparing for peak. Over the past five years, our service during peak has been better than our closest competitor by an average of 310 basis points. Service matters all the time, but especially at peak. So to prepare, we are collaborating with customers on volume projections, and the timing of their promotions. We will also leverage technology, like our network planning tools, to control how the volume comes in, utilize available capacity, and adjust the networks to operate as efficiently as possible. Regarding peak hiring, our people-led strategy enables greater flexibility to serve our customers during the holiday rush. For example, our experienced part-time employees have now become seasonal support drivers. This enables them to deliver packages using their own vehicles, before or after their regular shifts. In addition, we plan to hire over 100,000 seasonal employees to help process and deliver holiday volume. This year, we've made it even easier and faster to apply for a job, as we shorten the digital process to less than 20 minutes, and building out an online application to receiving a job offer. Regarding our financial outlook, we made changes based on what we're seeing in the market. We still expect to have healthy peak volume in the fourth quarter. So based on what appears to be slowing demand in all business segments, we are revising our guidance accordingly. Brian will share more detail in a moment. Back in January, I said that 2023 would be a year of resilience, and it has been. Our Founder Jim Casey said, determined people working together can do anything. During the year, we accelerated the deployment of smart package, smart facility, and made strategic acquisitions to grow in the best parts of the market. We delivered a labor agreement, that provides certainty for the next five years. We are operating with greater speed and agility, controlling what we can control, and we are staying on strategy. With that thank you for listening and now I'll turn the call over to Brian. So we're really pleased with how we're recapturing volume back in our business. We have recaptured over 600,000 pieces per day of the volume that was lost and I will say, 50% of that recapture is coming from our largest competitor. The recapture continues day by day, but it's not just about recapturing what we lost, it's about growing new business. You may recall, Allison, at the end of the second quarter, we said we had about a $7 billion pipeline of new business. Today, we've won about 25% of that pipeline. Now, that $7 billion is an annualized number. So, all those packages and volume haven't come into the network yet, it will come in over the next year. So, I couldn't be more pleased with how our sales team is performing, and winning new accounts, and winning back volume that deferred. There's no material costs associated with the recapture. Customers are coming back because of our superior service. Yes. Let's finish of the year, Dave, and then, we'll give you some color about 2024. Maybe one other comment, if I could, Brian, on the volume range. We know which of our customers peak during peak. There are about a 117 customers in the US that make up about 86% of our peak volume. We're sitting down with each of those customers, understanding what their plans are, as we work on our operating plans to make sure we deliver superior service, having that insight, if you will, gives us a lot of confidence in the US volume numbers that Brian shared with you. Actually, it's accelerating. Customers want to come back into our network before peak because of our superior service that we've exhibited over the past five years. I think Allison's question was, are there costs associated with winning back volume. And as I responded, not meaningful. Ken, from time to time, we have found customers who diverted, and they entered into longer-term contracts, and we might help them to exit those longer-term contracts, but it's not a meaningful discount. It's just we might help them. It's nothing measurable. Well, maybe just an observation on the US margin in the third quarter. Recall that we had $500 million of expense related to our Teamster contract in the third quarter. If we back that out, the US margin would have been 8.5%. 8.5% on volume down a 11% is not a bad margin. So, we've got a bit of pressure on the margin that we shared with you because of our new contract. The contract is front-end loaded. We're bearing the pain of that front-end load. For a five-year contract that's very attractive. The compounded annual growth rate on the five years is 3.3%. So once we get through this first front-end load with 46% of the cost in the first year, once we get through that, the margin is going to grow. It's going to grow in a big way. So hopefully, that's helpful. No again -- absolutely fair question, Amit. Let us finish this year. Then, we will give you guidance for 2024, and we can break it down by quarter, if that's going to be helpful. Yep. So, as we look at the small package volume in the United States, what we're seeing is basically a reversion to mean. So, we're at pre-pandemic levels. And I think our learning -- all of our learnings is that, if the pipeline spikes because of an event, things are going to revert back to the main. If you look at the growth rates projected for the small package market in the United States, it's low single-digits for the next couple of years. So we plan to grow not just at the market, but ahead of the market because of the investments that we're making with new products, new capabilities and actually new acquisitions, which we're very excited about. And maybe I'll just take a minute to talk about Happy Returns, which we just announced last night. Our returns business has been pretty growthy because of the explosion of e-commerce. It's grown 25% since 2020. And we like this business a lot. But we know we can offer a better experience for our retailers because it's expensive. Retailers estimate that between 20% and 30% of all online orders are returned, and it cost them on average, about $33 to process that return. So it's Happy Returns. We're going to offer consolidated returns for our customers, which will reduce their handling costs. Actually improve our delivery density. So it's a win-win-win. And so we're going to put the pedal to the metal in terms of growing the returns business because it's a very good business for us and one that our customers need a sale force. So I'm excited about that. The other acquisition that I'm excited about is in health care. Our health care business will be $10 billion this year against an addressable market that's over $100 billion. We're going to grow that market. It's got double-digit margins. We're going to grow it because we need to grow it. It's important for the world. It's important for humanity. And we are the best in the world access. So that doesn't require any consumer spending. That's just leading into a market share capture with the capabilities that we are investing in, be it cold chain capabilities and more. Yeah. Well we've seen clearly a shift from goods to services and people through the pandemic started going back to work, taking vacations, eating out at restaurants, going to amusement park. They're spending their dollars differently. It's like source. It's not that the consumer is not healthy, they're spending their dollars different way. And what we're seeing with many of our retail customers. It's a real desire to bring people back into the stores and they should bring people back into the stores, because it's their largest investment. So you see retailers offering buy online pickup in-store, where they hadn't offered that before. So I can give you example after example of customers, not by name, obviously, but customers that are in our top 20 where they're seeing their same-store sales down year-on year, because their anniversary in that COVID peak, if you will, and they're seeing their online sales down even more. And part of that is because people are going back into stores -- part of that and shifting. So that's that comment that Brian made in his remarks about just some demand softening Is that, we do see that with some of our larger customers who didn't divert but their overall business and you can look at their guy, so I'm not talking about anything that's not public. You can look at our guidance, were they not only have reported declining sales, but they are guiding softer. Yeah. No, it's interesting if you go back to 2019, our volumes by the same as in the third quarter as it was back in 2019. But our SMB mix has moved from 23% to 29%. And our net revenue per piece has moved from $9.99 to $12.54. So we've been laser-focused on improving the revenue quality in our business and we will continue to do that. Value is defined by what the customer is willing to pay for and we are improving our experience every day. A good example of that is delivery photo. We're now 92% of all of our residential drops are photographed which is creating a better experience for our recipients for our customers and for us candidly. We're leaning into simplifying the experience of how does that work with us and we'll talk to you about the widgets that we have with DAP or improvements that we've made in our claim process. You see our net promoter score now in the high 40s, so we believe that experience because it helps grow the revenue quality and we're going to continue to do that. We have nothing else planned, Brian, today. So we'll be buying MNX and Happy Returns this quarter, and it's about $1.3 billion in total that we'll be spending on those two companies. In terms of the pace of getting share. As I mentioned earlier is accelerating because of the fact that the peak is nearly on us. So people want to come into the network. Here's the truth though. It does take time to come back in. I get weekly updates Fernando and the team, from Kate and the team about how is the volume coming back in. And I see that, oh, we've gotten a handshake. We've got an agreement from a customer that's coming back in. And then I see it takes 30 days to get it back into on-car. And so now I'm like I want photos when it's on car because I want to make sure that's actually in the network. And that's what we're getting. We're having some fun with that actually because we're seeing it. picked up from our competitors. That's always done when you're picking up volume from your competitors. So it accelerates."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Stephen, and I will be your facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nKen Cook: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2022 Form 10-K and other reports we filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results. For the second quarter of 2023, GAAP results include after-tax transformation and other charges of $106 million or $0.12 per diluted share. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website, along with the webcast of today's call. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions]. And now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you, Ken, and good morning. Let me begin by commenting on our agreement with the Teamsters. We believe this contract is a win-win-win. Together, we reached agreements on the issues that were important to Teamster leadership, to our employees and to UPS. We have the best people, and our new contract continues to reward our employees with the best pay and benefits in our industry. I'll share some highlights of the new contract in a moment. The second quarter was challenging, and I'd like to recognize the more than 500,000 UPSers around the world for their hard work and effort and for doing what they do better than anyone, and that's to deliver industry-leading service. I'd also like to give a special shout-out to our sales people for their dedication to our customers. And most importantly, I want to thank our customers for putting their trust and their business with us during our labor negotiations. And for those customers who divert it, we look forward to bringing you back to our network. Moving to our second quarter results. We expected negotiations with the Teamsters to be late and loud, and they were. As the noise level increased throughout the second quarter, we experienced more volume diversion than we anticipated. Now in pace with volume declines, some companies might go off strategy or chase unprofitable business, but that is not today's UPS. Today's UPS is focused on the long-term. During the quarter, we stayed on strategy and continued to invest in the business. We also maintained our pricing discipline. Further, the investments we've made in our automated facilities and technology, like network planning tools or NPT, have enabled greater agility than ever before. As volume levels declined, we demonstrated that agility by quickly adjusting our integrated network and maintaining high levels of productivity. Looking at our second quarter results versus last year, consolidated revenue declined 10.9% to $22.1 billion, under our expectations due to lower volume. But by controlling what we could control, we quickly took cost out of the network and delivered $2.9 billion of operating profit, in line with our expectations. Consolidated operating margin was 13.2%, which exceeded our expectations. Over the past three years, we've executed several initiatives in support of our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy. Let me highlight some recent accomplishments. Starting with customer first. During the labor negotiation, communication and transparency with customers was a top priority. During the quarter, over 500 UPS executives had regular contact with many, many customers. Our approach with these customers was to keep volume from diverting or if it diverted, win it back after the labor negotiation was settled. This approach brought us closer to our customers, and we've gained an even better understanding of their end-to-end supply chain, which will allow us to better serve them. We are now laser focused on executing our win-back initiatives and pulling through the more than $7 billion of opportunity in our sales pipeline. To do so, we will leverage our superior service and capability and the investments we've made in the digital customer experience. We'll all win back and new volume won't happen immediately, we are already seeing some volume return. On the digital front, our digital access program, or DAP, continues to grow. We've introduced new plug-and-play technology to make it even easier for e-commerce platforms to connect. In the second quarter, we added 7 new platforms to DAP, including 4 international platforms. In the first 6 months of this year, DAP generated more than $1.4 billion in revenue, putting us on our way to achieving our 2023 DAP revenue targets of around $3 billion. One of our strategic objectives is to become the number one complex health care logistics provider in the world. In the second quarter, we further expanded our European footprint by opening our first dedicated health care distribution facility in Ireland, giving us certified health care facilities in 35 countries. For the first 6 months of 2023, revenue from our health care portfolio reached $4.7 billion. For the full year, we expect to generate $10 billion in health care revenue. On the international small package front, we've been quickly expanding in India, which is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. In May of last year, we launched MOVIN, our asset-light domestic joint venture. And we recently expanded from 3 studies to 49 of the largest cities in India, now covering approximately 90% of the B2B market opportunity. Turning to People Led. We expect our new labor contract to be ratified in 2 weeks. Today, I'll just share some highlights, and we will provide more details after ratification. Let's start with weekend delivery. The new contract converts all 22.4 employees, who are our weekend delivery drivers, to regular full-time packaged car drivers. This gives us the flexibility we need to schedule delivery drivers Tuesday through Saturday and provides more work-life balance for our drivers. Further, we kept our Sunday delivery service by maintaining our SurePost product. Moving to working conditions. We will be improving the working conditions for all employees, including air conditioning in every new U.S. packaged car, starting in January 2024. We retained our ability to introduce new technology and the flexibility to use seasonal support during the peak holiday season. For our Teamster employees, this contract further strengthens the industry-leading pay and benefits they already enjoy. When you look at total compensation, by the end of the new contract, the average UPS full-time driver will make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits. And for all part-time union employees that are already working at UPS, by the end of this contract, they will be making at least $25.75 per hour while receiving full health care and pension benefits. In fact, our part-timers are among only 7% of all U.S. part-time workers in the private sector to enjoy these benefits. There's much, much more, but the last point I would like to highlight is the addition of a new paid holiday on Martin Luther King Junior Day, which will be a benefit for all U.S. employees. UPS is a long history of honoring Dr. King. And this additional paid holiday aligns with our value. All of this and more helps to make UPS the best place to work, which brings me to Innovation Driven. We run the most efficient integrated network in the world, powered by technology developed by UPS Engineer. In the quarter, we leveraged the agility of our network to match capacity with volume levels. Key to this agility was NPT, which is a set of technologies that use AI and machine learning to harness the value of our data to quickly make changes to low planning, scheduling and volume flows across the network. This technology is powerful. In fact, NPT can do in an afternoon what used to take a team of engineers months to do. By using NPT with our total service plan, we quickly match the network to volume levels. This resulted in a nearly 10% reduction in hours in the U.S., in line with the decline in volume. Additionally, NPT enabled us to further reduce semi-variable and fixed costs, which Brian will detail in a moment. Importantly, we did all of it while continuing to provide industry-leading service to our customers. There is no finish line when it comes to driving efficiency. For example, we've made great progress in rolling out smart package smart facility, our RFID initiative. At the end of the second quarter, almost 50% of our U.S. buildings were operating with this technology, and we expect to complete the U.S. deployment by the end of October. Quickly touching on our outlook. Now that labor negotiations are behind us, we've updated our guidance for the full year, primarily to reflect the volume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with the tentative agreement. Brian will share more detail in a moment. Let me close by talking about our future. Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven under our better and bolder framework is a winning strategy. We are winning in the best parts of the market and making our integrated network even more agile and efficient. And now for the People Led part of our strategy, our new contract establishes a platform for the future. Our company is stronger than ever, and we will move even faster to execute our strategy and continue delivering industry-leading service for our customers. I'm excited about what the future holds and what UPSers will accomplish together. I truly believe our best days are ahead. And with that, thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol, and good morning. Let me begin by echoing Carol's comments on how pleased we are no achieving a win-win-win labor agreement covering our more than 300,000 Teamster employees. This contract provides UPS a significant measure of certainty around labor, gives us operational flexibility to increase productivity and continue providing industry-leading service to our customers, and it will help us attract and retain the best employees in the industry. Now in my comments today, I'll cover 4 areas. I'll start with the macro, followed by our second quarter results. Next, I'll cover cash and shareholder returns. And lastly, I'll provide some comments on the second half of the year. In the second quarter, the overall macro conditions in the U.S. were in line with our expectations. Internationally, conditions were a little worse than we expected due to lower growth in both real exports and industrial production. Moving to our financial results. For the quarter, consolidated revenue was $22.1 billion, down 10.9% from last year. All 3 of our segments demonstrated agility and on a combined basis, drove down total expense by $2.1 billion in the second quarter year-over-year. This enabled us to deliver $2.9 billion in operating profit, which is the target we communicated to you last quarter and was a decrease of 18.4% compared to last year. Consolidated operating margin was 13.2%, a decline of 120 basis points compared to the same period last year, with all 3 segments achieving double-digit operating margins. For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was $2.54, down 22.8% from the same period last year. Now let's look at our business segments. In U.S. domestic, our disciplined approach to revenue quality partially offset the decrease in volume. As volume declined throughout the quarter, the team did an excellent job adjusting the network to match demand and drive out cost in real-time, all while maintaining industry-leading service levels. We expected volumes to decline in the second quarter, and it did, but we saw more volume diversion than anticipated as noise levels around our labor negotiations increased. We estimate the impact of volume diversion, combined with a slowdown in our sales pipeline pull-through, reduced volume in the second quarter by approximately 1.2 million packages per day. For the quarter, total average daily volume was down 9.9%, with June down 12.2%. Moving to mix. In the second quarter, we saw lower volumes across all industry sectors with the largest declines from retail and high tech. B2C average daily volume declined 11.5% compared to last year, and B2B average daily volume was down 7.7%. In the second quarter, B2B represented 43.7% of our volume, which was an increase of 100 basis points from a year ago. Also in the second quarter, we continued to see customers shift volumes out of the air onto the ground. Total air average daily volume was down 16.5% year-over-year, and ground average daily volume declined 8.6%. In terms of customer mix, in the second quarter, SMB average daily volumes declined less than volume from our enterprise customers. SMBs, including [Audio Gap] quarter. U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.4 billion, down 6.9%. Revenue per piece increased 3.3%, partially offsetting the decline in volume. The combination of strong base rates and improved customer mix increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 670 basis points. Changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 220 basis points. The remaining 120 basis point decline was due to multiple factors, including package characteristics and product mix. Turning to costs. The U.S. domestic team took out $889 million of expense year-over-year, which is the largest year-over-year cost reduction in our history. How did we do it? We leveraged our technology and the agility of our integrated network. Let me walk you through some of the levers we've pulled. We continued to execute our total service plan and reduced labor hours by nearly 10% to maintain our high levels of productivity. We leveraged the power of our network planning tools to optimize package flows and pull volume out of smaller nonautomated buildings and flow it into our larger automated facilities. While total volume was down 9.9%, we reduced the volume in our nonautomated building by 18%. This enabled us to close door and reduce operations headcount by 7% compared to last year. We reduced feeder movements by continuing to manage cube utilization in our trailers and brought on more UPS feeder drivers to support our fastest ground-ever lane. Looking at air volumes, we pulled more activity into WorldPort, our global AirHub in Louisville. This enabled us to move more volume via our next day flight and reduced second day flights. As a result, domestic block hours were lower by 6.5% versus last year, and we exited the second quarter with block hours down more than 10%. And lastly, we reduced management headcount by over 2,500 positions year-over-year. All of these actions helped us reduce U.S. domestic expense in the second quarter. Specifically, compensation and benefits was down $205 million year-over-year, despite a 6.5% increase in average union wage rates. Purchase transportation declined $207 million. Fuel expense was lower by $394 million and there were multiple factors that drove the remaining $83 million reduction in expense. Our results are proof of our agility. And in the second quarter, we took out a record amount of cost and held the cost per piece growth rate to 3.7%, while volume was down nearly 10%. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, in line with our expectations and down 9.4% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Operating margin was 11.7%, an increase of 180 basis points from the first quarter of this year. Moving to our International segment. Macro conditions remained sluggish in the second quarter. In Europe, persistent high inflation and tight financial conditions weighed on the consumer. And in Asia, the slow recovery we experienced in the first quarter stalled in the second quarter. In the quarter, International total average daily volume was down 6.6% year-over-year. About 2/3rd of the decline came from lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 8.7%, driven primarily by declines in Europe. On the export side, average daily volume declined 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Looking at Asia, export average daily volume was down 10.1%. Export volume on the China to U.S. lane was down 7% year-over-year, which was an improvement from the first quarter. In the second quarter, International revenue was $4.4 billion, which was down 13% from last year due to the decline in volume and a 5.7% reductions in revenue per piece. The decline in revenue per piece was primarily driven by a 570 basis point decrease from fuel surcharge revenue. Additionally, a reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue contributed 240 basis points to the decline. And there was an 80-basis point decline in revenue per piece due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Partially offsetting the decline, multiple factors increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 320 basis points, including strong base rate and favorable volume mix as export volume outperformed domestic volume. Moving to cost. In the second quarter, total international costs was down $356 million, primarily driven by lower fuel expense. We leveraged the agility of our integrated network to match capacity with demand and focused on controlling what we could control. These actions included flight reduction, which drove international block hours down 9.4% compared to last year, which includes a 15.5% block hour reduction on Asia-outbound Transcontinental flights. We also reduced headcount in operations and overhead functions by a total of more than 1,700 positions and we did all of this while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers. Operating profit in the International segment was $902 million, down $302 million year-over-year, which included a $123 million reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue. Operating margin in the second quarter was 20.4%, in line with our expectations. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. Our teams continued to navigate a challenging macro environment and executed our plans to reduce cost. In the second quarter, revenue was $3.2 billion, down $990 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers. Forwarding continued to be impacted by softer global demand, especially out of Asia, which drove market rate and volume lower. This resulted in a decline in revenue and operating profit. In response, we cut operating costs and are continuing to manage buy-sell spreads. Logistics delivered revenue and operating profit growth, including gains in our health care business. In the second quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $336 million and an operating margin of 10.4%. Walking through the rest of the income statement. We had $190 million of interest expense, our other pension income was $66 million, and our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23.5%. Now let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. Year-to-date, we generated $5.6 billion in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $3.8 billion, including our annual pension contribution of $1.2 billion that we made in the first quarter. Also this year, in the first quarter, we issued $2.5 billion in long-term debt. We've used $1.6 billion to pay off debt maturities in the second quarter, and we plan to use $900 million to pay off debt maturities in the second half of this year. And in the first half of 2023, UPS paid $2.7 billion in dividend. We also completed $1.5 billion in share buybacks at an average price of around $178 per share. Now I'll share a few comments about our outlook. As Carol mentioned, with the contract out for ratification, we have updated our consolidated revenue and adjusted operating margin guidance. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated revenues of about $93 billion and consolidated operating margin of around 11.8%. Now let me provide some color to help you update your models for the second half of the year. The U.S. Domestic segment is navigating a couple of unique factors in the back half of the year. First, in the second quarter and into July, we experienced more volume diversion than we anticipated because of this, our volume ramp-up for the second half of the year is starting from a lower base. We're already executing our initiatives to win back diverted volume and accelerate the pull-through from our sales pipeline while remaining disciplined on revenue quality. As a result of our efforts, by the end of the year, we expect our average daily volume level to be about even with December of last year. And overall, for the second half of 2023, we expect U.S. average daily volume to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year. And second, looking at expense in the U.S. Domestic segment. The union wage rate increases included in our new labor agreement for the first year are higher than we originally planned. We started to accrue for the terms of the tentative agreement on August 1, while the contract is out for ratification. Further, we will address wage compression that resulted from the new labor contract. These additional labor costs in the back half of the year will be partially offset by the network adjustments we made in the second quarter. Turning to the International segment. In the second half of the year, we expect the year-over-year volume growth rate to be similar to what we saw in the second quarter and revenue per piece growth to be flattish compared to the same period last year. And in Supply Chain Solutions, we expect second half revenue to be down by a high single-digit percentage year-over-year, with full year revenue approaching $14 billion. Moving to capital allocation. Our 2023 full year targets have not changed. We will continue to stay on strategy and invest in both efficiency and growth opportunities. Capital expenditures are still expected be about $5.3 billion, which includes completing the deployment of the first phase Smart Package Marketability in the U.S., continuing to expand our health care logistics footprint globally, expanding DAP internationally and investing in our Logistics-as-a-Service platform. We are still planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023, subject to Board approval. And for the full year, we still plan to buy back around $3 billion of our shares. With negotiations behind us, we are moving our business forward. For our people, we have a platform for the future that continues to reward our employees, which helps us to deliver industry-leading service to our customers and enables us to win that volume and drive revenue quality. We will control what we can control, which means continuing to manage costs as we scale up the network with volume. And we are staying on strategy and investing through this cycle, which will enable us to grow in the most attractive parts of the market, make our integrated network even more efficient and continue to reward our shareholders. Thank you, and operator, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: So Brian or Carol, I just want to understand kind of at a high level, what we should be expecting about the shape of inflation over the course of the contract. I know we're probably not going to get into too many of the details today, but I'd love to understand kind of from a CAGR perspective how you're set up for inflation over the life of this contract.\nCarol Tomé: Well, maybe I'll just start with some observations about the contract. And then Brian, you can provide details on the shape of the curve. As we got into the negotiations, David, it became very clear to me that we were negotiating on behalf of a number of stakeholders. We were negotiating on behalf of our people. We were negotiating on behalf of our customer. We were negotiating on behalf of our country. We were negotiating on behalf of our shareowners, and we were negotiating on behalf of UPS. And as I look at the handshake agreement that we achieved, I think we have a win-win-win for all stakeholders. I'll make that real for you. First, in terms of our people, they will continue to be paid the highest wage and benefits in the industry. We'll have better work-life balance, and the working conditions will also be improved as we'll be adding air conditioning among package cars starting January. For our customers, we avoided a work stoppage, and that would have been disruptive for them and for their customers. So I think that's a win. For our country, as you know, we move 6% of the U.S. GDP every day, and there was no place for this volume to go. So we avoided a disruption to the economy with this handshake agreement. For our shareowners, I would say we also have a win, because as I look at the economic package over the 5 years, the compounded annual growth rate of this economic package is 3.3%. So I say that's a win. And for UPS, we retain the flexibility we need to take care of our customers to provide seasonal health during the holidays to add technology to drive productivity and efficiency. So I think it's a win-win-win. And maybe, Brian, you can talk about the shape.\nBrian Newman: Yes, Carol. I'm going to host the call, Dave, and go a bit deeper on it, but it's sort of a barbell type effect. We've got a majority of the increase or not majority, over 40% in year one, and then years 2, 3, 4 quite reasonable from an inflation standpoint, and then with another step-up in year 5. But I'll go into more details on that when we host a call following the ratification.\nDavid Vernon: All right. And thanks for that. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Can you talk about what you need to do to win back some of the volume that you might have lost a contract uncertainty? I'm just wondering kind of how quickly you guys are expecting that to come back as we look into the -- what's baked into guidance.\nCarol Tomé: So it's all hands on deck to win back the volume that was diverted as a result of the labor negotiations. The first thing we did is that we stood up a control tower. This is the same kind of control tower that we use during peak to ensure that we can onboard this volume coming back without disruption. So that is up and running, and I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing in that regard. We have, of course, mitigated all the risk that was still remaining because we didn't know the outcome of the contract. So those high-risk customers are now shipping with us without any risk. From a marketing perspective, we're doing a number of things. The first thing we're doing is we're amplifying our service message because we do have the best service in the industry. We are also amplifying our SurePost advantage because this is a very attractive product that you're shipping low-weight packages. We are expanding our speed campaign because we are faster than our largest competitor in many, many markets. So we are amplifying our speed campaign. We are also expanding our weekend pickup to four markets. We are expanding our Saturday delivery by 890 postal codes. And we are launching new offerings inside Deal Manager, which is the tool that we use to win new small- and medium-sized businesses. There's a lot of effort underway to bring back this business that we lost and to win new business. Now I will tell you, it's not all going to happen at once. And so we understand that. We're working with our customers to bring it in as it can, but also as smoothly as we can for them as they've diverted. Looking at our volume in July, I will say that it was still down year-on-year, but not as much as the decline that we saw in June.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Maybe just a little bit, Carol, your thoughts into the peak season here. Maybe outside of the diversion, what was underlying in your thoughts here? And I think Brian mentioned still expecting negative all the way through the end of December. So maybe just a little bit of thoughts on the backdrop and the differences between the contract and what's going on economically.\nCarol Tomé: Yes. We'll still have a peak even though we're winning back those volume that was diverted over time, we'll still have a peak. We are collaborating with the top 100 in customers that represent 87% of our peak surge. So we're already starting to work with them on their operating plans for peak. Peak will be 21 days this year, the same as it was last year. We expect to see search in the 60% area this year. So it's still going to pick up. It's just from a different volume level. And we're well prepared to take -- to have another peak for us. It's just another day with more volume.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Brian, can you help us on the guidance change, just attribute that guidance change to volume diversion and then maybe the difference in terms of what you accrued on the wages. And I don't know if you provided this in your prepared remarks, but the monthly cadence of domestic volumes in June and July? And then lastly, Carol, we started the year at 12% margin expectations for domestic. We went down to 11%, now we're probably around 10%. Obviously, we're in a completely different world, and you have a new wage deal. Just provide your thoughts around 3.3% inflation, doesn't seem like an enormous hurdle. Has what's happened over the last 7 months changed kind of your view on what you think the return profile of this business is from an operating margin perspective in the domestic business? And when we can get back to like a positive trajectory in that? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Amit, thanks for the question. So from a guide perspective, we went from $97 billion to $93 billion in revenue. That's a $4 billion change. About $1 billion of that is from the softer volume Carol talked about in the second quarter, the higher diversion and about $3 billion is coming from the second half, as we think about volume and exiting the second quarter, down 12. You'll remember, in March and April, we were down 7, but June exited at minus 12. So if we take that minus 12 exit and you get to flat by the end of the year, that glide over the balance of the year is about -- it's down mid-single digit, down about 6%. From a profit standpoint, we dropped about $1.4 billion in profit to $11 billion or 11.8 margin. And most of that is coming from the domestic side, about $1 billion. That $1 billion, Amit, is split fairly evenly between wages and then also the lower volume I just referenced. There was a $400 million piece related to some inconsistent recovery in the euro inflation and interest rates. Germany's in a recession and a bit of Asia, but the vast majority is really split, half and half between wages and volume.\nCarol Tomé: And on the monthly cadence, we were down 12% in June. And down double-digit in July, but better than 12%.\nBrian Newman: Right. Right.\nCarol Tomé: On your question about margin. As we got into the negotiation with Teamsters, and this is true for any negotiation, there are some things that are very important. And one thing that was very important for Teamster leadership was to front-load some of the wage inflation. And we agreed to do that. So that does put a little pressure on the margin, as Brian pointed out. But that doesn't change the destination. It just changes the journey. We'll have a bit of pressure for the next year, through August of next year but then the inflation is very manageable. So I see a path back to 12% or higher margins in the U.S. because of all the investments that we're making to drive productivity. And a good proof point of that is what we did in the second quarter. So let me give you an example of just one of our initiatives, which is Smart Package, Smart Facility. We're now in over about 50% of the buildings in the United States. And 50% of those buildings have misload improvements from 1 in 400 to now 1 in 1,000. So as the buildings mature, they get better and more productive. As we think about the next phase of Smart Package, Smart Facility, we're moving from where the pre-loaders are scanning the package to where the car is going to scan package. So think about the productivity that we will enjoy then. So it doesn't change the destination, just the journey. We plan to have an investor conference in the spring of '24. We haven't landed on a date yet. But during that investor conference, we will lay out 3-year targets, so you can understand the journey to get to a 12%-or-higher margin in the U.S.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Carol, I just want to see if you can expand a little bit on the productivity efforts in Smart Package, how we should think about that? I know a lot of the investment was going into this year. You're talking about 900 facilities in by the end of October. Does that productivity start to accelerate from here? How should we think about that in terms of an offset to some of the wage inflation going forward? Thanks.\nCarol Tomé: Yes. So Smart Package, Smart Facility is just one of the levers in our productivity toolkit. Our network planning tools are powerful tools. They are powered by machine learning and AR. And if you think about it, we've just really completed the rollout of network planning tools in 2020. So every year, we get better because the tools get better. And think about what the tools were enabled us to do in the second quarter. When we saw the volume starting to slow down and actually divert, we were able through our tools to move volume away from unautomated hubs to automated hubs. And let me make that real for you. Last year, of the volume that was started by our hubs in the United States, about 53% went through an automated hub. This year, 57% of the volume went through an automated hub. So the tools are making us more effective. And then, we are introducing new technology inside of our buildings to make us more effective like automated label application and automated bagging and robotic small sort induction. And I can go on and on just kind of gig out on the tools, but it's a complement of tools that will help offset some of the wage pressure that we will see over the next year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Just wanted to see if disagreement now behind you and out for ratification. Has that changed any of your thinking about the timing and magnitude of GRI or pricing in general? Maybe, Brian, you can give more detail on RPP trends and mix in the U.S. And then, Carol, I wanted to see, you mentioned the SurePost Advantage. Can you just give some context around the USPS Ground Advantage product that just launched? And if you see that as a competitive threat now that it's been out there for a month or so, maybe some initial impressions of that service and what they're able to deliver and what it means for you. Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Yes, Brian. Thanks for the question. So look, every year, we evaluate the GRI to provide the right service at the right price for our customers. This year, we had guided to roughly a 500-basis point improvement in rate, and then we had expected about 200 basis point headwind in fuel to land at about 3%. So we're staying with that guide for this year. Brian, coming up here in the fall, we'll take a look at next year but the thing I would leave you with is we remain very disciplined on revenue management, and we'll continue to deliver value for the service we provide.\nCarol Tomé: And on our SurePost product, it compares very favorably to the [indiscernible] product, and we're going to continue to invest in that product. We like it a lot because of the delivery density associated with that product.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Carol, can you give us a little more color on the $7 billion sales pipeline? Kind of what kind of customers, what kind of end markets? I haven't heard you guys talk about a sales pipeline before too often. How is that kind of building up or kind of expect it to come through over time? And also, can you give us an update on your largest customer at least and kind of any changes to that relationship/volumes there over the course of the potential kind of union docks? Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: The sales pipeline is across all customer segments with a real focus in the commercial area, small and medium sized business, of course, health care and enterprise. You name it, we're going after it. Our sales team are really excited about selling the value that we have to offer, which is just the best service in the industry. We've also identified about 50 customers that are target customers for our new pricing architecture, which we call Architecture of Tomorrow. The new pricing architecture doesn't fit everybody, but it does fit some where based on their shipping needs, we could add pricing modifiers like day of week or Cube or ZIP code plus 4. So these pricing modifiers are very interesting to these targeted customers. And it won't be for everybody, but for some so we're going to lean into that in a big way. And as it relates to our largest customer, we have a very good relationship with our largest customer. And the businesses is operating as we would expect it to be. We're on a glide path, but not a glide out.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: I was wondering if you could comment on the 1.2 million packages per day. And how you think that comes back? I guess maybe the bigger question is does all of it come back and maybe how long does it take to get there? And then, Brian, you've given us some help in the past on sort of quarter-to-quarter margin dynamics as we think about getting towards that full year number. Is there anything we should be thinking about 3Q versus 4Q? I know volatility volumes will be a little bit better in the second part of the back half of the year, but just curious about how that cadence might look.\nCarol Tomé: Well, the 1.2 million packages per day is about 1 million of diverted volume. In other words, volume that we had that diverted elsewhere, and about $200 million of sales that we couldn't pull through because of concerns about the outcome of the labor negotiation. As Brian commented, we think by the end of the year, we will pull back everything that diverted. And I think we're going to win that extra 200,000 packages as well. It doesn't happen overnight, of course. It's already starting to flow back in. But we think by the end of the year, we'll win it all back.\nBrian Newman: And Chris, just with respect to the phasing, we're really focused on the second half and the full year guide, but I would say both top line and profitability. Q3 will be more challenged than Q4 due to the ADV growth rates and seasonality. And we've got some one-time costs in the third quarter. So I would just think of Q4 being a bit stronger than Q3.\nCarol Tomé: And you might ask, well, where does that volume go? And so we don't have great intelligence there, but we do have some market share intelligence through a tool that we use from Nielsen IQ. And what that would tell us it's not perfect. But what I would tell us is that 1/3 went to the Post Office, 1/3 went to FedEx and 1/3 went to the regionals. So that actually directs our activities as when we think about how to win that set volume back.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: I was wondering if you could give a little more color. I think I have a good sense on the domestic margin. It looks like there's a small piece in your profitability guide that's Supply Chain and International. So can you maybe talk about or unpack a little bit sort of the margins expectations for the full year on that? And if indeed, the U.S. margin should be at or around the 10% level, give or take. Thanks.\nBrian Newman: So from a margin perspective, Jordan, we'd expect International full year to be 19% to 20%, SCS should be at 10%. And as you think about the International business, the second half ADV, we're expecting to be down around 6.5%, RPP should be flattish. And really, it stems from some of the challenging macro situation. We've got weak real export growth. Germany is in recession. And then I would say, Europe and Asia ADV growth would bottom in Q3. Kate and the team are very focused on controlling what we can control, both on the air side and the headcount side to protect that. You saw she printed north of a 20% margin second quarter. SCS, I would expect full year revenue to approach $14 billion with a margin of about 10%. Forwarding rates and volume is stabilizing but down year-over-year. The team does a good job of managing the buy-sell spreads, as you saw. Obviously, expanding health care is a strategic priority for the company, and they're also executing the cost initiatives.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Kauffman: I just wanted to ask a little bit about the labor contract economics. I know you said, we'll have a call on this after ratification. But you noted a number of about 3.3% CAGR on the economic benefits. And just off the wage, we're calculating a little higher than that. So could you do your best to break down the components that help us get to that 3.3%?\nBrian Newman: Jeff, so 3.3% is an all-in number, so it includes wages and benefits of the two net together. Rather than go into a lot of detail on this call, I'm going to host a call shortly after ratification, and I'll take you through all the details at that point.\nCarol Tomé: We can go line by line at that.\nBrian Newman: I can go very deep then.\nCarol Tomé: But we want to respect the ratification products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: I wanted to see if you could help us to think about kind of volume versus price. It seems like both are important, but they're kind of related, right, if you go for more price to offset higher inflation, then it could be a headwind to what you do on volume. So how do you think about managing between those two? And then, I guess, that feeds into -- you've given us a lot to work with for 2023. But I think there's probably a lack of visibility for '24, whether should earnings be up in '24, obviously, we'd like to see that, but you've got through August, that headwind. So any broad commentary about how optimistic you might be on '24 in terms of domestic margin or earnings overall? Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Well, we run the business as a portfolio. So we want both. We want volume and we want price, but price doesn't necessarily mean price increases. It means moving into segments that value our end-to-end network and have different products. So we run it as a portfolio. We want both. That's the easy answer to that question.\nBrian Newman: And just on shaping the multiyear, Tom, as Carol mentioned, we'll come back in the spring and give you multiyear targets. Obviously, year one of the labor contract is the most expensive piece. That's in August-to-August. So 1H of '24 would expect to be under some pressure, the back half, less inflation. So we'll walk that for you in the early part of next year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel.\nBruce Chan: I appreciate the time here. Carol, the DAP rollout has been very successful this year. And I know it's early to start thinking about 2024. But as far as what the longer opportunity is, does growth start to slow for that channel now that you've kind of reached critical mass? Or do you still see quite a bit of opportunity there? And then, Brian, just to follow up broadly on e-commerce demand trends. Have we kind of turned the corner there, or are we still seeing a bit of an air pocket in terms of spending? Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: So thanks for your comments about DAP. We're very pleased with that product, and we see nothing but growth ahead. Global growth. We are just scratching the surface when we think about DAP outside of the United States. And we continue to add new partners here in the United States, now up to 27 partners. One thing we're doing to continue to grow DAP is to make it easier to onboard the platforms. So we are introducing widgets, which are basically pre-programmed applications that a DAP partner can put into its website and avoid the user interface and API onboarding that can slow things down. The first widget that we introduced is a locator widget. So our DAP partner can put the locator widget into its website, and then you push a button and up pops the closest UPS store to ship that package. So we're going to continue to make it easier to do business with as we continue to grow with this important part of our business.\nBruce Chan: And then, Brian, just on the e-commerce demand trends, any broad commentary there?\nBrian Newman: Yes. We're looking at ESMO improving in the back end of the year. So from a macro standpoint, I think the trends are stable to improving in the U.S., obviously, under some more pressure internationally.\nCarol Tomé: I mean clearly, what happened with e-commerce is the blew up during COVID-19. It blew up. And so now everything is kind of reverting back to where it was before COVID. We see that around the globe, which makes sense. And so this is a great place to think about growth from here on out.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: Brian, I believe you said you're expecting a bottoming in Europe and Asia in the third quarter. Just want to get a sense of cadence and your optimism that it will improve in fourth quarter, just what you're seeing in trajectory on both there. And then also, if you could put into perspective just the domestic cost per piece, how you see that trajectory on that metric specifically? Thanks.\nBrian Newman: So on the bottoming, we have thought we would have seen the bottom in Asia in Q2, which I would say, it didn't recover. It stalled. In Europe, we think the bottom will be more in Q3, but there could be an elongated period here. So we're not putting in a lot of recovery into the international business going forward. On the CPP basis, we're still calling from a U.S. basis, we would look from a full year standpoint to be about 11.24, which is about a 1.4% change from the 11.08 we had previously.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Stephanie Moore of Jefferies.\nStephanie Moore: I'd want to touch a little bit on kind of your automation efforts as part of your ongoing productivity tools. I think you said last year, it was 53% went through some form of an automated hub, this year at 57%. Do you have kind of a line of sight on where that can go over time?\nCarol Tomé: We do. We're going to come back in the spray at our Investor Conference and give you our sense of what we're calling network of the future. It's a very exciting opportunity for us to really automate this business. The good thing is we don't have to integrate our network because we're integrated. But we can do a better job of automating, and so we'll come back and give you all of that in the spring of next year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.\nEric Morgan: This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on SurePost. Maybe could you give us an update on how much you're redirecting in the network today? And maybe you could fill us and if this was the topic of the labor negotiations. And if you did need to start in-sourcing more kind of on an accelerated basis, what kind of potential cost implications or inefficiencies there could be? And maybe some offsets there as well. Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: Sure. So we were redirecting a little under 40% at the end of the second quarter. It was a point of the negotiations. We'd agreed to redirect 50%. No problem at all with that. No concern about cost because the delivery density with SurePost is really, really good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: So I just had a couple of quick ones. So Brian, I think you said the labor deal is $500 million headwind in the back half relative to what you accrued for estimated in the prior guidance. I wasn't sure if that was a gross number, or there was some productivity against that. And then, Carol, I wanted to ask about M&A, because it doesn't get enough attention. But I think you guys have done some interesting strategic acquisitions from Delivery Solutions. You also took a stake or a board seat on CommerceHub. These are small, but I view kind of as important deals kind of long-term view. Can you just talk about what they give you? And is there more in the pipeline? Because you're generating oodles of cash flow and wondering if there's an opportunity to tack on more deals even on the health care vertical, which is such a big vertical for you guys. If you can just expand on that. Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Hi, Amit. The barbell shape of the contract, the $500 million is a gross number. We had assumed originally about $500 million, so it's actually 2x, what we thought.\nCarol Tomé: And on the acquisitions that we've made, we couldn't be happier because they are giving us enabling capabilities from a Delivery Solution greeting product from us [indiscernible], which is creating cold chain logistics for us in parts of the world that we didn't have that. So I couldn't be happier. And I don't want to miss out any of the companies that we've acquired. So we're pleased with Rhodium, what it's providing for us as well. They're enabling capabilities. And as we look ahead, expect us to continue to acquire enabling capabilities, particularly in those areas that we really want to own. Health care logistics would certainly be one of those. Technology investments that give us platforms to accelerate the digital experience for our customers, absolutely expect us to lean into that space. And we'll be giving you updates as we go.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Jon Chapell of Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: I just want to tie together a couple of things from before. As you think about regaining that 1 million packages that was diverted and you think about your pricing path going forward, do you have to lead with price in the next 6 months to win the diverted traffic and then think about pricing from a new starting point in 2024? Or do you think it's strictly service your relationships? And that package flow will come back to you without adjusting the way you think about the revenue management?\nCarol Tomé: We don't think we have to lead with price. Our customers did what they thought they had to do to protect their customers, but they're very happy with us. So it's about operating plans, making sure they come back to us without disruption to their business. That doesn't happen overnight. It's going to take a while, but we can bring that business back because of what we provide to them.\nKen Cook: All right. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you soon, and that concludes our call.",

            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol, and good morning. Let me begin by echoing Carol's comments on how pleased we are no achieving a win-win-win labor agreement covering our more than 300,000 Teamster employees. This contract provides UPS a significant measure of certainty around labor, gives us operational flexibility to increase productivity and continue providing industry-leading service to our customers, and it will help us attract and retain the best employees in the industry. Now in my comments today, I'll cover 4 areas. I'll start with the macro, followed by our second quarter results. Next, I'll cover cash and shareholder returns. And lastly, I'll provide some comments on the second half of the year. In the second quarter, the overall macro conditions in the U.S. were in line with our expectations. Internationally, conditions were a little worse than we expected due to lower growth in both real exports and industrial production. Moving to our financial results. For the quarter, consolidated revenue was $22.1 billion, down 10.9% from last year. All 3 of our segments demonstrated agility and on a combined basis, drove down total expense by $2.1 billion in the second quarter year-over-year. This enabled us to deliver $2.9 billion in operating profit, which is the target we communicated to you last quarter and was a decrease of 18.4% compared to last year. Consolidated operating margin was 13.2%, a decline of 120 basis points compared to the same period last year, with all 3 segments achieving double-digit operating margins. For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was $2.54, down 22.8% from the same period last year. Now let's look at our business segments. In U.S. domestic, our disciplined approach to revenue quality partially offset the decrease in volume. As volume declined throughout the quarter, the team did an excellent job adjusting the network to match demand and drive out cost in real-time, all while maintaining industry-leading service levels. We expected volumes to decline in the second quarter, and it did, but we saw more volume diversion than anticipated as noise levels around our labor negotiations increased. We estimate the impact of volume diversion, combined with a slowdown in our sales pipeline pull-through, reduced volume in the second quarter by approximately 1.2 million packages per day. For the quarter, total average daily volume was down 9.9%, with June down 12.2%. Moving to mix. In the second quarter, we saw lower volumes across all industry sectors with the largest declines from retail and high tech. B2C average daily volume declined 11.5% compared to last year, and B2B average daily volume was down 7.7%. In the second quarter, B2B represented 43.7% of our volume, which was an increase of 100 basis points from a year ago. Also in the second quarter, we continued to see customers shift volumes out of the air onto the ground. Total air average daily volume was down 16.5% year-over-year, and ground average daily volume declined 8.6%. In terms of customer mix, in the second quarter, SMB average daily volumes declined less than volume from our enterprise customers. SMBs, including [Audio Gap] quarter. U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.4 billion, down 6.9%. Revenue per piece increased 3.3%, partially offsetting the decline in volume. The combination of strong base rates and improved customer mix increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 670 basis points. Changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 220 basis points. The remaining 120 basis point decline was due to multiple factors, including package characteristics and product mix. Turning to costs. The U.S. domestic team took out $889 million of expense year-over-year, which is the largest year-over-year cost reduction in our history. How did we do it? We leveraged our technology and the agility of our integrated network. Let me walk you through some of the levers we've pulled. We continued to execute our total service plan and reduced labor hours by nearly 10% to maintain our high levels of productivity. We leveraged the power of our network planning tools to optimize package flows and pull volume out of smaller nonautomated buildings and flow it into our larger automated facilities. While total volume was down 9.9%, we reduced the volume in our nonautomated building by 18%. This enabled us to close door and reduce operations headcount by 7% compared to last year. We reduced feeder movements by continuing to manage cube utilization in our trailers and brought on more UPS feeder drivers to support our fastest ground-ever lane. Looking at air volumes, we pulled more activity into WorldPort, our global AirHub in Louisville. This enabled us to move more volume via our next day flight and reduced second day flights. As a result, domestic block hours were lower by 6.5% versus last year, and we exited the second quarter with block hours down more than 10%. And lastly, we reduced management headcount by over 2,500 positions year-over-year. All of these actions helped us reduce U.S. domestic expense in the second quarter. Specifically, compensation and benefits was down $205 million year-over-year, despite a 6.5% increase in average union wage rates. Purchase transportation declined $207 million. Fuel expense was lower by $394 million and there were multiple factors that drove the remaining $83 million reduction in expense. Our results are proof of our agility. And in the second quarter, we took out a record amount of cost and held the cost per piece growth rate to 3.7%, while volume was down nearly 10%. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, in line with our expectations and down 9.4% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Operating margin was 11.7%, an increase of 180 basis points from the first quarter of this year. Moving to our International segment. Macro conditions remained sluggish in the second quarter. In Europe, persistent high inflation and tight financial conditions weighed on the consumer. And in Asia, the slow recovery we experienced in the first quarter stalled in the second quarter. In the quarter, International total average daily volume was down 6.6% year-over-year. About 2/3rd of the decline came from lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 8.7%, driven primarily by declines in Europe. On the export side, average daily volume declined 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Looking at Asia, export average daily volume was down 10.1%. Export volume on the China to U.S. lane was down 7% year-over-year, which was an improvement from the first quarter. In the second quarter, International revenue was $4.4 billion, which was down 13% from last year due to the decline in volume and a 5.7% reductions in revenue per piece. The decline in revenue per piece was primarily driven by a 570 basis point decrease from fuel surcharge revenue. Additionally, a reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue contributed 240 basis points to the decline. And there was an 80-basis point decline in revenue per piece due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Partially offsetting the decline, multiple factors increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 320 basis points, including strong base rate and favorable volume mix as export volume outperformed domestic volume. Moving to cost. In the second quarter, total international costs was down $356 million, primarily driven by lower fuel expense. We leveraged the agility of our integrated network to match capacity with demand and focused on controlling what we could control. These actions included flight reduction, which drove international block hours down 9.4% compared to last year, which includes a 15.5% block hour reduction on Asia-outbound Transcontinental flights. We also reduced headcount in operations and overhead functions by a total of more than 1,700 positions and we did all of this while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers. Operating profit in the International segment was $902 million, down $302 million year-over-year, which included a $123 million reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue. Operating margin in the second quarter was 20.4%, in line with our expectations. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. Our teams continued to navigate a challenging macro environment and executed our plans to reduce cost. In the second quarter, revenue was $3.2 billion, down $990 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers. Forwarding continued to be impacted by softer global demand, especially out of Asia, which drove market rate and volume lower. This resulted in a decline in revenue and operating profit. In response, we cut operating costs and are continuing to manage buy-sell spreads. Logistics delivered revenue and operating profit growth, including gains in our health care business. In the second quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $336 million and an operating margin of 10.4%. Walking through the rest of the income statement. We had $190 million of interest expense, our other pension income was $66 million, and our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23.5%. Now let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. Year-to-date, we generated $5.6 billion in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $3.8 billion, including our annual pension contribution of $1.2 billion that we made in the first quarter. Also this year, in the first quarter, we issued $2.5 billion in long-term debt. We've used $1.6 billion to pay off debt maturities in the second quarter, and we plan to use $900 million to pay off debt maturities in the second half of this year. And in the first half of 2023, UPS paid $2.7 billion in dividend. We also completed $1.5 billion in share buybacks at an average price of around $178 per share. Now I'll share a few comments about our outlook. As Carol mentioned, with the contract out for ratification, we have updated our consolidated revenue and adjusted operating margin guidance. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated revenues of about $93 billion and consolidated operating margin of around 11.8%. Now let me provide some color to help you update your models for the second half of the year. The U.S. Domestic segment is navigating a couple of unique factors in the back half of the year. First, in the second quarter and into July, we experienced more volume diversion than we anticipated because of this, our volume ramp-up for the second half of the year is starting from a lower base. We're already executing our initiatives to win back diverted volume and accelerate the pull-through from our sales pipeline while remaining disciplined on revenue quality. As a result of our efforts, by the end of the year, we expect our average daily volume level to be about even with December of last year. And overall, for the second half of 2023, we expect U.S. average daily volume to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year. And second, looking at expense in the U.S. Domestic segment. The union wage rate increases included in our new labor agreement for the first year are higher than we originally planned. We started to accrue for the terms of the tentative agreement on August 1, while the contract is out for ratification. Further, we will address wage compression that resulted from the new labor contract. These additional labor costs in the back half of the year will be partially offset by the network adjustments we made in the second quarter. Turning to the International segment. In the second half of the year, we expect the year-over-year volume growth rate to be similar to what we saw in the second quarter and revenue per piece growth to be flattish compared to the same period last year. And in Supply Chain Solutions, we expect second half revenue to be down by a high single-digit percentage year-over-year, with full year revenue approaching $14 billion. Moving to capital allocation. Our 2023 full year targets have not changed. We will continue to stay on strategy and invest in both efficiency and growth opportunities. Capital expenditures are still expected be about $5.3 billion, which includes completing the deployment of the first phase Smart Package Marketability in the U.S., continuing to expand our health care logistics footprint globally, expanding DAP internationally and investing in our Logistics-as-a-Service platform. We are still planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023, subject to Board approval. And for the full year, we still plan to buy back around $3 billion of our shares. With negotiations behind us, we are moving our business forward. For our people, we have a platform for the future that continues to reward our employees, which helps us to deliver industry-leading service to our customers and enables us to win that volume and drive revenue quality. We will control what we can control, which means continuing to manage costs as we scale up the network with volume. And we are staying on strategy and investing through this cycle, which will enable us to grow in the most attractive parts of the market, make our integrated network even more efficient and continue to reward our shareholders. Thank you, and operator, please open the line. Yes, Carol. I'm going to host the call, Dave, and go a bit deeper on it, but it's sort of a barbell type effect. We've got a majority of the increase or not majority, over 40% in year one, and then years 2, 3, 4 quite reasonable from an inflation standpoint, and then with another step-up in year 5. But I'll go into more details on that when we host a call following the ratification. Amit, thanks for the question. So from a guide perspective, we went from $97 billion to $93 billion in revenue. That's a $4 billion change. About $1 billion of that is from the softer volume Carol talked about in the second quarter, the higher diversion and about $3 billion is coming from the second half, as we think about volume and exiting the second quarter, down 12. You'll remember, in March and April, we were down 7, but June exited at minus 12. So if we take that minus 12 exit and you get to flat by the end of the year, that glide over the balance of the year is about -- it's down mid-single digit, down about 6%. From a profit standpoint, we dropped about $1.4 billion in profit to $11 billion or 11.8 margin. And most of that is coming from the domestic side, about $1 billion. That $1 billion, Amit, is split fairly evenly between wages and then also the lower volume I just referenced. There was a $400 million piece related to some inconsistent recovery in the euro inflation and interest rates. Germany's in a recession and a bit of Asia, but the vast majority is really split, half and half between wages and volume. Right. Right. Yes, Brian. Thanks for the question. So look, every year, we evaluate the GRI to provide the right service at the right price for our customers. This year, we had guided to roughly a 500-basis point improvement in rate, and then we had expected about 200 basis point headwind in fuel to land at about 3%. So we're staying with that guide for this year. Brian, coming up here in the fall, we'll take a look at next year but the thing I would leave you with is we remain very disciplined on revenue management, and we'll continue to deliver value for the service we provide. And Chris, just with respect to the phasing, we're really focused on the second half and the full year guide, but I would say both top line and profitability. Q3 will be more challenged than Q4 due to the ADV growth rates and seasonality. And we've got some one-time costs in the third quarter. So I would just think of Q4 being a bit stronger than Q3. So from a margin perspective, Jordan, we'd expect International full year to be 19% to 20%, SCS should be at 10%. And as you think about the International business, the second half ADV, we're expecting to be down around 6.5%, RPP should be flattish. And really, it stems from some of the challenging macro situation. We've got weak real export growth. Germany is in recession. And then I would say, Europe and Asia ADV growth would bottom in Q3. Kate and the team are very focused on controlling what we can control, both on the air side and the headcount side to protect that. You saw she printed north of a 20% margin second quarter. SCS, I would expect full year revenue to approach $14 billion with a margin of about 10%. Forwarding rates and volume is stabilizing but down year-over-year. The team does a good job of managing the buy-sell spreads, as you saw. Obviously, expanding health care is a strategic priority for the company, and they're also executing the cost initiatives. Jeff, so 3.3% is an all-in number, so it includes wages and benefits of the two net together. Rather than go into a lot of detail on this call, I'm going to host a call shortly after ratification, and I'll take you through all the details at that point. I can go very deep then. And just on shaping the multiyear, Tom, as Carol mentioned, we'll come back in the spring and give you multiyear targets. Obviously, year one of the labor contract is the most expensive piece. That's in August-to-August. So 1H of '24 would expect to be under some pressure, the back half, less inflation. So we'll walk that for you in the early part of next year. Yes. We're looking at ESMO improving in the back end of the year. So from a macro standpoint, I think the trends are stable to improving in the U.S., obviously, under some more pressure internationally. So on the bottoming, we have thought we would have seen the bottom in Asia in Q2, which I would say, it didn't recover. It stalled. In Europe, we think the bottom will be more in Q3, but there could be an elongated period here. So we're not putting in a lot of recovery into the international business going forward. On the CPP basis, we're still calling from a U.S. basis, we would look from a full year standpoint to be about 11.24, which is about a 1.4% change from the 11.08 we had previously. Hi, Amit. The barbell shape of the contract, the $500 million is a gross number. We had assumed originally about $500 million, so it's actually 2x, what we thought."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Carol Tomé",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good morning. Let me begin by commenting on our agreement with the Teamsters. We believe this contract is a win-win-win. Together, we reached agreements on the issues that were important to Teamster leadership, to our employees and to UPS. We have the best people, and our new contract continues to reward our employees with the best pay and benefits in our industry. I'll share some highlights of the new contract in a moment. The second quarter was challenging, and I'd like to recognize the more than 500,000 UPSers around the world for their hard work and effort and for doing what they do better than anyone, and that's to deliver industry-leading service. I'd also like to give a special shout-out to our sales people for their dedication to our customers. And most importantly, I want to thank our customers for putting their trust and their business with us during our labor negotiations. And for those customers who divert it, we look forward to bringing you back to our network. Moving to our second quarter results. We expected negotiations with the Teamsters to be late and loud, and they were. As the noise level increased throughout the second quarter, we experienced more volume diversion than we anticipated. Now in pace with volume declines, some companies might go off strategy or chase unprofitable business, but that is not today's UPS. Today's UPS is focused on the long-term. During the quarter, we stayed on strategy and continued to invest in the business. We also maintained our pricing discipline. Further, the investments we've made in our automated facilities and technology, like network planning tools or NPT, have enabled greater agility than ever before. As volume levels declined, we demonstrated that agility by quickly adjusting our integrated network and maintaining high levels of productivity. Looking at our second quarter results versus last year, consolidated revenue declined 10.9% to $22.1 billion, under our expectations due to lower volume. But by controlling what we could control, we quickly took cost out of the network and delivered $2.9 billion of operating profit, in line with our expectations. Consolidated operating margin was 13.2%, which exceeded our expectations. Over the past three years, we've executed several initiatives in support of our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy. Let me highlight some recent accomplishments. Starting with customer first. During the labor negotiation, communication and transparency with customers was a top priority. During the quarter, over 500 UPS executives had regular contact with many, many customers. Our approach with these customers was to keep volume from diverting or if it diverted, win it back after the labor negotiation was settled. This approach brought us closer to our customers, and we've gained an even better understanding of their end-to-end supply chain, which will allow us to better serve them. We are now laser focused on executing our win-back initiatives and pulling through the more than $7 billion of opportunity in our sales pipeline. To do so, we will leverage our superior service and capability and the investments we've made in the digital customer experience. We'll all win back and new volume won't happen immediately, we are already seeing some volume return. On the digital front, our digital access program, or DAP, continues to grow. We've introduced new plug-and-play technology to make it even easier for e-commerce platforms to connect. In the second quarter, we added 7 new platforms to DAP, including 4 international platforms. In the first 6 months of this year, DAP generated more than $1.4 billion in revenue, putting us on our way to achieving our 2023 DAP revenue targets of around $3 billion. One of our strategic objectives is to become the number one complex health care logistics provider in the world. In the second quarter, we further expanded our European footprint by opening our first dedicated health care distribution facility in Ireland, giving us certified health care facilities in 35 countries. For the first 6 months of 2023, revenue from our health care portfolio reached $4.7 billion. For the full year, we expect to generate $10 billion in health care revenue. On the international small package front, we've been quickly expanding in India, which is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. In May of last year, we launched MOVIN, our asset-light domestic joint venture. And we recently expanded from 3 studies to 49 of the largest cities in India, now covering approximately 90% of the B2B market opportunity. Turning to People Led. We expect our new labor contract to be ratified in 2 weeks. Today, I'll just share some highlights, and we will provide more details after ratification. Let's start with weekend delivery. The new contract converts all 22.4 employees, who are our weekend delivery drivers, to regular full-time packaged car drivers. This gives us the flexibility we need to schedule delivery drivers Tuesday through Saturday and provides more work-life balance for our drivers. Further, we kept our Sunday delivery service by maintaining our SurePost product. Moving to working conditions. We will be improving the working conditions for all employees, including air conditioning in every new U.S. packaged car, starting in January 2024. We retained our ability to introduce new technology and the flexibility to use seasonal support during the peak holiday season. For our Teamster employees, this contract further strengthens the industry-leading pay and benefits they already enjoy. When you look at total compensation, by the end of the new contract, the average UPS full-time driver will make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits. And for all part-time union employees that are already working at UPS, by the end of this contract, they will be making at least $25.75 per hour while receiving full health care and pension benefits. In fact, our part-timers are among only 7% of all U.S. part-time workers in the private sector to enjoy these benefits. There's much, much more, but the last point I would like to highlight is the addition of a new paid holiday on Martin Luther King Junior Day, which will be a benefit for all U.S. employees. UPS is a long history of honoring Dr. King. And this additional paid holiday aligns with our value. All of this and more helps to make UPS the best place to work, which brings me to Innovation Driven. We run the most efficient integrated network in the world, powered by technology developed by UPS Engineer. In the quarter, we leveraged the agility of our network to match capacity with volume levels. Key to this agility was NPT, which is a set of technologies that use AI and machine learning to harness the value of our data to quickly make changes to low planning, scheduling and volume flows across the network. This technology is powerful. In fact, NPT can do in an afternoon what used to take a team of engineers months to do. By using NPT with our total service plan, we quickly match the network to volume levels. This resulted in a nearly 10% reduction in hours in the U.S., in line with the decline in volume. Additionally, NPT enabled us to further reduce semi-variable and fixed costs, which Brian will detail in a moment. Importantly, we did all of it while continuing to provide industry-leading service to our customers. There is no finish line when it comes to driving efficiency. For example, we've made great progress in rolling out smart package smart facility, our RFID initiative. At the end of the second quarter, almost 50% of our U.S. buildings were operating with this technology, and we expect to complete the U.S. deployment by the end of October. Quickly touching on our outlook. Now that labor negotiations are behind us, we've updated our guidance for the full year, primarily to reflect the volume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with the tentative agreement. Brian will share more detail in a moment. Let me close by talking about our future. Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven under our better and bolder framework is a winning strategy. We are winning in the best parts of the market and making our integrated network even more agile and efficient. And now for the People Led part of our strategy, our new contract establishes a platform for the future. Our company is stronger than ever, and we will move even faster to execute our strategy and continue delivering industry-leading service for our customers. I'm excited about what the future holds and what UPSers will accomplish together. I truly believe our best days are ahead. And with that, thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Well, maybe I'll just start with some observations about the contract. And then Brian, you can provide details on the shape of the curve. As we got into the negotiations, David, it became very clear to me that we were negotiating on behalf of a number of stakeholders. We were negotiating on behalf of our people. We were negotiating on behalf of our customer. We were negotiating on behalf of our country. We were negotiating on behalf of our shareowners, and we were negotiating on behalf of UPS. And as I look at the handshake agreement that we achieved, I think we have a win-win-win for all stakeholders. I'll make that real for you. First, in terms of our people, they will continue to be paid the highest wage and benefits in the industry. We'll have better work-life balance, and the working conditions will also be improved as we'll be adding air conditioning among package cars starting January. For our customers, we avoided a work stoppage, and that would have been disruptive for them and for their customers. So I think that's a win. For our country, as you know, we move 6% of the U.S. GDP every day, and there was no place for this volume to go. So we avoided a disruption to the economy with this handshake agreement. For our shareowners, I would say we also have a win, because as I look at the economic package over the 5 years, the compounded annual growth rate of this economic package is 3.3%. So I say that's a win. And for UPS, we retain the flexibility we need to take care of our customers to provide seasonal health during the holidays to add technology to drive productivity and efficiency. So I think it's a win-win-win. And maybe, Brian, you can talk about the shape. So it's all hands on deck to win back the volume that was diverted as a result of the labor negotiations. The first thing we did is that we stood up a control tower. This is the same kind of control tower that we use during peak to ensure that we can onboard this volume coming back without disruption. So that is up and running, and I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing in that regard. We have, of course, mitigated all the risk that was still remaining because we didn't know the outcome of the contract. So those high-risk customers are now shipping with us without any risk. From a marketing perspective, we're doing a number of things. The first thing we're doing is we're amplifying our service message because we do have the best service in the industry. We are also amplifying our SurePost advantage because this is a very attractive product that you're shipping low-weight packages. We are expanding our speed campaign because we are faster than our largest competitor in many, many markets. So we are amplifying our speed campaign. We are also expanding our weekend pickup to four markets. We are expanding our Saturday delivery by 890 postal codes. And we are launching new offerings inside Deal Manager, which is the tool that we use to win new small- and medium-sized businesses. There's a lot of effort underway to bring back this business that we lost and to win new business. Now I will tell you, it's not all going to happen at once. And so we understand that. We're working with our customers to bring it in as it can, but also as smoothly as we can for them as they've diverted. Looking at our volume in July, I will say that it was still down year-on-year, but not as much as the decline that we saw in June. Yes. We'll still have a peak even though we're winning back those volume that was diverted over time, we'll still have a peak. We are collaborating with the top 100 in customers that represent 87% of our peak surge. So we're already starting to work with them on their operating plans for peak. Peak will be 21 days this year, the same as it was last year. We expect to see search in the 60% area this year. So it's still going to pick up. It's just from a different volume level. And we're well prepared to take -- to have another peak for us. It's just another day with more volume. And on the monthly cadence, we were down 12% in June. And down double-digit in July, but better than 12%. On your question about margin. As we got into the negotiation with Teamsters, and this is true for any negotiation, there are some things that are very important. And one thing that was very important for Teamster leadership was to front-load some of the wage inflation. And we agreed to do that. So that does put a little pressure on the margin, as Brian pointed out. But that doesn't change the destination. It just changes the journey. We'll have a bit of pressure for the next year, through August of next year but then the inflation is very manageable. So I see a path back to 12% or higher margins in the U.S. because of all the investments that we're making to drive productivity. And a good proof point of that is what we did in the second quarter. So let me give you an example of just one of our initiatives, which is Smart Package, Smart Facility. We're now in over about 50% of the buildings in the United States. And 50% of those buildings have misload improvements from 1 in 400 to now 1 in 1,000. So as the buildings mature, they get better and more productive. As we think about the next phase of Smart Package, Smart Facility, we're moving from where the pre-loaders are scanning the package to where the car is going to scan package. So think about the productivity that we will enjoy then. So it doesn't change the destination, just the journey. We plan to have an investor conference in the spring of '24. We haven't landed on a date yet. But during that investor conference, we will lay out 3-year targets, so you can understand the journey to get to a 12%-or-higher margin in the U.S. Yes. So Smart Package, Smart Facility is just one of the levers in our productivity toolkit. Our network planning tools are powerful tools. They are powered by machine learning and AR. And if you think about it, we've just really completed the rollout of network planning tools in 2020. So every year, we get better because the tools get better. And think about what the tools were enabled us to do in the second quarter. When we saw the volume starting to slow down and actually divert, we were able through our tools to move volume away from unautomated hubs to automated hubs. And let me make that real for you. Last year, of the volume that was started by our hubs in the United States, about 53% went through an automated hub. This year, 57% of the volume went through an automated hub. So the tools are making us more effective. And then, we are introducing new technology inside of our buildings to make us more effective like automated label application and automated bagging and robotic small sort induction. And I can go on and on just kind of gig out on the tools, but it's a complement of tools that will help offset some of the wage pressure that we will see over the next year. And on our SurePost product, it compares very favorably to the [indiscernible] product, and we're going to continue to invest in that product. We like it a lot because of the delivery density associated with that product. The sales pipeline is across all customer segments with a real focus in the commercial area, small and medium sized business, of course, health care and enterprise. You name it, we're going after it. Our sales team are really excited about selling the value that we have to offer, which is just the best service in the industry. We've also identified about 50 customers that are target customers for our new pricing architecture, which we call Architecture of Tomorrow. The new pricing architecture doesn't fit everybody, but it does fit some where based on their shipping needs, we could add pricing modifiers like day of week or Cube or ZIP code plus 4. So these pricing modifiers are very interesting to these targeted customers. And it won't be for everybody, but for some so we're going to lean into that in a big way. And as it relates to our largest customer, we have a very good relationship with our largest customer. And the businesses is operating as we would expect it to be. We're on a glide path, but not a glide out. Well, the 1.2 million packages per day is about 1 million of diverted volume. In other words, volume that we had that diverted elsewhere, and about $200 million of sales that we couldn't pull through because of concerns about the outcome of the labor negotiation. As Brian commented, we think by the end of the year, we will pull back everything that diverted. And I think we're going to win that extra 200,000 packages as well. It doesn't happen overnight, of course. It's already starting to flow back in. But we think by the end of the year, we'll win it all back. And you might ask, well, where does that volume go? And so we don't have great intelligence there, but we do have some market share intelligence through a tool that we use from Nielsen IQ. And what that would tell us it's not perfect. But what I would tell us is that 1/3 went to the Post Office, 1/3 went to FedEx and 1/3 went to the regionals. So that actually directs our activities as when we think about how to win that set volume back. We can go line by line at that. But we want to respect the ratification products. Well, we run the business as a portfolio. So we want both. We want volume and we want price, but price doesn't necessarily mean price increases. It means moving into segments that value our end-to-end network and have different products. So we run it as a portfolio. We want both. That's the easy answer to that question. So thanks for your comments about DAP. We're very pleased with that product, and we see nothing but growth ahead. Global growth. We are just scratching the surface when we think about DAP outside of the United States. And we continue to add new partners here in the United States, now up to 27 partners. One thing we're doing to continue to grow DAP is to make it easier to onboard the platforms. So we are introducing widgets, which are basically pre-programmed applications that a DAP partner can put into its website and avoid the user interface and API onboarding that can slow things down. The first widget that we introduced is a locator widget. So our DAP partner can put the locator widget into its website, and then you push a button and up pops the closest UPS store to ship that package. So we're going to continue to make it easier to do business with as we continue to grow with this important part of our business. I mean clearly, what happened with e-commerce is the blew up during COVID-19. It blew up. And so now everything is kind of reverting back to where it was before COVID. We see that around the globe, which makes sense. And so this is a great place to think about growth from here on out. We do. We're going to come back in the spray at our Investor Conference and give you our sense of what we're calling network of the future. It's a very exciting opportunity for us to really automate this business. The good thing is we don't have to integrate our network because we're integrated. But we can do a better job of automating, and so we'll come back and give you all of that in the spring of next year. Sure. So we were redirecting a little under 40% at the end of the second quarter. It was a point of the negotiations. We'd agreed to redirect 50%. No problem at all with that. No concern about cost because the delivery density with SurePost is really, really good. And on the acquisitions that we've made, we couldn't be happier because they are giving us enabling capabilities from a Delivery Solution greeting product from us [indiscernible], which is creating cold chain logistics for us in parts of the world that we didn't have that. So I couldn't be happier. And I don't want to miss out any of the companies that we've acquired. So we're pleased with Rhodium, what it's providing for us as well. They're enabling capabilities. And as we look ahead, expect us to continue to acquire enabling capabilities, particularly in those areas that we really want to own. Health care logistics would certainly be one of those. Technology investments that give us platforms to accelerate the digital experience for our customers, absolutely expect us to lean into that space. And we'll be giving you updates as we go. We don't think we have to lead with price. Our customers did what they thought they had to do to protect their customers, but they're very happy with us. So it's about operating plans, making sure they come back to us without disruption to their business. That doesn't happen overnight. It's going to take a while, but we can bring that business back because of what we provide to them."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Steven and I will be your facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] It’s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to our host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nKen Cook: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS first quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we’ll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2022 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results. For the third quarter of 2023, GAAP results include after-tax transformation and other charges of $9 million or $0.01 per diluted share. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website along with the webcast of today’s call. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator instructions] Please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you, Ken, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for once again delivering industry-leading service to our customers. Service defines UPS. It is one of our values and I’m proud of our team who continue to make it a key priority. Another company value is safety. UPS drivers are among the safest in the industry and every year we invest millions of dollars in safe driving education and training. Our Circle of Honor program recognizes drivers who have achieved 25 years or more of accident-free driving. This year we inducted more than 1,200 UPS drivers into the Circle of Honor, bringing the total to more than 10,400 around the globe. Congratulations to these drivers on their achievement. Turning to our results. 2023 is proving to be an interesting year. In the U.S., relative to our base plan, volume was higher than we expected in January, close to our plan in February, and then moved significantly lower than our plan in March as retail sales contracted and we saw a shift in consumer spending. For example, food as a percentage of household budgets reached 9% in the first quarter compared to 7% a couple of years ago. U.S. discretionary sales are lagging grocery and consumable sales and disposable income is shifting away from goods to services. Outside of the U.S., export activity out of Asia remained weak, which negatively impacted revenue in both international and supply chain solutions. In response, we focused on controlling what we could control. We remained in disciplined on price. We increased penetration in the most attractive parts of the market. We managed the network with agility, we drove productivity and we stayed on strategy. Looking at our first quarter financial results versus last year, consolidated revenue was $22.9 billion, down 6%. Operating profit was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 22.8% and consolidated operating margin was 11.1%, a decline of 250 basis points. While revenue fell short of our base plan due to a relentless focus on productivity both operating profit and operating margin were in line with our base plan. Moving to our strategic update, through our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy, we are investing to improve the customer experience and drive efficiency. Starting with Customer First. Key investments here are driving growth in targeted customer segments like SMBs and healthcare. Looking at SMBs, we continue to invest in the international expansion of our Digital Access Program or DAP. We now have 16 countries producing DAP revenue. In the first quarter, total DAP revenue was up 51.5% compared to last year, and we are on track to generate around $3 billion in DAP revenue this year. Did you know that in the U.S. about one out of every four DAP packages enters our network through a UPS store with more than 5,100 locations in the U.S., UPS stores are strategic assets. In fact, 85% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a store, giving customers ultra convenient entry points to the UPS network, whether they’re in SMB shipping and item they’ve sold online or a customer returning an item they buy. Given the strategic importance of these stores, we are leaning into investments here to improve the customer experience. For example, the stores are rolling out self-service kiosks that enable customers to bypass the counter when they have shipments and returns, even returns with no box or no label. These kiosks make it easier for customers to get in and get out of the store. We’ve rolled out nearly 200 kiosks so far and we’ll deploy 1,000 by the end of October this year and we’re not stopping there. Another area of focus is improving the claims process, which used to be a hassle for both customers and franchisees. In March, the UPS store launched an online claims portal to all U.S. locations that’s designed specifically for the needs of the store shipper. With this portal, claims that used to take weeks for resolution are now resolved within an average of about two gains. One final comment on SMBs. In the first quarter, SMBs including platforms made up 29.6% of our total U.S. volume. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of increased SMB penetration and it’s the highest level we’ve seen in more than seven years. Turning to healthcare. In the first quarter of 2023, we expanded our global footprint by opening nearly 1 million square feet of dedicated healthcare space, including our first facility in Germany. This facility provides customers a broad range of temperature sensitive and handling solutions. Its location in the center of Germany connects our customer shipment, the fast growing European healthcare market. The facility is also closed to our European air hub in Cologne, enabling customers to leverage the speed and reach of our global network. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed the acquisition of Bomi Group and to date, revenue and cost synergy are running ahead of target. Further, we are continuing to invest in the global expansion of UPS Premier, which is now available in 45 countries with four more to be added this year. Our goal is to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world to help us get there who plan to open a total of seven dedicated healthcare facilities this year. In the first quarter, revenue from our healthcare portfolio reached $2.4 billion and we expect to generate over $10 billion in healthcare revenue in 2023. Turning to People Led, let me discuss the progress of our negotiations with the Teamsters. Negotiations on a new contract with the Teamsters are underway and good progress has been made on many of our local supplemental agreements. Together, we’ve set up five subcommittees at the national bargaining table to take on key areas of the contract, which enables us to move faster. We are aligned on several key issues like solving the staffing needs for weekend deliveries and ways to mitigate the summer heat in our package delivery vehicle. While we expect to hear a great deal of noise during the negotiation, I remain confident that a win-win-win contract is very achievable and that UPS and the Teamsters will reach agreement by the end of July. Now let’s move to the last leg of our strategy Innovation Driven. We have the best, most efficient global integrated network in the world, and we are getting even better. Today, we operate our network with more agility than ever before, and when it comes to productivity, we are relentless about creating a virtuous cycle of improvement in our network. For example, our total service plan, which addresses running a predictable on-time network has delivered continued productivity improvements since being introduced last year. Our massive and highly complex network naturally generates efficiency when volume increases. But when volume levels drop, historically, it’s been harder to generate productivity improvement. With total service plans, we have driven productivity even with declining volume. In the first quarter, U.S. volume declined by 5.4%, but ours declined even further, which resulted in improved productivity as measured by pieces per hour. As we’ve discussed last quarter, we’ve accelerated investment in our Smart Package Smart Facility RFID solution and plan to complete deployment in more than 900 buildings across the U.S. by the end of October. Throughout the process, we’ve continued to learn and improve, which has enabled stronger results than we originally expected. In the facilities where we have this technology, we’ve cut the frequency of misloads from around 1-in-400 packages to one-in-1,000 packages, which reduces miles, handles and costs and it improves, but the customer and employee experience. Innovation driven is also about combining digital capabilities with our integrated network to improve the customer experience and efficiency. Our upstream delivery density solution checks both boxes. This month, we are onboarding our second large national retailer, which gives us more opportunity to increase density as we can match volume in the UPS network with orders of participating customers. It’s still early days of this initiative. As we learn, we continue to adjust the match rate algorithm and we are happy with the results. Lastly, our innovation driven initiatives are moving us towards our 2050 carbon neutrality goal. We are focused on the decarbonization of our global supply chain. In 2022, our Scope 1, 2, and 3 CO2 emissions declined by 6.9% from 2021. We’ve been investing in alternative fuel for more than 20 years and operate more than 15,600 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. Recently, we took delivery of 10 fully electric class 8 semi trucks in California. These trucks are quiet and they are the first zero emission semis to run in our UPS fleet. Our 2022 sustainability report was published on April 12. This is our 21st annual sustainability report, and you can find it on about.ups.com. Moving to our outlook for 2023, last quarter, we provided a range for our 2023 financial target. As we’ve discussed, there’s been a deceleration in U.S. retail sales growth in certain non-U.S. markets remain challenged. As a result, we now expect to be at the low end of our previously provided revenue and operating profit margin range. Brian will share more detail in a moment. I’ve led three difficult times before and I’ve seen the power of making the right decisions and the pitfalls of making wrong decisions. In uncertain market conditions, it’s easy to fall into the trap of managing the business for the short-term. While we will control what we can control, we will also stay on strategy. Over the past three years, we have fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business and we are just getting started. UPSs are the best in the industry, and because of them, I am convinced we will come out of this cycle faster, stronger, and with a wider lead on our competition. With that, thank you for listening, and now, I’ll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I’ll cover four areas, starting with the macro environment, then our first quarter results, next I’ll cover cash and shareholder returns, and lastly, I’ll review our updated financial outlook for 2023. Okay, let’s start with a macro. In the first quarter, the macro environment was challenging from both a commercial and consumer perspective. The growth rate for U.S. manufacturing production fell throughout the quarter and was down 0.9% in March year-over-year. On the consumer side of the U.S. economy, the growth rate on services spending is continuing to outpace the growth rate on good spending, and within the goods bucket, consumer spent more on essential items like groceries, which tend to be purchased in store. These factors plus a five point drop in consumer sentiment from February to March contributed to the reduction in our volume levels. Outside the U.S. in the first quarter, Asia exports remained weak while Europe narrowly avoided a winter recession. In the face of all this, we responded with agility and remain focused on controlling what we could control to deliver great service for our customers and bottom line results for shareholders. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue was $22.9 billion, down 6% from last year and slightly below our base plan expectations. Operating profit was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 22.8%, however, we achieved our base plan operating profit. Consolidated operating margin was 11.1%, a decline of 250 basis points compared to last year. For the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was $2.20 down 27.9% from the same period last year. Now, let’s look at our business segments. In U.S. Domestic, revenue quality initiatives nearly offset the decrease in volume and as the decline in volume accelerated toward the end of the quarter, we responded quickly by adjusting the network to eliminate costs while maintaining our industry leading service levels. In the first quarter, we expected average daily volume to decline between 3% and 4%. For the quarter, average daily volume was down 5.4% year-over-year, primarily because volume in March moved lower than we expected. Looking at mix in the first quarter, we saw lower volume across all industry sectors with the largest declines from retail and high-tech. B2C average daily volume declined 5.5% compared to last year, and B2B average daily volume declined 5.4%. A bright spot in B2B in the quarter was returns, which was up 6.8% year-over-year. In the first quarter, B2B represented 42.7% of our volume, which was unchanged from a year ago. Additionally, the shift in product mix from air to ground that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2022 continued in the first quarter as customers made cost tradeoffs and took advantage of the speed improvements we made in our ground network and further leveraged our SurePost product. Compared to the first quarter of last year, total air average daily volume was down 16.7%, ground declined 3% and within ground SurePost grew 1.8%. Looking at customer mix, SMB average daily volume declined significantly less than our enterprise customers in the first quarter. SMBs, including platforms made up 29.6% of our total U.S. volume, an increase of 120 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $15 billion down 0.9%. Revenue per piece increased 4.8%, nearly offsetting the decline in volume. The combination of base rates and customer mix increase the revenue per piece growth rate by 500 basis points driven by strong keep rates from our general rate increase and increased SMB penetration. Fuel drove 200 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate increase. Remaining factors reduced the revenue per piece growth rate by 220 basis points driven by the combination of negative product mix with ground packages outpacing air growth and lighter package weights. Turning to cost, total expense was relatively flat with an increase of 0.6% or $80 million in the first quarter. Higher union wage and benefit rates increased expense by over $300 million, primarily from a 6.1% increase in average union wage rates driven by the annual pay increase for our Teamster employees that went into effect in August of 2022. The U.S. Domestic team did an excellent job pulling cost out of the network in response to lower volume. We managed hours down 5.6%, which was more than the decrease in average daily volume, and we reduced headcounts throughout the quarter as volume growth rates decline. Together, these actions reduced expenses by more than $220 million, partially offsetting the increase in wage and benefit rates. Additionally, we reduced purchase transportation by $100 million, primarily from utilizing UPS feeder drivers to support our Fastest Ground Ever and from continued optimization efforts, which enabled us to reduce trailer loads per day by 7.5% compared to the same period last year. The remaining variance was driven by multiple factors including maintenance and depreciation. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $1.5 billion in operating profit, which was slightly above our base plan and down 12.7% compared to the first quarter of 2022. And operating margin was 9.9%. Moving to our international segment, we expected the macro environment to be bumpy and it was. Looking at Asia, export activity started off very weak due to the extended lunar New Year holiday. It gradually recovered through the quarter, but at a slower pace than we anticipated. In Europe, the macro environment was a little better than we expected, which helped offset the weakness in Asia relative to our base plan. In the first quarter, international total average daily volume came in as expected and was down 6.2% year-over-year. Domestic average daily volume was down 9.5%, which drove three quarters of the total average daily volume decline. Total export average daily volume declined 2.8% on a year-over-year basis driven by declines in retail and high tech market demand. Asia export average daily volume was down 8.9% and included a 20% year-over-year decline on the China to U.S. lane. Through the first quarter, we remained agile and we flexed the network to match demand. Reduced Asia block hours by more than the decline in Asia export volume and delivered excellent service to our customers. In the first quarter, international revenue was $4.5 billion, down 6.8% from last year due to the decline in volume and a $161 million negative revenue impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. Revenue per piece was relatively flat year-over-year, but there were a number of moving parts including a 370 basis points decline due to currency and a 180 basis points decline from demand related surcharges. These were offset by an increase in the fuel surcharge of 230 basis points and an increase of 330 basis points due to the combination of a high GRI keep rate and a favorable product mix as export volume outperformed domestic volume. Operating profit in the international segment was $806 million, down $314 million from the same period last year, primarily due to the decline in exports out of Asia and included a $97 million reduction in demand related surcharge revenue and a $51 million negative operating profit impact from currency. Operating margin in the first quarter was 17.7%. Now looking at supply chain solutions. In the first quarter, revenue was $3.4 billion, down $983 million year-over-year. Looking at key drivers. In forwarding, softer global demand, especially out of Asia, drove down market rates and volume resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. We are continuing to manage buy/sell spreads and have taken steps to reduce operating costs in this business. Logistics delivered revenue growth driven by gains in our healthcare logistics and clinical trials business and increased operating profit. In the first quarter, supply chain solutions generated an operating profit of $258 million and an operating margin of 7.6%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had 188 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $66 million and our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24.8%, which was less than we anticipated in our base plan due to lower tax impacts from our employee stock awards. Now let’s turn to cash and shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we generated $2.4 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $1.8 billion, including our annual pension contributions of $1.2 billion that we made in the first quarter. Also, in the first quarter, we issued $2.5 billion in long-term debt that we are using to pay off debt maturing in 2023. And in the first quarter, UPS distributed $1.3 billion in dividends and completed $751 million in share buybacks. Moving to our outlook for the full year 2023. In January, we provided a range for our 2023 financial targets due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment we saw at that time. Since then, the volume environment has deteriorated, especially in the U.S., driven by continued challenging macro conditions and changes in consumer behavior. As a result, we expect full year revenue and operating margin to be at the low end of the previously provided range. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated revenues of around $97 billion and consolidated operating margin of around 12.8% with about 56% of our operating profit coming in the second half of the year. In U.S. domestic, we expect full year volume to decline around 3% versus 2022 with revenue per piece growth yearly offsetting the decline in volume and operating margin is expected to be around 11%. In international, we anticipate both volume and revenue to be down by around 4% and we expect to generate an operating margin of around 20%. And in supply chain solutions, we expect full year revenue to be around $14.3 billion, and operating margin is expected to be around 10%. We have proven our ability to adapt in a dynamic environment. We have many levers to pull on the cost side and we will continue to control what we can control by delivering industry leading service and remaining disciplined on revenue quality. We will also continue investing in growth and efficiency initiatives like international DAP, healthcare and Smart Package smart facility, which will help us come out of this economic cycle faster and stronger. Specifically, now that our volume is trending at the downside of our range, we are executing our plan to take out semi variable and fixed costs. Including in the U.S. air network, we are adjusting package flows to maximize utilization on our next day flights, which enables us to reduce block hours in our two-day operation. On the ground, we are pulling more volume into our large regional hubs, further leveraging the automation in those buildings and enabling us to eliminate sorts in smaller buildings. Driving more consolidation on the ground could potentially allow us to reduce our overall building footprint in the U.S. Internationally, based on the volume levels over the last couple of quarters, we’ve further reduced scheduled flights to reflect lower market demand while ensuring we maintain agility in the network to quickly add flights where needed if volume returns more strongly than we expect. Across our global business, we will continue to manage headcount with volume levels. And in terms of overhead, we see opportunities to further reduce costs by leveraging technology. Now let’s turn to capital allocation. Our plans have not changed. We will continue to make long-term investments to support our strategy and capture growth coming out of this cycle. We still expect 2023 capital expenditures to be about $5.3 billion, including investments in automation, and we’ll add 2.3 million square feet of healthcare logistics space to our global network this year. We’ll also complete the deployment of the first phase of Smart Package Smart Facility in the U.S., expand DAP internationally and continue building out our logistics as a service platform. We are still planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023 subject to Board approval. We still plan to buy back around $3 billion of our shares. And lastly, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be around 23.5%. In closing, despite the challenging macro backdrop, we will continue to provide industry leading service to our customers and we will stay on strategy. We are investing to make our network even more efficient and to strengthen our customer value proposition to enable us to capture growth coming out of this cycle. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. We’ll now conduct a question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Vernon: So Carol, I wanted to follow up on your commentary around the productivity in lighter volume. As you guys think about the way the business is performing against the lower volume outlook right now, how confident are you that if we get into a better volume environment, say 2024, 2025, that some of those productivity gains are going to be able to be held? And then Brian maybe is just a follow-up. Can you give us a sense for what sort of magnitude of facility reductions you might be able to pull off here in the next couple of years? Thanks.\nCarol Tomé: Well, David, thank you for your question. First, as it relates to productivity, we introduced our total service plan last year. That’s not one and done. That’s the way we’re going to operate our business forever. Productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS. And Nando and the team continue to find opportunities to drive productivity in down markets as well as up markets.\nBrian Newman: And on the second part of the question, Dave in terms of the scope of building consolidation, et cetera, Nando and the team are doing a nice job working a project called network of the future, still early days. We do have some facility sales planned in the second quarter of the back half of the year, but that doesn’t really ramp up in terms of the opportunity to consolidate until 2024, 2025 in that timeframe.\nCarol Tomé: Just a little bit more color on that perhaps if you think about how we grew up as a company, if we build up a facility, we spun off a building and then we would build up another facility and spin off a building. As Nando and his team have looked at it, we found that, huh, we might be able to consolidate some of those spinoffs into highly automated buildings, drive productivity and not lose any drive time, not impact our customer service in any negative way. So we’re looking at that, it’s pretty exciting.\nBrian Newman: But it is a change in culture. I don’t think Carol, we’ve actually closed buildings outside of the non-op side. So it’s a pivot to be more optimized and focused.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Good morning, Carol and Brian. So Brian, the volume environment is obviously weaker and the weakness seems – seem to have accelerated towards the end of the quarter. So I’m just trying to understand, where are we now? I mean, they’re obviously – you’re obviously confident about achieving the low end of the guidance. I’m just trying to understand, that confidence in the context of the volume uncertainty. And then just as a follow-up if I could, Carol, it’s great that you think a win-win-win is still achievable, but the rhetoric is getting like really bellicose. And so, I’m wondering if you’d give some color on that dynamic because it seems like it’s costing you guys some volume right now. And I know you made an acquisition last year with Delivery Solutions that gives you access to a lot of contingent capacity. So talk about the win-win-win against the rhetoric, against the investments you’ve made. There’s a lot in there, but I’ll let you answer it however you want. Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Yes. The biggest change in terms of the base case versus downside is the volume. We were looking at volumes of down 1% in the base case, and now we’ve pivoted to the downside of down 3%. The first quarter was an evolution about where we expected in January, February a little bit lighter, but March was the trail off. And so as we’ve seen the macros to deteriorate, we look at things like IP manufacturing and ESMO [ph], those have continued to devolve. And so we’ve basically adjusted the volume outlook for the first half of the year. And so two reasons, we’re confident that the full year in the case of the domestic business will be at 11%. We have confidence that the volume will come back post the summer related to customer conversations and some of the macro which we think will trough in the middle part of the year. And also cost we can go into more detail, but our ability to control cost and take more of the semi-variable out will help us deliver that 11% in the U.S.\nCarol Tomé: And maybe just a little more color on volume, and then I’ll go to your question about Teamsters. As we – as Brian detailed, the rate of acceleration in the year-over-year decline caused us pause because we were down around 3% in January, 5% in March – February and 7% in March. As we look at April, April has stabilized relative to how we exited March. So we feel very good that volume has stabilized. If we look at the year-over-year decline in the U.S. a little over 1 million packages today, we would attribute over 60%, nearly 62% of the decline due to macro and a plan decline with our largest customers. We’re declining with them in a mutually agreed way. So it’s really a macro story here and we’re delighted to see that the volume has stabilized. To Brian’s point, then, what gives us confidence that the volume will come back in the back half of the year. I’ll share with you our strategy as it relates to sales. And this is a multifaceted strategy. It starts with keep to your point about volume diversion, which all by the way wasn’t very much in the first quarter. We’ve assigned 127 high impact executives to over 380 customers representing about one third of our total volume. The role of the high impact executive is to meet with our customers, update them on our ongoing negotiations with the Teamsters and to keep them with us. The next element of our strategy is protect in the unlikely event of a work stoppage. And we’re not counting on that because we are confident we’re getting our contract. But in the unlikely event, we do have contingency plans to protect. The third leg of our strategy is to win back for any volume that has diverted. And we did have some it would be unreasonable to expect that we wouldn’t have any for volume that has diverted. We are going to win it back because they’ve told us they’re coming back. In fact, one customer just signed on the dotted line that they’re coming back once we have a handshake. The third is to continue to sell. We are selling in the environment and we want to sell and close and pull through those new customers. And then finally is work the pipeline. We have a pipeline that’s greater than $6 billion. That’s hard to sell into right now because of that Teamsters negotiation. But we are going to go hard at it once we have that handshake deal. And we’re going to go at it in a way that we’ve never done before because we will be using our dynamic pricing model. This is a very different way to go to market because we are creating value propositions for our customers that we haven’t done before. Using the architecture of tomorrow pricing model that we’ve created, which creates the modifiers to base price it’s a win for our customer and our win for UPS. So that’s really how we’re getting competent in the volume projections that we shared with you this morning. Now to your question about the Teamsters. It – we told you from the beginning that it was going to be noisy and that’s turning out to be true. But let me just comment on the recent rhetoric. There was some noise about supplemental agreements. We have over 40 supplemental agreements with the Teamsters. We have been negotiating in good faith with the Teamsters on those supplemental agreements and have made very good progress. In fact, Teamsters leadership and UPS leadership were in Washington D.C. last week, both given in opening comments regarding the Master agreement. So I feel like we are very much on track as to our timeline to accomplish a win-win-win. And why am I competent about a win-win-win? Well, first of all, we are aligned on the Northstar. And the Northstar is that a thriving, growing UPS is good for Teamsters, it’s good for UPS and it’s good for our people. And when you are aligned on the Northstar, everything else can get worked out on some of the issues that Teamsters have been very public about. And we talked about it’s the last time we had an earnings call. We’re aligned. For example, we all agree that weekend delivery is table stakes because that’s what consumers are expecting. We all agree it’s how we go about doing that from an operating model perspective, that we need to work it out. Because of restrictions in our contract, in some instances, we have Teamsters working six days a week. Teamsters don’t like that. I don’t like that. If you want to work six days a week, that’s fine with me, but if you don’t, we shouldn’t force you. So we’ve got to work that out. And there are a number of other issues just like that when we get to the bargaining table, we’ll figure out a way to work it out. I’m highly confident that we’re going to get a win-win-win agreement. But like any negotiation, it’s going to be a noisy and a few bumps along the way. And I just had this argument with my husband about a puppy. It was noisy, it was stuffy [ph]. But in any negotiation, that’s going to be the case and it’s certainly the case here. And that’s why I go back to our sales strategy of these high impact executives putting their arms around our customers and making sure they’re comfortable with us because we are confident we’ll deliver our contract.\nAmit Mehrotra: Got it. Thank you. Good luck with the puppy.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just want to go back to the productivity side that the hours deployed, the spread between hours deployed and the volumes certainly narrowed this quarter. I know you talked about some stabilization in April and certainly some cost outs going forward. Just any color on how we should think of that spread? Should it remain positive and maybe expand as we get towards the back half of the year? Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Yes. So look – but we’re going to need to take cost out balance a year. It’ll be a big reduction in CPP. We were mid-single digit Allison in the U.S. And candidly, if you had told me wages were going to be up 6% and volume was going to be down 5%, I would’ve expected something like a double-digit CPP about three or four years ago. Nando and the team have done extraordinary job of driving that 6% that we saw in the quarter, but we are expecting low-single digits for the balance of the year. As you think about CPP, it’s going to come from four areas. One, Carol talked about total service plan, and that’s that reducing hours more than volume and managing the headcount. The second is our network. We deal with both ground and error, as you know, and in the ground side, how do we consolidate volume and automated facilities, closed sorts and really focus on the efficiency there. On the air side, it’s changing the package flows to better utilize the one day network. And in fact, domestic block hours they were down about 4% in the first quarter, we would expect to exit the second quarter at 2x [indiscernible] The third piece that we’re focused on is overhead and following the technology group delivering technology efficiency to allow us to do our jobs on the non-op side more efficiently and will continue to reduce headcount as volume warrants. And lastly, fuel. We expect fuel prices to be down double-digit year-over-year in the balance of the year 2Q and 2H. So that will reduce both RPP and CPP. But those four things combined drive a high amount of confidence in a low-single digit CPP balance a year.\nAllison Poliniak: Understood. Thanks for the color.\nBrian Newman: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead, sir.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. That was really helpful, Brian, in terms of the cost per piece framework, do you have a kind of a comparable thought for looking forward on revenue per piece? And maybe also some – just some commentary on how the pricing environment’s holding up. I think your primary competitor’s pretty focused on margins, cutting cost, cutting capacity. Obviously, you’re doing a good job managing cost and capacity as well. So I think there’s a lot of potential for a good pricing environment, but any thoughts on that? And also just how we think about the drivers of revenue per piece. Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Yes. Tom, I’m happy to. And I assume you’re talking about the domestic business. We had guide….\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Domestic, thanks. Yes.\nBrian Newman: Originally to an RPP growth of about 3% this year. Carol mentioned volumes are coming in a bit softer, but we’re holding on to that RPP and the RPP composition, we actually saw close to 5% RPP growth in the first quarter. That was driven by a tailwind in fuel about 200 bps that flips around Tom in the back end of the year where we expect double-digit decline in fuel price. So the way I think about the GRI and the customer mix piece, that should be mid-single digit about 5 points. And then we’ll have about a 200 bps decline from fuel. That gets us right into that, that that 3% range. We did see some headwinds in the product mix, the air to ground in the first quarter, that’ll moderate as we go into Q2 in the back end of the year. So that’s the composition.\nCarol Tomé: Yes. May be just a comment on the pricing environment, the keep rate on the GRI is the high as it’s been. In the United States, it’s north of 60%. It’s even higher outside of the United States.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi. You talked a little bit about what’s going to drive cost per piece back after the year, but maybe can you talk a little bit about some of the specific buckets notably that other expense was quite a bit higher and is it more opportunity purchase transport? Just trying to get a sense for what – where it’s going to be impacted the most. Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Yes. [Indiscernible] was we were able to take cost out of that. And as you look at the back end of the year from another perspective, we’re certainly getting after a lot of the non-operating costs. We’re taking consulting spend out of the business. We’re taking headcount out of the business. So we’re really driving from a non-ops perspective down to something closer to a 4% of revenue from a cost perspective.\nCarol Tomé: And maybe just a comment on that other expense line item because it does look out of sorts, we are moving to Software-as-a-Service. It’s a line item move, right, Brian, you’re the finance person here, but rather than depreciation’s it’s going to move into expect.\nBrian Newman: That’s exactly right.\nCarol Tomé: So there’s a little bit of a difference if you have Software-as-a-Service for your technology deployment versus what you build.\nBrian Newman: Transition of buckets.\nCarol Tomé: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Yes.\nJordan Alliger: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up, talked a lot about the domestic environment and stabilization perhaps in April, but what about the Asian export business? Is there anything on that front that, that gives a little confidence right now? Thanks.\nCarol Tomé: Well, here’s what we’re seeing in the business, week after week it’s better. It’s still down year-on-year, but it’s better slowly coming out of this negative year-over-year decline of almost 20% in the first quarter. And Kate and her team are doing a masterful job of managing through that. In fact, if you look at productivity outside the United States, our Asia export business down 8.9%, our block hours were down 14% and she’s taking more block hours out in the second quarter even with improvements just to optimize VR [ph] network.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, good morning, Carol and Brian. You talked about the sharp decline in mid-February. I guess you’ve seen this before where we’ve had some stabilization and then the sharp decline inventory still seem high. Maybe your thoughts on the backdrop, and maybe Brian a little more international, you talk about getting to 20% margin on international, but seems like pre-COVID you were operating maybe 16% to 19%. Did something structurally change or the mix change that, that you think that that is the new floor versus in a shifting environment it goes a little bit lower? Thanks.\nBrian Newman: Yes, Ken, happy to start. You taking the last piece first, on international, we had guided a couple years ago when we went out with three-year guidance to a 21.5% in international, obviously the world’s changed a lot since then. But the mix of Kate’s business that she’s running and the agility on the network in terms of managing the airflow has I don’t know about a floor, but I think we’re comfortable with the 20%. You’ll see that 20% margin can fairly consistently Q2 through Q4. So we feel comfortable about that in terms of how the business evolves.\nCarol Tomé: And on the volume question, again, it goes back to our sales strategy. We have pretty good visibility into the pipeline. We’re just going to pull that pipeline through. In today’s environment with the contract negotiation about a 100 days out to completion, it’s kind of hard to get it pulled through, but we’re going to pull it through when we get that handshake deal.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Carol. Thanks, Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Scott Group of Wolfe. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Brian, just a couple follow-ups on the guidance, the 11% U.S. margin. How does that trend throughout the course of the year? And then the volumes were down – the volumes down 3% for the year, how should we think about Q2? And is the back half sort of flat to positive? Is that what you’re expecting? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Yes. I would say the – in terms of shaping the year, Scott, maybe that helps. We don’t manage in quarters, but to help you shape, I referenced in the prepared remarks, 56% of our full year operating profit coming in the second half for the company. If you look at the U.S. domestic business, I’d expect ADV year-over-year growth rates to bottom in Q2 and then improve from there to your point. And that relates to the actions we’re – as we think about margin, the actions we’re taking on semi variable costs and margins will improve sequentially in Q2 and then throughout. Fuel PPG will reduce both RPP and CPP. So it’s not a material profit impact but I would expect operating margins to be better in the second quarter than in the first. On the international side, I think ADV will gradually improve through the year. And as I mentioned, we’ll have to see consistency of the op margin for the next three quarters of around 20% in the balance of the year. And then finally it’s supply chain. Revenue should be marginally better in Q2 than Q1, and you can hold that 10% as a full year op margin.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead, sir.\nBruce Chan: Yes, thanks, and good morning, everyone. Just want to ask here on the share shift issue if you’re able to quantify or even qualify the attrition that you’re seeing. And I just ask because I think there’s been a lot of focus on your upcoming negotiations, but just based on your service investments and what are some pretty major, I think, operational changes at your largest competitor. I’m wondering if you’re actually seeing any business wins. Appreciate it.\nCarol Tomé: We are definitely seeing business wins. And I’m – I have to give a hat off to our sales team for selling through this environment. We are delivering packages for customers that we’ve never delivered before. Why? Because our service is the best in the industry. But what we see with some of our long-term existing large customers is that their business is changing. And I can give you a few anecdotes if that’s helpful. One of our large customers reports publicly every month their same-store sales. This is a customer who for 80 quarters in a row had positive same-store sales and in the month of March saw negative same-store sales. One of our other customers who has both in-store sales as well as online sales has seen a shift in their customer shopping behavior from online to stores. So they’re shutting down shifts inside of their warehouses, which make sense for them. So they receive generally macro and a change in consumer behavior impacting our volume, but we’re winning and we just got to go win faster and we will win faster when the uncertainty is behind us. I’m quite convinced of the Teamster negotiation. Customers say, we’d like to ship with you, we’re just going to sit on the sidelines till you’re done. So we just need to get done. And we will.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Carol, you just gave some commentary about some of the volume trends from some of the customers. Are you seeing anything that you would attribute to perhaps demand destruction from parcel rates going up with capacity constraints, with some of the disruptions and surcharges including on fuel? Do you attribute any of the volume weakness to that? And then Brian, maybe you can elaborate a bit more on returns. You mentioned it was a pretty good growth driver in the quarter, but your largest customers also floating the idea of perhaps charging for some returns in the future. I wanted to see if that was some consideration we should think about in terms of what that could do for that volume driver, which seems to be a pretty good one, at least for the time being. Thank you.\nCarol Tomé: So to your first question, we don’t see volume disruption because of pricing. We do see product change however. If you looked at our air product in the quarter, it was down year-on-year, more than ground. We see customers moving out of air to ground. Why? Well, we’ve really worked to improve our time in transit. So we’ve got the fastest time in transit now, so you can get your package where it needs to go quicker than before. And people are looking for value. So I can watch customer by customer moving out of air to SurePost, by the way. SurePost is up in the quarter, almost 2%.\nBrian Newman: And on the returns business, it’s a great business. The margins are attractive. We saw positive growth in the first quarter as I called out. And a big piece of that is the – over 5,000 stores, we have UPS stores across the country. Carol mentioned 7% of the volume originates in those stores. And it’s a great easy way for consumers to with the returns that are going on as the e-comm economy pursues. So we feel good about that and something we’re building capability in every day.\nCarol Tomé: And convenience matters from returns. If you want to get that package back so you get credit back into your wallet, you want a convenient place to return. And with our locations near 85% of the U.S. population within 10 miles of 85% of the U.S. population were extraordinarily convenient.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Hey, just wanted to you maybe hit on the cadence question again and about sort of how this year progresses on the guidance. I think 56% of the profit on the back half of the year implies around $2.9 billion or so in 2Q. And just any thoughts around the step up we would might see between domestic and international? And then I guess just Brian on the RPP, CPP point, do you have a line of sight? Does the guidance include a flip back to RPP outperforming or outpacing CPP by the end of the year? Is that a volume function? Is that more of a cost function? Just want to make sure I understand sort of how you guys are thinking about that.\nBrian Newman: So we’re longer term, Chris, as we’ve talked to you. We’re always going to drive for RPP to outpace CPP. We’re a bit of an extraordinary environment right now with the macros and everywhere they are. So we don’t have margin expansion this year based on the guide. So you won’t see that likely return until 2024. But we feel good about the taking cost and CPP down to low single digit as RPP does come back. So feel okay about that. And then your math is fairly accurate in the second quarter, you’re doing the squeeze the right way.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Thank you very much.\nBrian Newman: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAri Rosa: Hey, good morning, Brian. Good morning, Carol. So I just wanted to understand, how do you think about the softer economic environment potentially impacting your discussion with the union? Is there any dimension on which it maybe makes negotiations a little bit easier or gives you a little bit more leverage vis-à-vis that discussion? Thanks.\nCarol Tomé: So we look out – we don’t look in the current moment. We look out for where we both want to go as growing and thriving UPS is in the best interest of Teamsters, UPS, and our people. So the current economic environment, it is what it is, but our negotiations are all about the future.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of TD Cowen. Please go ahead ma’am.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody. And thank you very much for the time. I wonder, Brian, if you could talk a little bit about what margins in the stores are like, I feel like you were hinting at their – one of your most profitable business lines. So I’m kind of wondering if you could put some more color to that.\nBrian Newman: You’re talking about the UPS stores? So it’s a great foundation for volume origin. We have a royalty relationship that generates a royalty stream that comes in from the stores as far as what income comes into UPS. And as that volume grows, our royalty grows.\nCarol Tomé: We do look at the profitability of stores. Because I’m curious, I’m an old retailer. So are the stores profitable? The stores are very profitable, which means franchisees are happy. We add about 100 new stores every year, because this is a great small business to own. And in terms of the royalty fee that comes into our company, there’s some expenses against that. But if you look at the margin against that royalty fee, I would say, it’s the highest margin business that we’ve got.\nKen Cook: Excellent. Steven, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead ma’am.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Hi, Carol and Bryan. I just wanted to kind of look through your updated guidance, particularly your consolidated margin outlook. It certainly understand it’s a very fluid environment as it relates to volumes and appreciate the additional color of you guys executing on what’s in your control. But could you talk a little bit about your ability to maybe still hit that margin target and volumes were to deteriorate worse than you expected? And how you kind of framed that in your outlook as you kind of looked at the puts and takes for it. What is a pretty volatile year? Thank you.\nBrian Newman: Yes, happy to. And the whole reason we went out at the beginning of the year with two scenarios is we didn’t know what was going to happen with the macros and the macros to continue to deteriorate in the first half of the year. So we had a playbook which was the downside scenario. We pulled that off the shelf and our executing the TSP, the network changes for ground and air, the overhead the fuel. And so from a line of sight perspective, what we control I feel good about the 12.8 that we’ve got in for the downside scenario. Obviously, the top line is what it is, but Carol said we’ve got the largest pipeline of sales that we’ve had in about five years, which is a very big number, $6 billion. And so our ability to pull that in posted negotiation with the labor that gives us confidence on the top line.\nCarol Tomé: Well, you might share the split of variable, semi variable and fixed.\nBrian Newman: Yes. So well, I’m not sure anything’s fixed anymore, Carol. So we do about a third variable on the 70% in the semi and the fixed bucket and we’re really redefining that. As we talked earlier, we don’t have a history of closing or selling buildings per se, but everything’s on the table because in the new world there has been a growth over a 100 years of a bunch of buildings located around. And so Nando’s ability to go and shut down some sorts and drive, we’re going to match the volume. The one thing Carol I would add is, when volume returns and make no mistake, volume will return to this business, we will be positioned very well to throw off cash, because we’ll have positioned the cost structure in a good way.\nKen Cook: Thanks, Brian. And I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. Look forward to talking to you next quarter. And that concludes today’s call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover four areas, starting with the macro environment, then our first quarter results, next I'll cover cash and shareholder returns, and lastly, I'll review our updated financial outlook for 2023. Okay, let's start with a macro. In the first quarter, the macro environment was challenging from both a commercial and consumer perspective. The growth rate for U.S. manufacturing production fell throughout the quarter and was down 0.9% in March year-over-year. On the consumer side of the U.S. economy, the growth rate on services spending is continuing to outpace the growth rate on good spending, and within the goods bucket, consumer spent more on essential items like groceries, which tend to be purchased in store. These factors plus a five point drop in consumer sentiment from February to March contributed to the reduction in our volume levels. Outside the U.S. in the first quarter, Asia exports remained weak while Europe narrowly avoided a winter recession. In the face of all this, we responded with agility and remain focused on controlling what we could control to deliver great service for our customers and bottom line results for shareholders. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue was $22.9 billion, down 6% from last year and slightly below our base plan expectations. Operating profit was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 22.8%, however, we achieved our base plan operating profit. Consolidated operating margin was 11.1%, a decline of 250 basis points compared to last year. For the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was $2.20 down 27.9% from the same period last year. Now, let's look at our business segments. In U.S. Domestic, revenue quality initiatives nearly offset the decrease in volume and as the decline in volume accelerated toward the end of the quarter, we responded quickly by adjusting the network to eliminate costs while maintaining our industry leading service levels. In the first quarter, we expected average daily volume to decline between 3% and 4%. For the quarter, average daily volume was down 5.4% year-over-year, primarily because volume in March moved lower than we expected. Looking at mix in the first quarter, we saw lower volume across all industry sectors with the largest declines from retail and high-tech. B2C average daily volume declined 5.5% compared to last year, and B2B average daily volume declined 5.4%. A bright spot in B2B in the quarter was returns, which was up 6.8% year-over-year. In the first quarter, B2B represented 42.7% of our volume, which was unchanged from a year ago. Additionally, the shift in product mix from air to ground that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2022 continued in the first quarter as customers made cost tradeoffs and took advantage of the speed improvements we made in our ground network and further leveraged our SurePost product. Compared to the first quarter of last year, total air average daily volume was down 16.7%, ground declined 3% and within ground SurePost grew 1.8%. Looking at customer mix, SMB average daily volume declined significantly less than our enterprise customers in the first quarter. SMBs, including platforms made up 29.6% of our total U.S. volume, an increase of 120 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $15 billion down 0.9%. Revenue per piece increased 4.8%, nearly offsetting the decline in volume. The combination of base rates and customer mix increase the revenue per piece growth rate by 500 basis points driven by strong keep rates from our general rate increase and increased SMB penetration. Fuel drove 200 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate increase. Remaining factors reduced the revenue per piece growth rate by 220 basis points driven by the combination of negative product mix with ground packages outpacing air growth and lighter package weights. Turning to cost, total expense was relatively flat with an increase of 0.6% or $80 million in the first quarter. Higher union wage and benefit rates increased expense by over $300 million, primarily from a 6.1% increase in average union wage rates driven by the annual pay increase for our Teamster employees that went into effect in August of 2022. The U.S. Domestic team did an excellent job pulling cost out of the network in response to lower volume. We managed hours down 5.6%, which was more than the decrease in average daily volume, and we reduced headcounts throughout the quarter as volume growth rates decline. Together, these actions reduced expenses by more than $220 million, partially offsetting the increase in wage and benefit rates. Additionally, we reduced purchase transportation by $100 million, primarily from utilizing UPS feeder drivers to support our Fastest Ground Ever and from continued optimization efforts, which enabled us to reduce trailer loads per day by 7.5% compared to the same period last year. The remaining variance was driven by multiple factors including maintenance and depreciation. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $1.5 billion in operating profit, which was slightly above our base plan and down 12.7% compared to the first quarter of 2022. And operating margin was 9.9%. Moving to our international segment, we expected the macro environment to be bumpy and it was. Looking at Asia, export activity started off very weak due to the extended lunar New Year holiday. It gradually recovered through the quarter, but at a slower pace than we anticipated. In Europe, the macro environment was a little better than we expected, which helped offset the weakness in Asia relative to our base plan. In the first quarter, international total average daily volume came in as expected and was down 6.2% year-over-year. Domestic average daily volume was down 9.5%, which drove three quarters of the total average daily volume decline. Total export average daily volume declined 2.8% on a year-over-year basis driven by declines in retail and high tech market demand. Asia export average daily volume was down 8.9% and included a 20% year-over-year decline on the China to U.S. lane. Through the first quarter, we remained agile and we flexed the network to match demand. Reduced Asia block hours by more than the decline in Asia export volume and delivered excellent service to our customers. In the first quarter, international revenue was $4.5 billion, down 6.8% from last year due to the decline in volume and a $161 million negative revenue impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. Revenue per piece was relatively flat year-over-year, but there were a number of moving parts including a 370 basis points decline due to currency and a 180 basis points decline from demand related surcharges. These were offset by an increase in the fuel surcharge of 230 basis points and an increase of 330 basis points due to the combination of a high GRI keep rate and a favorable product mix as export volume outperformed domestic volume. Operating profit in the international segment was $806 million, down $314 million from the same period last year, primarily due to the decline in exports out of Asia and included a $97 million reduction in demand related surcharge revenue and a $51 million negative operating profit impact from currency. Operating margin in the first quarter was 17.7%. Now looking at supply chain solutions. In the first quarter, revenue was $3.4 billion, down $983 million year-over-year. Looking at key drivers. In forwarding, softer global demand, especially out of Asia, drove down market rates and volume resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. We are continuing to manage buy/sell spreads and have taken steps to reduce operating costs in this business. Logistics delivered revenue growth driven by gains in our healthcare logistics and clinical trials business and increased operating profit. In the first quarter, supply chain solutions generated an operating profit of $258 million and an operating margin of 7.6%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had 188 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $66 million and our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24.8%, which was less than we anticipated in our base plan due to lower tax impacts from our employee stock awards. Now let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we generated $2.4 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $1.8 billion, including our annual pension contributions of $1.2 billion that we made in the first quarter. Also, in the first quarter, we issued $2.5 billion in long-term debt that we are using to pay off debt maturing in 2023. And in the first quarter, UPS distributed $1.3 billion in dividends and completed $751 million in share buybacks. Moving to our outlook for the full year 2023. In January, we provided a range for our 2023 financial targets due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment we saw at that time. Since then, the volume environment has deteriorated, especially in the U.S., driven by continued challenging macro conditions and changes in consumer behavior. As a result, we expect full year revenue and operating margin to be at the low end of the previously provided range. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated revenues of around $97 billion and consolidated operating margin of around 12.8% with about 56% of our operating profit coming in the second half of the year. In U.S. domestic, we expect full year volume to decline around 3% versus 2022 with revenue per piece growth yearly offsetting the decline in volume and operating margin is expected to be around 11%. In international, we anticipate both volume and revenue to be down by around 4% and we expect to generate an operating margin of around 20%. And in supply chain solutions, we expect full year revenue to be around $14.3 billion, and operating margin is expected to be around 10%. We have proven our ability to adapt in a dynamic environment. We have many levers to pull on the cost side and we will continue to control what we can control by delivering industry leading service and remaining disciplined on revenue quality. We will also continue investing in growth and efficiency initiatives like international DAP, healthcare and Smart Package smart facility, which will help us come out of this economic cycle faster and stronger. Specifically, now that our volume is trending at the downside of our range, we are executing our plan to take out semi variable and fixed costs. Including in the U.S. air network, we are adjusting package flows to maximize utilization on our next day flights, which enables us to reduce block hours in our two-day operation. On the ground, we are pulling more volume into our large regional hubs, further leveraging the automation in those buildings and enabling us to eliminate sorts in smaller buildings. Driving more consolidation on the ground could potentially allow us to reduce our overall building footprint in the U.S. Internationally, based on the volume levels over the last couple of quarters, we've further reduced scheduled flights to reflect lower market demand while ensuring we maintain agility in the network to quickly add flights where needed if volume returns more strongly than we expect. Across our global business, we will continue to manage headcount with volume levels. And in terms of overhead, we see opportunities to further reduce costs by leveraging technology. Now let's turn to capital allocation. Our plans have not changed. We will continue to make long-term investments to support our strategy and capture growth coming out of this cycle. We still expect 2023 capital expenditures to be about $5.3 billion, including investments in automation, and we'll add 2.3 million square feet of healthcare logistics space to our global network this year. We'll also complete the deployment of the first phase of Smart Package Smart Facility in the U.S., expand DAP internationally and continue building out our logistics as a service platform. We are still planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023 subject to Board approval. We still plan to buy back around $3 billion of our shares. And lastly, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be around 23.5%. In closing, despite the challenging macro backdrop, we will continue to provide industry leading service to our customers and we will stay on strategy. We are investing to make our network even more efficient and to strengthen our customer value proposition to enable us to capture growth coming out of this cycle. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines. And on the second part of the question, Dave in terms of the scope of building consolidation, et cetera, Nando and the team are doing a nice job working a project called network of the future, still early days. We do have some facility sales planned in the second quarter of the back half of the year, but that doesn't really ramp up in terms of the opportunity to consolidate until 2024, 2025 in that timeframe. But it is a change in culture. I don't think Carol, we've actually closed buildings outside of the non-op side. So it's a pivot to be more optimized and focused. Yes. The biggest change in terms of the base case versus downside is the volume. We were looking at volumes of down 1% in the base case, and now we've pivoted to the downside of down 3%. The first quarter was an evolution about where we expected in January, February a little bit lighter, but March was the trail off. And so as we've seen the macros to deteriorate, we look at things like IP manufacturing and ESMO [ph], those have continued to devolve. And so we've basically adjusted the volume outlook for the first half of the year. And so two reasons, we're confident that the full year in the case of the domestic business will be at 11%. We have confidence that the volume will come back post the summer related to customer conversations and some of the macro which we think will trough in the middle part of the year. And also cost we can go into more detail, but our ability to control cost and take more of the semi-variable out will help us deliver that 11% in the U.S. Yes. So look – but we're going to need to take cost out balance a year. It'll be a big reduction in CPP. We were mid-single digit Allison in the U.S. And candidly, if you had told me wages were going to be up 6% and volume was going to be down 5%, I would've expected something like a double-digit CPP about three or four years ago. Nando and the team have done extraordinary job of driving that 6% that we saw in the quarter, but we are expecting low-single digits for the balance of the year. As you think about CPP, it's going to come from four areas. One, Carol talked about total service plan, and that's that reducing hours more than volume and managing the headcount. The second is our network. We deal with both ground and error, as you know, and in the ground side, how do we consolidate volume and automated facilities, closed sorts and really focus on the efficiency there. On the air side, it's changing the package flows to better utilize the one day network. And in fact, domestic block hours they were down about 4% in the first quarter, we would expect to exit the second quarter at 2x [indiscernible] The third piece that we're focused on is overhead and following the technology group delivering technology efficiency to allow us to do our jobs on the non-op side more efficiently and will continue to reduce headcount as volume warrants. And lastly, fuel. We expect fuel prices to be down double-digit year-over-year in the balance of the year 2Q and 2H. So that will reduce both RPP and CPP. But those four things combined drive a high amount of confidence in a low-single digit CPP balance a year. Yes. Yes. Tom, I'm happy to. And I assume you're talking about the domestic business. We had guide.... Originally to an RPP growth of about 3% this year. Carol mentioned volumes are coming in a bit softer, but we're holding on to that RPP and the RPP composition, we actually saw close to 5% RPP growth in the first quarter. That was driven by a tailwind in fuel about 200 bps that flips around Tom in the back end of the year where we expect double-digit decline in fuel price. So the way I think about the GRI and the customer mix piece, that should be mid-single digit about 5 points. And then we'll have about a 200 bps decline from fuel. That gets us right into that, that that 3% range. We did see some headwinds in the product mix, the air to ground in the first quarter, that'll moderate as we go into Q2 in the back end of the year. So that's the composition. Thanks, Tom. Yes. [Indiscernible] was we were able to take cost out of that. And as you look at the back end of the year from another perspective, we're certainly getting after a lot of the non-operating costs. We're taking consulting spend out of the business. We're taking headcount out of the business. So we're really driving from a non-ops perspective down to something closer to a 4% of revenue from a cost perspective. That's exactly right. Transition of buckets. Yes. Thanks, Jordan. Yes, Ken, happy to start. You taking the last piece first, on international, we had guided a couple years ago when we went out with three-year guidance to a 21.5% in international, obviously the world's changed a lot since then. But the mix of Kate's business that she's running and the agility on the network in terms of managing the airflow has I don't know about a floor, but I think we're comfortable with the 20%. You'll see that 20% margin can fairly consistently Q2 through Q4. So we feel comfortable about that in terms of how the business evolves. Thanks, Ken. Yes. I would say the – in terms of shaping the year, Scott, maybe that helps. We don't manage in quarters, but to help you shape, I referenced in the prepared remarks, 56% of our full year operating profit coming in the second half for the company. If you look at the U.S. domestic business, I'd expect ADV year-over-year growth rates to bottom in Q2 and then improve from there to your point. And that relates to the actions we're – as we think about margin, the actions we're taking on semi variable costs and margins will improve sequentially in Q2 and then throughout. Fuel PPG will reduce both RPP and CPP. So it's not a material profit impact but I would expect operating margins to be better in the second quarter than in the first. On the international side, I think ADV will gradually improve through the year. And as I mentioned, we'll have to see consistency of the op margin for the next three quarters of around 20% in the balance of the year. And then finally it's supply chain. Revenue should be marginally better in Q2 than Q1, and you can hold that 10% as a full year op margin. Yes. And on the returns business, it's a great business. The margins are attractive. We saw positive growth in the first quarter as I called out. And a big piece of that is the – over 5,000 stores, we have UPS stores across the country. Carol mentioned 7% of the volume originates in those stores. And it's a great easy way for consumers to with the returns that are going on as the e-comm economy pursues. So we feel good about that and something we're building capability in every day. So we're longer term, Chris, as we've talked to you. We're always going to drive for RPP to outpace CPP. We're a bit of an extraordinary environment right now with the macros and everywhere they are. So we don't have margin expansion this year based on the guide. So you won't see that likely return until 2024. But we feel good about the taking cost and CPP down to low single digit as RPP does come back. So feel okay about that. And then your math is fairly accurate in the second quarter, you're doing the squeeze the right way. Yes. You're talking about the UPS stores? So it's a great foundation for volume origin. We have a royalty relationship that generates a royalty stream that comes in from the stores as far as what income comes into UPS. And as that volume grows, our royalty grows. Yes, happy to. And the whole reason we went out at the beginning of the year with two scenarios is we didn't know what was going to happen with the macros and the macros to continue to deteriorate in the first half of the year. So we had a playbook which was the downside scenario. We pulled that off the shelf and our executing the TSP, the network changes for ground and air, the overhead the fuel. And so from a line of sight perspective, what we control I feel good about the 12.8 that we've got in for the downside scenario. Obviously, the top line is what it is, but Carol said we've got the largest pipeline of sales that we've had in about five years, which is a very big number, $6 billion. And so our ability to pull that in posted negotiation with the labor that gives us confidence on the top line. Yes. So well, I'm not sure anything's fixed anymore, Carol. So we do about a third variable on the 70% in the semi and the fixed bucket and we're really redefining that. As we talked earlier, we don't have a history of closing or selling buildings per se, but everything's on the table because in the new world there has been a growth over a 100 years of a bunch of buildings located around. And so Nando's ability to go and shut down some sorts and drive, we're going to match the volume. The one thing Carol I would add is, when volume returns and make no mistake, volume will return to this business, we will be positioned very well to throw off cash, because we'll have positioned the cost structure in a good way."

            "name": "Carol Tomé",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for once again delivering industry-leading service to our customers. Service defines UPS. It is one of our values and I'm proud of our team who continue to make it a key priority. Another company value is safety. UPS drivers are among the safest in the industry and every year we invest millions of dollars in safe driving education and training. Our Circle of Honor program recognizes drivers who have achieved 25 years or more of accident-free driving. This year we inducted more than 1,200 UPS drivers into the Circle of Honor, bringing the total to more than 10,400 around the globe. Congratulations to these drivers on their achievement. Turning to our results. 2023 is proving to be an interesting year. In the U.S., relative to our base plan, volume was higher than we expected in January, close to our plan in February, and then moved significantly lower than our plan in March as retail sales contracted and we saw a shift in consumer spending. For example, food as a percentage of household budgets reached 9% in the first quarter compared to 7% a couple of years ago. U.S. discretionary sales are lagging grocery and consumable sales and disposable income is shifting away from goods to services. Outside of the U.S., export activity out of Asia remained weak, which negatively impacted revenue in both international and supply chain solutions. In response, we focused on controlling what we could control. We remained in disciplined on price. We increased penetration in the most attractive parts of the market. We managed the network with agility, we drove productivity and we stayed on strategy. Looking at our first quarter financial results versus last year, consolidated revenue was $22.9 billion, down 6%. Operating profit was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 22.8% and consolidated operating margin was 11.1%, a decline of 250 basis points. While revenue fell short of our base plan due to a relentless focus on productivity both operating profit and operating margin were in line with our base plan. Moving to our strategic update, through our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy, we are investing to improve the customer experience and drive efficiency. Starting with Customer First. Key investments here are driving growth in targeted customer segments like SMBs and healthcare. Looking at SMBs, we continue to invest in the international expansion of our Digital Access Program or DAP. We now have 16 countries producing DAP revenue. In the first quarter, total DAP revenue was up 51.5% compared to last year, and we are on track to generate around $3 billion in DAP revenue this year. Did you know that in the U.S. about one out of every four DAP packages enters our network through a UPS store with more than 5,100 locations in the U.S., UPS stores are strategic assets. In fact, 85% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a store, giving customers ultra convenient entry points to the UPS network, whether they're in SMB shipping and item they've sold online or a customer returning an item they buy. Given the strategic importance of these stores, we are leaning into investments here to improve the customer experience. For example, the stores are rolling out self-service kiosks that enable customers to bypass the counter when they have shipments and returns, even returns with no box or no label. These kiosks make it easier for customers to get in and get out of the store. We've rolled out nearly 200 kiosks so far and we'll deploy 1,000 by the end of October this year and we're not stopping there. Another area of focus is improving the claims process, which used to be a hassle for both customers and franchisees. In March, the UPS store launched an online claims portal to all U.S. locations that's designed specifically for the needs of the store shipper. With this portal, claims that used to take weeks for resolution are now resolved within an average of about two gains. One final comment on SMBs. In the first quarter, SMBs including platforms made up 29.6% of our total U.S. volume. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of increased SMB penetration and it's the highest level we've seen in more than seven years. Turning to healthcare. In the first quarter of 2023, we expanded our global footprint by opening nearly 1 million square feet of dedicated healthcare space, including our first facility in Germany. This facility provides customers a broad range of temperature sensitive and handling solutions. Its location in the center of Germany connects our customer shipment, the fast growing European healthcare market. The facility is also closed to our European air hub in Cologne, enabling customers to leverage the speed and reach of our global network. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed the acquisition of Bomi Group and to date, revenue and cost synergy are running ahead of target. Further, we are continuing to invest in the global expansion of UPS Premier, which is now available in 45 countries with four more to be added this year. Our goal is to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world to help us get there who plan to open a total of seven dedicated healthcare facilities this year. In the first quarter, revenue from our healthcare portfolio reached $2.4 billion and we expect to generate over $10 billion in healthcare revenue in 2023. Turning to People Led, let me discuss the progress of our negotiations with the Teamsters. Negotiations on a new contract with the Teamsters are underway and good progress has been made on many of our local supplemental agreements. Together, we've set up five subcommittees at the national bargaining table to take on key areas of the contract, which enables us to move faster. We are aligned on several key issues like solving the staffing needs for weekend deliveries and ways to mitigate the summer heat in our package delivery vehicle. While we expect to hear a great deal of noise during the negotiation, I remain confident that a win-win-win contract is very achievable and that UPS and the Teamsters will reach agreement by the end of July. Now let's move to the last leg of our strategy Innovation Driven. We have the best, most efficient global integrated network in the world, and we are getting even better. Today, we operate our network with more agility than ever before, and when it comes to productivity, we are relentless about creating a virtuous cycle of improvement in our network. For example, our total service plan, which addresses running a predictable on-time network has delivered continued productivity improvements since being introduced last year. Our massive and highly complex network naturally generates efficiency when volume increases. But when volume levels drop, historically, it's been harder to generate productivity improvement. With total service plans, we have driven productivity even with declining volume. In the first quarter, U.S. volume declined by 5.4%, but ours declined even further, which resulted in improved productivity as measured by pieces per hour. As we've discussed last quarter, we've accelerated investment in our Smart Package Smart Facility RFID solution and plan to complete deployment in more than 900 buildings across the U.S. by the end of October. Throughout the process, we've continued to learn and improve, which has enabled stronger results than we originally expected. In the facilities where we have this technology, we've cut the frequency of misloads from around 1-in-400 packages to one-in-1,000 packages, which reduces miles, handles and costs and it improves, but the customer and employee experience. Innovation driven is also about combining digital capabilities with our integrated network to improve the customer experience and efficiency. Our upstream delivery density solution checks both boxes. This month, we are onboarding our second large national retailer, which gives us more opportunity to increase density as we can match volume in the UPS network with orders of participating customers. It's still early days of this initiative. As we learn, we continue to adjust the match rate algorithm and we are happy with the results. Lastly, our innovation driven initiatives are moving us towards our 2050 carbon neutrality goal. We are focused on the decarbonization of our global supply chain. In 2022, our Scope 1, 2, and 3 CO2 emissions declined by 6.9% from 2021. We've been investing in alternative fuel for more than 20 years and operate more than 15,600 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. Recently, we took delivery of 10 fully electric class 8 semi trucks in California. These trucks are quiet and they are the first zero emission semis to run in our UPS fleet. Our 2022 sustainability report was published on April 12. This is our 21st annual sustainability report, and you can find it on about.ups.com. Moving to our outlook for 2023, last quarter, we provided a range for our 2023 financial target. As we've discussed, there's been a deceleration in U.S. retail sales growth in certain non-U.S. markets remain challenged. As a result, we now expect to be at the low end of our previously provided revenue and operating profit margin range. Brian will share more detail in a moment. I've led three difficult times before and I've seen the power of making the right decisions and the pitfalls of making wrong decisions. In uncertain market conditions, it's easy to fall into the trap of managing the business for the short-term. While we will control what we can control, we will also stay on strategy. Over the past three years, we have fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business and we are just getting started. UPSs are the best in the industry, and because of them, I am convinced we will come out of this cycle faster, stronger, and with a wider lead on our competition. With that, thank you for listening, and now, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Well, David, thank you for your question. First, as it relates to productivity, we introduced our total service plan last year. That's not one and done. That's the way we're going to operate our business forever. Productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS. And Nando and the team continue to find opportunities to drive productivity in down markets as well as up markets. Just a little bit more color on that perhaps if you think about how we grew up as a company, if we build up a facility, we spun off a building and then we would build up another facility and spin off a building. As Nando and his team have looked at it, we found that, huh, we might be able to consolidate some of those spinoffs into highly automated buildings, drive productivity and not lose any drive time, not impact our customer service in any negative way. So we're looking at that, it's pretty exciting. And maybe just a little more color on volume, and then I'll go to your question about Teamsters. As we – as Brian detailed, the rate of acceleration in the year-over-year decline caused us pause because we were down around 3% in January, 5% in March – February and 7% in March. As we look at April, April has stabilized relative to how we exited March. So we feel very good that volume has stabilized. If we look at the year-over-year decline in the U.S. a little over 1 million packages today, we would attribute over 60%, nearly 62% of the decline due to macro and a plan decline with our largest customers. We're declining with them in a mutually agreed way. So it's really a macro story here and we're delighted to see that the volume has stabilized. To Brian's point, then, what gives us confidence that the volume will come back in the back half of the year. I'll share with you our strategy as it relates to sales. And this is a multifaceted strategy. It starts with keep to your point about volume diversion, which all by the way wasn't very much in the first quarter. We've assigned 127 high impact executives to over 380 customers representing about one third of our total volume. The role of the high impact executive is to meet with our customers, update them on our ongoing negotiations with the Teamsters and to keep them with us. The next element of our strategy is protect in the unlikely event of a work stoppage. And we're not counting on that because we are confident we're getting our contract. But in the unlikely event, we do have contingency plans to protect. The third leg of our strategy is to win back for any volume that has diverted. And we did have some it would be unreasonable to expect that we wouldn't have any for volume that has diverted. We are going to win it back because they've told us they're coming back. In fact, one customer just signed on the dotted line that they're coming back once we have a handshake. The third is to continue to sell. We are selling in the environment and we want to sell and close and pull through those new customers. And then finally is work the pipeline. We have a pipeline that's greater than $6 billion. That's hard to sell into right now because of that Teamsters negotiation. But we are going to go hard at it once we have that handshake deal. And we're going to go at it in a way that we've never done before because we will be using our dynamic pricing model. This is a very different way to go to market because we are creating value propositions for our customers that we haven't done before. Using the architecture of tomorrow pricing model that we've created, which creates the modifiers to base price it's a win for our customer and our win for UPS. So that's really how we're getting competent in the volume projections that we shared with you this morning. Now to your question about the Teamsters. It – we told you from the beginning that it was going to be noisy and that's turning out to be true. But let me just comment on the recent rhetoric. There was some noise about supplemental agreements. We have over 40 supplemental agreements with the Teamsters. We have been negotiating in good faith with the Teamsters on those supplemental agreements and have made very good progress. In fact, Teamsters leadership and UPS leadership were in Washington D.C. last week, both given in opening comments regarding the Master agreement. So I feel like we are very much on track as to our timeline to accomplish a win-win-win. And why am I competent about a win-win-win? Well, first of all, we are aligned on the Northstar. And the Northstar is that a thriving, growing UPS is good for Teamsters, it's good for UPS and it's good for our people. And when you are aligned on the Northstar, everything else can get worked out on some of the issues that Teamsters have been very public about. And we talked about it's the last time we had an earnings call. We're aligned. For example, we all agree that weekend delivery is table stakes because that's what consumers are expecting. We all agree it's how we go about doing that from an operating model perspective, that we need to work it out. Because of restrictions in our contract, in some instances, we have Teamsters working six days a week. Teamsters don't like that. I don't like that. If you want to work six days a week, that's fine with me, but if you don't, we shouldn't force you. So we've got to work that out. And there are a number of other issues just like that when we get to the bargaining table, we'll figure out a way to work it out. I'm highly confident that we're going to get a win-win-win agreement. But like any negotiation, it's going to be a noisy and a few bumps along the way. And I just had this argument with my husband about a puppy. It was noisy, it was stuffy [ph]. But in any negotiation, that's going to be the case and it's certainly the case here. And that's why I go back to our sales strategy of these high impact executives putting their arms around our customers and making sure they're comfortable with us because we are confident we'll deliver our contract. Thank you. Yes. May be just a comment on the pricing environment, the keep rate on the GRI is the high as it's been. In the United States, it's north of 60%. It's even higher outside of the United States. And maybe just a comment on that other expense line item because it does look out of sorts, we are moving to Software-as-a-Service. It's a line item move, right, Brian, you're the finance person here, but rather than depreciation's it's going to move into expect. So there's a little bit of a difference if you have Software-as-a-Service for your technology deployment versus what you build. Thank you. Well, here's what we're seeing in the business, week after week it's better. It's still down year-on-year, but it's better slowly coming out of this negative year-over-year decline of almost 20% in the first quarter. And Kate and her team are doing a masterful job of managing through that. In fact, if you look at productivity outside the United States, our Asia export business down 8.9%, our block hours were down 14% and she's taking more block hours out in the second quarter even with improvements just to optimize VR [ph] network. And on the volume question, again, it goes back to our sales strategy. We have pretty good visibility into the pipeline. We're just going to pull that pipeline through. In today's environment with the contract negotiation about a 100 days out to completion, it's kind of hard to get it pulled through, but we're going to pull it through when we get that handshake deal. We are definitely seeing business wins. And I'm – I have to give a hat off to our sales team for selling through this environment. We are delivering packages for customers that we've never delivered before. Why? Because our service is the best in the industry. But what we see with some of our long-term existing large customers is that their business is changing. And I can give you a few anecdotes if that's helpful. One of our large customers reports publicly every month their same-store sales. This is a customer who for 80 quarters in a row had positive same-store sales and in the month of March saw negative same-store sales. One of our other customers who has both in-store sales as well as online sales has seen a shift in their customer shopping behavior from online to stores. So they're shutting down shifts inside of their warehouses, which make sense for them. So they receive generally macro and a change in consumer behavior impacting our volume, but we're winning and we just got to go win faster and we will win faster when the uncertainty is behind us. I'm quite convinced of the Teamster negotiation. Customers say, we'd like to ship with you, we're just going to sit on the sidelines till you're done. So we just need to get done. And we will. So to your first question, we don't see volume disruption because of pricing. We do see product change however. If you looked at our air product in the quarter, it was down year-on-year, more than ground. We see customers moving out of air to ground. Why? Well, we've really worked to improve our time in transit. So we've got the fastest time in transit now, so you can get your package where it needs to go quicker than before. And people are looking for value. So I can watch customer by customer moving out of air to SurePost, by the way. SurePost is up in the quarter, almost 2%. And convenience matters from returns. If you want to get that package back so you get credit back into your wallet, you want a convenient place to return. And with our locations near 85% of the U.S. population within 10 miles of 85% of the U.S. population were extraordinarily convenient. So we look out – we don't look in the current moment. We look out for where we both want to go as growing and thriving UPS is in the best interest of Teamsters, UPS, and our people. So the current economic environment, it is what it is, but our negotiations are all about the future. We do look at the profitability of stores. Because I'm curious, I'm an old retailer. So are the stores profitable? The stores are very profitable, which means franchisees are happy. We add about 100 new stores every year, because this is a great small business to own. And in terms of the royalty fee that comes into our company, there's some expenses against that. But if you look at the margin against that royalty fee, I would say, it's the highest margin business that we've got. Well, you might share the split of variable, semi variable and fixed."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. PJ Guido, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nPJ Guido: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Dykes, our CFO and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the Federal Securities Laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2023 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion today refers to non-GAAP adjusted results. For the third quarter of 2024, GAAP results include an after-tax net gain of $36 million or $0.04 per diluted share, comprised of a $152 million gain from the divestiture of our Coyote Logistics business, net of transformation strategy costs of $116 million. Transformation strategy costs consisted of after-tax costs of $81 million related to our Fit to Serve program and $35 million related to our Transformation 2.0 program. Additional detail on our transformation costs and initiatives as well as a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted amounts to GAAP financial results is available in today's webcast materials. These materials will also be available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now, I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, PJ, and good morning. On our last earnings call, we said that the second quarter would not only be the bottom, but a turning point for our performance and that we would return to revenue and profit growth in the third quarter, which we did. I would like to recognize and thank UPSers for their hard work and efforts. Their relentless focus on driving productivity while ensuring excellent customer service allowed us to deliver these results. In the third quarter, we faced a macro environment that was slightly worse than we expected. In the U.S., online sales slowed and manufacturing activity was lower than we anticipated. This slowdown in manufacturing activity was also true outside of the U.S. as we continue to see lower industrial production weigh on volume in certain geographies. But the macro-environment didn't prevent us from growing revenue and profit. As we leaned into the parts of the market that value our end-to-end network and we drove expense leverage through ongoing productivity initiatives. In the third quarter, our consolidated revenue was $22.2 billion, an increase of 5.6% versus last year. Consolidated operating profit was $2 billion, up 22.8% from last year and consolidated operating margin was 8.9%. In the U.S., this was the second consecutive quarter of average daily volume growth, and it was our highest year-over-year ADV growth rate since the first quarter of 2021. In International, average daily volume growth finished flattish and continued the upward momentum we've seen since the first quarter of this year. And in SCS, air and ocean forwarding contributed to strong revenue growth. Looking at the U.S., during the quarter, we focused on growing certain pockets of commercial business and grew B2B volume by nearly 1% compared to last year. One of the areas of commercial focus was retail B2B. Our B2B routes are in retail. In fact, we deliver merchandise to over 20,000 retail outlets across the country. To serve these customers, we offer a store replenishment with delivery window solution that provides retailers daily inventory replenishment within a two-hour window. Within this solution, we also provide visibility to the number of packages scheduled to be delivered. Our store replenishment solution, along with our RFID technology enables retailers to reduce stockouts and more efficiently run their receiving operations. This is just one example of how our customer-focused capabilities are enabling us to win new commercial volume. Now that U.S. volume is flowing back into our network, we have heightened our attention to revenue quality with a focus on the segments of the market we want to serve. You will recall that in the second quarter, we saw an unexpected surge of short zone lightweight e-commerce packages flow into our network. In the third quarter, we responded strategically, adjusting our pricing and optimizing our operating plans on a portion of this business. Further, we increased our focus on matching our pricing to the quality and attributes of the service we provide. We did this by leveraging the power of pricing science through our pricing architecture of tomorrow or AOT technology. Our revenue per piece growth rate improved in the third quarter from what we reported in the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. On the cost side, our team did an excellent job of managing expenses across the board. As it relates to our two major cost-out initiatives, we are continuing to deliver solid results. Fit to Serve, which was designed to optimize and rightsize our management structure, is slightly ahead of forecast. And with Network of the Future, so far this year, we've completed 45 operational closures, including nine full buildings that have been shut down. I'd like to give you a brief update on our customer-first, people-led innovation-driven strategy, starting with customer-first. As we discussed, we have a goal to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. To that end, we said we would pursue certain inorganic opportunities and we have. Last month, we entered into an agreement to acquire Frigo-Trans, a move that will enhance our end-to-end temperature-sensitive healthcare capabilities across Europe. Today, 80% of pharmaceuticals in Europe require temperature-controlled transportation. Frigo-Trans offers pan-European cold-chain transportation as well as temperature-controlled and time-critical freight forwarding capabilities. Plus, Frigo-Trans has temperature-controlled warehousing capabilities with every temperature from cryopreservation, which is minus 196 degrees Celsius to ambience, which is about 25 degrees Celsius. We are targeting to close the Frigo-Trans acquisition in the first quarter of next year. Complex healthcare logistics is a growing business for us and we're continuing to invest in the capabilities needed to accelerate growth. We have dedicated healthcare facilities in 36 countries and provide specialized handling and visibility to our customers through our UPS premier product. In the third quarter, we generated $2.5 billion in consolidated healthcare revenue, which contributed to revenue growth across all three segments. Shifting to International. In time for the holidays, we've made several enhancements. In September, we expanded residential Saturday delivery to the eight largest markets in Europe without an additional charge. This enhancement meets our customers' need for speed, and we now provide a superior service offering. Further, we sped up deliveries to over 35 countries across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. And to meet the expected demand for this year's peak holiday season, we added over 200 flights connecting Asia to Europe and the U.S. Quickly touching on DAP, our Digital Access Program, DAP continues to deliver strong SMB growth in both B2B and B2C segments. In the first nine months of this year, we generated $2.3 billion in global GAAP revenue, and we expect to deliver over $3 billion in GAAP revenue for the full year. As you know, we have been onboarding our new air cargo business with the United States Postal Service. During the third quarter, our network planning teams worked closely with the USPS to ensure the transition progressed smoothly and it did. As of October 1, all contracted USPS air cargo business has been fully onboarded and we expect this business to deliver strong consistent revenue at an attractive margin. Moving to People-led. Since our founding, we've had a culture of driving safe work practices. And by using new technology and tools, we've seen a dramatic improvement in the number of injuries and accidents. For example, in the U.S., this year we've had our best auto safety results in 10 years. The advances in safety were achieved through innovative driver education and training, like our Integrad driver training schools. This focus on safety enables driver achievements like our Circle of Honor, which recognizes drivers with 25 years or more of driving without an accident. Today, our Circle of Honor has grown to nearly 10,000 drivers. Now let's turn to Innovation Driven, which for this call is all about the peak holiday season. This year's holiday season has only 17 shipping days between Black Friday and Christmas Eve. We haven't seen such a compressed peak since 2019. We do peak better than anyone and with six years in a row of industry leading service, we're confident our plans and execution will make that seven. To prepare, we've been collaborating with our customers on daily volume expectations and the timing of their promotions. While our customers are still expecting a good holiday selling season, recently, shippers have tempered their volume expectations. In any case, we'll be ready to deliver and we'll leverage our network planning tools and other proven technologies to control first how the volume comes in. Second, how to flow more volume to our automated facilities. And third, how to adjust the network to operate as efficiently as possible. And talking about efficiency. This year on our peak day, which is December 18th in the U.S. we expect to deliver 2 million more packages than we did on peak day last year, but we'll do it at a higher productivity rate. This will be possible due to the efficiency improvements we've made over the years and the use of seasonal support drivers, many of which are experienced part time UPSers who work inside our facilities. To sum it up, we're ready to deliver another successful peak. Moving to our financial outlook, we continue our better, not bigger approach, enhanced by some bold moves. The addition of the USPS air cargo business and the divestiture of Coyote are recent examples. With these moves, we eliminated a highly volatile truckload brokerage business and added air cargo volume that is predictable and margin positive. Looking at our consolidated revenue outlook in the third quarter, we increased our emphasis on revenue quality resulting in a glide down of certain volume which we expect will continue into the fourth quarter. Given our third quarter results, our latest peak volume expectations, and adjusting for the impact of the Coyote disposition, we now expect consolidated revenue of approximately $91.1 billion for the year and are lifting our consolidated operating margin target to approximately 9.6%. Brian will provide more details. So with that, thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Dykes: Thank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will cover our third quarter results, review our capital allocation for the year, and then I'll wrap up by providing additional detail for our fourth quarter and full year financial outlook. Starting with our results, in the third quarter, we returned to revenue and profit growth the first time in two years. Looking at our consolidated performance, in the third quarter, we generated $22.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 5.6% compared to the third quarter of last year, with all three of our business segments delivering revenue growth. Consolidated operating profit was $2 billion, an increase of 22.8% versus the third quarter of 2023, and consolidated operating margin was 8.9%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.76, up 12.1% from the third quarter of 2023. Now let's look at our business segment. In the U.S. domestic segment, our performance in the third quarter was driven by two factors. First was strong volume growth, the highest growth rate we've seen in more than three years. And second was excellent cost management, which resulted in a year-over-year decrease in cost per piece of 4.1%. U.S. Average Daily Volume or ADV increased 6.5% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Looking at product mix in the third quarter, ground average daily volume increased 8.9%, while total air average daily volume was down 6.3%. We continue to see customers shifting down from air to ground and some ground volume is shifting down to SurePost. Within ground, SurePost volume levels rose slightly compared to the second quarter, driven by growth in our Digital Access program. While SurePost volume comes at a lower revenue per piece, given the enhancements we've made to our matching algorithm, we were able to redirect more SurePost packages into our network, driving delivery density. For the quarter, B2B average daily volume was up 0.8% year-over-year, increasing for the first time in two years. Growth was driven by SMBs, which had an increase in B2B average daily volume of 3.8%. B2C average daily volume increased 11% year-over-year and made up 58.3% of our volume, a slight downward shift from the second quarter. In terms of customer mix, we saw ADV growth from both enterprise and SMB customers. SMBs made up 29.4% of total U.S. volume in the third quarter. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.5 billion, up 5.8% compared to last year, driven by strong volume growth. As expected, U.S. domestic revenue per piece was down year-over-year. In the third quarter, revenue per piece declined 2.2% year-over-year, but showed a 40 basis point sequential improvement from the second quarter. Breaking down the components, first, we took actions to address revenue quality, which translated into higher base rates. In the quarter, base rates increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 170 basis points. Second, the combination of product mix, lighter weights and shorter zones decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 300 basis points. And finally, we experienced a 90 basis point decline in the revenue per piece growth rate due to the combination of changes in customer mix and fuel. Turning to costs. As you all recall, the cost of our new labor contract was front end loaded. As of the end of July, we lapped the first year of the contract and for the quarter, Union wage rate growth slowed to 5.2% year-over-year. Productivity is a virtuous cycle at UPS and in the third quarter, we took several actions to drive productivity. Through our Network of the Future initiative, this year, we've completed 45 operational closures, contributing to an 8% improvement in pieces per workforce hour. While 8% might not seem like a big number, that translated into an efficiency gain of 11 million hours. Production improvements, including total service plan offset 50% of the Union wage increase and we continued to see positive trends in our safety performance, which contributed to lower expense. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $974 million in operating profit, a 46.5% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023, and the operating margin was 6.7%, a year-over-year increase of 180 basis points. Moving to our International segment. In the third quarter, our international business grew revenue and operating profit and expanded operating margin for the first time in nearly three years. This performance was driven by strength in exports in 13 of our top 20 export countries. Total international average daily volume growth continued its sequential improvement trend from the second quarter and was about flat to last year. In the third quarter, international revenue was $4.4 billion, up 3.4% from last year, with all regions growing revenue year-over-year. International revenue per piece increased 2.5%, driven by strong base pricing and the positive impact of region and product mix. Touching on costs, total international expense was relatively flat year-over-year, which was achieved by optimizing our network and our ongoing cost management efforts. Operating profit in the International segment was $792 million, an increase of 17.3% year-over-year. Operating margin in the third quarter was 18%, an increase of 220 basis points from a year ago. Moving to Supply Chain Solutions. In the third quarter, revenue was $3.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, air and ocean forwarding revenue was up 15.1%, driven by strong market demand out of Asia. Logistics delivered revenue growth driven primarily by the impact of the MNX acquisition and onboarding of USPS air cargo contributed to revenue growth in SCS. Partially offsetting these gains was weaker performance at Coyote, our truckload brokerage business and the completion of the sale in mid-September. In the third quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $217 million, down $58 million year-over-year, primarily driven by our efforts to configure our air network as we onboarded the USPS air cargo business. Now that we have fully onboarded this volume, we expect it to generate consistent revenue and we expect an attractive margin on a consolidated basis. For SCS, operating margin in the third quarter was 6.4%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $230 million of interest expense, our other pension income was $68 million, and our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 21%. Now let's turn to cash and capital allocation. So far this year, we've generated $6.8 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $4 billion, including our annual pension contribution of $1.4 billion. We refinanced $1.5 billion in current maturities year-to-date, and we finished the quarter with strong liquidity and no outstanding commercial paper. So far this year, UPS has paid $4 billion in dividends. And lastly, we've completed our targeted $500 million share repurchase program in the third quarter, which brings us to our outlook. In July, we provided an update to our full year financial targets based on global economic forecast and our performance in the first half of the year. Now looking ahead at the full year, we have updated our outlook to reflect three things. First, our third-quarter results and the focus on revenue quality; second, the sale of Coyote; and finally, new softer peak volume forecast from our customers. At the consolidated level, we now expect full year revenue of approximately $91.1 billion. Due to our focus on revenue quality, coupled with the efficiency of our integrated network and our ability to manage costs, we are lifting our consolidated operating margin expectation to approximately 9.6% to align with these new volume and revenue expectations. Now looking at the segments in the fourth quarter. Starting with U.S. domestic, we expect the combination of both volume and revenue per piece growth to increase revenue by 1.5% in the fourth quarter. We expect to generate a fourth quarter operating margin of approximately 9.5%, and we now expect the operating margin in December to be slightly higher than 10%. Looking at International. We expect the positive volume momentum we've experienced throughout the year will continue. With that in mind, we expect fourth-quarter revenue growth to be up mid-single digits year-over-year and we still expect around a 20% operating margin in the fourth quarter. In Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter of around $3.3 billion, which takes into consideration the disposition of Coyote, and we expect to generate an operating margin of approximately 9%. Turning to capital allocation. For the full year in 2024, we expect free cash flow to be around $5.1 billion after the $1.4 billion pension contribution we made to fund annual service costs. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $4 billion. We plan to pay around $5.4 billion in dividends subject to Board approval. And lastly, we expect the tax rate for the full year to be between 23% and 23.5%. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the time and taking the questions. So when we think about the ramp here from 3Q into 4Q, the operating profit guidance sort of suggests a close to a 50% bump from 3Q to 4Q. Can -- Brian, maybe can you walk us through some of the drivers of what makes that look realistic? And then if you think about that -- those drivers taking hold, how does that affect sort of the shape of profitability as we carry into 2025?\nBrian Dykes: Sure. Thank you, David, and I appreciate the question. And yes, we do have an increase from Q3 to Q4 on the profit side. And really it's driven by a couple of things. One, as we mentioned, this focus on revenue quality and the moves that we've made to drive revenue improvement, both through pricing policy as well as the take rate that we're seeing on HCS coupled with the acceleration of Fit to Serve and Network of the Future and just the productivity initiatives give us the incremental bump over the normal seasonality. We feel very confident in both of those and we're seeing them actually start to come through in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter on the revenue side. And you can see from our cost performance, we feel that the Fit to Serve and NOS stuff is sticking very well.\nDavid Vernon: And then how that's going to affect sort of into 2025?\nBrian Dykes: Yes. And so as we roll through '24, you can see that we've raised the consolidated margin. We do expect the domestic margin to be around 9.5%. And now we do expect to exit the year higher than -- slightly higher than the 10% that we guided to before. We'll come back to you as we get through peak on '25, but we want to close out peak first.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thank you.\nBrian Dykes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe can you expand a little bit more on the softness you're seeing into peak season? What type of themes and concerns maybe you're hearing from the customers as they sort of dialed down their expectations on volume? And maybe within that a broader comment on the pricing and the surcharges ticking if you're getting more pushback on that or seeing more trade-downs at this point? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Well, I'll start with the customer feedback. We work with a little over 100 of our customers who represent 60% of the volume in our network, but 85% of the peak surge. So we develop operating plans for each of these customers. And these plans have been in process now for months. As the year has progressed, they continue to tighten up their forecast and we just received their last forecast on October 2. And their forecast have been tempered and we believe it's driven by a couple of factors. First, external forecast for the holiday season have come in. In fact, the forecast for ESMO in the fourth quarter is now about 3%. Earlier in the year, it had been about 5%. If you look at just the peak part of the holiday season, forecasts are all over the board, candidly from a low of 2% to a high of 11% and SMB Global has it at about 3.5%. Part of this, we believe, is influenced by the tight compressed peak period. There are only 17 shipping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. And what forecasters and some of our customers are saying is because of the tightness of the shipping season that many customers will go into a store to complete their holiday purchases. The consumer actually is in pretty good shape, but we think there'll be some dynamics in how the consumer shops during the peak season. So it will still be a good peak. In fact, in our prepared remarks, we called out that on peak day, we'll deliver 2 million more packages than we did last year. It will still be a good peak, but just not as dynamic as people thought at the beginning of the year. Whatever happens, we're prepared. We're prepared to handle the volume. And then on the pricing surcharge, we're seeing a really good take rate on the pricing surcharge for the holiday, I should say. And maybe Matt Guffey is here. Matt, perhaps you want to comment on the holiday surcharge?\nMatt Guffey: Yes, absolutely. So first off, we're working closely in collaboration with all of our customers. Carol talked about the top 100, which are extremely important just due to the peakiness that they bring during the season. But we've really worked again. We've got a good structure and a process in place where we can manage our holiday demand surcharge at the customer level and we have a lot more flexibility to work with them as we go through the peak season. Look, at the end of it, it's all about us creating -- continuing to drive value and -- with our customers and to deliver a great peak. So we're staying close on the forecast, but also working very closely with them on this holiday demand surcharge.\nCarol Tome: And we're seeing a good keep rate on…\nMatt Guffey: Very -- yes, very, very good keep rate, probably one of the best keep rates we've seen, so.\nBrian Dykes: And Brian, I would just add that we're on our plan, if you remember, there were changes because of the compressed peak that opened the peak -- the holiday demand surcharge to a larger set of volume, right, and that's what drives some of the incremental outperformance year-over-year that you're seeing.\nCarol Tome: Yes.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to drill down a little bit on the cost improvement on a per piece basis in domestic, so down about 4%. It was better than what we were looking for. I guess maybe two pieces to the question. How do you think about that progress potential in the fourth quarter? And then maybe widening out a little bit with some of the initiatives that you're working on bigger picture about managing the footprint as well as maybe the headcount, how do we think this can trend as we move into 2025?\nCarol Tome: So why don't you take the fourth quarter question and then we'll turn to Nando for some thoughts.\nBrian Dykes: Great. Yes, thank you. And yes, it's a great question because the cost performance in the third quarter was outstanding, right? And I think there's a couple of dynamics that are going on. As we said in our earlier remarks, we lapped the contract at the end of July, right? So you start to see that high wage inflation that we talked about in the second quarter as being 12%, now coming down to 5.2% and we will now get a full clean quarter of wage inflation at a normalized level in Q4. But also, as we mentioned, we've accelerated Fit to Serve and are now outperforming our forecast as well, as you'll see from the Network of the Future discussion that -- we've closed more sorts and we've closed more buildings. So we're pulling that forward, which helps in the cost performance. As we carry into Q4, we do expect to have strong cost performance. We'll probably be up about 1% per piece, which is still going to be less than our rev per piece growth rate. So we'll maintain a positive spread, but it'll be a little bit more normal as you go through it. Nando, you want to talk a little bit about network in future now we're pulling things forward?\nNando Cesarone: Yes. Thanks, Brian. And look, you may be asking how are we able to have 45 operational closures and nine buildings that we've closed. We are moving much more volume about 5% through our automated facilities and we're also making sure that our legacy of production indices are performing the way we expect them to perform. The teams are doing an excellent job allowing us to really shrink the network and be a lot more productive. Safety of course helped. And at the end of the day, it comes down to hours and people, and we were down about 11 million hours compared to the last year. So really just an excellent job all around. And the last thing I would say is there's nothing that we're overlooking so every piece of our business, from car wash to automated dispatching, we are prepared for all of it and looking and scrutinizing all of that cost and finding some good improvements there.\nCarol Tome: All the while maintaining outstanding service levels, which is job number one for UPS. And just to put the 5% number that Nando mentioned into perspective, he's talking about automated volume through our hubs, right. And we now processed 63% of the volume in our hubs in some sort of an automated way. That's up 5 percentage points from a year ago. That's pretty good.\nBrian Dykes: Absolutely. And look, we've got 21 active projects here in this quarter. You would think it's peak season. Why would we take that undertaking? We have full confidence that that's going to provide very good productivity improvements. And then next year, we're accelerating and pulling in the number of projects that we can execute in 2025.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go-ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning and congratulations on the strong results. I wanted to ask a bit about, Carol, you started the call. I think you commented about some industrial economy weakness. You're clearly doing some idiosyncratic -- excuse me, idiosyncratic things that are going well. How do you think about as we go into 2025, how much of margin improvement would be in your control? And if you don't see improvement in macro, is it reasonable to translate improvement in revenue per piece and network of the future, those things to margin expansion? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Well, I think our team has done a masterful job of managing a very choppy environment over the past several years, actually. And as we think about our business outside the United States, we saw improvement in every quarter this year. In fact, our export business grew in the third quarter and domestic was down just slightly. So, Kate, maybe you want to talk about how you would manage the business outside the United States if the industrial production remains softish?\nKate Gutmann: Yes, absolutely. And I think the quarter was a good example of that. The macro indicators have come down, but yet we've expanded the revenue, profit and margin in the international business and posting an 8% margin. We intend to continue to run those same plays. Let me go into a few. Just as Nando indicated, on the domestic side, 60% of our volume goes through automated hubs and that's for the domestic and transporter of all of our large international volume markets. And then on the air side of the house, we continue to show that revenue quality matters, especially when you have expensive assets and we align with demand. So we had strong rev per piece for international we held our cost CPP flat and so delivered operating leverage. We would continue to do that into the next year.\nCarol Tome: And in-markets that are soft to win, you gain share. And you gain share not by dropping price, but by actually increasing your capability. And our Saturday delivery is one example of that. We are the only carrier that offers standard Saturday delivery at no charge in these eight markets. And that's driving some nice performance, isn't it, Kate? We just started it.\nKate Gutmann: It really is. And so Europe and Canada exceeding expectations, unlocking more of the customer share of wallet and in the premium spaces too. So cross border trade we're seeing growth with the expansion of our service out of Asia to Europe as well as throughout intra-Asia we've made the lanes faster and as a result that premium unlock and by the way with rev per piece growing. So we feel good about the equations and we'll definitely continue it.\nTom Wadewitz: Do you -- I don't think I asked the question well. I actually was thinking a little bit about domestic in terms of the margin.\nCarol Tome: So I think in the domestic side, productivity is a virtuous cycle here. And as Nando pointed out, there's nothing that's not under review, right. Everything is under review and we continue to drive productivity that exceeds our expectations. Brian, anything you want to add?\nBrian Dykes: Yes, I would just say so. So if you remember, look, we've got a contract that locked up that we have known costs for the next four years for 60% of our domestic cost structure. With the focus on revenue quality and our ability to win more and win new in the places where we really want to, like you saw in the third quarter with commercial and SMB commercial growing -- starting to grow again, we do think we have the ability to: One, continue to take action to drive rev per piece ourselves as well as Carol said, productivity -- production is a virtuous cycle with a known cost structure as we go into '25.\nCarol Tome: And we like that commercial business. We -- it's got a more dense delivery metric associated with that, in other words, more packages per delivery. And one way we can win commercial is with new capabilities. So we had a big win in the third quarter and the determining factor for this customer to come into our network were our RFID labels. So that's a new capability that we didn't have before.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Conor Cunningham, your line is open. Check your mute button. Okay, we'll move on. We'll go to the line of Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, hi. Morning. Question for you. So a little bit more on the U.S. Postal onboarding. If I could maybe if you could share some of the experience. I know you had the upfront step up costs, but as it's still, a few weeks in, perhaps talk about how the operations are going there. Is it delivering on the profit levels that you had talked about and just any general thoughts around how that's going to contribute going forward? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: Well, as you point out, Jordan, we did have a bit of a transition in the third quarter. The USPS contract with their previous carrier expired October 1st. And we didn't want to wait until October 1st to onboard that volume because peak is right around the corner. So we agreed with the USPS that we would operationalize this service to them, while over-time, they onboarded their volume. And it was over-time, actually, we didn't get much weight until September. So there was a mismatch between our operational model and the volume. But now the volume is all in. So the fourth quarter is going to look a lot different than the third quarter did. And from a performance perspective, Nando, you just met with the Postmaster General. And so tell us what he said.\nNando Cesarone: Sure. So as early as yesterday, we meet face-to-face and yesterday the purpose was peak planning. So both teams face-to-face in DC and we're working really well. Professionals on both sides that have executed a very difficult plan and made it look very, very simple. Feedback from the Postmaster General himself has been positive and we see the resources that we've applied are in-line with what we had modeled when we have accepted the business and the contract was negotiated with the USPS. So good things ahead for that contract.\nCarol Tome: And I just can't overemphasize the heavy lift here. In fact, it was over 50 million cubic feet that we had to take into our network in the third quarter and there'll be more obviously in the fourth. So job well done by our team in working with the USPS as well.\nNando Cesarone: Absolutely.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow up on another piece of the postal service relationship. Can you talk about where you are in negotiating the delivery service agreement that enables SurePost in Sunday delivery with their effort to renegotiate some of those contracts? And maybe along with that, what challenges does that create either on cost-to-serve or Sunday delivery operations, but also what opportunities might that create for your own trucks to deliver more packages in the marketplace in a world where the post office is seeking to retain more upstream business and push customers into that? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Well, thanks for the question. And Matt, why don't you take on this question?\nMatt Guffey: Yes. So first-off, so we -- to Nando's point, we had an opportunity to meet with the PMG yesterday. We continually work to find a mutually agreeable agreement for both USPS and UPS. More work to be done, but we are moving very, very quickly and hopefully, we'll have this to a close in very short order.\nCarol Tome: And to your question about what challenges and what opportunities, I think it's some and some. I think it's some and some. And so once we get this contract agreed to, we'll show you what those sum and some are, but we're confident we can work through this.\nBascome Majors: In the expiration, I believe you've said before, it's at year-end. Can you confirm roughly when we should hear more on that and what the go forward relationship will be?\nCarol Tome: Yes, you should hear something about it in our fourth quarter earnings.\nBrian Dykes: Yes. No impact in the fourth quarter. We'll tell you more about it when we come back with the fourth quarter earnings in January.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAri Rosa: Hi, good morning. I was hoping if you could give us a sense of how much excess capacity you see in the network right now. Just trying to understand how you're thinking about planning kind of given the weaker outlook in terms of both customer demand and also industrial production and some of the weakness in the macro. How do you think about kind of matching resources to that lower volume? And do you think you're carrying excess resources right now?\nCarol Tome: So I think our team has done an excellent job of taking capacity out of the market. In fact, with 45 million -- 45 operational closures, it's about 1 million ADV per day of capacity that we've taken out of the market and we see capacity rationalization happening in other parts of the market as well. Clearly, it's peak time. So we're all adding resources to handle the surge in the holiday, but capacity is coming in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hi, thanks, good morning. So how much, if any, does the new USPS contract help the fourth quarter U.S. margin just with the cost allocation? And then I don't -- Carol, I just -- big-picture, right, you're now saying margins in the U.S. in Q4 are going to be -- they'll be slightly positive. We've now lapped the Teamster contract, yields are now turning positive. That's good. Peak season surcharges. Just big picture, like when do we start to see more meaningful margin improvement? Does that start right away in '25? Or does that take some more time?\nCarol Tome: First, why don't we address the path to the fourth quarter?\nBrian Dykes: Sure, sure. So, hi, Scott, and thank you for the question. So on the USPS contract, so we put a network in place that was all part of the plan. There's no incremental impact to domestic in the fourth quarter from the USPS contract. The cost that we -- the cost that Carol referred to was start-up costs associated with getting the contract stood up that was -- that impacted SCS, doesn't impact domestic. And in the fourth quarter, we'll see SCS go back to 9 -- about 9% and domestic to around 9.5%. So I don't think that's going to impact us there.\nCarol Tome: No. And then in terms of when are we going to see more meaningful margin expansion, let us get through the fourth quarter and then we'll give you our outlook for 2025.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about our domestic RPP trends throughout the quarter. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about how they trended as the months progressed and really what this means for 4Q and your thoughts into 2025 if you have them? Thanks.\nBrian Dykes: Sure. Thanks for the question, Stephanie. Yes, so we saw positive momentum going from Q2 to Q3 in domestic rev per piece. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, really when you think about what happened in the base rate, in the second quarter, base rate added about 90 basis points of improvement to rev per piece. In the third quarter, that jumped to 170 basis points. Now as we translate into the fourth quarter, we actually expect rev per piece to inflect positive in the U.S. and that's really driven by a couple of things. Look, we talked about actions that we were going to take around specific customers that were enabled by our architecture of tomorrow and the work that we've been doing and investments have been made to create more sensitive demand channels, DAP and AOT and the modifiers. And we're leveraging those in order to make adjustments to help drive rev per piece. The other thing is what we're doing on the surcharging and the GRIs that we will continue to see lift as we go through the fourth quarter and into '25. So look, it's a positive trajectory on rev per piece and it's clearly an area of focus as we move from our year-one to our plus two strategy.\nCarol Tome: And pricing architecture of tomorrow is really moving from the art to the science of pricing. And one of the elements of this architecture are modifiers that we use, modifiers that can provide discounts to our customers or modifiers that allow us to increase the price. And I'll just give you a real life example of what happened in the third quarter to help you understand. In the third quarter, we had a discount modifier that we adjusted, basically test the elasticity. We reduced the discount by 25%, which increased the RPP by 12% and reduced the volume by 26%. We liked that trade. And because it's a modifier, it's not a contract that has to be reopened and renegotiated. You just adjust the model. And this is just one element of pricing architecture of tomorrow that we will use not only in the fourth quarter, but in '25 and beyond.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJoe Enderlin: Hi guys, this is Joe Enderlin on for Daniel. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask another one actually on revenue per piece. One of your peers noted increased price competition in the market. Just are you seeing any of that today? And then do you think we've felt peak trade-down pressures yet?\nBrian Dykes: So I'll start on the price pressures. Look, we -- just in a very price-competitive industry, but we think it's very rational, right? And when you look bid-for-bid and product-to-product, it is very rational. We know we have to win on capabilities and that's where we continue to add. With every customer every day, it's -- you got to deliver service to do it. It starts with us with service and then we add incremental capabilities like RFID to win where we really want to win most. And I point that as Carol mentioned, we've had big enterprise commercial wins through that. We also have seen commercial now grow nearly 1% for the first time this year as we really started to catch that from the contract, that's been a big momentum point. And then specifically, SMB commercial growing 3.8%. Those sorts of things allow -- the capabilities that we have, allow us to win more and win new in those areas that help drive rev per piece growth despite a very competitive rate environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question and congrats on growth for the first time in a couple of years here. Good to see. Carol, I think you mentioned something about enterprise customers. And I know in the past, you've talked about glide down. So can you just put that in context as you head into 2025? And then just very quickly on Fit to Serve, I didn't get it, but is that going to incrementally deliver more in the fourth quarter? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: So first on the customer glide down, we have, as you know, been in a glide-down arrangement with our largest customer and they continue to be our largest customer. I think it's fair to say that we have seen them drive a lot of the reduction in our air volume. In fact, if I look at the third quarter performance, 100% of the decline in air volume was down about 6.5% that is attributable to the largest customer. So they, like many, trading down from air to ground and in their case, a little bit of ground out to their own network. But we're fine with that because it creates opportunity for us to grow in other areas. And then looking ahead...\nBrian Dykes: And then on the Fit to Serve point, yes, so we do expect about $70 million incremental to go about $350 million in the fourth quarter, and we've seen great progress with that program.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAdam Rakowski: Hi, good morning. This is Adam Rakowski on for Ken Hoexter. You noted in the release that you are a - scope of the Fit to Serve initiative, which previously called for a reduction of about 12,000 positions. Could you just expand on what that means? Is there -- has that actually accelerated this quarter? And just any thoughts on how you would expand the scope and what you would target there? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: So you're just asking for a status update on Fit to Serve?\nBrian Dykes: Sure. Yes. On Fit to Serve, as we said, we have pulled forward incremental savings opportunities. We are -- we hit the full run rate that we expected. We will have some incremental benefit as we wrap into the fourth quarter, but we're continuing forward with it as planned.\nCarol Tome: And to your question, do you have additional opportunities. We are an opportunity rich company. And as you heard from Nando, we're looking at all opportunities to drive a better experience for our customer and actually higher productivity,\nBrian Dykes: Greg, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shankar: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So maybe just to follow-up on the holiday side, I think you announced a pretty big step up in your hiring for the first time in many years. I know it's a peak compressed -- compressed earnings peak season. But what's the logic behind that, if you're seeing a little bit of a reduction in customer experience or expectations on volumes here, how do we think of squaring that? And is there like a minimum surcharge bogey you guys need to kind of COVID the extra costs? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: So last year we announced that we were hiring 100,000 for the peak holiday season and our ADV declined 7.4%. This year we announced that we're hiring 125,000 and our ADV will be positive. So it's not out of the realm of reason that we should hire more people this year than we did last year. But this is what you need to know. We will hire what we need for peak regardless of where the volume actually ends up. We're not going to over hire for peak. We will hire what we need. And what we've done over time, Ravi, is we've added this amazing capability where within just a few -- less than an hour, just a few minutes, we can actually get a job offer out or we can rescind a job offer so we can flex up or flex down the way we need to. And Nando, would you like to add anything?\nNando Cesarone: Yes. I would just say the number also includes a favorable employee mix. So this year, we're adding -- we're going to increase our helper teams with our drivers by about 10%. That's not a small number. So a big percentage of our volume will be delivered by helpers, seasonal helpers that can deliver at Christmas time and we've amped that up and make sure that we've got every position optimized and that is the number, as Carol had said, and we're going to deliver a great peak season.\nRavi Shankar: Thank you.\nPJ Guido: Thank you, Greg. This concludes our call. Thank you all for joining and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Dykes",
            "content": "Thank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will cover our third quarter results, review our capital allocation for the year, and then I'll wrap up by providing additional detail for our fourth quarter and full year financial outlook. Starting with our results, in the third quarter, we returned to revenue and profit growth the first time in two years. Looking at our consolidated performance, in the third quarter, we generated $22.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 5.6% compared to the third quarter of last year, with all three of our business segments delivering revenue growth. Consolidated operating profit was $2 billion, an increase of 22.8% versus the third quarter of 2023, and consolidated operating margin was 8.9%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.76, up 12.1% from the third quarter of 2023. Now let's look at our business segment. In the U.S. domestic segment, our performance in the third quarter was driven by two factors. First was strong volume growth, the highest growth rate we've seen in more than three years. And second was excellent cost management, which resulted in a year-over-year decrease in cost per piece of 4.1%. U.S. Average Daily Volume or ADV increased 6.5% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Looking at product mix in the third quarter, ground average daily volume increased 8.9%, while total air average daily volume was down 6.3%. We continue to see customers shifting down from air to ground and some ground volume is shifting down to SurePost. Within ground, SurePost volume levels rose slightly compared to the second quarter, driven by growth in our Digital Access program. While SurePost volume comes at a lower revenue per piece, given the enhancements we've made to our matching algorithm, we were able to redirect more SurePost packages into our network, driving delivery density. For the quarter, B2B average daily volume was up 0.8% year-over-year, increasing for the first time in two years. Growth was driven by SMBs, which had an increase in B2B average daily volume of 3.8%. B2C average daily volume increased 11% year-over-year and made up 58.3% of our volume, a slight downward shift from the second quarter. In terms of customer mix, we saw ADV growth from both enterprise and SMB customers. SMBs made up 29.4% of total U.S. volume in the third quarter. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.5 billion, up 5.8% compared to last year, driven by strong volume growth. As expected, U.S. domestic revenue per piece was down year-over-year. In the third quarter, revenue per piece declined 2.2% year-over-year, but showed a 40 basis point sequential improvement from the second quarter. Breaking down the components, first, we took actions to address revenue quality, which translated into higher base rates. In the quarter, base rates increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 170 basis points. Second, the combination of product mix, lighter weights and shorter zones decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 300 basis points. And finally, we experienced a 90 basis point decline in the revenue per piece growth rate due to the combination of changes in customer mix and fuel. Turning to costs. As you all recall, the cost of our new labor contract was front end loaded. As of the end of July, we lapped the first year of the contract and for the quarter, Union wage rate growth slowed to 5.2% year-over-year. Productivity is a virtuous cycle at UPS and in the third quarter, we took several actions to drive productivity. Through our Network of the Future initiative, this year, we've completed 45 operational closures, contributing to an 8% improvement in pieces per workforce hour. While 8% might not seem like a big number, that translated into an efficiency gain of 11 million hours. Production improvements, including total service plan offset 50% of the Union wage increase and we continued to see positive trends in our safety performance, which contributed to lower expense. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $974 million in operating profit, a 46.5% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023, and the operating margin was 6.7%, a year-over-year increase of 180 basis points. Moving to our International segment. In the third quarter, our international business grew revenue and operating profit and expanded operating margin for the first time in nearly three years. This performance was driven by strength in exports in 13 of our top 20 export countries. Total international average daily volume growth continued its sequential improvement trend from the second quarter and was about flat to last year. In the third quarter, international revenue was $4.4 billion, up 3.4% from last year, with all regions growing revenue year-over-year. International revenue per piece increased 2.5%, driven by strong base pricing and the positive impact of region and product mix. Touching on costs, total international expense was relatively flat year-over-year, which was achieved by optimizing our network and our ongoing cost management efforts. Operating profit in the International segment was $792 million, an increase of 17.3% year-over-year. Operating margin in the third quarter was 18%, an increase of 220 basis points from a year ago. Moving to Supply Chain Solutions. In the third quarter, revenue was $3.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, air and ocean forwarding revenue was up 15.1%, driven by strong market demand out of Asia. Logistics delivered revenue growth driven primarily by the impact of the MNX acquisition and onboarding of USPS air cargo contributed to revenue growth in SCS. Partially offsetting these gains was weaker performance at Coyote, our truckload brokerage business and the completion of the sale in mid-September. In the third quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $217 million, down $58 million year-over-year, primarily driven by our efforts to configure our air network as we onboarded the USPS air cargo business. Now that we have fully onboarded this volume, we expect it to generate consistent revenue and we expect an attractive margin on a consolidated basis. For SCS, operating margin in the third quarter was 6.4%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $230 million of interest expense, our other pension income was $68 million, and our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 21%. Now let's turn to cash and capital allocation. So far this year, we've generated $6.8 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $4 billion, including our annual pension contribution of $1.4 billion. We refinanced $1.5 billion in current maturities year-to-date, and we finished the quarter with strong liquidity and no outstanding commercial paper. So far this year, UPS has paid $4 billion in dividends. And lastly, we've completed our targeted $500 million share repurchase program in the third quarter, which brings us to our outlook. In July, we provided an update to our full year financial targets based on global economic forecast and our performance in the first half of the year. Now looking ahead at the full year, we have updated our outlook to reflect three things. First, our third-quarter results and the focus on revenue quality; second, the sale of Coyote; and finally, new softer peak volume forecast from our customers. At the consolidated level, we now expect full year revenue of approximately $91.1 billion. Due to our focus on revenue quality, coupled with the efficiency of our integrated network and our ability to manage costs, we are lifting our consolidated operating margin expectation to approximately 9.6% to align with these new volume and revenue expectations. Now looking at the segments in the fourth quarter. Starting with U.S. domestic, we expect the combination of both volume and revenue per piece growth to increase revenue by 1.5% in the fourth quarter. We expect to generate a fourth quarter operating margin of approximately 9.5%, and we now expect the operating margin in December to be slightly higher than 10%. Looking at International. We expect the positive volume momentum we've experienced throughout the year will continue. With that in mind, we expect fourth-quarter revenue growth to be up mid-single digits year-over-year and we still expect around a 20% operating margin in the fourth quarter. In Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter of around $3.3 billion, which takes into consideration the disposition of Coyote, and we expect to generate an operating margin of approximately 9%. Turning to capital allocation. For the full year in 2024, we expect free cash flow to be around $5.1 billion after the $1.4 billion pension contribution we made to fund annual service costs. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $4 billion. We plan to pay around $5.4 billion in dividends subject to Board approval. And lastly, we expect the tax rate for the full year to be between 23% and 23.5%. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions. Sure. Thank you, David, and I appreciate the question. And yes, we do have an increase from Q3 to Q4 on the profit side. And really it's driven by a couple of things. One, as we mentioned, this focus on revenue quality and the moves that we've made to drive revenue improvement, both through pricing policy as well as the take rate that we're seeing on HCS coupled with the acceleration of Fit to Serve and Network of the Future and just the productivity initiatives give us the incremental bump over the normal seasonality. We feel very confident in both of those and we're seeing them actually start to come through in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter on the revenue side. And you can see from our cost performance, we feel that the Fit to Serve and NOS stuff is sticking very well. Yes. And so as we roll through '24, you can see that we've raised the consolidated margin. We do expect the domestic margin to be around 9.5%. And now we do expect to exit the year higher than -- slightly higher than the 10% that we guided to before. We'll come back to you as we get through peak on '25, but we want to close out peak first. Thank you. And Brian, I would just add that we're on our plan, if you remember, there were changes because of the compressed peak that opened the peak -- the holiday demand surcharge to a larger set of volume, right, and that's what drives some of the incremental outperformance year-over-year that you're seeing. Great. Yes, thank you. And yes, it's a great question because the cost performance in the third quarter was outstanding, right? And I think there's a couple of dynamics that are going on. As we said in our earlier remarks, we lapped the contract at the end of July, right? So you start to see that high wage inflation that we talked about in the second quarter as being 12%, now coming down to 5.2% and we will now get a full clean quarter of wage inflation at a normalized level in Q4. But also, as we mentioned, we've accelerated Fit to Serve and are now outperforming our forecast as well, as you'll see from the Network of the Future discussion that -- we've closed more sorts and we've closed more buildings. So we're pulling that forward, which helps in the cost performance. As we carry into Q4, we do expect to have strong cost performance. We'll probably be up about 1% per piece, which is still going to be less than our rev per piece growth rate. So we'll maintain a positive spread, but it'll be a little bit more normal as you go through it. Nando, you want to talk a little bit about network in future now we're pulling things forward? Absolutely. And look, we've got 21 active projects here in this quarter. You would think it's peak season. Why would we take that undertaking? We have full confidence that that's going to provide very good productivity improvements. And then next year, we're accelerating and pulling in the number of projects that we can execute in 2025. Yes, I would just say so. So if you remember, look, we've got a contract that locked up that we have known costs for the next four years for 60% of our domestic cost structure. With the focus on revenue quality and our ability to win more and win new in the places where we really want to, like you saw in the third quarter with commercial and SMB commercial growing -- starting to grow again, we do think we have the ability to: One, continue to take action to drive rev per piece ourselves as well as Carol said, productivity -- production is a virtuous cycle with a known cost structure as we go into '25. Yes. No impact in the fourth quarter. We'll tell you more about it when we come back with the fourth quarter earnings in January. Sure, sure. So, hi, Scott, and thank you for the question. So on the USPS contract, so we put a network in place that was all part of the plan. There's no incremental impact to domestic in the fourth quarter from the USPS contract. The cost that we -- the cost that Carol referred to was start-up costs associated with getting the contract stood up that was -- that impacted SCS, doesn't impact domestic. And in the fourth quarter, we'll see SCS go back to 9 -- about 9% and domestic to around 9.5%. So I don't think that's going to impact us there. Sure. Thanks for the question, Stephanie. Yes, so we saw positive momentum going from Q2 to Q3 in domestic rev per piece. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, really when you think about what happened in the base rate, in the second quarter, base rate added about 90 basis points of improvement to rev per piece. In the third quarter, that jumped to 170 basis points. Now as we translate into the fourth quarter, we actually expect rev per piece to inflect positive in the U.S. and that's really driven by a couple of things. Look, we talked about actions that we were going to take around specific customers that were enabled by our architecture of tomorrow and the work that we've been doing and investments have been made to create more sensitive demand channels, DAP and AOT and the modifiers. And we're leveraging those in order to make adjustments to help drive rev per piece. The other thing is what we're doing on the surcharging and the GRIs that we will continue to see lift as we go through the fourth quarter and into '25. So look, it's a positive trajectory on rev per piece and it's clearly an area of focus as we move from our year-one to our plus two strategy. So I'll start on the price pressures. Look, we -- just in a very price-competitive industry, but we think it's very rational, right? And when you look bid-for-bid and product-to-product, it is very rational. We know we have to win on capabilities and that's where we continue to add. With every customer every day, it's -- you got to deliver service to do it. It starts with us with service and then we add incremental capabilities like RFID to win where we really want to win most. And I point that as Carol mentioned, we've had big enterprise commercial wins through that. We also have seen commercial now grow nearly 1% for the first time this year as we really started to catch that from the contract, that's been a big momentum point. And then specifically, SMB commercial growing 3.8%. Those sorts of things allow -- the capabilities that we have, allow us to win more and win new in those areas that help drive rev per piece growth despite a very competitive rate environment. And then on the Fit to Serve point, yes, so we do expect about $70 million incremental to go about $350 million in the fourth quarter, and we've seen great progress with that program. Sure. Yes. On Fit to Serve, as we said, we have pulled forward incremental savings opportunities. We are -- we hit the full run rate that we expected. We will have some incremental benefit as we wrap into the fourth quarter, but we're continuing forward with it as planned. Greg, we have time for one more question."

            "name": "Kate Gutmann",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely. And I think the quarter was a good example of that. The macro indicators have come down, but yet we've expanded the revenue, profit and margin in the international business and posting an 8% margin. We intend to continue to run those same plays. Let me go into a few. Just as Nando indicated, on the domestic side, 60% of our volume goes through automated hubs and that's for the domestic and transporter of all of our large international volume markets. And then on the air side of the house, we continue to show that revenue quality matters, especially when you have expensive assets and we align with demand. So we had strong rev per piece for international we held our cost CPP flat and so delivered operating leverage. We would continue to do that into the next year. It really is. And so Europe and Canada exceeding expectations, unlocking more of the customer share of wallet and in the premium spaces too. So cross border trade we're seeing growth with the expansion of our service out of Asia to Europe as well as throughout intra-Asia we've made the lanes faster and as a result that premium unlock and by the way with rev per piece growing. So we feel good about the equations and we'll definitely continue it."

            "name": "Carol Tome",
            "content": "Thank you, PJ, and good morning. On our last earnings call, we said that the second quarter would not only be the bottom, but a turning point for our performance and that we would return to revenue and profit growth in the third quarter, which we did. I would like to recognize and thank UPSers for their hard work and efforts. Their relentless focus on driving productivity while ensuring excellent customer service allowed us to deliver these results. In the third quarter, we faced a macro environment that was slightly worse than we expected. In the U.S., online sales slowed and manufacturing activity was lower than we anticipated. This slowdown in manufacturing activity was also true outside of the U.S. as we continue to see lower industrial production weigh on volume in certain geographies. But the macro-environment didn't prevent us from growing revenue and profit. As we leaned into the parts of the market that value our end-to-end network and we drove expense leverage through ongoing productivity initiatives. In the third quarter, our consolidated revenue was $22.2 billion, an increase of 5.6% versus last year. Consolidated operating profit was $2 billion, up 22.8% from last year and consolidated operating margin was 8.9%. In the U.S., this was the second consecutive quarter of average daily volume growth, and it was our highest year-over-year ADV growth rate since the first quarter of 2021. In International, average daily volume growth finished flattish and continued the upward momentum we've seen since the first quarter of this year. And in SCS, air and ocean forwarding contributed to strong revenue growth. Looking at the U.S., during the quarter, we focused on growing certain pockets of commercial business and grew B2B volume by nearly 1% compared to last year. One of the areas of commercial focus was retail B2B. Our B2B routes are in retail. In fact, we deliver merchandise to over 20,000 retail outlets across the country. To serve these customers, we offer a store replenishment with delivery window solution that provides retailers daily inventory replenishment within a two-hour window. Within this solution, we also provide visibility to the number of packages scheduled to be delivered. Our store replenishment solution, along with our RFID technology enables retailers to reduce stockouts and more efficiently run their receiving operations. This is just one example of how our customer-focused capabilities are enabling us to win new commercial volume. Now that U.S. volume is flowing back into our network, we have heightened our attention to revenue quality with a focus on the segments of the market we want to serve. You will recall that in the second quarter, we saw an unexpected surge of short zone lightweight e-commerce packages flow into our network. In the third quarter, we responded strategically, adjusting our pricing and optimizing our operating plans on a portion of this business. Further, we increased our focus on matching our pricing to the quality and attributes of the service we provide. We did this by leveraging the power of pricing science through our pricing architecture of tomorrow or AOT technology. Our revenue per piece growth rate improved in the third quarter from what we reported in the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. On the cost side, our team did an excellent job of managing expenses across the board. As it relates to our two major cost-out initiatives, we are continuing to deliver solid results. Fit to Serve, which was designed to optimize and rightsize our management structure, is slightly ahead of forecast. And with Network of the Future, so far this year, we've completed 45 operational closures, including nine full buildings that have been shut down. I'd like to give you a brief update on our customer-first, people-led innovation-driven strategy, starting with customer-first. As we discussed, we have a goal to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. To that end, we said we would pursue certain inorganic opportunities and we have. Last month, we entered into an agreement to acquire Frigo-Trans, a move that will enhance our end-to-end temperature-sensitive healthcare capabilities across Europe. Today, 80% of pharmaceuticals in Europe require temperature-controlled transportation. Frigo-Trans offers pan-European cold-chain transportation as well as temperature-controlled and time-critical freight forwarding capabilities. Plus, Frigo-Trans has temperature-controlled warehousing capabilities with every temperature from cryopreservation, which is minus 196 degrees Celsius to ambience, which is about 25 degrees Celsius. We are targeting to close the Frigo-Trans acquisition in the first quarter of next year. Complex healthcare logistics is a growing business for us and we're continuing to invest in the capabilities needed to accelerate growth. We have dedicated healthcare facilities in 36 countries and provide specialized handling and visibility to our customers through our UPS premier product. In the third quarter, we generated $2.5 billion in consolidated healthcare revenue, which contributed to revenue growth across all three segments. Shifting to International. In time for the holidays, we've made several enhancements. In September, we expanded residential Saturday delivery to the eight largest markets in Europe without an additional charge. This enhancement meets our customers' need for speed, and we now provide a superior service offering. Further, we sped up deliveries to over 35 countries across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. And to meet the expected demand for this year's peak holiday season, we added over 200 flights connecting Asia to Europe and the U.S. Quickly touching on DAP, our Digital Access Program, DAP continues to deliver strong SMB growth in both B2B and B2C segments. In the first nine months of this year, we generated $2.3 billion in global GAAP revenue, and we expect to deliver over $3 billion in GAAP revenue for the full year. As you know, we have been onboarding our new air cargo business with the United States Postal Service. During the third quarter, our network planning teams worked closely with the USPS to ensure the transition progressed smoothly and it did. As of October 1, all contracted USPS air cargo business has been fully onboarded and we expect this business to deliver strong consistent revenue at an attractive margin. Moving to People-led. Since our founding, we've had a culture of driving safe work practices. And by using new technology and tools, we've seen a dramatic improvement in the number of injuries and accidents. For example, in the U.S., this year we've had our best auto safety results in 10 years. The advances in safety were achieved through innovative driver education and training, like our Integrad driver training schools. This focus on safety enables driver achievements like our Circle of Honor, which recognizes drivers with 25 years or more of driving without an accident. Today, our Circle of Honor has grown to nearly 10,000 drivers. Now let's turn to Innovation Driven, which for this call is all about the peak holiday season. This year's holiday season has only 17 shipping days between Black Friday and Christmas Eve. We haven't seen such a compressed peak since 2019. We do peak better than anyone and with six years in a row of industry leading service, we're confident our plans and execution will make that seven. To prepare, we've been collaborating with our customers on daily volume expectations and the timing of their promotions. While our customers are still expecting a good holiday selling season, recently, shippers have tempered their volume expectations. In any case, we'll be ready to deliver and we'll leverage our network planning tools and other proven technologies to control first how the volume comes in. Second, how to flow more volume to our automated facilities. And third, how to adjust the network to operate as efficiently as possible. And talking about efficiency. This year on our peak day, which is December 18th in the U.S. we expect to deliver 2 million more packages than we did on peak day last year, but we'll do it at a higher productivity rate. This will be possible due to the efficiency improvements we've made over the years and the use of seasonal support drivers, many of which are experienced part time UPSers who work inside our facilities. To sum it up, we're ready to deliver another successful peak. Moving to our financial outlook, we continue our better, not bigger approach, enhanced by some bold moves. The addition of the USPS air cargo business and the divestiture of Coyote are recent examples. With these moves, we eliminated a highly volatile truckload brokerage business and added air cargo volume that is predictable and margin positive. Looking at our consolidated revenue outlook in the third quarter, we increased our emphasis on revenue quality resulting in a glide down of certain volume which we expect will continue into the fourth quarter. Given our third quarter results, our latest peak volume expectations, and adjusting for the impact of the Coyote disposition, we now expect consolidated revenue of approximately $91.1 billion for the year and are lifting our consolidated operating margin target to approximately 9.6%. Brian will provide more details. So with that, thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Well, I'll start with the customer feedback. We work with a little over 100 of our customers who represent 60% of the volume in our network, but 85% of the peak surge. So we develop operating plans for each of these customers. And these plans have been in process now for months. As the year has progressed, they continue to tighten up their forecast and we just received their last forecast on October 2. And their forecast have been tempered and we believe it's driven by a couple of factors. First, external forecast for the holiday season have come in. In fact, the forecast for ESMO in the fourth quarter is now about 3%. Earlier in the year, it had been about 5%. If you look at just the peak part of the holiday season, forecasts are all over the board, candidly from a low of 2% to a high of 11% and SMB Global has it at about 3.5%. Part of this, we believe, is influenced by the tight compressed peak period. There are only 17 shipping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. And what forecasters and some of our customers are saying is because of the tightness of the shipping season that many customers will go into a store to complete their holiday purchases. The consumer actually is in pretty good shape, but we think there'll be some dynamics in how the consumer shops during the peak season. So it will still be a good peak. In fact, in our prepared remarks, we called out that on peak day, we'll deliver 2 million more packages than we did last year. It will still be a good peak, but just not as dynamic as people thought at the beginning of the year. Whatever happens, we're prepared. We're prepared to handle the volume. And then on the pricing surcharge, we're seeing a really good take rate on the pricing surcharge for the holiday, I should say. And maybe Matt Guffey is here. Matt, perhaps you want to comment on the holiday surcharge? And we're seeing a good keep rate on... Yes. So why don't you take the fourth quarter question and then we'll turn to Nando for some thoughts. All the while maintaining outstanding service levels, which is job number one for UPS. And just to put the 5% number that Nando mentioned into perspective, he's talking about automated volume through our hubs, right. And we now processed 63% of the volume in our hubs in some sort of an automated way. That's up 5 percentage points from a year ago. That's pretty good. Well, I think our team has done a masterful job of managing a very choppy environment over the past several years, actually. And as we think about our business outside the United States, we saw improvement in every quarter this year. In fact, our export business grew in the third quarter and domestic was down just slightly. So, Kate, maybe you want to talk about how you would manage the business outside the United States if the industrial production remains softish? And in-markets that are soft to win, you gain share. And you gain share not by dropping price, but by actually increasing your capability. And our Saturday delivery is one example of that. We are the only carrier that offers standard Saturday delivery at no charge in these eight markets. And that's driving some nice performance, isn't it, Kate? We just started it. So I think in the domestic side, productivity is a virtuous cycle here. And as Nando pointed out, there's nothing that's not under review, right. Everything is under review and we continue to drive productivity that exceeds our expectations. Brian, anything you want to add? And we like that commercial business. We -- it's got a more dense delivery metric associated with that, in other words, more packages per delivery. And one way we can win commercial is with new capabilities. So we had a big win in the third quarter and the determining factor for this customer to come into our network were our RFID labels. So that's a new capability that we didn't have before. Thank you. Well, as you point out, Jordan, we did have a bit of a transition in the third quarter. The USPS contract with their previous carrier expired October 1st. And we didn't want to wait until October 1st to onboard that volume because peak is right around the corner. So we agreed with the USPS that we would operationalize this service to them, while over-time, they onboarded their volume. And it was over-time, actually, we didn't get much weight until September. So there was a mismatch between our operational model and the volume. But now the volume is all in. So the fourth quarter is going to look a lot different than the third quarter did. And from a performance perspective, Nando, you just met with the Postmaster General. And so tell us what he said. And I just can't overemphasize the heavy lift here. In fact, it was over 50 million cubic feet that we had to take into our network in the third quarter and there'll be more obviously in the fourth. So job well done by our team in working with the USPS as well. Well, thanks for the question. And Matt, why don't you take on this question? And to your question about what challenges and what opportunities, I think it's some and some. I think it's some and some. And so once we get this contract agreed to, we'll show you what those sum and some are, but we're confident we can work through this. Yes, you should hear something about it in our fourth quarter earnings. So I think our team has done an excellent job of taking capacity out of the market. In fact, with 45 million -- 45 operational closures, it's about 1 million ADV per day of capacity that we've taken out of the market and we see capacity rationalization happening in other parts of the market as well. Clearly, it's peak time. So we're all adding resources to handle the surge in the holiday, but capacity is coming in. First, why don't we address the path to the fourth quarter? No. And then in terms of when are we going to see more meaningful margin expansion, let us get through the fourth quarter and then we'll give you our outlook for 2025. And pricing architecture of tomorrow is really moving from the art to the science of pricing. And one of the elements of this architecture are modifiers that we use, modifiers that can provide discounts to our customers or modifiers that allow us to increase the price. And I'll just give you a real life example of what happened in the third quarter to help you understand. In the third quarter, we had a discount modifier that we adjusted, basically test the elasticity. We reduced the discount by 25%, which increased the RPP by 12% and reduced the volume by 26%. We liked that trade. And because it's a modifier, it's not a contract that has to be reopened and renegotiated. You just adjust the model. And this is just one element of pricing architecture of tomorrow that we will use not only in the fourth quarter, but in '25 and beyond. So first on the customer glide down, we have, as you know, been in a glide-down arrangement with our largest customer and they continue to be our largest customer. I think it's fair to say that we have seen them drive a lot of the reduction in our air volume. In fact, if I look at the third quarter performance, 100% of the decline in air volume was down about 6.5% that is attributable to the largest customer. So they, like many, trading down from air to ground and in their case, a little bit of ground out to their own network. But we're fine with that because it creates opportunity for us to grow in other areas. And then looking ahead... So you're just asking for a status update on Fit to Serve? And to your question, do you have additional opportunities. We are an opportunity rich company. And as you heard from Nando, we're looking at all opportunities to drive a better experience for our customer and actually higher productivity, So last year we announced that we were hiring 100,000 for the peak holiday season and our ADV declined 7.4%. This year we announced that we're hiring 125,000 and our ADV will be positive. So it's not out of the realm of reason that we should hire more people this year than we did last year. But this is what you need to know. We will hire what we need for peak regardless of where the volume actually ends up. We're not going to over hire for peak. We will hire what we need. And what we've done over time, Ravi, is we've added this amazing capability where within just a few -- less than an hour, just a few minutes, we can actually get a job offer out or we can rescind a job offer so we can flex up or flex down the way we need to. And Nando, would you like to add anything?"

            "name": "Nando Cesarone",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Brian. And look, you may be asking how are we able to have 45 operational closures and nine buildings that we've closed. We are moving much more volume about 5% through our automated facilities and we're also making sure that our legacy of production indices are performing the way we expect them to perform. The teams are doing an excellent job allowing us to really shrink the network and be a lot more productive. Safety of course helped. And at the end of the day, it comes down to hours and people, and we were down about 11 million hours compared to the last year. So really just an excellent job all around. And the last thing I would say is there's nothing that we're overlooking so every piece of our business, from car wash to automated dispatching, we are prepared for all of it and looking and scrutinizing all of that cost and finding some good improvements there. Sure. So as early as yesterday, we meet face-to-face and yesterday the purpose was peak planning. So both teams face-to-face in DC and we're working really well. Professionals on both sides that have executed a very difficult plan and made it look very, very simple. Feedback from the Postmaster General himself has been positive and we see the resources that we've applied are in-line with what we had modeled when we have accepted the business and the contract was negotiated with the USPS. So good things ahead for that contract. Absolutely. Yes. I would just say the number also includes a favorable employee mix. So this year, we're adding -- we're going to increase our helper teams with our drivers by about 10%. That's not a small number. So a big percentage of our volume will be delivered by helpers, seasonal helpers that can deliver at Christmas time and we've amped that up and make sure that we've got every position optimized and that is the number, as Carol had said, and we're going to deliver a great peak season."

Carol talked about the top 100, which are extremely important just due to the peakiness that they bring during the season. But we've really worked again. We've got a good structure and a process in place where we can manage our holiday demand surcharge at the customer level and we have a lot more flexibility to work with them as we go through the peak season. Look, at the end of it, it's all about us creating -- continuing to drive value and -- with our customers and to deliver a great peak. So we're staying close on the forecast, but also working very closely with them on this holiday demand surcharge. Very -- yes, very, very good keep rate, probably one of the best keep rates we've seen, so. Yes. So first-off, so we -- to Nando's point, we had an opportunity to meet with the PMG yesterday. We continually work to find a mutually agreeable agreement for both USPS and UPS. More work to be done, but we are moving very, very quickly and hopefully, we'll have this to a close in very short order."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. PJ Guido, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nPJ Guido : Good morning and welcome to the UPS Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Dykes, our new CFO, and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the Federal Securities Laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2023 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion today refers to adjusted results. For the second quarter, GAAP results include an after-tax charge of $120 million or $0.14 per diluted share, comprised of a one-time payment of $94 million to settle an international regulatory matter, and transformation and other charges of $26 million. A Reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and also available in the webcast of today's call. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome : Thank you, PJ, and good morning. Let me begin by welcoming Brian Dykes as UPS's new Chief Financial Officer. With over 25 years of multinational experience with the company, Brian brings deep financial and strategic experience to our executive leadership team. Welcome, Brian. Our second quarter performance was a significant turning point for our company as we returned to volume growth in the United States the first time in nine quarters. I would like to recognize and thank UPSers for their hard work and efforts in delivering these results. At the beginning of the year, we shared our outlook for 2024 based on four key planning assumptions. The first planning assumption acknowledged the front-loading of costs associated with our new labor contracts, which we believed would cause our financial performance to reflect a bathtub effect, with first half 2024 earnings down as much as 30% and second half earnings returning to growth. In the first half of the year, our earnings were in-line with the down 30% scenario. The second assumption was that we would return to volume growth, which we did in the US, during the month of May. Further, while international volume growth in the second quarter was down 2.9% year-over-year, we saw growth in certain markets. The third planning assumption was based on our fit-to-serve initiative to right size our management structure. And we are on track with this initiative to deliver roughly $1 billion in savings by the end of the year. Finally, we said we would explore strategic alternatives for Coyote and we did, leading to a pending sell to RXO, at considerably more than our carrying value. So the key assumptions we used to build our plan are holding with one distinction and that's US volume mix both in terms of product and customer segmentation. During the quarter we experienced a shift toward value products with shippers choosing ground over air and SurePost over ground. And there was also a notable shift in product characteristics with a surge in lightweight short-zone volume moving into our network. We will discuss the full year impact of these shifts in a few moments. But let me first highlight our second quarter results and then provide a few updates on our longer-term strategies. In the second quarter, consolidated revenue was $21.8 billion, a decline of 1.1% versus last year. Consolidated operating profit was $2.1 billion down 29.3% and consolidated operating margin was 9.5%. At our March Investor Day, we set forth our declarations to become the premium small package provider, the premium logistics orchestrator, and the Number #1 complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. To that end, we said we would pursue certain inorganic opportunities and we have. As you've seen, we just announced our plans to acquire Estafeta, a leading domestic small package provider in Mexico. This is a big win for UPS and it's a big win for our customers. By combining Estafeta with the end-to-end services we already have in Mexico and connecting it to the global reach of our integrated network, we will greatly enhance our logistics orchestration capabilities for customers that are shifting manufacturing and distribution closer to the United States. We are targeting to close this acquisition by the end of this year. Let me share a few other strategic updates starting with customer first. In healthcare we just opened our first dedicated healthcare facility in Dublin, Ireland. This 82,000 square foot facility provides storage and fulfillment for a range of complex pharmaceutical and healthcare products. And in the Netherlands, we increased the size of our flagship facility in Roermond to now more than 235,000 square feet, including expanded ultra-cold storage capabilities to support the growing market of complex biopharma products. Looking at SMBs, we continue to add partners to our Digital Access Program or DAP, meeting small businesses where they are. In the first six months of this year, DAP generated $1.5 billion in revenue and we are well on our way to achieving our 2024 DAP revenue target of over $3 billion. And because speed will always be important to our customers. In the US, we expanded our weekend service offering to six additional markets. With this service, we provide deliveries one day earlier than competitors who don't offer weekend pickup services. In fact, we are the only private US-based carrier that provides both commercial and residential pickup and delivery services on Saturday as a general service offering. Outside of the US, we are continuing to enhance our portfolio to support our customers as they balance the need for speed with cost. For example, in record time, we launched enhancements to our worldwide economy service globally. This is an e-commerce solution for non-urgent cross-border shipment. Here we created a true door-to-door service with customs clearance and delivery fees baked into the solution, making the experience simpler for the shipper and the receiver. In Asia, over the last several quarters, we've made a series of network enhancements with the latest being in Taiwan. Because Europe is a top three export destination for Taiwan, we've expanded our capacity by 30% and extended pickups to as late as midnight. These enhancements enable our customers, including high-tech manufacturing and automotive shippers, to better serve their European customers by reaching their destination in just two business days. And in supply chain solutions, we've expanded our supply chain operations at our Frankfurt Airport Gateway, by adding nearly 25% more warehouse space. This facility is a major SCS hub for central Europe where it connects all transportation modes. In this expansion, we can now provide even greater flexibility to the region's growing technology and healthcare industry. And importantly, also in SCS, we are onboarding the new USPS Air Cargo business with plans to be fully implemented before peak. The onboarding has gone well and we continue to expect this business to be margin accretive for the company. Now let's turn to innovation driven and progress with Network of the Future. In the first half of 2024, we completed 35 operational closures, which included closing five buildings. And we are on plan to complete an additional five operational closures in the second half of this year. Simultaneously, we’re continuing to automate more of our operational tasks. For example, in the US, we are automating the dispatch process for our packaged car and feeder drivers to reduce dispatch staffing by half. We deployed Phase 1 of the project and so far this year we've reduced staffing by 26%. As we continue deployment, we expect to achieve our reduction target by 2026. As a reminder, these actions are outside of fit-to-serve and are part of Network of the Future. Lastly, touching on Smart Package Smart Facility, which is our RFID solution, we are moving from a scanning network to a sensing network. As we've discussed, we're adding RFID readers to our package cards, but we're not stopping there. We're moving upstream. First, we are enabling customers to print RFID labels themselves. Second, we are installing readers at customer dock doors. This will enable immediate visibility as our trailers are loaded for pick-up. This solution provides a significant competitive advantage to us and to our customers. Moving to our financial outlook, Brian will provide more details but let me share a few highlights. First, while we have entered into an agreement to sell our Coyote business, we are retaining Coyote revenue and earnings in our outlook until the transaction is consummated. Second, while our first half earnings were in-line with the low end of the guidance we provided, our revenue came in just short of the low-end. Given the current volume momentum we are now experiencing in our business, we are resetting our revenue guidance, taking us to the midpoint of our original revenue guide. But for operating profit, as we look to the back half of the year, in the US, we expect the same volume mix characteristics as we had in the first half of the year, which compresses revenue per piece growth. While we still expect an operating profit bathtub effect with solid earnings growth in the back half of the year, the growth rate will not be as high as we projected at the beginning of the year. Accordingly, we are adjusting our full year operating margin guidance to reflect the nature of the volume flowing through our US Network. As a result, we now expect consolidated revenue of approximately $93 billion and a consolidated operating margin of approximately 9.4%. Importantly, we expect to exit the final month of 2024 with a US operating margin of 10%, which creates a solid footing as we drive the US business to a longer-term operating margin target of 12%. One last comment before I hand the call over to Brian. We believe it is important to have a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation with the first uses of capital going back to the business and to pay our dividends and then any excess cash being used for share repurchases. As we have fine-tuned our capital requirements for Network of the Future, we expect to spend less than we originally anticipated. Further, with the pending sale of Coyote, we expect to free up cash that was not in our original guidance plan. As a result, we are restarting our share repurchase program with the intent of repurchasing about $1 billion of shares annually, including roughly $500 million in 2024. So with that, thank you for listening and let me turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Dykes : Thank you, Carol, and good morning everyone. First, I'm very thankful for the opportunity to lead the global finance organization and work with the entire leadership team to achieve the targets we set. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us and the right team to achieve our goals. I'm also particularly eager to meet our investors as I hit the road over the next few weeks. This morning I'll review our second quarter results, provide an update on capital allocation and lastly, provide additional detail for our 2024 financial outlook. First, our results. The second quarter represented an important turning point for our business. In the US, volume inflected positively and it was the last full quarter of the high wage growth rate associated with the first year of our new Teamsters contract. Outside the US, we saw pockets-of-demand improved in each export region driving growth in many of our more profitable lanes. Additionally, through our fit-to-serve initiative, we reduced our workforce by over 11,500 positions which has translated into approximately $350 million in savings for the first half of 2024. And as Carol said we are on track to deliver roughly $1 billion in savings by the end of the year. Looking at our consolidated performance. In the second quarter, revenue was $21.8 billion, a reduction of $237 million compared to the second quarter of 2023. Consolidated operating profit was $2.1 billion, down 29.3%, and consolidated operating margin was 9.5%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.79, down 29.5% from the second quarter of 2023. Now let's look at our business segment. In the second quarter, US average daily volume increased 0.7% year-over-year. This marks a return to positive volume growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. And sequentially, when compared to the first quarter of 2024, the average daily volume year-over-year growth rate increased by 390 basis points. At the beginning of the year, we expected to see three things in the second quarter; volume growth, growth in B2C and relatively consistent product mix to what we had experienced last year. While we saw strong volume growth in the second quarter led by B2C, it came with a different product mix. For the quarter, B2C volume increased 4.8% year-over-year and made up 58.5% of our volume, an increase of 220 basis points from a year ago. This growth was driven in large part by several new e-commerce customers that entered our network. B2B average daily volume finished down 4.6%. Returns remained a bright spot and increased 3% year-over-year. From a product perspective, we saw customers trade down between services. Specifically, we saw customers shift from air to ground and from ground to SurePost. As a result, total air average daily volume was down 7.8%, while ground average daily volume increased 2.3%. Within ground SurePost average daily volume grew 25%, driven by new shippers product choices, product trade downs and easier comparisons due to last year's decline in volume during our contract negotiations. By enhancing our matching algorithm, we saw an increase in the percentage of SurePost packages redirected to UPS for delivery. As a result, SurePost redirect increase returning to 2020 level. Turning to SMBs. We saw the trend from the first quarter continue with total SMB volume down until June when it flipped positive. And in terms of total volume, SMBs made up 29.7% in the second quarter. For the quarter, US Domestic generated revenue of $14.1 billion, down 1.9% compared to last year. Revenue per piece was down 2.6% year-over-year. Let me break down the components of the revenue per piece decline. Base rates increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 90 basis points. The combination of product mix, lighter weights and shorter zones decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 310 basis points. The remaining [40] (ph) basis point decline in the revenue per piece growth rate was due to the combination of changes in customer mix and fuel. Turning to costs. Total expense increased 3.2% in the second quarter. Union wage rates increased 11.7%, driven by the contractual increase that went into effect in August of last year. The US Domestic team took several actions and executed on productivity initiatives to partially offset the increase in compensation rate. We leveraged total service plan and network planning tools to reduce total operational hours by 1.4%, while volume grew 0.7%. Through Network of the Future, we had 17 operational closures in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 35. And because we're routing more volume through our automated facilities, we've permanently closed five buildings so far this year. We lowered block hours by 12.5% versus last year and we recorded our best auto safety results in 10 years, driving a better outcome for our people and a better long-term cost picture for UPS. Putting it all together, due to the actions we took in the second quarter, we held the cost per piece growth rate to only 2.5% even as union wages increased nearly 12%. This is the lowest cost per piece growth rate we've seen in more than three years. The US Domestic segment delivered $997 million in operating profit, down 40.7% compared to the second quarter of 2023, and the operating margin was 7.1%. Moving to our International segment. The second quarter was a turning point for our International business well. For the first time in 10 quarters, 11 of our top 20 export countries demonstrated year-over-year average daily volume growth, including several key markets in Europe. At the region level, Asia grew average daily volume and revenue in the quarter. And in the Americas regions, we continue to see solid signs of the shift in nearshoring. Looking at volume in the second quarter, International total average daily volume was down 2.9% year-over-year which is half the decline we saw in the first quarter of this year. About three-quarters of the decline in the second quarter came from lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 4.4%, primarily driven by Europe. On the export side, average daily volume declined 1.5% year-over-year. However, on a sequential basis from the first quarter, export average daily volume improved 210 basis points. While overall export average daily volume was down in Europe, in Germany, our largest export market, outbound grew 1%. In Asia export average daily volume increased 1.7%. And within Asia, export volume on the China to US trade lane increased 20.6%. This is the third consecutive quarter of volume growth on this lane, which is our most profitable lane. And looking at the Americas region, export average daily volume increased 5%, which was the sixth consecutive quarter of growth. As we see the shift in nearshore and continue to take hold, our announced acquisition of Estafeta will further enhance our end-to-end services in Mexico. In the second quarter, International revenue was $4.4 billion down 1% from last year, primarily due to the decline in volume. Revenue per piece increased 2.4%, driven by strong base pricing and the positive impact of region and product mix. In the second quarter total International expense was relatively flat year-over-year. Here we leverage the agility of our integrated network to manage block hours down 2.1% compared to last year. Operating profit in the International segment was $824 million down $78 million year-over-year. Operating margin in the second quarter was 18.9%. Moving to Supply Chain Solutions. In the face of a dynamic market, we remained agile and leaned into areas of growth. In the second quarter revenue was $3.3 billion, up 2.6% year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers. Within international air freight, strong e-commerce demand particularly in China outbound, drove an increase in volume and lifted market rates as demand outpaced capacity, resulting in an increase in revenue. On the ocean side, total volume and revenue was down year-over-year. However toward the end of the quarter, demand on Asia outbound lanes improved and drove market rates higher. Our truckload brokerage business known as Coyote, continued to face market pressures, which drove revenue down. And then logistics revenue grew driven by the impact of MNX and Health care. In the second quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $243 million, down $93 million year-over-year reflecting market conditions, Operating margin was 7.3%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $206 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $67 million. And our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23.4%. Now let's turn to cash and capital allocation. Year-to-date, we've generated $5.3 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $3.4 billion. We finished the quarter with strong liquidity and no outstanding commercial paper. In May, we successfully issued $2.8 billion of debt to refinance $1.6 billion in current maturities which will shore up additional liquidity and support our acquisition strategy. And in the quarter, we announced that we would be outsourcing the asset management portion of our pension plan in order to focus squarely on our core business, while adding more expertise and oversight that will benefit UPS retirees. Lastly, so far this year UPS has paid $2.7 billion in dividends, which brings us to our outlook for the second half of 2024. Global economic growth forecast remained relatively unchanged in the back half of 2024. According to S&P Global, global GDP is expected to grow 2.7% for the full year 2024 and US GDP is expected to grow 2.4%. Additionally, as we've discussed we still expect the US small package market excluding Amazon to grow by less than 1%. Looking at our business in the first half of 2024, revenue was below our expectations and operating profit was at the low end of the range we provided and finished down about 30%. Based on our performance in the first half of the year combined with our expectation that the product shift we experienced in the US will continue through the rest of 2024, we have updated our guidance. This includes moving to a point estimate because it represents our best view of the many moving parts within our business. We now expect consolidated revenue to be approximately $93 billion, and because the volume characteristics are different from what we originally anticipated, we now expect a consolidated operating margin of approximately 9.4%. Our guidance includes roughly $1 billion in savings from fit-to-serve. And as Carol mentioned, Coyote revenue and operating profit remains in our guidance and will until the transaction is executed. Looking at the segments. In US Domestic, we anticipate back half 2024 revenue growth of around 5%, driven by strong volume growth. As you update your models for US Domestic there are a few things to keep in mind. First, we expect average daily volume to grow by mid-single digits. Second, we’ll anniversary the first year of the Teamsters contract on August 1. Next, product mix is expected to continue to pressure revenue per piece. However through expense management and slowing labor inflation, we expect to grow third quarter operating profit by double digits and exit the year with a US operating margin of 10%. And lastly, we expect a strong peak driven by volume growth and demand surcharges. Within the International segment, our full year and second half outlook remains consistent with what we provided at the beginning of the year. For the second half of 2024, we anticipate volume growth rates will inflect positively and the revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Operating margin in the second half of the year in the International segment is anticipated to be approximately 20%. And in Supply Chain Solutions, in the second half of 2024, we expect revenue to be over $7 billion and an operating margin in the high-single digits. Included in our guidance is the newly won air cargo business from the USPS, which will be fully onboarded by the end of the third quarter. And lastly, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 22% for the remainder of the year. Turning to capital allocation. For the full year in 2024, we expect free cash flow to be around $5.8 billion before any pension contribution. We've tightened our capital expenditure forecast and now expect to spend about $4 billion. We plan to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval. And given our strong liquidity, while we originally had not planned to repurchase shares, we now plan to repurchase approximately $500 million of shares this year. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could offer some more thoughts on what's happening with domestic package volume and the mix effect. If I look at the core ground, so excluding SurePost it looks like you saw a decline sequentially. So let us say, 2 point -- excuse me, 12.3 million pieces a day in 1Q to 11.7 million, if I exclude SurePost. So do you think -- is that just market weaker? Or is that kind of competitive performance? So just wanted to see if you could offer more thoughts on what's happening in domestic package volume. And then maybe why -- what are key levers to see that mix performance improve, as we look at second half. Thank you.\nBrian Dykes: Yes. Thanks, Tom for the question. I think when you look at the domestic volume performance from the second quarter and then going forward. In the second quarter, there was really two big impacts that were driving the change. One is we did see customers favoring our more economical products, so going from air-to-ground, and within ground, from ground to SurePost. And that was across the broad base of customers. We also saw an acceleration of new entrants, new e-commerce customers that were coming into the market that are quite frankly running a different model than our traditional customers and are highly leveraging our SurePost product. So we saw an acceleration of SurePost. The growth rate is also complicated as you think about what happened in the second quarter of last year because of the type of customers that diverted early. As we were approaching the Teamster contract, it does also skew the growth rate. As we move forward and you see -- you can see it in our forecast and within the guide, that we do expect that mix to rationalize as we move towards the end of the year. And we've got line of sight to that in our pipeline and are working to actively pull those through as we kind of balance the mix of products going into the second half.\nCarol Tome: And maybe a couple of other comments about just the volume. As you saw our commercial business was down year-on-year, although the rate of decline has moderated greatly. As we look to the back-half of the year, we expect that to improve. Our pipeline is quite robust. So we expect to see good movement in that space.\nTom Wadewitz : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Just again on the trade-down from more premium products to economic products, what changes customer behavior to go back? And is it simply the economy? And then what are your thoughts on sort of the B2B side of the equation which I guess is still under pressure? Do you anticipate a step up with more of a focus on just-in-time inventory, a need to move things quicker from that end? And when would you think that timing could look better? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: On the B2B front, as we discussed it was down year-on-year. Part of that was because of customers who left us during the contract negotiation that have not returned. They left us, they locked themselves into long-term contracts and they have not yet returned. That just gives us an opportunity to win them back for the excellent service that we provide. We've also seen some dynamics within the B2B space occur recently within poolers, companies going out of business like overnight which gives us an opportunity to bring that business back into our network. It's already starting to flow. And as I mentioned, the pipeline of commercial accounts is robust. So we expect that to improve dramatically in the back half of the year. On the RPP, it is really interesting. We've had these new e-commerce entrants into the United States. And their volume, well, it is exploded. It was certainly more than we anticipate flowing into our network. So in -- to your question, is this a phenomenon forever? I don't know. It depends on what consumer demand will be. But we are going to focus on the parts of the market that really value our end-to-end service and expect to see some of the pressure that we saw on the RPP in the second quarter moderate. And Brian, maybe you can give a little bit more color on what we think the RPP will look like in the back half of the year.\nBrian Dykes: Yes. So as Carol mentioned, yes we do expect our RPP growth to moderate in the back half. And actually, as we move from kind of the negative 2.6% that we are at to almost approach breakeven as we get towards the end of the year. And there is a couple of pieces of that. Carol had mentioned the B2B piece. I would say, the bright spot within B2B is returns, that improved 3%. And we are seeing uptake with the addition of Happy Returns into the portfolio. And as that pipeline builds and we start to see that pull through, that continues to accelerate our B2B business. The other thing I would say is that we do have a strong pipeline of ground-ready products. And what happens with the SurePost product is, it allows you to get new customers in, leveraging that. We get the integration into their systems, we get the pickup process set up, and they become part of the UPS portfolio but then allows us to expand that as we go through the cycles.\nCarol Tome: And maybe one other comment about SurePost because the question may be, do you like that product. We actually like the product. It provides a steady solution for us. We also through our matching algorithm, we can redirect the packages back into the ground network. And in fact, the redirect percentage was 40%. So that's returning back to levels we saw during the COVID.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hi, great. Good morning. Hello Brian, I guess the spread of margins, can you talk about kind of the reaction we should see in third quarter? I guess typically, we see maybe 100 basis points pullback. I just want to get seasonality or kind of flow that we should expect through the year. And then I think you mentioned the 90 basis points of pure pricing. I want to understand the margin impact there. Is that just a fraction of GRI? Has that shifted as well? Thanks.\nCarol Tome: So maybe I'll talk about the RPP and then you can talk about the margin. So on the base pricing, there are many dynamics on the base pricing. First, we were up against very tough comparisons from a year ago. Why? Well, you'll recall that our volume declined in the United States in the second quarter by almost 10%. And this was related to noise around the labor contract negotiation. If you look at who declined during that time frame it was predominantly dual-sourcers, who are low GRI customers. So last year's base pricing was a bit artificially inflated because it is just the mix change. If you roll forward now to this year, what you see in the base pricing is, okay the tough comparisons year-on-year, as well as new entrants that don't have a GRI because they are starting to ship with us for the first time. And then finally, if you zoom out and say well, what's the keep rate looking like on those customers who have a GRI? The keep rate is looking at about 50%. So as we get past this time frame and get into an easier compare, that's why we think our base rates can improve dramatically in the -- from where it was in the second half. And maybe you can talk about the margins.\nBrian Dykes: Yes. And Ken I'll give you a little bit of shaping for how we think the second half is going to go because we do have confidence in how we are going to be able to pull-through the margin. First, if you think about in the US from Q3 to Q4, we expect ADV to be up around kind of mid-single digit. We do -- as we just talked about, the decline in RPP growth will moderate, so about negative 1.5% in the third quarter, negative 5% in the fourth quarter. And as we get to peak and we see the holiday demand surcharges, we expect that to get even better. And we expect op-profit to be up kind of double digits in Q3. And then December as Carol mentioned before, we're going to hit a 10% operating margin. In International, Q3 ADV is kind of flat to slightly positive year-over-year, with Q4 up mid-single digits and the RPP growth of 1% to 2% year-over-year in the second half. Our Q3 op margin is in the high teens and then getting to over 20% in Q4. So continuing that strong momentum in International. And then we expect a mid-teens revenue growth in SCS and stronger year-over-year profit growth in Q3 and Q4 with the second half up about 20%. And look, I think we've got a lot of confidence that we can pull through the second half forecast for a couple of reasons. One is we've got line of sight to the volume. We've shown the volume has been building. We've got a line of sight to the volume that we need to deliver the top-line. And that helps offset some of the RPP growth, and you can see that in the guide. On the cost side, fit-to-serve is on track. We have reduced 11,500 or 90% of the resources that we had anticipated. And then we've also got line-of-sight to revenue improvements that are in the pipeline as well that are going to help us drive better profitability as we get into the second half. So we absolutely feel confident that we are back to the point of revenue growth, profit growth and back to margin expansion in the US.\nCarol Tome: And just one other piece of color, don't forget that we are anniversarying our labor contract on August 1. So the pressure associated with that contract moderates dramatically in the back half.\nBrian Dykes: That's right.\nKen Hoexter: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning. Two parter if I may, please. Given -- I mean, you've done a pretty good job of kind of managing your largest customer in terms of size. Will you be looking to also meter the growth from these new e-commerce customers as part of better, not bigger if the mix is not being helpful? And second question is can you help us dimension the size of returns in your operation either in terms of volume or revenue please? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: So first in terms of our largest customer we have a very good relationship with that customer, and the revenue for the quarter was at 11.5% of total revenue, so about the same as it was a year ago. And we look forward to continuing to optimizing the relationship we had with that customer. In terms of the new e-commerce entrants that have come into our network, we’re focused on serving the segments of the opportunities that really respect our end-to-end network, and we will continue to do that. One reason why we are leaning so hard into health care, another reason why we are leaning so hard into SMBs. And I couldn't say enough goodness about our SMB business, particularly our digital access program where the revenue grew 7.7% year-on-year. We now have 38 partners around the world in that program and over 5.8 million shippers on the program. Returns Brian, do you want to comment on that?\nBrian Dykes: Yes. So Ravi we don't -- returns rolls up into our B2B product and also into the ground commercial breakout that we give. Look returns is a portfolio that UPS has had for a long time that we continue to add to and be a leader in. It's one that we've continued to see growth in B2B even when we have, had pressures in other parts of the business. And it leverages not only are kind of single piece returns and technology capabilities that enable customers to integrate with their process, but also the UPS store footprint which allows us to have a very unique returns offering. Now when you add Happy to that, we are able to do consolidated returns, it really becomes a unique portfolio that provides growth in B2B.\nCarol Tome: And Matt Guffey is here. Maybe, Matt, you want to comment on Happy Returns and how that's going -- the integration is going.\nMatt Guffey: Absolutely. So Happy Returns integration has been extremely important. Remember, we made that acquisition last November. We turned on all 5,200 stores in a matter of eight weeks, which gives us great scale. And with this to Brian's point, it's just not about the digital capabilities, but it is also about that physical footprint and the experience that you can drive for not just the consumer but also the shipper. So we continue to see growth from the Happy Returns portfolio and -- but it also complementary to the single piece returns as well. So as we think about no box, no label and consolidation, we are also doing the no box, no label single piece. So it allows consumers and shippers to get the benefit on -- and managing the rules on how they want the returns to come back to them.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hi, thanks. Good morning. So Brian can you just clarify, you are saying that US package EBIT will be up double digits. Are you sort of pointing us towards that -- around that 10% growth rate and then just because double digits is going to obviously mean a lot. And then bigger picture, Carol. At the Analyst Day, you talked about industry oversupply, we are seeing negative yields. It doesn't feel like there is a lot of pricing power right now. But in that context, your -- the peak season surcharges coming are really big. And we were surprised by the magnitude of them. So I guess my question is like are we at an inflection point where you think you can start pushing price more aggressively? And this is a turn? Is this just a unique quarter with a compressed peak? I just want to understand the peak surcharges seem to go in contrast with what we are seeing in underlying price and yield right now. And I just want to understand if we are at a turning point.\nCarol Tome: Well, let's talk about the margin first and then we will talk about peak.\nBrian Dykes: Yes. So Scott I think what I was talking about was the shaping of Q3 to Q4. And in Q3 yes, we expect domestic package EBIT to be up in the 10% to 15% range. And then for the -- and then it will moderate a little bit. The growth will moderate a little bit in Q4 as the comp levels out. And Carol, do you want to --.\nCarol Tome: I'll be happy to talk about peak. So it is a condensed peak. It is the most condensed peak since 2019. There are only 17 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And as we look at the volume projections for peak, we’re expecting on our Peak day, which is December 18, has the highest volume ever in our network. Now when you have that kind of volume flowing to your network, you actually have to charge to service them well because you have to hire people and lease aircraft and delivery vehicles so on and so forth. So we think that the prices are going to stick because of what the environment is telling us from a demand perspective. I would also say candidly, they are up against very easy comparison last year. Because, as you recall, well we peaked, volume was declining in the network. So the year-over-year comparisons and the fact that this peak is tight gives us confidence. That being said we also have an opportunity to price -- moving from the art of pricing to the science of pricing through the new tools that we have been talking to you about. Pricing architecture of the future gives us the opportunity to use modifiers and price that creates opportunities for value for our customers, as well as value for ourselves. That plus deal manager, which has been a huge home run for us. We are winning more deals at less discounts than we have in the past. And Matt, maybe I'll turn it back over to you for a comment on price.\nMatt Guffey: Yes. So first off, we think we are competing in a rational pricing environment today. And to Carol's point, I think about it in three segments, once she hit on some of the mediums. We also talked about our Digital Access Program, where we have the ability to leverage the architecture of tomorrow. And the way to think about the technology, if I could just to give you context, is the technology gets dynamic pricing across all customer segments and all channels. So we've leveraged it to win in the Digital Access Program, Carol highlighted deal manager. How you think about now moving forward, which I think is really exciting for us is now we have the ability through the modifiers that she highlighted, to dynamically priced across our enterprise customers to better align our price to our cost to serve, while also providing the best value for our customers.\nCarol Tome: So hopefully, that's helpful, Scott.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, good afternoon or good morning and thanks for taking my question. So Carol, when you came in, there was a lot of focus on value over volume. But here we are guiding down the back half on really easy comps through growth in lower-value volume. Has something changed to your focus for the company? Like what should investors take away from this sort of -- what seems like a pivot towards chasing volume again?\nCarol Tome: Yes. So we are not chasing volume. We actually accepted new customers into our network of with certain volume expectations that blew up on us. We are not chasing it. It is just their demand was much higher than we had anticipated. And so we are laser focused -- focusing on the segments of the market that value our end-to-end network. Better not bigger has not gone away. We'll be managing through this. We need to manage through it and we will be managing through it. So don't read anything into this other than we had new customers come in to our network whose volume blew up. And we were able to serve that with the best on-time service of any carrier.\nBrian Dykes: And Carol, if I can just add one thing because I think the value of the volume is also very important. And while we had a lot more shippers in the network, it is important to reinforce this point that SurePost rides in the same theaters and the same hubs that all the other packages do and it helped us drive incremental productivity. Our cube utilization was up in the feeder network. Our hub productivity was up, our preload productivity was up. And when you look at what that does with cost per piece, the US business was able to hold cost per piece to a 2.5% growth rate in the face of a 12% increase in compensation rate. So that alone is huge. Then you layer on top of that the impact it can have on the delivery side with the redirect and really driving stop-and-route density. It's -- the volume generates productivity improvements throughout the entire network, now we have the ability to manage as we move forward.\nDavid Vernon: So I mean, I guess I appreciate that. But when you think about the guidance you just gave for 3Q being 10% to 15% off a really low base, it just doesn't seem like it is dropping to the bottom-line. And that's what investors are looking to capitalize your earnings, not necessarily productivity or cost per piece growth.\nCarol Tome: Yes. No we appreciate that. We do. There are a number of actions that we can take to address this. But we thought it was important to provide guidance today. Is that the most realistic view of the back half of the year. It doesn't mean that this is the future of our company. In fact, as we mentioned we will exit the US with a 10% operating margin. That's a significant change from where we have been.\nDavid Vernon: Got it. Thank you for the time.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Yeah. Thanks, good morning. Maybe touching on that last response, Carol. What are some of the things that you can do to adjust to the network changes that we're seeing and the product mix changes that we're seeing? Is your ability to pull forward fit-to-serve, cost takeout some of the other network structure changes? I guess just how do you fix profitability running at that low level as it is right now?\nCarol Tome: So one way is to accelerate Network of the Future. And I get a review from the team every two weeks on what we are doing in that regard, while we committed to five additional closures in the back half of this year, I think there is an opportunity to do more. Nando, would you like to comment on that?\nNando Cesarone: Yes, there sure is. And look -- I would just say the operators and the engineers are in tiptop shape right now. And our network is matching to the actual activity that is occurring. But I will tell you there is additional opportunity. As we've closed 35 operational operations this year, we've got additional in the second half. But also, we are starting online 23 new projects that is going to drive additional automation into our efficiency. And so as you start to see the efficiency unfold, we talked about the hours versus the volume, our air volume versus block hours. And of course there is a lot of discussion about SurePost, we're up 300 basis points, making sure we are matching that product with every other package in our network to reduce our operational costs. So as we find those opportunities, we continue making sure we're pressing forward. And for what it's worth, the value of all of that is one, very efficient, very safe and pleasing network to our customers.\nCarol Tome: And Kate, the same is true outside of the United States. So what cost down activities are you focused on?\nKate Gutmann: Yes. So Carol, I think the important move that we made at the start of the year that is playing out in the second half, and you can see it in the margins, of course is the flattening of our structure. We actually – we are focused on how do we speed up from the customer to the decision-making. And we eliminated a whole layer throughout the world, and we are getting great feedback both from the customer, as well as from our people. One example of that also playing off of what Matt talked about with deal manager, we have actually shaved off two weeks of pricing time internationally. International is very complex. Every bid is different countries and different cost structures. To be able to do that and get it down now into two-day turn time or less for our SMBs, that's why we're seeing an over 60% SMB mix in the international arena as well. So both sides of the profit equation.\nCarol Tome: Productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS. I think we've shown that we can drive cost out, and we will continue to do that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan: Hi, thanks operator. And good morning everyone. Brian, you talked a little bit about the line of sight on volumes in the back half. And I'm wondering if maybe you could give us a bit more color on where RPP or yield trends have been moving into the third quarter so far. And I ask this because I think we saw a little bit of a deterioration, maybe a surprise deterioration on those metrics. Last quarter, it seems like that was not expected. So I'm just kind of curious, what makes you so confident that mix issues and the trade down issues that surprised us have kind of stabilized here and won't continue to deteriorate? And then maybe just worth a shot here, but is it possible to talk about what domestic volume growth would have been without that e-commerce customer?\nBrian Dykes: So certainly, on the first point around the RPP growth rate, I think when you take a look at the second quarter you do have to remember the comp is a big issue in the second quarter. And we did see quite a shift from Q1 to Q2. And as we go into Q3 and Q4, we do expect the growth rate to moderate -- sorry, the negative growth rate to moderate. So it will improve to about negative 1.4% in the third quarter negative 0.4% in the fourth quarter and that will continue to improve as we go through the back half. There is a couple of things that are going on there. One is we absolutely have line-of-sight to new customers that are going to be coming on that normalize the mix of volume that we have. And also we have seen the wave of these kind of new entrants come into the market, and the volume levels are stabilized. And we are working with those customers on what those forecasts look like in the back-half, so we have better line-of-sight to that. Related to your second question we invited these customers into our network. I think the idea of what they would look like if they weren't there, it doesn't really matter right? Because they are there -- we found a way to make this volume very efficient within our network. And look, we'll continue to grow in the places of the market that are growing faster.\nCarol Tome: And just on the line of sight question, we've really tightened up the visibility as to when we win an account versus when it actually comes into the network. I will say we -- our visibility there wasn't as sharp as it should have been, so we've gotten much better now. And we are holding everyone accountable for getting the cardboard onto the package car. And that makes a -- well it may not be cardboard, it may be a poly bag, but the package on to package car. So I feel much better than I have over the past several years, candidly in terms of our visibility on onboarding.\nBruce Chan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Carol, following up on the pipeline. You mentioned that several times in terms of the visibility, the types of customers, the confidence coming through there. Maybe you can elaborate on that last comment, given just how that one large customer or e-commerce customer surprised the upside when volumes blew up. And then separately, can you give us an update on the USPS contract, how it is going so far, any surprises and whether or not that was a big contributor to the updated '24 guide. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Yes. So to be perfectly clear, there were two new e-commerce customers that came into our network. And you can imagine who they are. These are new e-commerce shippers in the United States whose volume has been quite explosive. We are working through those relationships as we speak. As it relates to the USPS, Nando, would you like to comment on how that's going?\nNando Cesarone: Sure. I think because with regard to the USPS, both teams are actually face-to-face planning and executing so far close to 50% of the change. And we'll continue pushing forward. We'll be fully implemented in terms of the UPS network in place to serve the USPS on September 8 and contract really starts officially 10/01, where we'll see the -- all of the volume come over to UPS. So far, in recognition of two parties getting together for the first time in this regard, there's been some bumps but nothing systemic. So it's working out really well on both sides, professionals from the USPS and UPS, really doing some good work there.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hi everyone. Thank you. I was hoping you could provide some color just on revenue contribution for Estafeta and then maybe price paid. And then just bigger picture, how you are viewing the M&A landscape now. Are you happy with the portfolio? How are the returns of the businesses that you have or are acquiring holding up right now? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: So we're super excited about the Estafeta announcement. Acquiring companies in Mexico isn't easy. The team has worked very hard to get us to this point, and we'll work through all the closing conditions. We hope to have the acquisition closed by the end of the year. Together UPS and Estafeta will be a $1 billion plus business. So this firmly cements our leadership position in North America and we couldn't be more excited about it. Do you want to take the second part of the question?\nBrian Dykes: Yes, certainly. And then, Kate maybe you want to talk about the broader piece of it. But I think Estafeta, just to give you a little bit of context, it covers 95% of the population in Mexico with 145 facilities. So this is a fairly large business. It does about 325,000 pieces a day. So it gives you context of where it fits into the portfolio. And it fits very firmly within our near-shoring strategy. And Kate, do you want to add anything on that?\nKate Gutmann: Yes, absolutely. So think about first of all, that 300,000 pieces, all those shippers. They need a transporter, a cross-border solution that is quality and that has access to the best small package network in the US. That's what we give it. So it's the additional packages. I'll answer that other part of the question on our track record with the acquisitions. If you look back at Marken, also Bomi, onto MNX all of them are meeting their business cases, as well as their synergy both on the revenue and cost side of the equation. Because what it does is opens up again this end-to-end opportunity to these premium customers. We expect the same thing we are ahead of the supply chain shift into Mexico. Our supply chain cross-border business is up double digit. So this will only help with us that as well.\nCarol Tome: And I know you asked about the purchase price. We typically won't disclose the purchase price, but I can give you a hint. Brian said that we accessed the debt capital markets in the second quarter and raised some additional debt capital for growth. It is about $1.2 billion. We are not spending $1.2 billion on the business. So that gives you a sense of where the purchase price is going to be.\nBrian Dykes: That's right.\nCarol Tome: And in terms of the portfolio of assets that we have -- we looked at strategic alternatives for Coyote. We are delighted to reach an agreement with RFO to sell Coyote to that business, at a great value, higher than our carrying value, and the multiple on EBITDA was over 12 times. So I was really pleased with the value that we received or will receive when we close that transaction. And we are always looking at the portfolio of assets, are there other things that we can optimize or monetize. So we are never done. But there's nothing large that would need to be talked about today.\nBrian Dykes: Stephen, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Thanks for taking my questions. If you go back to the trade down discussion in the SurePost, can you talk a little bit high level about how that business moves through your network? And what's different about it that better matches the cost of that package with the lower yield for that package? And just extending that a little bit further if SurePost is a higher mix of the domestic business than you'd expected longer-term, what nuance changes would there need to be with the network to make that a better fit? Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Well, SurePost is a great product in many ways. As I mentioned, it is a Sunday solution for us, and we are -- with our matching algorithm able to redirect volume. So it's delivered in our ground network. Maybe, Nando you want to give a little bit more color at how does that work?\nNando Cesarone: Yes, sure. And as Brian mentioned earlier, I mean, SurePost is going to flow through our network, regular feeders, regular hubs, sortation. What we are working on and very close to solving is looking ahead more than one day, so we can match even more of those SurePost shipments. So right now, if a package shows up at a destination, that particular morning, we will match that package with other deliveries for that day. The option moving forward is to look for additional matching opportunities, and we are very close to that solution so we can actually look further out. In total, as I said before, we're matching a lot more, about 3% more than last year. And each one is offsetting the cost and providing profitability to that shipment or that delivery, if you will to that one location.\nCarol Tome: So that matching capability then creates more delivery density, which is a big value unlock for us. We've talked about in the past, every 10 basis points of improvement is a couple of hundred million dollars. So this is an important initiative to make this product even more attractive to us over time.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Thank you.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the conference back over to our host, Mr. Guido. Please go ahead.\nPJ Guido: Thank you, Stephen. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining and have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Dykes",
            "content": "Thank you, Carol, and good morning everyone. First, I'm very thankful for the opportunity to lead the global finance organization and work with the entire leadership team to achieve the targets we set. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us and the right team to achieve our goals. I'm also particularly eager to meet our investors as I hit the road over the next few weeks. This morning I'll review our second quarter results, provide an update on capital allocation and lastly, provide additional detail for our 2024 financial outlook. First, our results. The second quarter represented an important turning point for our business. In the US, volume inflected positively and it was the last full quarter of the high wage growth rate associated with the first year of our new Teamsters contract. Outside the US, we saw pockets-of-demand improved in each export region driving growth in many of our more profitable lanes. Additionally, through our fit-to-serve initiative, we reduced our workforce by over 11,500 positions which has translated into approximately $350 million in savings for the first half of 2024. And as Carol said we are on track to deliver roughly $1 billion in savings by the end of the year. Looking at our consolidated performance. In the second quarter, revenue was $21.8 billion, a reduction of $237 million compared to the second quarter of 2023. Consolidated operating profit was $2.1 billion, down 29.3%, and consolidated operating margin was 9.5%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.79, down 29.5% from the second quarter of 2023. Now let's look at our business segment. In the second quarter, US average daily volume increased 0.7% year-over-year. This marks a return to positive volume growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. And sequentially, when compared to the first quarter of 2024, the average daily volume year-over-year growth rate increased by 390 basis points. At the beginning of the year, we expected to see three things in the second quarter; volume growth, growth in B2C and relatively consistent product mix to what we had experienced last year. While we saw strong volume growth in the second quarter led by B2C, it came with a different product mix. For the quarter, B2C volume increased 4.8% year-over-year and made up 58.5% of our volume, an increase of 220 basis points from a year ago. This growth was driven in large part by several new e-commerce customers that entered our network. B2B average daily volume finished down 4.6%. Returns remained a bright spot and increased 3% year-over-year. From a product perspective, we saw customers trade down between services. Specifically, we saw customers shift from air to ground and from ground to SurePost. As a result, total air average daily volume was down 7.8%, while ground average daily volume increased 2.3%. Within ground SurePost average daily volume grew 25%, driven by new shippers product choices, product trade downs and easier comparisons due to last year's decline in volume during our contract negotiations. By enhancing our matching algorithm, we saw an increase in the percentage of SurePost packages redirected to UPS for delivery. As a result, SurePost redirect increase returning to 2020 level. Turning to SMBs. We saw the trend from the first quarter continue with total SMB volume down until June when it flipped positive. And in terms of total volume, SMBs made up 29.7% in the second quarter. For the quarter, US Domestic generated revenue of $14.1 billion, down 1.9% compared to last year. Revenue per piece was down 2.6% year-over-year. Let me break down the components of the revenue per piece decline. Base rates increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 90 basis points. The combination of product mix, lighter weights and shorter zones decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 310 basis points. The remaining [40] (ph) basis point decline in the revenue per piece growth rate was due to the combination of changes in customer mix and fuel. Turning to costs. Total expense increased 3.2% in the second quarter. Union wage rates increased 11.7%, driven by the contractual increase that went into effect in August of last year. The US Domestic team took several actions and executed on productivity initiatives to partially offset the increase in compensation rate. We leveraged total service plan and network planning tools to reduce total operational hours by 1.4%, while volume grew 0.7%. Through Network of the Future, we had 17 operational closures in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 35. And because we're routing more volume through our automated facilities, we've permanently closed five buildings so far this year. We lowered block hours by 12.5% versus last year and we recorded our best auto safety results in 10 years, driving a better outcome for our people and a better long-term cost picture for UPS. Putting it all together, due to the actions we took in the second quarter, we held the cost per piece growth rate to only 2.5% even as union wages increased nearly 12%. This is the lowest cost per piece growth rate we've seen in more than three years. The US Domestic segment delivered $997 million in operating profit, down 40.7% compared to the second quarter of 2023, and the operating margin was 7.1%. Moving to our International segment. The second quarter was a turning point for our International business well. For the first time in 10 quarters, 11 of our top 20 export countries demonstrated year-over-year average daily volume growth, including several key markets in Europe. At the region level, Asia grew average daily volume and revenue in the quarter. And in the Americas regions, we continue to see solid signs of the shift in nearshoring. Looking at volume in the second quarter, International total average daily volume was down 2.9% year-over-year which is half the decline we saw in the first quarter of this year. About three-quarters of the decline in the second quarter came from lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 4.4%, primarily driven by Europe. On the export side, average daily volume declined 1.5% year-over-year. However, on a sequential basis from the first quarter, export average daily volume improved 210 basis points. While overall export average daily volume was down in Europe, in Germany, our largest export market, outbound grew 1%. In Asia export average daily volume increased 1.7%. And within Asia, export volume on the China to US trade lane increased 20.6%. This is the third consecutive quarter of volume growth on this lane, which is our most profitable lane. And looking at the Americas region, export average daily volume increased 5%, which was the sixth consecutive quarter of growth. As we see the shift in nearshore and continue to take hold, our announced acquisition of Estafeta will further enhance our end-to-end services in Mexico. In the second quarter, International revenue was $4.4 billion down 1% from last year, primarily due to the decline in volume. Revenue per piece increased 2.4%, driven by strong base pricing and the positive impact of region and product mix. In the second quarter total International expense was relatively flat year-over-year. Here we leverage the agility of our integrated network to manage block hours down 2.1% compared to last year. Operating profit in the International segment was $824 million down $78 million year-over-year. Operating margin in the second quarter was 18.9%. Moving to Supply Chain Solutions. In the face of a dynamic market, we remained agile and leaned into areas of growth. In the second quarter revenue was $3.3 billion, up 2.6% year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers. Within international air freight, strong e-commerce demand particularly in China outbound, drove an increase in volume and lifted market rates as demand outpaced capacity, resulting in an increase in revenue. On the ocean side, total volume and revenue was down year-over-year. However toward the end of the quarter, demand on Asia outbound lanes improved and drove market rates higher. Our truckload brokerage business known as Coyote, continued to face market pressures, which drove revenue down. And then logistics revenue grew driven by the impact of MNX and Health care. In the second quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $243 million, down $93 million year-over-year reflecting market conditions, Operating margin was 7.3%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $206 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $67 million. And our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23.4%. Now let's turn to cash and capital allocation. Year-to-date, we've generated $5.3 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $3.4 billion. We finished the quarter with strong liquidity and no outstanding commercial paper. In May, we successfully issued $2.8 billion of debt to refinance $1.6 billion in current maturities which will shore up additional liquidity and support our acquisition strategy. And in the quarter, we announced that we would be outsourcing the asset management portion of our pension plan in order to focus squarely on our core business, while adding more expertise and oversight that will benefit UPS retirees. Lastly, so far this year UPS has paid $2.7 billion in dividends, which brings us to our outlook for the second half of 2024. Global economic growth forecast remained relatively unchanged in the back half of 2024. According to S&P Global, global GDP is expected to grow 2.7% for the full year 2024 and US GDP is expected to grow 2.4%. Additionally, as we've discussed we still expect the US small package market excluding Amazon to grow by less than 1%. Looking at our business in the first half of 2024, revenue was below our expectations and operating profit was at the low end of the range we provided and finished down about 30%. Based on our performance in the first half of the year combined with our expectation that the product shift we experienced in the US will continue through the rest of 2024, we have updated our guidance. This includes moving to a point estimate because it represents our best view of the many moving parts within our business. We now expect consolidated revenue to be approximately $93 billion, and because the volume characteristics are different from what we originally anticipated, we now expect a consolidated operating margin of approximately 9.4%. Our guidance includes roughly $1 billion in savings from fit-to-serve. And as Carol mentioned, Coyote revenue and operating profit remains in our guidance and will until the transaction is executed. Looking at the segments. In US Domestic, we anticipate back half 2024 revenue growth of around 5%, driven by strong volume growth. As you update your models for US Domestic there are a few things to keep in mind. First, we expect average daily volume to grow by mid-single digits. Second, we'll anniversary the first year of the Teamsters contract on August 1. Next, product mix is expected to continue to pressure revenue per piece. However through expense management and slowing labor inflation, we expect to grow third quarter operating profit by double digits and exit the year with a US operating margin of 10%. And lastly, we expect a strong peak driven by volume growth and demand surcharges. Within the International segment, our full year and second half outlook remains consistent with what we provided at the beginning of the year. For the second half of 2024, we anticipate volume growth rates will inflect positively and the revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Operating margin in the second half of the year in the International segment is anticipated to be approximately 20%. And in Supply Chain Solutions, in the second half of 2024, we expect revenue to be over $7 billion and an operating margin in the high-single digits. Included in our guidance is the newly won air cargo business from the USPS, which will be fully onboarded by the end of the third quarter. And lastly, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 22% for the remainder of the year. Turning to capital allocation. For the full year in 2024, we expect free cash flow to be around $5.8 billion before any pension contribution. We've tightened our capital expenditure forecast and now expect to spend about $4 billion. We plan to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval. And given our strong liquidity, while we originally had not planned to repurchase shares, we now plan to repurchase approximately $500 million of shares this year. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions. Yes. Thanks, Tom for the question. I think when you look at the domestic volume performance from the second quarter and then going forward. In the second quarter, there was really two big impacts that were driving the change. One is we did see customers favoring our more economical products, so going from air-to-ground, and within ground, from ground to SurePost. And that was across the broad base of customers. We also saw an acceleration of new entrants, new e-commerce customers that were coming into the market that are quite frankly running a different model than our traditional customers and are highly leveraging our SurePost product. So we saw an acceleration of SurePost. The growth rate is also complicated as you think about what happened in the second quarter of last year because of the type of customers that diverted early. As we were approaching the Teamster contract, it does also skew the growth rate. As we move forward and you see -- you can see it in our forecast and within the guide, that we do expect that mix to rationalize as we move towards the end of the year. And we've got line of sight to that in our pipeline and are working to actively pull those through as we kind of balance the mix of products going into the second half. Yes. So as Carol mentioned, yes we do expect our RPP growth to moderate in the back half. And actually, as we move from kind of the negative 2.6% that we are at to almost approach breakeven as we get towards the end of the year. And there is a couple of pieces of that. Carol had mentioned the B2B piece. I would say, the bright spot within B2B is returns, that improved 3%. And we are seeing uptake with the addition of Happy Returns into the portfolio. And as that pipeline builds and we start to see that pull through, that continues to accelerate our B2B business. The other thing I would say is that we do have a strong pipeline of ground-ready products. And what happens with the SurePost product is, it allows you to get new customers in, leveraging that. We get the integration into their systems, we get the pickup process set up, and they become part of the UPS portfolio but then allows us to expand that as we go through the cycles. Yes. And Ken I'll give you a little bit of shaping for how we think the second half is going to go because we do have confidence in how we are going to be able to pull-through the margin. First, if you think about in the US from Q3 to Q4, we expect ADV to be up around kind of mid-single digit. We do -- as we just talked about, the decline in RPP growth will moderate, so about negative 1.5% in the third quarter, negative 5% in the fourth quarter. And as we get to peak and we see the holiday demand surcharges, we expect that to get even better. And we expect op-profit to be up kind of double digits in Q3. And then December as Carol mentioned before, we're going to hit a 10% operating margin. In International, Q3 ADV is kind of flat to slightly positive year-over-year, with Q4 up mid-single digits and the RPP growth of 1% to 2% year-over-year in the second half. Our Q3 op margin is in the high teens and then getting to over 20% in Q4. So continuing that strong momentum in International. And then we expect a mid-teens revenue growth in SCS and stronger year-over-year profit growth in Q3 and Q4 with the second half up about 20%. And look, I think we've got a lot of confidence that we can pull through the second half forecast for a couple of reasons. One is we've got line of sight to the volume. We've shown the volume has been building. We've got a line of sight to the volume that we need to deliver the top-line. And that helps offset some of the RPP growth, and you can see that in the guide. On the cost side, fit-to-serve is on track. We have reduced 11,500 or 90% of the resources that we had anticipated. And then we've also got line-of-sight to revenue improvements that are in the pipeline as well that are going to help us drive better profitability as we get into the second half. So we absolutely feel confident that we are back to the point of revenue growth, profit growth and back to margin expansion in the US. That's right. Yes. So Ravi we don't -- returns rolls up into our B2B product and also into the ground commercial breakout that we give. Look returns is a portfolio that UPS has had for a long time that we continue to add to and be a leader in. It's one that we've continued to see growth in B2B even when we have, had pressures in other parts of the business. And it leverages not only are kind of single piece returns and technology capabilities that enable customers to integrate with their process, but also the UPS store footprint which allows us to have a very unique returns offering. Now when you add Happy to that, we are able to do consolidated returns, it really becomes a unique portfolio that provides growth in B2B. Yes. So Scott I think what I was talking about was the shaping of Q3 to Q4. And in Q3 yes, we expect domestic package EBIT to be up in the 10% to 15% range. And then for the -- and then it will moderate a little bit. The growth will moderate a little bit in Q4 as the comp levels out. And Carol, do you want to --. And Carol, if I can just add one thing because I think the value of the volume is also very important. And while we had a lot more shippers in the network, it is important to reinforce this point that SurePost rides in the same theaters and the same hubs that all the other packages do and it helped us drive incremental productivity. Our cube utilization was up in the feeder network. Our hub productivity was up, our preload productivity was up. And when you look at what that does with cost per piece, the US business was able to hold cost per piece to a 2.5% growth rate in the face of a 12% increase in compensation rate. So that alone is huge. Then you layer on top of that the impact it can have on the delivery side with the redirect and really driving stop-and-route density. It's -- the volume generates productivity improvements throughout the entire network, now we have the ability to manage as we move forward. So certainly, on the first point around the RPP growth rate, I think when you take a look at the second quarter you do have to remember the comp is a big issue in the second quarter. And we did see quite a shift from Q1 to Q2. And as we go into Q3 and Q4, we do expect the growth rate to moderate -- sorry, the negative growth rate to moderate. So it will improve to about negative 1.4% in the third quarter negative 0.4% in the fourth quarter and that will continue to improve as we go through the back half. There is a couple of things that are going on there. One is we absolutely have line-of-sight to new customers that are going to be coming on that normalize the mix of volume that we have. And also we have seen the wave of these kind of new entrants come into the market, and the volume levels are stabilized. And we are working with those customers on what those forecasts look like in the back-half, so we have better line-of-sight to that. Related to your second question we invited these customers into our network. I think the idea of what they would look like if they weren't there, it doesn't really matter right? Because they are there -- we found a way to make this volume very efficient within our network. And look, we'll continue to grow in the places of the market that are growing faster. Yes, certainly. And then, Kate maybe you want to talk about the broader piece of it. But I think Estafeta, just to give you a little bit of context, it covers 95% of the population in Mexico with 145 facilities. So this is a fairly large business. It does about 325,000 pieces a day. So it gives you context of where it fits into the portfolio. And it fits very firmly within our near-shoring strategy. And Kate, do you want to add anything on that? That's right. Stephen, we have time for one more question."

            "content": "Yes. So Carol, I think the important move that we made at the start of the year that is playing out in the second half, and you can see it in the margins, of course is the flattening of our structure. We actually – we are focused on how do we speed up from the customer to the decision-making. And we eliminated a whole layer throughout the world, and we are getting great feedback both from the customer, as well as from our people. One example of that also playing off of what Matt talked about with deal manager, we have actually shaved off two weeks of pricing time internationally. International is very complex. Every bid is different countries and different cost structures. To be able to do that and get it down now into two-day turn time or less for our SMBs, that's why we're seeing an over 60% SMB mix in the international arena as well. So both sides of the profit equation. Yes, absolutely. So think about first of all, that 300,000 pieces, all those shippers. They need a transporter, a cross-border solution that is quality and that has access to the best small package network in the US. That's what we give it. So it's the additional packages. I'll answer that other part of the question on our track record with the acquisitions. If you look back at Marken, also Bomi, onto MNX all of them are meeting their business cases, as well as their synergy both on the revenue and cost side of the equation. Because what it does is opens up again this end-to-end opportunity to these premium customers. We expect the same thing we are ahead of the supply chain shift into Mexico. Our supply chain cross-border business is up double digit. So this will only help with us that as well."

            "name": "Carol Tome",
            "content": "Thank you, PJ, and good morning. Let me begin by welcoming Brian Dykes as UPS's new Chief Financial Officer. With over 25 years of multinational experience with the company, Brian brings deep financial and strategic experience to our executive leadership team. Welcome, Brian. Our second quarter performance was a significant turning point for our company as we returned to volume growth in the United States the first time in nine quarters. I would like to recognize and thank UPSers for their hard work and efforts in delivering these results. At the beginning of the year, we shared our outlook for 2024 based on four key planning assumptions. The first planning assumption acknowledged the front-loading of costs associated with our new labor contracts, which we believed would cause our financial performance to reflect a bathtub effect, with first half 2024 earnings down as much as 30% and second half earnings returning to growth. In the first half of the year, our earnings were in-line with the down 30% scenario. The second assumption was that we would return to volume growth, which we did in the US, during the month of May. Further, while international volume growth in the second quarter was down 2.9% year-over-year, we saw growth in certain markets. The third planning assumption was based on our fit-to-serve initiative to right size our management structure. And we are on track with this initiative to deliver roughly $1 billion in savings by the end of the year. Finally, we said we would explore strategic alternatives for Coyote and we did, leading to a pending sell to RXO, at considerably more than our carrying value. So the key assumptions we used to build our plan are holding with one distinction and that's US volume mix both in terms of product and customer segmentation. During the quarter we experienced a shift toward value products with shippers choosing ground over air and SurePost over ground. And there was also a notable shift in product characteristics with a surge in lightweight short-zone volume moving into our network. We will discuss the full year impact of these shifts in a few moments. But let me first highlight our second quarter results and then provide a few updates on our longer-term strategies. In the second quarter, consolidated revenue was $21.8 billion, a decline of 1.1% versus last year. Consolidated operating profit was $2.1 billion down 29.3% and consolidated operating margin was 9.5%. At our March Investor Day, we set forth our declarations to become the premium small package provider, the premium logistics orchestrator, and the Number #1 complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. To that end, we said we would pursue certain inorganic opportunities and we have. As you've seen, we just announced our plans to acquire Estafeta, a leading domestic small package provider in Mexico. This is a big win for UPS and it's a big win for our customers. By combining Estafeta with the end-to-end services we already have in Mexico and connecting it to the global reach of our integrated network, we will greatly enhance our logistics orchestration capabilities for customers that are shifting manufacturing and distribution closer to the United States. We are targeting to close this acquisition by the end of this year. Let me share a few other strategic updates starting with customer first. In healthcare we just opened our first dedicated healthcare facility in Dublin, Ireland. This 82,000 square foot facility provides storage and fulfillment for a range of complex pharmaceutical and healthcare products. And in the Netherlands, we increased the size of our flagship facility in Roermond to now more than 235,000 square feet, including expanded ultra-cold storage capabilities to support the growing market of complex biopharma products. Looking at SMBs, we continue to add partners to our Digital Access Program or DAP, meeting small businesses where they are. In the first six months of this year, DAP generated $1.5 billion in revenue and we are well on our way to achieving our 2024 DAP revenue target of over $3 billion. And because speed will always be important to our customers. In the US, we expanded our weekend service offering to six additional markets. With this service, we provide deliveries one day earlier than competitors who don't offer weekend pickup services. In fact, we are the only private US-based carrier that provides both commercial and residential pickup and delivery services on Saturday as a general service offering. Outside of the US, we are continuing to enhance our portfolio to support our customers as they balance the need for speed with cost. For example, in record time, we launched enhancements to our worldwide economy service globally. This is an e-commerce solution for non-urgent cross-border shipment. Here we created a true door-to-door service with customs clearance and delivery fees baked into the solution, making the experience simpler for the shipper and the receiver. In Asia, over the last several quarters, we've made a series of network enhancements with the latest being in Taiwan. Because Europe is a top three export destination for Taiwan, we've expanded our capacity by 30% and extended pickups to as late as midnight. These enhancements enable our customers, including high-tech manufacturing and automotive shippers, to better serve their European customers by reaching their destination in just two business days. And in supply chain solutions, we've expanded our supply chain operations at our Frankfurt Airport Gateway, by adding nearly 25% more warehouse space. This facility is a major SCS hub for central Europe where it connects all transportation modes. In this expansion, we can now provide even greater flexibility to the region's growing technology and healthcare industry. And importantly, also in SCS, we are onboarding the new USPS Air Cargo business with plans to be fully implemented before peak. The onboarding has gone well and we continue to expect this business to be margin accretive for the company. Now let's turn to innovation driven and progress with Network of the Future. In the first half of 2024, we completed 35 operational closures, which included closing five buildings. And we are on plan to complete an additional five operational closures in the second half of this year. Simultaneously, we're continuing to automate more of our operational tasks. For example, in the US, we are automating the dispatch process for our packaged car and feeder drivers to reduce dispatch staffing by half. We deployed Phase 1 of the project and so far this year we've reduced staffing by 26%. As we continue deployment, we expect to achieve our reduction target by 2026. As a reminder, these actions are outside of fit-to-serve and are part of Network of the Future. Lastly, touching on Smart Package Smart Facility, which is our RFID solution, we are moving from a scanning network to a sensing network. As we've discussed, we're adding RFID readers to our package cards, but we're not stopping there. We're moving upstream. First, we are enabling customers to print RFID labels themselves. Second, we are installing readers at customer dock doors. This will enable immediate visibility as our trailers are loaded for pick-up. This solution provides a significant competitive advantage to us and to our customers. Moving to our financial outlook, Brian will provide more details but let me share a few highlights. First, while we have entered into an agreement to sell our Coyote business, we are retaining Coyote revenue and earnings in our outlook until the transaction is consummated. Second, while our first half earnings were in-line with the low end of the guidance we provided, our revenue came in just short of the low-end. Given the current volume momentum we are now experiencing in our business, we are resetting our revenue guidance, taking us to the midpoint of our original revenue guide. But for operating profit, as we look to the back half of the year, in the US, we expect the same volume mix characteristics as we had in the first half of the year, which compresses revenue per piece growth. While we still expect an operating profit bathtub effect with solid earnings growth in the back half of the year, the growth rate will not be as high as we projected at the beginning of the year. Accordingly, we are adjusting our full year operating margin guidance to reflect the nature of the volume flowing through our US Network. As a result, we now expect consolidated revenue of approximately $93 billion and a consolidated operating margin of approximately 9.4%. Importantly, we expect to exit the final month of 2024 with a US operating margin of 10%, which creates a solid footing as we drive the US business to a longer-term operating margin target of 12%. One last comment before I hand the call over to Brian. We believe it is important to have a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation with the first uses of capital going back to the business and to pay our dividends and then any excess cash being used for share repurchases. As we have fine-tuned our capital requirements for Network of the Future, we expect to spend less than we originally anticipated. Further, with the pending sale of Coyote, we expect to free up cash that was not in our original guidance plan. As a result, we are restarting our share repurchase program with the intent of repurchasing about $1 billion of shares annually, including roughly $500 million in 2024. So with that, thank you for listening and let me turn the call over to Brian. And maybe a couple of other comments about just the volume. As you saw our commercial business was down year-on-year, although the rate of decline has moderated greatly. As we look to the back-half of the year, we expect that to improve. Our pipeline is quite robust. So we expect to see good movement in that space. On the B2B front, as we discussed it was down year-on-year. Part of that was because of customers who left us during the contract negotiation that have not returned. They left us, they locked themselves into long-term contracts and they have not yet returned. That just gives us an opportunity to win them back for the excellent service that we provide. We've also seen some dynamics within the B2B space occur recently within poolers, companies going out of business like overnight which gives us an opportunity to bring that business back into our network. It's already starting to flow. And as I mentioned, the pipeline of commercial accounts is robust. So we expect that to improve dramatically in the back half of the year. On the RPP, it is really interesting. We've had these new e-commerce entrants into the United States. And their volume, well, it is exploded. It was certainly more than we anticipate flowing into our network. So in -- to your question, is this a phenomenon forever? I don't know. It depends on what consumer demand will be. But we are going to focus on the parts of the market that really value our end-to-end service and expect to see some of the pressure that we saw on the RPP in the second quarter moderate. And Brian, maybe you can give a little bit more color on what we think the RPP will look like in the back half of the year. And maybe one other comment about SurePost because the question may be, do you like that product. We actually like the product. It provides a steady solution for us. We also through our matching algorithm, we can redirect the packages back into the ground network. And in fact, the redirect percentage was 40%. So that's returning back to levels we saw during the COVID. So maybe I'll talk about the RPP and then you can talk about the margin. So on the base pricing, there are many dynamics on the base pricing. First, we were up against very tough comparisons from a year ago. Why? Well, you'll recall that our volume declined in the United States in the second quarter by almost 10%. And this was related to noise around the labor contract negotiation. If you look at who declined during that time frame it was predominantly dual-sourcers, who are low GRI customers. So last year's base pricing was a bit artificially inflated because it is just the mix change. If you roll forward now to this year, what you see in the base pricing is, okay the tough comparisons year-on-year, as well as new entrants that don't have a GRI because they are starting to ship with us for the first time. And then finally, if you zoom out and say well, what's the keep rate looking like on those customers who have a GRI? The keep rate is looking at about 50%. So as we get past this time frame and get into an easier compare, that's why we think our base rates can improve dramatically in the -- from where it was in the second half. And maybe you can talk about the margins. And just one other piece of color, don't forget that we are anniversarying our labor contract on August 1. So the pressure associated with that contract moderates dramatically in the back half. So first in terms of our largest customer we have a very good relationship with that customer, and the revenue for the quarter was at 11.5% of total revenue, so about the same as it was a year ago. And we look forward to continuing to optimizing the relationship we had with that customer. In terms of the new e-commerce entrants that have come into our network, we're focused on serving the segments of the opportunities that really respect our end-to-end network, and we will continue to do that. One reason why we are leaning so hard into health care, another reason why we are leaning so hard into SMBs. And I couldn't say enough goodness about our SMB business, particularly our digital access program where the revenue grew 7.7% year-on-year. We now have 38 partners around the world in that program and over 5.8 million shippers on the program. Returns Brian, do you want to comment on that? And Matt Guffey is here. Maybe, Matt, you want to comment on Happy Returns and how that's going -- the integration is going. Well, let's talk about the margin first and then we will talk about peak. I'll be happy to talk about peak. So it is a condensed peak. It is the most condensed peak since 2019. There are only 17 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And as we look at the volume projections for peak, we're expecting on our Peak day, which is December 18, has the highest volume ever in our network. Now when you have that kind of volume flowing to your network, you actually have to charge to service them well because you have to hire people and lease aircraft and delivery vehicles so on and so forth. So we think that the prices are going to stick because of what the environment is telling us from a demand perspective. I would also say candidly, they are up against very easy comparison last year. Because, as you recall, well we peaked, volume was declining in the network. So the year-over-year comparisons and the fact that this peak is tight gives us confidence. That being said we also have an opportunity to price -- moving from the art of pricing to the science of pricing through the new tools that we have been talking to you about. Pricing architecture of the future gives us the opportunity to use modifiers and price that creates opportunities for value for our customers, as well as value for ourselves. That plus deal manager, which has been a huge home run for us. We are winning more deals at less discounts than we have in the past. And Matt, maybe I'll turn it back over to you for a comment on price. So hopefully, that's helpful, Scott. Yes. So we are not chasing volume. We actually accepted new customers into our network of with certain volume expectations that blew up on us. We are not chasing it. It is just their demand was much higher than we had anticipated. And so we are laser focused -- focusing on the segments of the market that value our end-to-end network. Better not bigger has not gone away. We'll be managing through this. We need to manage through it and we will be managing through it. So don't read anything into this other than we had new customers come in to our network whose volume blew up. And we were able to serve that with the best on-time service of any carrier. Yes. No we appreciate that. We do. There are a number of actions that we can take to address this. But we thought it was important to provide guidance today. Is that the most realistic view of the back half of the year. It doesn't mean that this is the future of our company. In fact, as we mentioned we will exit the US with a 10% operating margin. That's a significant change from where we have been. Thank you. So one way is to accelerate Network of the Future. And I get a review from the team every two weeks on what we are doing in that regard, while we committed to five additional closures in the back half of this year, I think there is an opportunity to do more. Nando, would you like to comment on that? And Kate, the same is true outside of the United States. So what cost down activities are you focused on? Productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS. I think we've shown that we can drive cost out, and we will continue to do that. And just on the line of sight question, we've really tightened up the visibility as to when we win an account versus when it actually comes into the network. I will say we -- our visibility there wasn't as sharp as it should have been, so we've gotten much better now. And we are holding everyone accountable for getting the cardboard onto the package car. And that makes a -- well it may not be cardboard, it may be a poly bag, but the package on to package car. So I feel much better than I have over the past several years, candidly in terms of our visibility on onboarding. Thank you. Yes. So to be perfectly clear, there were two new e-commerce customers that came into our network. And you can imagine who they are. These are new e-commerce shippers in the United States whose volume has been quite explosive. We are working through those relationships as we speak. As it relates to the USPS, Nando, would you like to comment on how that's going? So we're super excited about the Estafeta announcement. Acquiring companies in Mexico isn't easy. The team has worked very hard to get us to this point, and we'll work through all the closing conditions. We hope to have the acquisition closed by the end of the year. Together UPS and Estafeta will be a $1 billion plus business. So this firmly cements our leadership position in North America and we couldn't be more excited about it. Do you want to take the second part of the question? And I know you asked about the purchase price. We typically won't disclose the purchase price, but I can give you a hint. Brian said that we accessed the debt capital markets in the second quarter and raised some additional debt capital for growth. It is about $1.2 billion. We are not spending $1.2 billion on the business. So that gives you a sense of where the purchase price is going to be. And in terms of the portfolio of assets that we have -- we looked at strategic alternatives for Coyote. We are delighted to reach an agreement with RFO to sell Coyote to that business, at a great value, higher than our carrying value, and the multiple on EBITDA was over 12 times. So I was really pleased with the value that we received or will receive when we close that transaction. And we are always looking at the portfolio of assets, are there other things that we can optimize or monetize. So we are never done. But there's nothing large that would need to be talked about today. Well, SurePost is a great product in many ways. As I mentioned, it is a Sunday solution for us, and we are -- with our matching algorithm able to redirect volume. So it's delivered in our ground network. Maybe, Nando you want to give a little bit more color at how does that work? So that matching capability then creates more delivery density, which is a big value unlock for us. We've talked about in the past, every 10 basis points of improvement is a couple of hundred million dollars. So this is an important initiative to make this product even more attractive to us over time. Thank you."

            "name": "Nando Cesarone",
            "content": "Yes, there sure is. And look -- I would just say the operators and the engineers are in tiptop shape right now. And our network is matching to the actual activity that is occurring. But I will tell you there is additional opportunity. As we've closed 35 operational operations this year, we've got additional in the second half. But also, we are starting online 23 new projects that is going to drive additional automation into our efficiency. And so as you start to see the efficiency unfold, we talked about the hours versus the volume, our air volume versus block hours. And of course there is a lot of discussion about SurePost, we're up 300 basis points, making sure we are matching that product with every other package in our network to reduce our operational costs. So as we find those opportunities, we continue making sure we're pressing forward. And for what it's worth, the value of all of that is one, very efficient, very safe and pleasing network to our customers. Sure. I think because with regard to the USPS, both teams are actually face-to-face planning and executing so far close to 50% of the change. And we'll continue pushing forward. We'll be fully implemented in terms of the UPS network in place to serve the USPS on September 8 and contract really starts officially 10/01, where we'll see the -- all of the volume come over to UPS. So far, in recognition of two parties getting together for the first time in this regard, there's been some bumps but nothing systemic. So it's working out really well on both sides, professionals from the USPS and UPS, really doing some good work there. Yes, sure. And as Brian mentioned earlier, I mean, SurePost is going to flow through our network, regular feeders, regular hubs, sortation. What we are working on and very close to solving is looking ahead more than one day, so we can match even more of those SurePost shipments. So right now, if a package shows up at a destination, that particular morning, we will match that package with other deliveries for that day. The option moving forward is to look for additional matching opportunities, and we are very close to that solution so we can actually look further out. In total, as I said before, we're matching a lot more, about 3% more than last year. And each one is offsetting the cost and providing profitability to that shipment or that delivery, if you will to that one location."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Matt Guffey",
            "content": "Absolutely. So Happy Returns integration has been extremely important. Remember, we made that acquisition last November. We turned on all 5,200 stores in a matter of eight weeks, which gives us great scale. And with this to Brian's point, it's just not about the digital capabilities, but it is also about that physical footprint and the experience that you can drive for not just the consumer but also the shipper. So we continue to see growth from the Happy Returns portfolio and -- but it also complementary to the single piece returns as well. So as we think about no box, no label and consolidation, we are also doing the no box, no label single piece. So it allows consumers and shippers to get the benefit on -- and managing the rules on how they want the returns to come back to them. Yes. So first off, we think we are competing in a rational pricing environment today. And to Carol's point, I think about it in three segments, once she hit on some of the mediums. We also talked about our Digital Access Program, where we have the ability to leverage the architecture of tomorrow. And the way to think about the technology, if I could just to give you context, is the technology gets dynamic pricing across all customer segments and all channels. So we've leveraged it to win in the Digital Access Program, Carol highlighted deal manager. How you think about now moving forward, which I think is really exciting for us is now we have the ability through the modifiers that she highlighted, to dynamically priced across our enterprise customers to better align our price to our cost to serve, while also providing the best value for our customers."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. PJ Guido, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\nPJ Guido : Good morning, and welcome to the UPS first quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO, and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2023 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results. For the first quarter of 2024, GAAP results include a total charge of $110 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, comprised of after-tax transformation and other charges of $75 million and a non-cash after-tax impairment charge of $35 million, driven by plans to consolidate certain acquired brands within our healthcare portfolio. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and also available in the webcast of today's call. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now, I'll turn the call over to Carol.\nCarol Tome: Thank you, PJ, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for doing what they do better than anyone, and that's deliver industry-leading service. Through the first quarter, UPSers continued to execute our strategy by focusing on growth and efficiency and exemplified our purpose of moving our world forward by delivering what matters. Moving to our results, the first quarter turned out as we expected, starting with a decline in average daily volume. U.S. average daily volume, or ADV, declined year-over-year, but the rate of decline slowed as the quarter progressed, ending with March down less than 1%. And on a sequential basis, the ADV decline rate in the first quarter showed marked improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This improving performance is primarily due to the efforts of our sales team to win and pull through new volume into our network. Outside of the U.S., the ADV decline rate also improved sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and we saw pockets of export growth in certain markets and lanes. For the first quarter, consolidated revenue was $21.7 billion, a decline of 5.3% versus last year. Operating profit was $1.7 billion, down 31.5% compared to last year, due for the most part to higher labor costs associated with the first year of our Teamster’s contract. Consolidated operating margin was 8%. Our operating profit performance was a bit better than we expected due to higher productivity. At our Investor and Analyst Day last month, we shared our three-year targets and how we intend to reach them under our Better and Bolder approach. We are reimagining our network through Network of the Future, and we are leaning into the parts of the market that value our end-to-end integrated network. For example, we recently announced that UPS will become the primary air cargo provider for the United States Postal Service. Under this contract, we will move most of the USPS’ air cargo within the United States. The USPS air cargo business fits beautifully with our strategy to grow our B2B business. To win, we put together an innovative and differentiated solution that leverages our integrated network and existing assets. The USPS air cargo business will contribute to top-line growth and be accretive to consolidated and U.S. domestic operating margins. Brian will share more details, including what to expect during the transition period and where this will show up in our financial reporting. Moving to our strategic update, through our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy, we are investing to grow in the premium parts of the market and drive efficiency. Let me give you a few recent examples. Starting with customer-first. Through our on-demand network, we are expanding our addressable market with capabilities like no-box, no-label returns, through Happy Returns, and the convenience of our more than 5,200 UPS store locations. During the first quarter, our overall returns volume in the U.S. increased 1.4%, and Happy Returns more than quadrupled its ADV in the first quarter. Returns are attractive to us for a couple of reasons. First, they are typically B2B movements, and as a result, drive pickup and delivery density. Second, our frictionless offering creates customer loyalty and repeat business. We are also expanding our addressable market with capabilities like big and bulky deliveries through Roadie. In the first quarter, we launched RoadieXD, which adds cross-dock capabilities to RoadieXL. Our cross-dock solution brings the digital and physical together for long-zone deliveries of bulky items, such as grills and furniture, that do not fit in the UPS small package network. This is enabling us to unlock additional revenue opportunities in the highly fragmented $60 billion big and bulky market in the U.S. It's still early days, but this is a large opportunity for us to grow quality revenue and profit and serve the needs of our customers. As we laid out at our Investor Day, our long-term target is to grow our U.S. S&D volume penetration to 40%. DAP, our digital access program, is one of the tools we will use to reach this target. Recently, we enhanced our DAP pricing capabilities by launching a solution we call Fast Lane. With Fast Lane, we can optimize rates and target attractive volume growth, whether it be by partner, by product, or by customer segment, all of which can drive revenue per piece growth. We can even target volume growth by geography to drive density. Prior to Fast Lane, rate and other adjustments in DAP could take months. Now we can make them in a matter of days or even hours. In terms of results, in the first quarter, DAP revenue grew by 3% year-over-year. And in 2024, we expect to generate over $3 billion in global DAP revenue. Speaking of S&D, over the last year, we've gained traction on improving the customer experience across 16 journeys. Take pickups. We redesigned our process and deployed new driver dispatch technology. This resulted in a 74% reduction in pickup concerns and a Net Promoter Score, or NPS, of 48 for this journey, which is an all-time high for UPS. And for our international customers, our next-gen brokerage solution is making it easier for S&Ds to navigate the ins and outs of exporting, as evidenced by a 40% decline in custom brokerage holds since April of 2023. Turning to healthcare, we aim to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. Healthcare companies are innovating, and so are we. Our latest example is the opening of LabPort at Worldport, our global air hub in Louisville, Kentucky. LabPort is unique. It's an end-of-the-runway, state-of-the-art facility built specifically for lab customers. By being at Worldport, we can deliver urgent air packages to our lab customers well before the sun comes up, so they can provide diagnostic results by early morning. And in terms of healthcare revenue, in the first quarter, revenue from our healthcare portfolio reached $2.6 billion. Outside the United States, we're continuing to enhance our network to grow our premium international business. Our most recent example is the launch of Next Day flights between Shenzhen, China, and Sydney, Australia. The addition of these flights enables faster import and export movements between 11 Asian markets in Australia. And now, exports from Australia can even reach Europe by the next business day. This enhancement further enables us to serve our customers, particularly those that are in high-tech manufacturing and healthcare, as they are shifting their supply chains in response to changing international trade flows. Now, let's turn to innovation-driven. As we've discussed, Network of the Future includes physical and digital changes that will deliver benefits in the short-term and the long-term. Smart Package, Smart Facility, our RFID solution, is a great digital example. We are moving from a scanning network to a sensing network. Following last year's Phase 1 deployment to our preload operations, this year, we are installing RFID readers in over 40,000 U.S. package cards, with a balance to be completed in 2025. Package card readers will enable us to further reduce our misloads, which will improve efficiency and the customer experience. The physical aspect of Network of the Future has launched, and in the quarter, we continue to close sorts and flow more volume into automated facilities. Most of the Phase 1 major projects we outlined during our Investor Day have begun and are in the contracting and execution phases. Innovation-driven is also about achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We recently published our 22nd Sustainability Report, and we are well on our way to achieving our goals. In 2023, our Scope 1, 2, and 3 CO2 emissions declined 8.1% compared to 2022. We operate more than 18,000 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles in our rolling laboratory. And the use of alternative fuels in our ground operations reached 28.8% last year, keeping us on track to achieve our target of 40% by 2025. Moving to our outlook, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2024 consolidated financial goals. In 2024, we expect to generate consolidated revenue ranging from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion and a consolidated operating margin ranging from approximately 10% to 10.6%. Versus last year, we still expect first half earnings to decline and second half earnings to grow as we lap the first year of the Teamster’s contract, and we still expect to exit the year with a U.S. operating margin of 10%. As we move forward, we are staying on strategy and under our Better and Bolder approach, we are pursuing our declarations to become the premium small package provider and logistics partner in the world. With that, thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol. Good morning. In my comments, I'll cover four areas. First, I'll review our first quarter results followed by our 2024 financial outlook. Then I'll provide some comments on our business with the USPS. And lastly, I'll close with a recap of our 2026 targets. While the macro environment in the first quarter showed improvement in some areas, continued soft demand pressured all three parts of our business. Through the quarter, we adjusted our integrated network to match volume levels and drove out expense while maintaining industry-leading service levels. Moving to our financial results, our overall quarterly performance was in line with our expectations. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue was $21.7 billion, down 5.3% compared to the first quarter of 2023. All three of our segments demonstrated cost agility and on a combined basis, drove DAP expense by $414 million in the first quarter. This enabled us to deliver $1.7 billion in consolidated operating profit and consolidated operating margin was 8%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.43, down 35% from the first quarter of 2023. Now let's look at our business segments. In U.S. Domestic, we remained focused on controlling what we could control to improve volume growth and drive productivity. In the first quarter, average daily volume was down 3.2% year-over-year. When looking at ADV sequentially, the growth rate showed strong improvement compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2023. B2B average daily volume was down 5.5% compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily driven by declines in the retail and manufacturing sectors. And B2B represented 41.6% of our volume. Looking at product mix and in line with recent trends, we continue to see a shift from air to ground as customers prioritize cost savings over transit times by taking advantage of our ground services. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, total air average daily volume was down 8.3%. Ground declined 2.3% and within ground, sure post volume grew 10.8%. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.2 billion, down 5%. Revenue per piece was relatively flat year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, base rates increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 240 basis points. This was offset by a couple of factors. First, changes in customer and product mix due to growth in sure post combined with changes in package characteristics decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 180 basis points. And second, changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 90 basis points. Turning to cost, total expense was down 0.8% or $104 million in the first quarter. Union wage rates increased 13% driven by the contractual increase that went into effect last August. Leveraging technology and the agility of our integrated network, we took several actions which more than offset the increase in compensation. We leveraged total service plan and network planning tools to reduce total operational hours by 6.6%, which was more than the decline in average daily volume. We closed 18 sorts and reduced operational resources by 4.8% compared to last year. We lowered block hours by 15.2% versus last year. We reduced management and support staff by approximately 5,400 positions year-over-year. In addition, we reduced purchase transportation by 17%, primarily from our continued optimization efforts. And lastly, lower fuel costs contributed to the decrease in total expense. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $839 million in operating profit, down 43.6% compared to the first quarter of 2023, and operating margin was 5.9%. Moving to our international segment, the macro environment remained challenged, primarily in Europe and Asia. However, volume growth in the Americas region showed early signs of nearshoring. In the first quarter, international total average daily volume was down 5.8% year-over-year. About two-thirds of the decline came from lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 8.1%, and driven primarily by declines in Canada and major markets in Europe. On the export side, average daily volume declined 3.6% year-over-year primarily due to weak manufacturing activity in Europe. In Asia, export average daily volume was down 4.8%, which was an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2023. Within Asia, export volume on the China to U.S. lane increased 12.8% and showed steady growth for the second consecutive quarter. More than offsetting the overall decline in Asia, nearshoring became evident as export average daily volume in the Americas region increased 3.8%. This was led by SMB customers in Canada and Mexico, leveraging our cross-border ground service. In the first quarter, international revenue was $4.3 billion, down 6.3% from last year, primarily due to the decline in volume. Revenue per piece increased 2% and included a number of moving parts. Strong base pricing drove a 360 basis point increase in the revenue per piece growth rate, a decline in fuel surcharge revenue, combined with a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted the revenue per piece growth rate by 80 basis points. And finally, lower demand-related surcharge revenue decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 80 basis points. In the first quarter, total international expense was down $163 million, a decline of 4.4%. Similar to previous quarters, we leveraged the agility of our integrated network to reduce block hours by 6.6%. Operating profit in the international segment was $682 million, down $124 million year-over-year. Operating margin in the first quarter was 16%. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions, in the first quarter, revenue was $3.2 billion, down 5.3% year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers within forwarding, market rates in international airfreight continue to drive down top-line revenue. On the ocean side, excess market capacity continued to pressure market rates and drove a decrease in revenue despite volume growth. And our truckload brokerage unit continued to face soft demand and market rate pressures. Logistics delivered revenue growth and increased operating profit driven by gains in health care. In the first quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $226 million, down $32 million year-over-year and an operating margin of 7%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $195 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $67 million, our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26.8%. Now let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we generated $3.3 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $2.3 billion. We finished the quarter with strong liquidity and no outstanding commercial paper. Also in the first quarter, UPS rewarded shareowners with $1.3 billion in dividends. Turning to our outlook. As Carol mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2024 consolidated financial targets. For the full year 2024, on a consolidated basis, revenues are expected to range between $92 billion and $94.5 billion, and we expect to generate a consolidated operating margin ranging from approximately 10% to 10.6%. Looking at the shape of the year. In the first half of the year, we expect consolidated operating profit to be down between 20% and 30%. And in the back half of the year, we expect volume and revenue growth to accelerate as we lap the diversion we experienced as a result of our labor negotiations. Additionally, our labor cost growth rate will drop substantially. We will also see the majority of the $1 billion in savings from Fit to serve. We still expect revenue per piece to outperform cost per piece. And lastly, in U.S. domestic, we expect to exit the year at a 10% operating margin. Looking at cash flow and capital spending. For the full year in 2024, we still expect capital expenditures to be within our target of around 5% of revenue or $4.5 billion. We're reviewing certain aspects of our pension strategy, and so we expect free cash flow to be within a range of approximately $5.9 billion to $6.7 billion before reflecting any pension contributions. Now let me share more detail about servicing Air Cargo for the USPS. This is good business for us, and we are moving quickly to begin onboarding this cargo. We will leverage our integrated network and existing assets, and we expect the majority of the volume will fit within our current U.S. domestic daytime flight operations. Our operators and engineers are already planning the network to support the complete transition to UPS in the third quarter. In terms of financial reporting, the revenue and expense associated with USPS Air Cargo will show up in the SCS other line in our financial reporting. Adding the USPS air cargo volume to our existing network will result in a higher share of the network cost being allocated to SCS, indirectly benefiting our U.S. domestic segment. We expect to see a benefit to operating margins this year at both the consolidated level and within the U.S. Domestic segment. To wrap up, we are also reaffirming our three-year consolidated revenue and operating margin targets we put forth at our March Investor and Analyst Day. Specifically, we aim to grow revenue to be between $108 million and $114 billion by 2026. The high end of the range includes inorganic opportunities, primarily in health care and international. Additionally, we expect to expand our consolidated operating margin to more than 13% by 2026, which includes expanding our domestic operating margin to at least 12%. And I'll note that the USPS volume is consistent with our better and bolder approach to grow in the parts of the market that leverage our integrated network, and it gives us a strong start to our 2026 targets. With that, thank you, and operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nEric Morgan : Hey, good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the guidance in the first half. I know you mentioned 1Q kind of coming in line with your expectations, but you did call out the 40% decline expectation at the Investor Day. So just wondering if anything happened late in the quarter that drove EBIT above your expectations in the first quarter? And then, are there anything negative going on in 2Q that led you to maintain the first half guidance rather than raise it similar to the 1Q beat. Thank you.\nBrian Newman : Morgan, good morning. It's Brian. Happy to take this one. Look, our guidance for the first half of the year remains the same, declining in profit down 20% to 30%. So that's consistent. I did call out at the tail end of the quarter, expected minus 40%. I said consistently that Q1 would be the tougher quarter in the first half of the year. There were two elements that contributed to beating that 40%. One, on the top-line, we did see positive volume momentum going into the end of the quarter in fact, the last couple of weeks were basically breakeven from a volume perspective. I think the last week was about zero percent thereabout. So sequentially, we were seeing improved volume. But the bigger component was just some cost trading between April and March, things like occupancy and maintenance cost shift in terms of when they hit the P&L between March and April. So no change from a guide perspective still down 20% to 30%, some cost timing at the end of the quarter there, but the positive was the trajectory of volume momentum. Thanks, Morgan.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra : Thanks. Carol, Brian, can you just provide a bit more details on the contribution margins associated with the USPS contract. This was a zero margin business that your direct competitor and somewhat surprisingly is now moving from your direct competitor to you it kind of harkens back to kind of pre-2020 when UPS was less price disciplined. And so can you just wage concerns that this wasn't one on price and just talk a little bit in more detail. I know you're obviously raising some block hours to fund -- to service this volume. But what other costs do you kind of expect to bring on to service this $1 billion, $1.5 billion of incremental revenue. Thanks.\nCarol Tome : Well, thanks very much for your question, Amit. And we're delighted to have won the air cargo business from USPS our team put together an innovative solution using our integrated network. And as in contrast to traditional hub-and-spoke models, we don't have to run all of the air volume through our main air hub at Westport. Of course, we will use Worldport, but we will also use our regional gateways. That allows for splits to occur outside of the network, so they'll be built in origin and then we will bypass the main hub and go point to point. This is an integrated solution that's very different than I think the former provider offered. We also will use all of the assets of our integrated network, and that will allow us to actually optimize block hours. Now in terms of the investments that we need to make to services volume, we have plenty of space on our existing aircraft. So we won't be purchasing any aircraft. We will be hiring some pilots but less than 200 pilots, and we factored all of that into the cost model that we built. So this will be margin accretive. It will be EPS great at beginning in year one and through the life of the contract.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz : Hi, good morning. I wanted to see Brian or Carol, if you could walk through what are the key pieces of the 2Q versus 1Q ramp in EBIT. And then I guess the same thing for second half. Obviously, you've got Fit to Serve as a significant cost benefit versus 1Q. But I think just trying to figure out how much of the improvement sequentially is based on volume that you have visibility to and how much would be based on anticipation of improvement in the broader parcel market kind of macro improvement. Thank you.\nBrian Newman : Hey, Tom, happy to take that. So listen, from a Q1 to Q2 perspective, the shape, if we look at the U.S. we would expect marginal growth from a volume perspective, which relative to past trends, normally, Q1 steps down to Q2 from an absolute volume level. So by maintaining that will be a natural accretion from an EBIT perspective. The big component, though, full year on a run rate basis, the Fit to Serve program will generate $1.3 billion in savings and we're ramping that up in Q2. So that will be a big driver as well as we think about it. And then from a Q1 to the back half of the year, it's the same three components, Fit to Serve. It's the volume lift along with the drivers of RPP and then it's the labor contract lapping, which is the big piece in the back end of the year.\nCarol Tome : And maybe just a few more comments on RPP since our RPP in the U.S. was flat in the first quarter. We expect RPP growth as we head towards the back half of the year. Why? Well, first of all, fuel prices were a drag on the RPP in the first quarter. The projection for fuel is that is going to increase. We are also announcing a fuel surcharge later today. So those two components of fuel will be a bonus to RPP as we head towards the back half. We also are going to have a pretty picky peak, we anticipate for fewer operating days this year than last, which means the demand surcharge should be pretty strong this year compared to last year. And then we brought in a lot of SurePost product into our network. We're meeting our customers where they want to go we'll be anniversarying a lot of that in the back half of the year as well. So we don’t expect we love by the way, but we don’t expect to see the drag on the RPP I’m sure costs in the back half, like we said, in the first quarter. Any other color you’d like to provide?\nBrian Newman : I think all those that you stated, Carol, and then the volume growth, obviously, with the comps, it’s going to be a big help to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger : Hi, good morning. Sort of curious, you mentioned some actions taken in the first quarter, like closing sorts and working on peak purchase transport, et cetera, amongst other things. Can you maybe talk to some additional actions that are helping to drive the profit uplift from here, not related to the volumes and maybe the head count reduction? Thanks.\nCarol Tome : Well, productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS domestically and outside of the U.S. And I just can’t say enough good things about how our team is running our business. Ours are running under the volume declines, higher productivity and cull utilization packages per hour. We measure productivity in minutes, miles and practice per hour and all across the board, we’re seeing record levels. One different callouts that we’ve been talking about this for a while is safety. Our safety stats, if you will, are the best they’ve been in five years. And of course, if you haven’t run a safer business, where you don’t have as many claims for is comp and auto liability. So a real shout out to our operators. And I certainly might say, why is the productivity getting better? One reason is because our turnover is down. And as people stay in place, we were just more productive. And let me throw it over Nando. Is there anything you’d like to add on the productivity side?\nNando Cesarone : No, I’m actually quite impressed with our engineers and our operators, I think, the best in the business. And we’re continuing to follow our game plan that we reviewed with you at the investor conference, which is keenly focused on closing down stores, moving volume to our automation and our automated facilities. And in fact, when I talked about pieces per headcount at our conference, we’re actually up 2.7% in March. So we are pushing all of the things that help us be more productive and less reliant on labor.\nCarol Tome : And Kate, outside the United States in your word talk about product.\nKate Gutmann : Yeah, absolutely. It is a consistent value at UPS and something that all of us work very hard towards every day. So when you look at the major regions around the world, we’re setting records on our cube utilization both on the ground and in the air. As our margins show, we have a very good handle on expense management and as we’re unlocking more of this segment growth, health care specifically, SMB around the world, it only fuels that further.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning. Just international margins were a bit lower than we expected. Just maybe thoughts on increased costs. It sounded like you threw out some impacts of near-sourcing. And then, I guess, Brian, just a clarification. You said you’re moving the U.S. Postal Services will be listed in SCS and benefiting domestic. I just want to understand, are you shifting costs then out of domestic into SCS? Or maybe just clarify that comment there.\nCarol Tome : Well, first on the international margin, I think Keith did a terrific job of managing costs in an environment where demand was down. There was a onetime item that we didn’t call out in our prepared remarks. But if you back out that onetime item, the international margin would 17%. The first quarter is usually our lowest margin quarter. So we anticipate that the international business and our planning for the international business to be in the high teens as we told to.\nBrian Newman : And then on the tonnage in terms of USPS comes in through SCS other. But because we’re using a lot of the U.S. assets, we allocate cost to that business, and that will have a positive benefit on the domestic margin.\nKen Hoexter : And can you clarify what the one item was there?\nCarol Tome : It was a cleanup really in our revenue data mark, we just had some accounts we wrote off.\nKen Hoexter : Thanks a lot for the time. Appreciate it.\nCarol Tome : Yes.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon : Hey, good morning. I got a couple of quick commercial questions for you. Can you talk about how the volume outlook outside issuer post is shaping up? I think you mentioned in a couple of pockets, the second derivative is getting better. But if you could talk about whether you feel better or worse about where volumes are going to end up in the year today versus when you started the year? That would be helpful. And then the second question would be on SurePost, 10% demand for anything in small package is a very high number. When are you going to have a chance to maybe address pricing in that product? Because it does sound like you have what looks like a relative advantage in terms of marketing against the lower end of the e-commerce small package market?\nCarol Tome : So from a volume mix perspective, if I look at the volume that’s in our pipeline, I would say the volume that’s in our pipeline is not sure cost. We’ve got commercial volume in our pipeline, additional enterprise volume in our pipeline. So we’re going to be our customers where they want to go. But the mix is looking very different as we look ahead than it was in the first quarter. And in terms of pricing, I don’t think we’re going to talk pricing on this for this call but we always look for opportunities to optimize our pricing.\nBrian Newman : And the headwind we saw from a mix perspective, Carol alluded to this in the back end of the year, we are anniversarying a fair amount of share post from last peak. And so the overlaps won’t drive as big of a headwind.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Scott -- we have a question from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Brian, the second quarter guide, I guess, implies EBIT down anywhere from 10% to 30%. So any more directional color there? And then on this revenue cost allocation thing with the post office? Is there any way to just quantify what the benefit is to the U.S. margin as you're doing this? And is that already sort of captured in the 10% margin comment for Q4? Or does this now take it up versus what you previously thought?\nCarol Tome : Well, maybe I'll talk about the full year guidance and then you can talk specifically about the second quarter. One of the questions may be, well, why aren't you changing your guidance now that you won this air cargo business and you say it's going to be margin accretive. We were highly confident of the range of guidance that we provided at the end of the year, and we're even more confident now but it's just too early in the year to change the guidance. So once we get through the second quarter, we'll tell you what we think the back half of the year will be. On Q2 alone, why don't you talk about?\nBrian Newman : Sure. Scott, we're maintaining the first half at negative 20% to 30% from a profit perspective. So can choose the element of the range you want to point towards. I think ADV in domestic, we're expecting Q2 to be slightly positive. RPP should be consistent with what we saw flattish in the first quarter as we move out of the headwinds from a mix perspective. And as Carol said, fuel and the PSS in the back end of the year will help us. Cost per piece will get better in Q2 -- I'm sorry, in Q3 when we anniversary the cost of the labor contract, but somewhat similar from a Q2 perspective in the U.S. And then from an ADV perspective, internationally, Kate is looking to see that business improve as we sequentially move over the course of the year. So I guess I would steer you towards the 20% to 30%. We've been very consistent on that from a profit standpoint for the first half and you can squeeze it.\nScott Group : And then any thoughts on that the postal shift and the margin benefit for Q4?\nCarol Tome : So this is what I'd like to do is out, let's get through the second quarter, and then we'll come back and give you more color. I like to get some of it into the network. We've modeled it out. I want to actually see how it performs. So we'll give you more color at the end of the second quarter.\nScott Group : Okay.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker : Thanks, good morning, everyone. Carol, in your opening comments, you mentioned that returns were a good business because they were B2B. I'm a little surprised to hear that because I mean, it almost seems like a C2B type business with pretty high fragmentation in the last mile. So if you can just unpack kind of how that works through the supply chain and kind of the profit contribution of that, that would be great. Thank you.\nCarol Tome : So we like to return business a lot. You're right, the consumer typically walks into a UPS store to start the return and we consolidate the returns at the UBS store, and they returned to the shipper. And that would be a B2B return. So if you think about -- I'll use our largest customer for an example, we have returns through our UPS stores with our largest customer. We take in thousands of returns for that customer and package it into one consolidated return that goes back to them. So that's a good business for us. And with Happy Returns, now we were able to offer the same service, which is no box in the label. Same idea, consumer walks in, they make the return, we consolidate it and return it back that's how we think about it being a B2B business, and the margins are very attractive to us. It's density. That's one reason why the margins are so good because you get that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. Maybe one for Carol, one for Brian. Carol, can you just talk about -- I know you don't talk about too much about pricing, but you're increasing the fuel surcharge about another 50 basis points. I think that's on top of 125 in December. So just wanted to see your thoughts on how the market could absorb that with some excess capacity. And do you still feel as sort of a lever in terms of all-in pricing? Then for Brian, maybe you can elaborate on the pension contribution strategy. You talked about -- it sounded like maybe the cash contribution was on hold until some other options were considered. So any more thoughts on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nCarol Tome : So on the fuel surcharge as we look to the rest of the year, fuel prices are increasing. And this is not atypical for us to adjust our surcharge on the base of rising fuel costs. You also should know that, that doesn't impact all of our customers. Clearly, some are exempted from this. So in terms of the ability to stick, we think the will stick. And just a comment on the capacity at our Investor and Earnings Day, we said there was about $12 million ADV excess capacity in the market, and that equilibrium is about 6%, you need about 6%. So really, the excess capacity is around 6 million today, and we think that will be fully absorbed by 2025. Now you may say why. Well, we're part of that excess. And so we're closing stores. We're taking capacity out of the market, and our Network of the Future initiative is capacity neutral. Also with our large competitors' consolidation efforts capacity will be leaving the market. And then another player headquartered in Seattle on the regional, I think the capacity will be taken out of the market. So we think all that capacity will be absorbed in the pricing environment is actually very rational.\nBrian Ossenbeck : And Brian, just on your secondary question around the pension. I had quoted cash -- free cash flow ex pension of $59 million to $67 million. We do have annual service cost in the $1.4 billion range. So from a modeling perspective, you can use that as a placeholder. But the reality is taking a look at strategic options on pension, a little too a bit of early days to comment on that, but we'll come back later in the year and share our thinking on some of the actions and activities we're pursuing.\nCarol Tome : Yeah. Our pensions are very well funded. They're over 90% funded. And it gives us an opportunity to step back on. You just look at our asset liability strategy, our funding strategy. So we thought we should just pause right now, take a look at it and then when we -- if we make any decisions, we'll share that with you.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you.\nOperator: Our question will come from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham : Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just curious on your expectations for -- I mean, sorry, you talked a little bit about volume inflecting soon. And can you just talk about your expectations in terms of volumes as you move from first half to second half? I think previously, you were talking about flat to up 2% in the U.S. domestic market, then you came in a little bit ahead. Just trying to understand how the back half are to look outside of just comps being pretty easy. Thank you.\nBrian Newman : So from an ADV perspective in domestic, I think that's where you're headed with a little bit of a slight tick up in positive volume in the second quarter will likely finish low single-digit decline in the first half, second half we'd expect that to be low single-digit increase. And you can look at it through various different lenses. We're building momentum ever since August, each month is basically getting sequentially better each quarter from Q3, Q4, Q1 improves. We'd expect to see slight positive volume trends in the second quarter. And then just from a comp standpoint, I mean if I go back from a trend perspective, over the last 10 years, our Q3 is generally about close to 300,000 ADV better than Q1. And even if we assume flat from a Q3 to Q1, that would be 4.5% growth. So any way you cut it, we see the back end of the year and most important, it's the visibility on the sales pipeline that we're pulling through and the volume levels we're seeing going into Q2.\nConor Cunningham : Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Chappell of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you, good morning. Brian, you'd mentioned the $1 billion of productivity that you expected to see in the full year '24 guide. Can you just tell us where that stands after the first quarter and how we think about the cadence throughout the rest of the year? Is it front half loaded? Or is it kind of extrapolated evenly by quarter?\nBrian Newman : Yeah. The initiative is progressing slightly ahead of plan. Reductions began in March and will continue through I2. We’d expect more than 80% of the resource reductions to be complete by I2. We’re on track to that $1 billion that I mentioned. And at a full annual run rate going into next year, we’d expect $1.3 billion. So there’ll be some benefit early part of next year.\nJonathan Chappell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Daniel Amaro [ph] of Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead.\nUnknown Analyst: Yeah. Thanks, good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Wanted to follow up on the USPS contract. Carol, the air cargo, I think, should come into your network in the fourth quarter. I think first, any business coming in sooner than that, just to clarify, and then looking at 4Q in the outlook, are there any minimum volume component to the agreement? I mean, obviously, that customer has moved a lot of freight out of the air network as it looks to save costs by using ground. It still looks like ground is cheaper out there. So how do you protect for more of that volume leaving the air cargo market into maybe slower transit time, similar to the rest of your business? Thanks.\nCarol Tome : Well, clearly, we want to get all the volume on boarded before peak. That’s in their interest in our best interest. We will onboard the volume as we can. Our teams are in Washington, D.C. working with the postal service hand-in-hand as we build our operating plan.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors : Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. As you work on cash flow with the pension strategy stuff you've talked about that we might hear more about late this year. Can you talk a little bit about the dividend? If you look at your payout guidance, it implies roughly $13 in earnings at the dividend level that you're paying now. Is there an opportunity to start to raise it more meaningfully before the earnings power of the business gets there? Or do you think we need to wait and get more increases like we saw this year until the business is supporting that more literally? Thank you.\nCarol Tome : We have a disciplined approach when it comes to capital allocation. The first use of our cash, as you know, is to invest back into our business and the second is to pay our dividend. We have a targeted dividend payout ratio of 50%. We are higher than that. It's our intent to earn back into a 50% payout ratio over time. We have no intent to cut the dividend to make that math work. We're going to earn back into it and the dividend is an important part of the value proposition. So we just raised the dividend and we look to, of course, subject to board approval, we look to raise the dividend every year. Any color you'd like to add here?\nBrian Newman : Just, Carol, this year marks the 15th consecutive year we've increased the dividend, and we're committed to a stable and growing dividend. So we will earn back into that, but certainly committed to it.\nCarol Tome : And I feel to respond to Daniel's question about minimum levels within the USPS contract. I'd like to throw that over to Matt. Matt, did you answer your question?\nMatt Guffey : Yeah, absolutely. So thank you, Carol. First of, yes, we do set minimums in the contract. As we built this, we identified a win-win for both the USPS and for us it's just imperative that, one, we not only have it on the protection for our side and our business on what we're bringing on but also for the USPS because we want to make sure, as Carol mentioned, that we're onboarded before peak season, and we're bringing this on as quickly as possible, and we're working collectively with them. Nando and the team have done a great job with their operational team. And to Carol's point, we're meeting with them every week in DC to continue to onboard that volume to make sure it's a smooth transition.\nCarol Tome : Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch back on the volume commentary. If you can maybe discuss in your eyes, what drove the improvement as the quarter progressed and your expectations into 2Q. How much of this was from kind of actions within your own control? And then at the same time, maybe areas where the underlying environment is improving some over kind of what we've experienced over the last year. And in that case, where you've seen that improvement in the macro. Thank you.\nCarol Tome: Well, I give a shout out to our sales team. The improving volume trends are in large part due to their hard work and efforts. You may recall at the beginning of the year, we said the growth in the market wasn't going to be very growthy this year. So the fact said, we're able to see sequential improvement in the magnitude that we're seeing is really because of our sales team. We are winning new. We are gaining additional penetration of existing customers. We are meeting customers where they want us to be. And our sales team will continue to do that around the world. And that's one reason that we're confident in the volume projection that Brian did share.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan : Hey, thanks. And good morning everyone. Carol, just back to your DAP comment from the beginning of the call. I know that's big part of your S&D growth efforts. You said you grew 3% in the first quarter. And I can't help but notice that that's materially [indiscernible] you said the plan was over $3 billion and then at the Investor Day, you said materially over $3 billion. So I just want to know if there's something happening that's driving a slower growth outlook for DAP.\nCarol Tome : Yeah. Thanks for the question. And I think I got it, you broke up a bit, but it’s generally about DAP. So last year, in the first quarter, our DAP revenue grew 51% and our volume grew 61%. So we didn’t expect to repeat that kind of growth in the first quarter of this year. And so we were very pleased with how the DAP portfolio performed in the first quarter because it was in line with our expectations. We had anticipated a slower growth in the first quarter because there were a couple of our partners that we were working on amending the teens and fees. So we expected the growth rate to be slower and then to pick up as we move into the second quarter and the rest of the year. The projections for the DAP around the world, and we’re seeing great growth outside the United States, by the way. The projections for the DAP portfolio by the end of the year is in excess of $3 billion.\nBruce Chan : Okay, that’s very helpful. Thank you.\nCarol Tome : Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good morning. Carol, could you give us an update on your SMB progress. Curious how you're trending towards the long-term target domestically? And then also, how does international compare? You've spoken in the past about making nice progress there. Just curious, how does that compare to domestic right now? And what type of aspiration can you achieve longer term? Thanks.\nCarol Tome : Yeah. So we're right now at about 29% as of the end of the first quarter. And as we look towards the end of this year, we should be over 30 in the low 30s. So we're trending nicely. And Kate outside the United States how's SMB performance?\nKate Gutmann : Yeah. Our history outside the U.S. is in SMB. So we have a 62% share of SMB, and this is now where we're implementing debt. So we're only going further. As Carol said, our DAP program and small package around the world is resonating with our SME shippers as they look for ease and access. So that's excellent. And then I'll just also say in our freight business, we have a DAP like service, which is our forwarding hub, and it's actually well ahead of plan as well. So SMBs are showing that they really need access through the digital platforms, and it's resonating very well.\nPJ Guido : Hey, Stephen, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question will be a follow-up from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Vernon : Thanks for coming back to me. I just wanted to ask about -- you mentioned the pricing environment being kind of rational. Could you elaborate on how effective the GRI has been this year? What's the stick rate there? And as you think about the underlying performance in domestic yields ex some of the mix headwinds, could you talk a little bit about the trajectory or the rate of change through the quarter?\nBrian Newman : Yeah, Dave, we had expected about a 50% keep rate. We saw a 240 -- roughly 250 basis points in the first quarter. So generally, in line with expectations. We'd expect that base rate to continue over the course of the year. I think Carol hit on a couple of the key points around the other elements of pricing. There's a fuel piece. There's PSS in the back -- in the peak season and then there's the mix component that we've been talking about the focus on commercial on SMB and health care. So all those things combined give us confidence that we'll deliver a low single digit from an RPP second half of the year.\nDavid Vernon : Okay. Thank you.\nCarol Tome : Thank you.\nOperator: I will now turn the floor back over to our host, Mr. P.J. Guido. Please go ahead, sir.\nPJ Guido: Thank you, Steven. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining, and have a good day.",

            "name": "Carol Tome",
            "content": "Thank you, PJ, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for doing what they do better than anyone, and that's deliver industry-leading service. Through the first quarter, UPSers continued to execute our strategy by focusing on growth and efficiency and exemplified our purpose of moving our world forward by delivering what matters. Moving to our results, the first quarter turned out as we expected, starting with a decline in average daily volume. U.S. average daily volume, or ADV, declined year-over-year, but the rate of decline slowed as the quarter progressed, ending with March down less than 1%. And on a sequential basis, the ADV decline rate in the first quarter showed marked improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This improving performance is primarily due to the efforts of our sales team to win and pull through new volume into our network. Outside of the U.S., the ADV decline rate also improved sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and we saw pockets of export growth in certain markets and lanes. For the first quarter, consolidated revenue was $21.7 billion, a decline of 5.3% versus last year. Operating profit was $1.7 billion, down 31.5% compared to last year, due for the most part to higher labor costs associated with the first year of our Teamster's contract. Consolidated operating margin was 8%. Our operating profit performance was a bit better than we expected due to higher productivity. At our Investor and Analyst Day last month, we shared our three-year targets and how we intend to reach them under our Better and Bolder approach. We are reimagining our network through Network of the Future, and we are leaning into the parts of the market that value our end-to-end integrated network. For example, we recently announced that UPS will become the primary air cargo provider for the United States Postal Service. Under this contract, we will move most of the USPS' air cargo within the United States. The USPS air cargo business fits beautifully with our strategy to grow our B2B business. To win, we put together an innovative and differentiated solution that leverages our integrated network and existing assets. The USPS air cargo business will contribute to top-line growth and be accretive to consolidated and U.S. domestic operating margins. Brian will share more details, including what to expect during the transition period and where this will show up in our financial reporting. Moving to our strategic update, through our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy, we are investing to grow in the premium parts of the market and drive efficiency. Let me give you a few recent examples. Starting with customer-first. Through our on-demand network, we are expanding our addressable market with capabilities like no-box, no-label returns, through Happy Returns, and the convenience of our more than 5,200 UPS store locations. During the first quarter, our overall returns volume in the U.S. increased 1.4%, and Happy Returns more than quadrupled its ADV in the first quarter. Returns are attractive to us for a couple of reasons. First, they are typically B2B movements, and as a result, drive pickup and delivery density. Second, our frictionless offering creates customer loyalty and repeat business. We are also expanding our addressable market with capabilities like big and bulky deliveries through Roadie. In the first quarter, we launched RoadieXD, which adds cross-dock capabilities to RoadieXL. Our cross-dock solution brings the digital and physical together for long-zone deliveries of bulky items, such as grills and furniture, that do not fit in the UPS small package network. This is enabling us to unlock additional revenue opportunities in the highly fragmented $60 billion big and bulky market in the U.S. It's still early days, but this is a large opportunity for us to grow quality revenue and profit and serve the needs of our customers. As we laid out at our Investor Day, our long-term target is to grow our U.S. S&D volume penetration to 40%. DAP, our digital access program, is one of the tools we will use to reach this target. Recently, we enhanced our DAP pricing capabilities by launching a solution we call Fast Lane. With Fast Lane, we can optimize rates and target attractive volume growth, whether it be by partner, by product, or by customer segment, all of which can drive revenue per piece growth. We can even target volume growth by geography to drive density. Prior to Fast Lane, rate and other adjustments in DAP could take months. Now we can make them in a matter of days or even hours. In terms of results, in the first quarter, DAP revenue grew by 3% year-over-year. And in 2024, we expect to generate over $3 billion in global DAP revenue. Speaking of S&D, over the last year, we've gained traction on improving the customer experience across 16 journeys. Take pickups. We redesigned our process and deployed new driver dispatch technology. This resulted in a 74% reduction in pickup concerns and a Net Promoter Score, or NPS, of 48 for this journey, which is an all-time high for UPS. And for our international customers, our next-gen brokerage solution is making it easier for S&Ds to navigate the ins and outs of exporting, as evidenced by a 40% decline in custom brokerage holds since April of 2023. Turning to healthcare, we aim to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. Healthcare companies are innovating, and so are we. Our latest example is the opening of LabPort at Worldport, our global air hub in Louisville, Kentucky. LabPort is unique. It's an end-of-the-runway, state-of-the-art facility built specifically for lab customers. By being at Worldport, we can deliver urgent air packages to our lab customers well before the sun comes up, so they can provide diagnostic results by early morning. And in terms of healthcare revenue, in the first quarter, revenue from our healthcare portfolio reached $2.6 billion. Outside the United States, we're continuing to enhance our network to grow our premium international business. Our most recent example is the launch of Next Day flights between Shenzhen, China, and Sydney, Australia. The addition of these flights enables faster import and export movements between 11 Asian markets in Australia. And now, exports from Australia can even reach Europe by the next business day. This enhancement further enables us to serve our customers, particularly those that are in high-tech manufacturing and healthcare, as they are shifting their supply chains in response to changing international trade flows. Now, let's turn to innovation-driven. As we've discussed, Network of the Future includes physical and digital changes that will deliver benefits in the short-term and the long-term. Smart Package, Smart Facility, our RFID solution, is a great digital example. We are moving from a scanning network to a sensing network. Following last year's Phase 1 deployment to our preload operations, this year, we are installing RFID readers in over 40,000 U.S. package cards, with a balance to be completed in 2025. Package card readers will enable us to further reduce our misloads, which will improve efficiency and the customer experience. The physical aspect of Network of the Future has launched, and in the quarter, we continue to close sorts and flow more volume into automated facilities. Most of the Phase 1 major projects we outlined during our Investor Day have begun and are in the contracting and execution phases. Innovation-driven is also about achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We recently published our 22nd Sustainability Report, and we are well on our way to achieving our goals. In 2023, our Scope 1, 2, and 3 CO2 emissions declined 8.1% compared to 2022. We operate more than 18,000 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles in our rolling laboratory. And the use of alternative fuels in our ground operations reached 28.8% last year, keeping us on track to achieve our target of 40% by 2025. Moving to our outlook, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2024 consolidated financial goals. In 2024, we expect to generate consolidated revenue ranging from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion and a consolidated operating margin ranging from approximately 10% to 10.6%. Versus last year, we still expect first half earnings to decline and second half earnings to grow as we lap the first year of the Teamster's contract, and we still expect to exit the year with a U.S. operating margin of 10%. As we move forward, we are staying on strategy and under our Better and Bolder approach, we are pursuing our declarations to become the premium small package provider and logistics partner in the world. With that, thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Well, thanks very much for your question, Amit. And we're delighted to have won the air cargo business from USPS our team put together an innovative solution using our integrated network. And as in contrast to traditional hub-and-spoke models, we don't have to run all of the air volume through our main air hub at Westport. Of course, we will use Worldport, but we will also use our regional gateways. That allows for splits to occur outside of the network, so they'll be built in origin and then we will bypass the main hub and go point to point. This is an integrated solution that's very different than I think the former provider offered. We also will use all of the assets of our integrated network, and that will allow us to actually optimize block hours. Now in terms of the investments that we need to make to services volume, we have plenty of space on our existing aircraft. So we won't be purchasing any aircraft. We will be hiring some pilots but less than 200 pilots, and we factored all of that into the cost model that we built. So this will be margin accretive. It will be EPS great at beginning in year one and through the life of the contract. And maybe just a few more comments on RPP since our RPP in the U.S. was flat in the first quarter. We expect RPP growth as we head towards the back half of the year. Why? Well, first of all, fuel prices were a drag on the RPP in the first quarter. The projection for fuel is that is going to increase. We are also announcing a fuel surcharge later today. So those two components of fuel will be a bonus to RPP as we head towards the back half. We also are going to have a pretty picky peak, we anticipate for fewer operating days this year than last, which means the demand surcharge should be pretty strong this year compared to last year. And then we brought in a lot of SurePost product into our network. We're meeting our customers where they want to go we'll be anniversarying a lot of that in the back half of the year as well. So we don't expect we love by the way, but we don't expect to see the drag on the RPP I'm sure costs in the back half, like we said, in the first quarter. Any other color you'd like to provide? Well, productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS domestically and outside of the U.S. And I just can't say enough good things about how our team is running our business. Ours are running under the volume declines, higher productivity and cull utilization packages per hour. We measure productivity in minutes, miles and practice per hour and all across the board, we're seeing record levels. One different callouts that we've been talking about this for a while is safety. Our safety stats, if you will, are the best they've been in five years. And of course, if you haven't run a safer business, where you don't have as many claims for is comp and auto liability. So a real shout out to our operators. And I certainly might say, why is the productivity getting better? One reason is because our turnover is down. And as people stay in place, we were just more productive. And let me throw it over Nando. Is there anything you'd like to add on the productivity side? And Kate, outside the United States in your word talk about product. Well, first on the international margin, I think Keith did a terrific job of managing costs in an environment where demand was down. There was a onetime item that we didn't call out in our prepared remarks. But if you back out that onetime item, the international margin would 17%. The first quarter is usually our lowest margin quarter. So we anticipate that the international business and our planning for the international business to be in the high teens as we told to. It was a cleanup really in our revenue data mark, we just had some accounts we wrote off. Yes. So from a volume mix perspective, if I look at the volume that's in our pipeline, I would say the volume that's in our pipeline is not sure cost. We've got commercial volume in our pipeline, additional enterprise volume in our pipeline. So we're going to be our customers where they want to go. But the mix is looking very different as we look ahead than it was in the first quarter. And in terms of pricing, I don't think we're going to talk pricing on this for this call but we always look for opportunities to optimize our pricing. Well, maybe I'll talk about the full year guidance and then you can talk specifically about the second quarter. One of the questions may be, well, why aren't you changing your guidance now that you won this air cargo business and you say it's going to be margin accretive. We were highly confident of the range of guidance that we provided at the end of the year, and we're even more confident now but it's just too early in the year to change the guidance. So once we get through the second quarter, we'll tell you what we think the back half of the year will be. On Q2 alone, why don't you talk about? So this is what I'd like to do is out, let's get through the second quarter, and then we'll come back and give you more color. I like to get some of it into the network. We've modeled it out. I want to actually see how it performs. So we'll give you more color at the end of the second quarter. So we like to return business a lot. You're right, the consumer typically walks into a UPS store to start the return and we consolidate the returns at the UBS store, and they returned to the shipper. And that would be a B2B return. So if you think about -- I'll use our largest customer for an example, we have returns through our UPS stores with our largest customer. We take in thousands of returns for that customer and package it into one consolidated return that goes back to them. So that's a good business for us. And with Happy Returns, now we were able to offer the same service, which is no box in the label. Same idea, consumer walks in, they make the return, we consolidate it and return it back that's how we think about it being a B2B business, and the margins are very attractive to us. It's density. That's one reason why the margins are so good because you get that. So on the fuel surcharge as we look to the rest of the year, fuel prices are increasing. And this is not atypical for us to adjust our surcharge on the base of rising fuel costs. You also should know that, that doesn't impact all of our customers. Clearly, some are exempted from this. So in terms of the ability to stick, we think the will stick. And just a comment on the capacity at our Investor and Earnings Day, we said there was about $12 million ADV excess capacity in the market, and that equilibrium is about 6%, you need about 6%. So really, the excess capacity is around 6 million today, and we think that will be fully absorbed by 2025. Now you may say why. Well, we're part of that excess. And so we're closing stores. We're taking capacity out of the market, and our Network of the Future initiative is capacity neutral. Also with our large competitors' consolidation efforts capacity will be leaving the market. And then another player headquartered in Seattle on the regional, I think the capacity will be taken out of the market. So we think all that capacity will be absorbed in the pricing environment is actually very rational. Yeah. Our pensions are very well funded. They're over 90% funded. And it gives us an opportunity to step back on. You just look at our asset liability strategy, our funding strategy. So we thought we should just pause right now, take a look at it and then when we -- if we make any decisions, we'll share that with you. Well, clearly, we want to get all the volume on boarded before peak. That's in their interest in our best interest. We will onboard the volume as we can. Our teams are in Washington, D.C. working with the postal service hand-in-hand as we build our operating plan. We have a disciplined approach when it comes to capital allocation. The first use of our cash, as you know, is to invest back into our business and the second is to pay our dividend. We have a targeted dividend payout ratio of 50%. We are higher than that. It's our intent to earn back into a 50% payout ratio over time. We have no intent to cut the dividend to make that math work. We're going to earn back into it and the dividend is an important part of the value proposition. So we just raised the dividend and we look to, of course, subject to board approval, we look to raise the dividend every year. Any color you'd like to add here? And I feel to respond to Daniel's question about minimum levels within the USPS contract. I'd like to throw that over to Matt. Matt, did you answer your question? Thanks, Matt. Well, I give a shout out to our sales team. The improving volume trends are in large part due to their hard work and efforts. You may recall at the beginning of the year, we said the growth in the market wasn't going to be very growthy this year. So the fact said, we're able to see sequential improvement in the magnitude that we're seeing is really because of our sales team. We are winning new. We are gaining additional penetration of existing customers. We are meeting customers where they want us to be. And our sales team will continue to do that around the world. And that's one reason that we're confident in the volume projection that Brian did share. Yeah. Thanks for the question. And I think I got it, you broke up a bit, but it's generally about DAP. So last year, in the first quarter, our DAP revenue grew 51% and our volume grew 61%. So we didn't expect to repeat that kind of growth in the first quarter of this year. And so we were very pleased with how the DAP portfolio performed in the first quarter because it was in line with our expectations. We had anticipated a slower growth in the first quarter because there were a couple of our partners that we were working on amending the teens and fees. So we expected the growth rate to be slower and then to pick up as we move into the second quarter and the rest of the year. The projections for the DAP around the world, and we're seeing great growth outside the United States, by the way. The projections for the DAP portfolio by the end of the year is in excess of $3 billion. Yes. Yeah. So we're right now at about 29% as of the end of the first quarter. And as we look towards the end of this year, we should be over 30 in the low 30s. So we're trending nicely. And Kate outside the United States how's SMB performance? Thank you."

            "name": "Brian Newman",
            "content": "Thanks, Carol. Good morning. In my comments, I'll cover four areas. First, I'll review our first quarter results followed by our 2024 financial outlook. Then I'll provide some comments on our business with the USPS. And lastly, I'll close with a recap of our 2026 targets. While the macro environment in the first quarter showed improvement in some areas, continued soft demand pressured all three parts of our business. Through the quarter, we adjusted our integrated network to match volume levels and drove out expense while maintaining industry-leading service levels. Moving to our financial results, our overall quarterly performance was in line with our expectations. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue was $21.7 billion, down 5.3% compared to the first quarter of 2023. All three of our segments demonstrated cost agility and on a combined basis, drove DAP expense by $414 million in the first quarter. This enabled us to deliver $1.7 billion in consolidated operating profit and consolidated operating margin was 8%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.43, down 35% from the first quarter of 2023. Now let's look at our business segments. In U.S. Domestic, we remained focused on controlling what we could control to improve volume growth and drive productivity. In the first quarter, average daily volume was down 3.2% year-over-year. When looking at ADV sequentially, the growth rate showed strong improvement compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2023. B2B average daily volume was down 5.5% compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily driven by declines in the retail and manufacturing sectors. And B2B represented 41.6% of our volume. Looking at product mix and in line with recent trends, we continue to see a shift from air to ground as customers prioritize cost savings over transit times by taking advantage of our ground services. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, total air average daily volume was down 8.3%. Ground declined 2.3% and within ground, sure post volume grew 10.8%. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.2 billion, down 5%. Revenue per piece was relatively flat year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, base rates increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 240 basis points. This was offset by a couple of factors. First, changes in customer and product mix due to growth in sure post combined with changes in package characteristics decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 180 basis points. And second, changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 90 basis points. Turning to cost, total expense was down 0.8% or $104 million in the first quarter. Union wage rates increased 13% driven by the contractual increase that went into effect last August. Leveraging technology and the agility of our integrated network, we took several actions which more than offset the increase in compensation. We leveraged total service plan and network planning tools to reduce total operational hours by 6.6%, which was more than the decline in average daily volume. We closed 18 sorts and reduced operational resources by 4.8% compared to last year. We lowered block hours by 15.2% versus last year. We reduced management and support staff by approximately 5,400 positions year-over-year. In addition, we reduced purchase transportation by 17%, primarily from our continued optimization efforts. And lastly, lower fuel costs contributed to the decrease in total expense. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $839 million in operating profit, down 43.6% compared to the first quarter of 2023, and operating margin was 5.9%. Moving to our international segment, the macro environment remained challenged, primarily in Europe and Asia. However, volume growth in the Americas region showed early signs of nearshoring. In the first quarter, international total average daily volume was down 5.8% year-over-year. About two-thirds of the decline came from lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 8.1%, and driven primarily by declines in Canada and major markets in Europe. On the export side, average daily volume declined 3.6% year-over-year primarily due to weak manufacturing activity in Europe. In Asia, export average daily volume was down 4.8%, which was an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2023. Within Asia, export volume on the China to U.S. lane increased 12.8% and showed steady growth for the second consecutive quarter. More than offsetting the overall decline in Asia, nearshoring became evident as export average daily volume in the Americas region increased 3.8%. This was led by SMB customers in Canada and Mexico, leveraging our cross-border ground service. In the first quarter, international revenue was $4.3 billion, down 6.3% from last year, primarily due to the decline in volume. Revenue per piece increased 2% and included a number of moving parts. Strong base pricing drove a 360 basis point increase in the revenue per piece growth rate, a decline in fuel surcharge revenue, combined with a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted the revenue per piece growth rate by 80 basis points. And finally, lower demand-related surcharge revenue decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 80 basis points. In the first quarter, total international expense was down $163 million, a decline of 4.4%. Similar to previous quarters, we leveraged the agility of our integrated network to reduce block hours by 6.6%. Operating profit in the international segment was $682 million, down $124 million year-over-year. Operating margin in the first quarter was 16%. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions, in the first quarter, revenue was $3.2 billion, down 5.3% year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers within forwarding, market rates in international airfreight continue to drive down top-line revenue. On the ocean side, excess market capacity continued to pressure market rates and drove a decrease in revenue despite volume growth. And our truckload brokerage unit continued to face soft demand and market rate pressures. Logistics delivered revenue growth and increased operating profit driven by gains in health care. In the first quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $226 million, down $32 million year-over-year and an operating margin of 7%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $195 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $67 million, our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26.8%. Now let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we generated $3.3 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $2.3 billion. We finished the quarter with strong liquidity and no outstanding commercial paper. Also in the first quarter, UPS rewarded shareowners with $1.3 billion in dividends. Turning to our outlook. As Carol mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2024 consolidated financial targets. For the full year 2024, on a consolidated basis, revenues are expected to range between $92 billion and $94.5 billion, and we expect to generate a consolidated operating margin ranging from approximately 10% to 10.6%. Looking at the shape of the year. In the first half of the year, we expect consolidated operating profit to be down between 20% and 30%. And in the back half of the year, we expect volume and revenue growth to accelerate as we lap the diversion we experienced as a result of our labor negotiations. Additionally, our labor cost growth rate will drop substantially. We will also see the majority of the $1 billion in savings from Fit to serve. We still expect revenue per piece to outperform cost per piece. And lastly, in U.S. domestic, we expect to exit the year at a 10% operating margin. Looking at cash flow and capital spending. For the full year in 2024, we still expect capital expenditures to be within our target of around 5% of revenue or $4.5 billion. We're reviewing certain aspects of our pension strategy, and so we expect free cash flow to be within a range of approximately $5.9 billion to $6.7 billion before reflecting any pension contributions. Now let me share more detail about servicing Air Cargo for the USPS. This is good business for us, and we are moving quickly to begin onboarding this cargo. We will leverage our integrated network and existing assets, and we expect the majority of the volume will fit within our current U.S. domestic daytime flight operations. Our operators and engineers are already planning the network to support the complete transition to UPS in the third quarter. In terms of financial reporting, the revenue and expense associated with USPS Air Cargo will show up in the SCS other line in our financial reporting. Adding the USPS air cargo volume to our existing network will result in a higher share of the network cost being allocated to SCS, indirectly benefiting our U.S. domestic segment. We expect to see a benefit to operating margins this year at both the consolidated level and within the U.S. Domestic segment. To wrap up, we are also reaffirming our three-year consolidated revenue and operating margin targets we put forth at our March Investor and Analyst Day. Specifically, we aim to grow revenue to be between $108 million and $114 billion by 2026. The high end of the range includes inorganic opportunities, primarily in health care and international. Additionally, we expect to expand our consolidated operating margin to more than 13% by 2026, which includes expanding our domestic operating margin to at least 12%. And I'll note that the USPS volume is consistent with our better and bolder approach to grow in the parts of the market that leverage our integrated network, and it gives us a strong start to our 2026 targets. With that, thank you, and operator, please open the lines. Morgan, good morning. It's Brian. Happy to take this one. Look, our guidance for the first half of the year remains the same, declining in profit down 20% to 30%. So that's consistent. I did call out at the tail end of the quarter, expected minus 40%. I said consistently that Q1 would be the tougher quarter in the first half of the year. There were two elements that contributed to beating that 40%. One, on the top-line, we did see positive volume momentum going into the end of the quarter in fact, the last couple of weeks were basically breakeven from a volume perspective. I think the last week was about zero percent thereabout. So sequentially, we were seeing improved volume. But the bigger component was just some cost trading between April and March, things like occupancy and maintenance cost shift in terms of when they hit the P&L between March and April. So no change from a guide perspective still down 20% to 30%, some cost timing at the end of the quarter there, but the positive was the trajectory of volume momentum. Thanks, Morgan. Hey, Tom, happy to take that. So listen, from a Q1 to Q2 perspective, the shape, if we look at the U.S. we would expect marginal growth from a volume perspective, which relative to past trends, normally, Q1 steps down to Q2 from an absolute volume level. So by maintaining that will be a natural accretion from an EBIT perspective. The big component, though, full year on a run rate basis, the Fit to Serve program will generate $1.3 billion in savings and we're ramping that up in Q2. So that will be a big driver as well as we think about it. And then from a Q1 to the back half of the year, it's the same three components, Fit to Serve. It's the volume lift along with the drivers of RPP and then it's the labor contract lapping, which is the big piece in the back end of the year. I think all those that you stated, Carol, and then the volume growth, obviously, with the comps, it's going to be a big help to us. And then on the tonnage in terms of USPS comes in through SCS other. But because we're using a lot of the U.S. assets, we allocate cost to that business, and that will have a positive benefit on the domestic margin. And the headwind we saw from a mix perspective, Carol alluded to this in the back end of the year, we are anniversarying a fair amount of share post from last peak. And so the overlaps won't drive as big of a headwind. Sure. Scott, we're maintaining the first half at negative 20% to 30% from a profit perspective. So can choose the element of the range you want to point towards. I think ADV in domestic, we're expecting Q2 to be slightly positive. RPP should be consistent with what we saw flattish in the first quarter as we move out of the headwinds from a mix perspective. And as Carol said, fuel and the PSS in the back end of the year will help us. Cost per piece will get better in Q2 -- I'm sorry, in Q3 when we anniversary the cost of the labor contract, but somewhat similar from a Q2 perspective in the U.S. And then from an ADV perspective, internationally, Kate is looking to see that business improve as we sequentially move over the course of the year. So I guess I would steer you towards the 20% to 30%. We've been very consistent on that from a profit standpoint for the first half and you can squeeze it. So from an ADV perspective in domestic, I think that's where you're headed with a little bit of a slight tick up in positive volume in the second quarter will likely finish low single-digit decline in the first half, second half we'd expect that to be low single-digit increase. And you can look at it through various different lenses. We're building momentum ever since August, each month is basically getting sequentially better each quarter from Q3, Q4, Q1 improves. We'd expect to see slight positive volume trends in the second quarter. And then just from a comp standpoint, I mean if I go back from a trend perspective, over the last 10 years, our Q3 is generally about close to 300,000 ADV better than Q1. And even if we assume flat from a Q3 to Q1, that would be 4.5% growth. So any way you cut it, we see the back end of the year and most important, it's the visibility on the sales pipeline that we're pulling through and the volume levels we're seeing going into Q2. Yeah. The initiative is progressing slightly ahead of plan. Reductions began in March and will continue through I2. We'd expect more than 80% of the resource reductions to be complete by I2. We're on track to that $1 billion that I mentioned. And at a full annual run rate going into next year, we'd expect $1.3 billion. So there'll be some benefit early part of next year. Just, Carol, this year marks the 15th consecutive year we've increased the dividend, and we're committed to a stable and growing dividend. So we will earn back into that, but certainly committed to it. Yeah, Dave, we had expected about a 50% keep rate. We saw a 240 -- roughly 250 basis points in the first quarter. So generally, in line with expectations. We'd expect that base rate to continue over the course of the year. I think Carol hit on a couple of the key points around the other elements of pricing. There's a fuel piece. There's PSS in the back -- in the peak season and then there's the mix component that we've been talking about the focus on commercial on SMB and health care. So all those things combined give us confidence that we'll deliver a low single digit from an RPP second half of the year."

As we built this, we identified a win-win for both the USPS and for us it's just imperative that, one, we not only have it on the protection for our side and our business on what we're bringing on but also for the USPS because we want to make sure, as Carol mentioned, that we're onboarded before peak season, and we're bringing this on as quickly as possible, and we're working collectively with them. Nando and the team have done a great job with their operational team. And to Carol's point, we're meeting with them every week in DC to continue to onboard that volume to make sure it's a smooth transition."
