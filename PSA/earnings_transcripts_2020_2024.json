At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Erica. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that aside from those of historical fact, all statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results as described in yesterday's earnings release and our reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, February 25, 2021. We assume no obligation to update or revise any of these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our earnings release, SEC reports, earnings supplement and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thanks, Ryan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, and on behalf of the entire Public Storage team, I hope you and your families are well as we all navigate through this pandemic. Looking back at the full range of events in 2020, it was clearly a year of historic extremes. The year began with the predicted consequences from oversupply in several markets. In Q2, full focus shifted to managing a myriad of unknown issues tied to the virus. This included judging impacts on our employees, customers, operations, development approvals, acquisition volume and full company revenue with an overarching effort to maintain a safe environment and keep properties open. By Q3, we saw pronounced customer activity emerge as a result of both traditional and new drivers of demand. In the fourth quarter and into this year, we have seen sustained demand that has lifted the traditional seasonal slowdown in our business, resulting in historic occupancy and move in rate growth. I commend the Public Storage team on the numerous successes we had in 2020 and their ability to be nimble and creative in an environment we have never faced before. Now I would like to highlight eight specific areas of success as I reflect on the full year and on the fourth quarter. First, the integration of technology unlocked a new contactless leasing channel, which we call e-rental, which now accounts for nearly 50% of our move-ins. Approximately 300,000 customers use this new offering in 2020. Second, move-in rates grew by 12% in Q4 compared to negative 14% in Q2. Third, we reached fourth quarter occupancy of 95.2%, a record for this time of the year. Fourth, the robust lease-up of our 32 million square foot non same-store portfolio led to 26% NOI growth for both the quarter and the year. Fifth, after two full years, our third-party management business has expanded to 120 properties with a growing backlog as we enter 2021. Sixth, our industry-leading development platform has produced a current pipeline of $560 million as we deliver generation five assets across the United States. Seventh, the acquisition team sourced nearly $800 million of assets in 2020, with over $500 million in Q4, and we are entering 2021 with an equally vibrant pipeline of $580 million. And last, our focus on the continued optimization of our balance sheet, with record low issuances of preferred equity and debt. As we begin 2021, we are well equipped and focused on driving company performance on several fronts. Our advantages include a well primed capital structure, broad and growing benefits of the digitization of our business, record occupancy and, of course, the most commanding platform and brand in the self-storage industry. The Public Storage leadership team and I look forward to sharing more of these strategies in our upcoming Investor Day on May 3. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. Financial performance improved steadily through the second half of 2020, with a return to positive same-store revenue, NOI and full company core FFO growth in the fourth quarter. Our same-store revenue increased 0.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, which represents a sequential improvement in growth of 3.5% from the third quarter. There were two primary factors contributing to that improvement. First and foremost, move in rates, as Joe highlighted, were up double digits, while move out rates were roughly flat year-over-year, which led to improving in place rents. To a lesser extent, occupancy also increased with move in volume down, move out volume down Now on to expenses. The team did a great job driving same-store cost of operations down in the fourth quarter. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, taxes, utilities and marketing. The net result was a return to positive NOI growth of 1.3% in the fourth quarter. On the reporting front, we enhanced the presentation of same-store expenses this quarter. We broke expenses into two categories: first, direct cost of operations; and second, indirect cost of operations. This provides enhanced disclosure into property level profitability which once again demonstrates our industry-leading operating margins. We also posted our first earnings supplement on our website last night, which we hope you found helpful along with our 10-K. Next, our balance sheet. It's in great shape with two drivers of cash flow growth. First, as we have for the last five years, we have the capability to fund acquisitions and development activity with retained cash flow and unsecured debt at historically low financing costs. And second, we have the opportunity to redeem preferred stock as we move through the year. As we enter 2021, we've seen continued strength in customer demand, with occupancies up 250 basis points and in place contract rent per occupied square foot turning into positive year-over-year territory in January. The outlook for revenue growth is good with support from demand and moderating supply. That said, we do see risk to both move-outs as well as lingering state of emergency pricing restrictions as we move through the year. We expect continued strong expense control in 2021. We provide line-by-line commentary on our disclosure. Property tax expense growth is expected to pick up with around a 5.5% increase for the year anticipated. But away from that, better performance by utilizing technology to change operating processes, and investing in energy efficiency, we anticipate continued savings on property, payroll and utilities and a better marketing expense environment as we're operating with lower vacancies. In sum, improving revenue outlook and strong expense control as we start 2021. With that, I'll turn it back to Ryan.\nRyan Burke: Thanks, Tom. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, feel free to jump back in queue for follow-up. With that, Erica, let's please open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeffrey Spector: Great, I'm here with my colleague, and yes, thank you for the supplemental. We thought it was excellent, very helpful. Also appreciate the initial comments and the '21 outlook. And we take those comments very serious. I guess, can we just expand on that a little bit more? I know we know there's still risks out there, but it seems very clear that you're optimistic on '21 and that demand should remain stable, strong.\nJoe Russell: Yes, Jeff, one of the things that's leading to a change in demand and consumer behavior to some degree is tied to the pandemic. We're seeing some interesting and new areas of customer behavior surfacing. You could point to the work from home environment. So that's pronounced widespread. We're seeing it across literally all markets. It's provided an additive driver to the amount of activity that we're seeing. One of the things that we do on a regular basis to survey new customers coming into properties, and in 2020, one of the areas that was more pronounced was customers needing more space at home. So clearly ties to the entire work from home environment that's new and different through 2020. Likely to stay through a good chunk of 2021 and beyond because, frankly, I think many components of work from home are here for a much longer period of time than we might have predicted. Another thing that's been additive, home sales have been quite vibrant, even from a seasonality standpoint, we're seeing much more activity this time of the year than we normally do. So that too is added to the amount of activity and the overall demand that we're seeing across many markets. There's really been no distinction from activity in suburban versus urban areas. Frankly, it's highly consistent in both regard. So we're keeping a close track on many different cross currents. But overall business, as Tom noted, is quite good.\nJeffrey Spector: That's very helpful. And our second question is on acquisitions and your comment on the vibrant pipeline. To ask, are you getting more aggressive? Is underwriting changed? Are you focused on new markets or moving out, like there just more sellers? What has changed on that? We're excited? What's changed on the acquisition pipeline?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Jeff. The acquisition environment, as I know, has been quite robust. And if you step back, even going to 2019, we started to see an increase of the amount of sellers that were coming to market many of whom had come into the self-storage industry over the last, say, four or five years. There's no question there's been a much more vibrant amount of new owners coming into the sector. Some of whom weren't intending to stay in the sector for a long period of time. So you've got some churn tied to that. You've also got a number of assets that have been built at historic volume levels over the last three or four years, many of which have not hit either occupancy or revenue pro forma expectations, that too has motivated a number of sellers to bring assets to market. We've been controlling the markets as we typically do very actively. And then in 2020, we saw a sizable uptick in opportunities, many of which that fit the explanation I just described on the types of sellers that are coming to market. The other thing that we've found an interesting opportunity to expand into buying assets that may not be highly stabilized or looking for a different level of value creation. So in 2020, the average occupancy of the assets we bought was approximately 65%. That speaks to the fact that these are newer assets. They haven't gone through a full lease-up cycle and sellers have been frustrated in many cases and not patient enough to want to take them through that full cycle. So we've been able to open up some very interesting opportunities tied to that. And the $580 million that we have either closed or are in contract for 2021 is a reflection of all those issues. The average occupancy of those assets is about the same, which is in the mid-60% range. Combination of one-off and some smaller portfolios, nothing as large as beyond portfolio that we closed in the fourth quarter, but our acquisition team continues to control markets, and they're very well known. We've got deep relationships. We're seeing a combination of both marketed and off market opportunities. And we're looked upon as a preferred buyer. So Tom spoke to the fact that the capital structure is well primed, and we're frankly just seeing a much larger set of opportunities.\nOperator: Your next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: To echo Jeff's comments, thank you at kudos to the improved disclosure. I guess one question for me would be on the balance sheet which you just referenced, Joe. And how are you thinking about the firepower there? And are you wedded to the A-rated balance sheet? Or is that not necessarily something that you're wedding or at this point?\nJoe Russell: Sure. Maybe I'll start from, then Tom can give you some more color. We have a clear advantage because we do have an A credit rating. And with that, as we've been able to do in many different issuances, whether through the preferred or institutional bond market, we're able to tap into a pool of investors who love the credit rating, they're very attracted to the Company as a whole. And we enjoy very strong both demand and we've been able to issue record low rates and yields on these instruments. Now the other thing is we've got a lot of capacity in our current structure. Tom can give you more color on that. So we're not concerned about tipping into something less than an A credit rating, but we'll give you a little perspective on that.\nTom Boyle: Yes, sure. Thanks, Joe. I think looking back over the last five years, you can see that we have financed our external growth, both acquisitions and developments, really with retained cash flow we have about $200 million to $300 million a year as well as unsecured debt. And that gives us a good amount of capacity in firepower each and every year to grow the business and accretively drive external growth performance without needing to raise equity.  And that's a good long-term sustainable FFO growth engine. So we think we do have a good mount of capacity there. And as Joe said, we have very good access across the capital markets, and we demonstrated that again in January with a five-year bond offering, sub-1% on the coupon. So, good access and cost, and we look forward to utilizing it to finance the external growth that Joe mentioned.\nJuan Sanabria: And one quick follow-up for me, in the disclosure, you talked about G&A increasing year-over-year adding some headcount. So just curious on what areas of the the enterprise you're adding people to? And what's the focus of that? What are you looking to build out?\nTom Boyle: Sure. I think, in particular, I think you might be highlighting the centralized management costs and the comment that we increased headcount there. That is just deepening the bench across many of our centralized management functions, be it information technology, human resources, pricing and marketing, data analytics, really down the list. Folks really are responsible for centrally managing and supporting our field teams. So just deepening of the bench and overall those teams are really important to the success of the organization.\nOperator: Your next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: I also appreciate the increased disclosure this quarter. First question. Just looking at the core FFO that you reported in the quarter, 293, what headwinds should we be thinking about moving into the the first quarter and throughout the year, just given the lack of seasonality experienced in the fourth quarter and so far early in '21 that you discussed that would detract from sort of core FFO going forward here in terms of the run rate. Is there anything specific that we should be thinking about?\nTom Boyle: Sure. This is Tom. Thanks, Todd. I think there's really a couple of things as we look out over the horizon into 2021 that we view as potential headwinds, I mentioned them briefly. One of them is move-outs. As we move through 2020, it was really a unique environment that we've spoken about on previous calls, where the customer behavior shifted as we moved into April and May and really persist through the year, across customer vintages, geographies, customer segments, where length of stays went longer and move-outs declined. And you can see that in our disclosures. That's one area that we do anticipate is likely to moderate as we move through 2021. Maybe it's into 2022. I mean it's uncertain as to when we do see that moderation. So far to start this year, we've continued to see very strong existing customer performance and lower move-outs. But we would anticipate that at some point, customer behavior returns to pre pandemic levels. And we see move-outs start to accelerate. So that's number one. The second one is the lingering impact of state of emergency pricing restrictions. And those impact our ability to increase move in rents as well as existing tenant price increases over time. And as those linger and we navigate through the dynamic health care environment that we have for the past year, that's a risk. We'll have to see. There's a myriad of different regulations across different states. Probably most notably here in the state of California, which is a good portion of our portfolio, and we'll -- that's an unpredictable element of rate restriction.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then I wanted to see if you could comment on CapEx spend. It looks like it's expected to ramp up to about $250 million in '21, which is up from 2020 levels, but still well below peers as sort of a percent of NOI or a percent of EBITDA. How do you think about CapEx spend? And is there an opportunity to increase that further? And I guess sort of what's the governor on CapEx spend that -- is there anything preventing you from sort of touching more stores more quickly?\nJoe Russell: So yes, Todd, I'll speak to a component of that, and then Tom can give you more color as well. But our property of tomorrow program is part of that increased spend in 2020 for a number of reasons, particularly tied to slower permitting process, availability of officials that do the overall improvements of the types of changes that we're making through the program. We were unable to tap as much volume and to pull or cover that program as full force is into many markets as we expected at the beginning of 2020. We've regrouped, we have a much more clear runway in 2021, we're going to be touching many more assets through the year. And we may actually find ways to accelerate it as we go deeper into the year. But at the moment, that's major component of the increase in spend.\nTom Boyle: Yes. And if you break down the $250 million that we anticipate, about $130 million of that, we anticipate to be the property of tomorrow spend that Joe highlighted, around $75 million of of your regular maintenance CapEx and another $40 million, $50 million of energy efficiency driven capital expenditures. And I would highlight, we do break out the maintenance CapEx and provide some disclosure on that in the 10-K, even away from the development and acquisition CapEx on the cash flow statement.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Tom, I was wondering if you could spend a little bit more time on the balance sheet and just kind of following up on Juan's question. You have a lot of preferreds that have call dates coming up in the next, I think it's maybe 18 months. And I'm just curious your thoughts on your willingness to use more long-term unsecured debt to maybe take out some of those higher cost preferreds?\nJoe Russell: Sure. You're right, Steve, to highlight the fact that one of the great features of preferred stock is that it's both perpetual as well as has a five-year call. And so a lot of the preferreds that were issued back in in 2016 are now coming up for potential redemption. At the time they were issued, I think they were viewed as pretty darn attractive for handled preferreds, but in this environment, certainly a great opportunity to redeem that perpetual capital. And so we did a little bit of that in January, as you saw, we redeemed $300 million of a series that was at 5.4%. We did issue five-year bonds in January. As I've noted before, we'll monitor different markets and have the ability to use both a new preferred stock at lower rates as well as unsecured debt to finance the business as well as the redemption activity going forward. But clearly, second prong of the balance sheet that I spoke about earlier, it will be a powerful one as we move through both '21 and into the beginning of '22.\nSteve Sakwa: And maybe just a follow-up on just kind of leverage overall. I mean you're committed clearly to the A rating, but where does that sort of leave you on a net debt to maybe net debt plus preferred to EBITDA, sort of how high can that number go? And theoretically, still maintain the A rating?\nJoe Russell: Sure. I would highlight some disclosure we put in on leverage in the supplemental on net debt plus preferred. The different rating agencies use different metrics, but I would -- just to pick one, pick S&P who looks at a net debt plus preferred of 4.5x, which is over a turn higher than where we are now as a guidepost for single A ratings.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. Great. And then just maybe by market, there were some interesting trends in Q4. Some of them that have been super weak in multifamily, and we've seen some drawdowns in office. We're reasonably strong for you, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and some of the markets that are benefitting down in the south were a bit weaker. Maybe that's supply, maybe there's something else going on. Just any thoughts on maybe the coastal gateway markets against kind of the Sunbelt markets?\nJoe Russell: Steve, as I mentioned earlier, we're really not seeing a material change in urban versus suburban and even coastal versus Midwest markets, the markets you spoke to, specifically, we're seeing overall very good demand. Literally, every one of our markets improved in occupancy in the quarter. And we continue to see very good and sustained demand coming through not only our same-store portfolio, but the lease-up of our non-same-store is quite vibrant. The demand for self-storage has been very resilient through both the pandemic, and I think it reaffirms the attractiveness of the product itself. Supply though is still a factor in a number of markets. There's no question. And it has and will continue to be a headwind in the name markets that we've spoken to for the last two or three years as many markets have been burdened by oversupply. The Houston market, for instance, still is absorbing a lot of product, but we're seeing good traction though. And to your point on the Southeast Atlanta has got some headwinds around supply. Minneapolis, Florida, parts of New York, et cetera. But at the same time, demand is quite healthy. So we're very pleased with the amount of lease up that's going on. And we're very pleased with the acceleration and stabilization of our non same-store portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I guess, I wanted to ask just a little bit more around sort of pricing strategy if patterns return to more normal -- more normal in the back half of the year. Do you think in terms of maximizing revenues long term, would you be inclined to try to keep occupancies kind of more elevated with maybe less increases to existing customers? Or is there any sort of change around how you're thinking about sort of capitalizing on these high occupancy levels that you have right now?\nJoe Russell: Sure, Smedes. I mean, I guess I wouldn't highlight a particular occupancy or rate strategy for the back half of the year, given it's way too early to understand what the nature of the dynamics will be in the local submarkets with which we operate. I would highlight, clearly through 2020, we had the opportunity to anticipate lower move out volumes and lower inventory levels, which led to accelerating pricing, really starting in the second quarter and then accelerating through the second half of the year and now into the first quarter as well. So I think it's really been a rate focused strategy at this point given the low inventory levels, and that's been combined with lower promotional discounts, which we disclosed as well as lower marketing expense. As we move into the back half of 2021, if the picture you're painting is one where occupancy starts to fall significantly because of increased move out activity that will definitely change the dynamics in the local market. But I think one of the key components that we'd have to understand is whether the durability of consumer demand that we're seeing now persists because that is a really strong and powerful driver to revenue growth and overall move-in rates and accommodations to customers. So we're ultimately looking to maximize revenues, and we need to understand the nature of the move-ins and move outs. But clearly, it's a combination of both occupancy and rent and operating trends continue to be quite good as we start 2021.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then I guess we were just also wondering if you have any sense of if there's been any change in the customer base in terms of maybe first-time users of storage or reaching a particular demographic that hasn't maybe used storage in the past? Any sort of color there that you've seen?\nJoe Russell: There's no question, Smedes, that's happening as we speak. When you look at the sector as a whole and then more specifically, what we're seeing in our own portfolio, there's been more adoption by newer generations of users, many of whom have never used self-storage before. So it's been a great way for them to use the product for the first time. We're seeing continued repeat customers as well. But generationally, there's been growing and deep adoption of the asset, and we're very encouraged by that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: So in regards to some of the dialogue you've had with investor, it seems like you're embracing some of those suggestions. And of course, you've made some board changes and better disclosure, better commentary on this call. And I won't rehash everything that they brought up, but the two big ones are capital deployment and balance sheet. I'm interested if there's been any type of kind of shift in mentality or business philosophy or how you see the investment universe? And what are some of the changes that we can expect to see from PSA and the magnitude because that's important?\nJoe Russell: Well, Ki Bin to speak to just interaction with all shareholders, we have and will continue to be in active dialogue with our entire shareholder base. And we are continuing to drive the business on many different fronts. As we've talked about, we've got very unique and commanding strategies and capabilities. We are clearly focused on tapping into many of those, and we'll give you even more perspective on that in our Investor Day on May 3. This is not coming from one specific event or one and very distinct change in strategy. It's something that we're very focused on from an evolution and opportunity standpoint. And the management team and I are very focused on delivering strong shareholder returns through a variety of very commanding strategies that we've identified, some of which we've spoken about today and more that we'll speak about in May. So we'll continue to be as transparent as we can be, and we welcome and continue to have very active dialogue with our shareholders.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And in regards to some of the Board changes, I'm just curious if there is -- or what kind of dynamic there would be between the new Board members, the Chairman and the management team and how this might compare to the past, if there is any difference?\nJoe Russell: Well, there is a difference because over the last two years, the Board has gone through a pretty strong level of refreshment. We've added seven new trustees. The Board has and will continue to be very focused on good governance. I'm very happy with the new trustees that have joined the Public Storage board of good strong collection of different backgrounds, different business perspectives. And collectively, we're working on many things together. And we'll continue to look to and seek very strong counsel from the Board as it evolves over time. As I mentioned, we've added seven new trustees. So prior to that, the average tenure of the Board was 11 to 12 years. Now, it's about four. So with that comes, new ideas, new perspectives, and I'm very pleased with the overall caliber and focus at the Board at large has on the Company's direction and all the strategic initiatives that we're focused on.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. I echo the sentiment on the supplemental, very helpful. Just a quick one from me. Just going back to the supply question, very helpful calling out some of the markets. But maybe as asking in a different way, if we think about sort of the percentage of the portfolio, dealing with competitive new supply, maybe what is that number? And if not, just how do you expect that to trend this year and sort of in the out years going forward?\nJoe Russell: Yes, sure, Ron. So obviously, we've talked about now for the last two to three years. We've been in a very strong delivery pattern of new assets. You go back to 2017, about $4 billion of new assets were added to the market nationally. It ticked up in 2018 and '19, which, at the moment, feels like a peak, that was about $5 billion of deliveries. In 2020, as expected, we saw that taper down by about 10% to 12%, where now we're at 2021, and we're thinking that there's likely another 10% to 15% reduction in deliveries. It's come to different markets. It's had, as I mentioned earlier, some pretty detrimental impacts where it hit certain submarkets with an inordinate amount of oversupply. We're encouraged, however, that it's cyclically starting to taper down, but it's still with us. And even at a level this year, that could be somewhere between $3.5 or so billion to maybe $3.75 billion of deliveries, it's -- that's still a fair amount of new assets being delivered in many markets. As I mentioned, it has provided an opportunity for us to go out and acquire assets on one front. On our development platform, it's also given us a pocket of opportunity that we haven't seen until the last year or two, where we're actually not seeing as much competitive bidding on land sites. And it's creating another different opportunity that we uniquely enjoy because we do have an industry-leading development platform and our development teams out betting a higher level of land sites as we speak. So we're hopeful that, that continued decline of deliveries play through to counterbalance that. The self-storage sector is doing quite well. And funding is out there, and developers are still going to be encouraged in some areas to continue to put new product into markets. So we're tracking it actively. And we'll see how it plays through in the coming quarters.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Very helpful. My second question was just looking internationally, obviously with the stake in Shurgard, it could be really helpful if you could just compare and contrast sort of the experience you've seen with the storage product and COVID, maybe someone internationally in some of the markets you're familiar with versus what the U.S. went through?\nJoe Russell: Yes, I think I'd point you to, Shurgard has got vibrant disclosures, and they can give you much more color on what's going on in the European markets. But knowing and understanding what's been impacting their business. It has been similar in many ways to what we've seen here in the United States, which, again, is an elevated level of demand, new users coming into the product itself. And they, too, are seeing good business drivers, many similarities between what we're seeing here in the United States.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller: Just wondering, have you seen any significant benefits yet of having the third-party business, even though you've been for a fairly short time at this point?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Mike. Yes, it's definitely giving us a different lens on the industry. As I mentioned, currently, we've got the program up to 120 properties, a sizable percentage of the assets that are coming into our pipeline are development assets. So it's another view of how much of that activity is on the front lines in many markets. That's helpful. We've actually bought four assets thus far from the platform itself. So it can be many times a different relationship opportunity to identify and actually acquire assets. And it's always helpful to get outside feedback on the different operational methodologies that we use, the reaction we've got from owners, the way that they're looking at the performance of assets. So holistically, it's been very additive, and it's given us yet again a different perspective on the industry in many different ways. So we're encouraged about our opportunities going into this year. The pipeline continues to grow. It is not fully weighted, but it is heavily weighted around continued construction activity or development activity, but we're also finding a number of owners that have given us, say, one, two or three assets initially, and now they're giving us more. So it's another way for us to continue to build relationships, and we look forward to strengthening as relationships as we continue -- as the program continues to expand.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.\nRick Skidmore: Just a follow-up on the supply question just a few minutes ago. As you think about the lease-up of new and developed properties has been maybe extended four to five years and given the demand trends you're seeing, are you seeing that lease-up pace accelerate such that it might be a little faster than you think or maybe reverting back to prior periods where growth wasn't as rapid?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Rick, you're right. It is accelerating. We've been very pleased with even more near term, the assets that we delivered in 2019 and '20 are seeing much stronger demand and lease-up activity than we anticipated. So that's definitely encouraging. And as I mentioned, even if we're looking to some of the acquisitions that have lower levels of existing occupancy, we're seeing -- once we put those assets into our platform, really strong and acceleration from customer activity, lease-up and then we're stabilizing the asset in a shorter period of time. But frankly, and Tom's talked about this in prior calls as well. It is a product type that does take time to season from a revenue stabilization standpoint. But the quicker we are able to fill assets up and start maturing that revenue stream, the better off we are and putting, as we speak.\nRick Skidmore: Got it. And then just on the demand side of the question, you mentioned some new millennial generation or younger generation utilizing storage a bit more, but you also -- Tom also talked a bit about move-outs reverting back to maybe a normal trend line. Maybe just frame how you think about demand as to whether it's changed over the longer term? Or is it just too early to tell if there's some trend that that's coming out of COVID with regards to how demand might move going forward?\nTom Boyle: Sure. It's something, Rick, that we're watching very closely, both the composition, as Joe mentioned, based on survey data and customer activity. As we move through 2020. The good thing is it's been really durable, and the momentum has continued. So looking at top of funnel demand trends, web visits and sales calls are up 10% plus, and that's against an inventory backdrop, where occupancies are higher, vacancies are lower. And as Joe just mentioned, lease-up assets are filling up faster. So, a good environment to have strong top of funnel customer interest, IN terms of the types of customers or the use cases of storage, one of them that Joe highlighted that we saw really accelerate in the April and May time period was consumers that were not moving, but we're looking to free up some space in their home. And that use case has continued to trend higher than prior years throughout the year. In other words, it wasn't an April, May but it has persisted throughout. And those customers tend to be good storage customers as they utilize the storage space as an extension of their home and tend to have longer length of stays. So that's a nice backdrop and characterization of the demand that we've seen to date, and we'll support the occupancy and customer tenure here going forward. How long that lasts, is anybody's guess. But we've been encouraged by how persistent it's been through 2020 and into 2021. And as Joe mentioned, we do think some elements of the reaction to really individuals daily lives being disrupted through the pandemic will persist as we go forward, be it with the ability to work from home for more days or just generally spending more time at home. So we're encouraged by that, but no guidepost into the future as to what exactly or what day or time period those could shift.\nOperator: Your next question is from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.\nTodd Stender: I heard some occupancy figures that I think may have been for the full year 2020, but I wanted to make sure if you broke out the Q4 deals and then facilities already acquired here in Q1.\nJoe Russell: Todd, are you specifically asking about acquisition deals or...\nTodd Stender: Sorry. Yes. I know it's a pretty geographically diverse set, but maybe just speak to occupancies and any color on rents maybe they're below market or at market? Any color there?\nTom Boyle: Yes. I can maybe provide a little bit of color and then Joe can chime in too. But the fourth quarter, we did see some lower occupancy transactions. I think we had spoken in the past around how the portfolio came in at lower occupancies than the overall average, around 35%. And overall, the acquisitions in 2020, you're right, we're higher, around 65%. And as we moved into 2021, we're obviously only really talking about a quarter's worth of activity, but that's similar around that 65% And then in terms of rate, clearly, with many of the properties in earlier fill up stages, rates will be lower, and we'll have the opportunity over time to increase those rates as we go.\nJoe Russell: Yes. And maybe just to give you a little bit more color to, Todd, as I mentioned, the occupancy on average, speaks to the fact that many of these assets are relatively new. But overall, we've been very pleased with the quality level of the assets that we've been able to acquire over the last two years in particular, as I mentioned, many of these sellers are coming to market in a way that they have some level of reticence to stay in the sector, they're not necessarily achieving either pro forma revenues or occupancies, but the overall quality of the assets that we continue to see and acquire has been very good.\nTodd Stender: If they're generally new or does that suggest that the sellers do not need tax-efficient currency like an OP unit and you're just paying in cash?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Many of them are looking for cash. It could be because it's a single asset that they developed or maybe they've got other asset types that they need to put more capital into and the rebalancing a broader portfolio. So different circumstances, but many of these conversations have come over some period of time as we built relationships with these owners and through our deep connections even through the brokerage community, too.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Bragg with Green Street.\nDavid Bragg: On the expense side, could you provide some additional color on the role of the rental program and driving down payroll expenses? And are you expecting that rental utilization is going to remain elevated as we move toward a more normal environment?\nJoe Russell: So yes, David, the e rental channel, as I mentioned, has been quite vibrant. Customers are really drawn to it. We think that the sustainability and the utility of that channel will definitely go beyond whatever pandemic environment, driving our whatever pandemic related activity may be leading customers to use it because, frankly, we designed it and tested it before the pandemic. It was built around a very efficient and time-sensitive customer who wanted to be much more oriented toward a self-service transaction. So we've really seen good adaptability and adoption by customers. It's now approximately 50% of our move-in process. And to your point, it will likely have different kinds of beneficial impacts as we continue to study our operational model and the way that it too provides a different level of service to customers. We'll talk more about this in our Investor Day in May, but we're definitely very encouraged by the success of that channel so far and look forward to continue to optimize it.\nDavid Bragg: Great. Just quick follow-up. It seems like work from home demand, you're expecting to be relatively sticky moving forward. As we think about potential move-outs, what are particular areas where you're concerned? Is it potentially small business demand moving out as we move towards a normal environment? Or are there other areas where we should be keeping in mind\nTom Boyle: As I noted earlier, the change in move out ratio really was across customer segments, customer tenures, pre pandemic, during pandemic customers, business, consumer and the like. So the shift was not isolated in one. And so as we think about consumer behavior, moving back to historical norms or closer to historical norms, there's no question that, that could just as easily be across the full spectrum. But as we noted, we have not seen that to date. And we'll certainly update the investment community when we do start to see that, but we've been encouraged starting 2021.\nOperator: Your final question is from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: Michael Bilerman here with Smedes. Joe, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about sort of the stakes in Shurgard and PSB. And just as you've interacted with shareholders and analysts, whether sort of any of that is on the table in terms of distribution or a sale, the combined stakes in those two companies today is almost $3.6 billion, high single-digit of your gross asset value. I guess, how do you think about those stakes longer term?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Michael, I would step back and tell you that we are supporters of both platforms. We're very pleased with the individual performance of each of those businesses. There are a variety of reasons why we have and do maintain our investment level in them. And ultimately, and to what degree that changes over time, I wouldn't speak to directly, but we're very pleased with our investment and the success of each of those entities.\nMichael Bilerman: But I guess does that capital on your balance sheet makes sense. I think probably more so, I can understand the Shurgard, Europe side is a global business, but does the PSD stake makes sense?\nJoe Russell: It's -- like I mentioned, Michael, I would just leave it as it's been, and we feel a good investment on our behalf. And that's as much color as I can give at this point. It would be strategically as it would be in any different investment that we have, something that we could continue to evaluate. And as any shift in focus or commitment takes place, we would certainly bring that forth. But at this point, I don't have anything to share with you.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. And then just on the management program, do you have sort of maybe just some details around how many different owners you have in that group, maybe some clarity on what those represent out of the 120, more sort of the top five in there? Or is it spread out amongst singles and doubles and triples?\nJoe Russell: Yes. It's beginning with singles, doubles and triples. But as I mentioned, as the business evolves, we're actually starting to see a number of owners that have anywhere from, say, 10, 20 or 30 or more assets. And they're giving us the opportunity to basically display and show the kind of performance that those assets are able to attain under our own platform. We've seen good traction. And I think over time, that's a different way for the program to continue to evolve. The business as a whole is very reference oriented. So that matters. And that's something that, over time, as we show and display the amount of performance of these assets are able to attain under our own platform, I think will be very additive, and we're actually starting to see some of that as we speak.\nMichael Bilerman: Great. And I appreciate making opening comments on the call. I appreciate having a supplemental and sort of coming in line with the industry. It's nice to see the Company take action amongst the comments that have been provided by the investment community time and being a little bit more outward with some of that. So definitely appreciate the change in a lot of things that you're doing and implementing.\nJoe Russell: Great. Thanks for the feedback. Appreciate it.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Ryan Burke for additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Erica. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your time. We appreciate your interest. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Financial performance improved steadily through the second half of 2020, with a return to positive same-store revenue, NOI and full company core FFO growth in the fourth quarter. Our same-store revenue increased 0.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, which represents a sequential improvement in growth of 3.5% from the third quarter. There were two primary factors contributing to that improvement. First and foremost, move in rates, as Joe highlighted, were up double digits, while move out rates were roughly flat year-over-year, which led to improving in place rents. To a lesser extent, occupancy also increased with move in volume down, move out volume down Now on to expenses. The team did a great job driving same-store cost of operations down in the fourth quarter. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, taxes, utilities and marketing. The net result was a return to positive NOI growth of 1.3% in the fourth quarter. On the reporting front, we enhanced the presentation of same-store expenses this quarter. We broke expenses into two categories: first, direct cost of operations; and second, indirect cost of operations. This provides enhanced disclosure into property level profitability which once again demonstrates our industry-leading operating margins. We also posted our first earnings supplement on our website last night, which we hope you found helpful along with our 10-K. Next, our balance sheet. It's in great shape with two drivers of cash flow growth. First, as we have for the last five years, we have the capability to fund acquisitions and development activity with retained cash flow and unsecured debt at historically low financing costs. And second, we have the opportunity to redeem preferred stock as we move through the year. As we enter 2021, we've seen continued strength in customer demand, with occupancies up 250 basis points and in place contract rent per occupied square foot turning into positive year-over-year territory in January. The outlook for revenue growth is good with support from demand and moderating supply. That said, we do see risk to both move-outs as well as lingering state of emergency pricing restrictions as we move through the year. We expect continued strong expense control in 2021. We provide line-by-line commentary on our disclosure. Property tax expense growth is expected to pick up with around a 5.5% increase for the year anticipated. But away from that, better performance by utilizing technology to change operating processes, and investing in energy efficiency, we anticipate continued savings on property, payroll and utilities and a better marketing expense environment as we're operating with lower vacancies. In sum, improving revenue outlook and strong expense control as we start 2021. With that, I'll turn it back to Ryan. Yes, sure. Thanks, Joe. I think looking back over the last five years, you can see that we have financed our external growth, both acquisitions and developments, really with retained cash flow we have about $200 million to $300 million a year as well as unsecured debt. And that gives us a good amount of capacity in firepower each and every year to grow the business and accretively drive external growth performance without needing to raise equity.  And that's a good long-term sustainable FFO growth engine. So we think we do have a good mount of capacity there. And as Joe said, we have very good access across the capital markets, and we demonstrated that again in January with a five-year bond offering, sub-1% on the coupon. So, good access and cost, and we look forward to utilizing it to finance the external growth that Joe mentioned. Sure. I think, in particular, I think you might be highlighting the centralized management costs and the comment that we increased headcount there. That is just deepening the bench across many of our centralized management functions, be it information technology, human resources, pricing and marketing, data analytics, really down the list. Folks really are responsible for centrally managing and supporting our field teams. So just deepening of the bench and overall those teams are really important to the success of the organization. Sure. This is Tom. Thanks, Todd. I think there's really a couple of things as we look out over the horizon into 2021 that we view as potential headwinds, I mentioned them briefly. One of them is move-outs. As we move through 2020, it was really a unique environment that we've spoken about on previous calls, where the customer behavior shifted as we moved into April and May and really persist through the year, across customer vintages, geographies, customer segments, where length of stays went longer and move-outs declined. And you can see that in our disclosures. That's one area that we do anticipate is likely to moderate as we move through 2021. Maybe it's into 2022. I mean it's uncertain as to when we do see that moderation. So far to start this year, we've continued to see very strong existing customer performance and lower move-outs. But we would anticipate that at some point, customer behavior returns to pre pandemic levels. And we see move-outs start to accelerate. So that's number one. The second one is the lingering impact of state of emergency pricing restrictions. And those impact our ability to increase move in rents as well as existing tenant price increases over time. And as those linger and we navigate through the dynamic health care environment that we have for the past year, that's a risk. We'll have to see. There's a myriad of different regulations across different states. Probably most notably here in the state of California, which is a good portion of our portfolio, and we'll -- that's an unpredictable element of rate restriction. Yes. And if you break down the $250 million that we anticipate, about $130 million of that, we anticipate to be the property of tomorrow spend that Joe highlighted, around $75 million of of your regular maintenance CapEx and another $40 million, $50 million of energy efficiency driven capital expenditures. And I would highlight, we do break out the maintenance CapEx and provide some disclosure on that in the 10-K, even away from the development and acquisition CapEx on the cash flow statement. Sure. It's something, Rick, that we're watching very closely, both the composition, as Joe mentioned, based on survey data and customer activity. As we move through 2020. The good thing is it's been really durable, and the momentum has continued. So looking at top of funnel demand trends, web visits and sales calls are up 10% plus, and that's against an inventory backdrop, where occupancies are higher, vacancies are lower.

            "name": "Joe Russell",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, and on behalf of the entire Public Storage team, I hope you and your families are well as we all navigate through this pandemic. Looking back at the full range of events in 2020, it was clearly a year of historic extremes. The year began with the predicted consequences from oversupply in several markets. In Q2, full focus shifted to managing a myriad of unknown issues tied to the virus. This included judging impacts on our employees, customers, operations, development approvals, acquisition volume and full company revenue with an overarching effort to maintain a safe environment and keep properties open. By Q3, we saw pronounced customer activity emerge as a result of both traditional and new drivers of demand. In the fourth quarter and into this year, we have seen sustained demand that has lifted the traditional seasonal slowdown in our business, resulting in historic occupancy and move in rate growth. I commend the Public Storage team on the numerous successes we had in 2020 and their ability to be nimble and creative in an environment we have never faced before. Now I would like to highlight eight specific areas of success as I reflect on the full year and on the fourth quarter. First, the integration of technology unlocked a new contactless leasing channel, which we call e-rental, which now accounts for nearly 50% of our move-ins. Approximately 300,000 customers use this new offering in 2020. Second, move-in rates grew by 12% in Q4 compared to negative 14% in Q2. Third, we reached fourth quarter occupancy of 95.2%, a record for this time of the year. Fourth, the robust lease-up of our 32 million square foot non same-store portfolio led to 26% NOI growth for both the quarter and the year. Fifth, after two full years, our third-party management business has expanded to 120 properties with a growing backlog as we enter 2021. Sixth, our industry-leading development platform has produced a current pipeline of $560 million as we deliver generation five assets across the United States. Seventh, the acquisition team sourced nearly $800 million of assets in 2020, with over $500 million in Q4, and we are entering 2021 with an equally vibrant pipeline of $580 million. And last, our focus on the continued optimization of our balance sheet, with record low issuances of preferred equity and debt. As we begin 2021, we are well equipped and focused on driving company performance on several fronts. Our advantages include a well primed capital structure, broad and growing benefits of the digitization of our business, record occupancy and, of course, the most commanding platform and brand in the self-storage industry. The Public Storage leadership team and I look forward to sharing more of these strategies in our upcoming Investor Day on May 3. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. Yes, Jeff, one of the things that's leading to a change in demand and consumer behavior to some degree is tied to the pandemic. We're seeing some interesting and new areas of customer behavior surfacing. You could point to the work from home environment. So that's pronounced widespread. We're seeing it across literally all markets. It's provided an additive driver to the amount of activity that we're seeing. One of the things that we do on a regular basis to survey new customers coming into properties, and in 2020, one of the areas that was more pronounced was customers needing more space at home. So clearly ties to the entire work from home environment that's new and different through 2020. Likely to stay through a good chunk of 2021 and beyond because, frankly, I think many components of work from home are here for a much longer period of time than we might have predicted. Another thing that's been additive, home sales have been quite vibrant, even from a seasonality standpoint, we're seeing much more activity this time of the year than we normally do. So that too is added to the amount of activity and the overall demand that we're seeing across many markets. There's really been no distinction from activity in suburban versus urban areas. Frankly, it's highly consistent in both regard. So we're keeping a close track on many different cross currents. But overall business, as Tom noted, is quite good. Yes, Jeff. The acquisition environment, as I know, has been quite robust. And if you step back, even going to 2019, we started to see an increase of the amount of sellers that were coming to market many of whom had come into the self-storage industry over the last, say, four or five years. There's no question there's been a much more vibrant amount of new owners coming into the sector. Some of whom weren't intending to stay in the sector for a long period of time. So you've got some churn tied to that. You've also got a number of assets that have been built at historic volume levels over the last three or four years, many of which have not hit either occupancy or revenue pro forma expectations, that too has motivated a number of sellers to bring assets to market. We've been controlling the markets as we typically do very actively. And then in 2020, we saw a sizable uptick in opportunities, many of which that fit the explanation I just described on the types of sellers that are coming to market. The other thing that we've found an interesting opportunity to expand into buying assets that may not be highly stabilized or looking for a different level of value creation. So in 2020, the average occupancy of the assets we bought was approximately 65%. That speaks to the fact that these are newer assets. They haven't gone through a full lease-up cycle and sellers have been frustrated in many cases and not patient enough to want to take them through that full cycle. So we've been able to open up some very interesting opportunities tied to that. And the $580 million that we have either closed or are in contract for 2021 is a reflection of all those issues. The average occupancy of those assets is about the same, which is in the mid-60% range. Combination of one-off and some smaller portfolios, nothing as large as beyond portfolio that we closed in the fourth quarter, but our acquisition team continues to control markets, and they're very well known. We've got deep relationships. We're seeing a combination of both marketed and off market opportunities. And we're looked upon as a preferred buyer. So Tom spoke to the fact that the capital structure is well primed, and we're frankly just seeing a much larger set of opportunities. Sure. Maybe I'll start from, then Tom can give you some more color. We have a clear advantage because we do have an A credit rating. And with that, as we've been able to do in many different issuances, whether through the preferred or institutional bond market, we're able to tap into a pool of investors who love the credit rating, they're very attracted to the Company as a whole. And we enjoy very strong both demand and we've been able to issue record low rates and yields on these instruments. Now the other thing is we've got a lot of capacity in our current structure. Tom can give you more color on that. So we're not concerned about tipping into something less than an A credit rating, but we'll give you a little perspective on that. So yes, Todd, I'll speak to a component of that, and then Tom can give you more color as well. But our property of tomorrow program is part of that increased spend in 2020 for a number of reasons, particularly tied to slower permitting process, availability of officials that do the overall improvements of the types of changes that we're making through the program. We were unable to tap as much volume and to pull or cover that program as full force is into many markets as we expected at the beginning of 2020. We've regrouped, we have a much more clear runway in 2021, we're going to be touching many more assets through the year. And we may actually find ways to accelerate it as we go deeper into the year. But at the moment, that's major component of the increase in spend. Sure. You're right, Steve, to highlight the fact that one of the great features of preferred stock is that it's both perpetual as well as has a five-year call. And so a lot of the preferreds that were issued back in in 2016 are now coming up for potential redemption. At the time they were issued, I think they were viewed as pretty darn attractive for handled preferreds, but in this environment, certainly a great opportunity to redeem that perpetual capital. And so we did a little bit of that in January, as you saw, we redeemed $300 million of a series that was at 5.4%. We did issue five-year bonds in January. As I've noted before, we'll monitor different markets and have the ability to use both a new preferred stock at lower rates as well as unsecured debt to finance the business as well as the redemption activity going forward. But clearly, second prong of the balance sheet that I spoke about earlier, it will be a powerful one as we move through both '21 and into the beginning of '22. Sure. I would highlight some disclosure we put in on leverage in the supplemental on net debt plus preferred. The different rating agencies use different metrics, but I would -- just to pick one, pick S&P who looks at a net debt plus preferred of 4.5x, which is over a turn higher than where we are now as a guidepost for single A ratings. Steve, as I mentioned earlier, we're really not seeing a material change in urban versus suburban and even coastal versus Midwest markets, the markets you spoke to, specifically, we're seeing overall very good demand. Literally, every one of our markets improved in occupancy in the quarter. And we continue to see very good and sustained demand coming through not only our same-store portfolio, but the lease-up of our non-same-store is quite vibrant. The demand for self-storage has been very resilient through both the pandemic, and I think it reaffirms the attractiveness of the product itself. Supply though is still a factor in a number of markets. There's no question. And it has and will continue to be a headwind in the name markets that we've spoken to for the last two or three years as many markets have been burdened by oversupply. The Houston market, for instance, still is absorbing a lot of product, but we're seeing good traction though. And to your point on the Southeast Atlanta has got some headwinds around supply. Minneapolis, Florida, parts of New York, et cetera. But at the same time, demand is quite healthy. So we're very pleased with the amount of lease up that's going on. And we're very pleased with the acceleration and stabilization of our non same-store portfolio. Sure, Smedes. I mean, I guess I wouldn't highlight a particular occupancy or rate strategy for the back half of the year, given it's way too early to understand what the nature of the dynamics will be in the local submarkets with which we operate. I would highlight, clearly through 2020, we had the opportunity to anticipate lower move out volumes and lower inventory levels, which led to accelerating pricing, really starting in the second quarter and then accelerating through the second half of the year and now into the first quarter as well. So I think it's really been a rate focused strategy at this point given the low inventory levels, and that's been combined with lower promotional discounts, which we disclosed as well as lower marketing expense. As we move into the back half of 2021, if the picture you're painting is one where occupancy starts to fall significantly because of increased move out activity that will definitely change the dynamics in the local market. But I think one of the key components that we'd have to understand is whether the durability of consumer demand that we're seeing now persists because that is a really strong and powerful driver to revenue growth and overall move-in rates and accommodations to customers. So we're ultimately looking to maximize revenues, and we need to understand the nature of the move-ins and move outs. But clearly, it's a combination of both occupancy and rent and operating trends continue to be quite good as we start 2021. There's no question, Smedes, that's happening as we speak. When you look at the sector as a whole and then more specifically, what we're seeing in our own portfolio, there's been more adoption by newer generations of users, many of whom have never used self-storage before. So it's been a great way for them to use the product for the first time. We're seeing continued repeat customers as well. But generationally, there's been growing and deep adoption of the asset, and we're very encouraged by that. Well, Ki Bin to speak to just interaction with all shareholders, we have and will continue to be in active dialogue with our entire shareholder base. And we are continuing to drive the business on many different fronts. As we've talked about, we've got very unique and commanding strategies and capabilities. We are clearly focused on tapping into many of those, and we'll give you even more perspective on that in our Investor Day on May 3. This is not coming from one specific event or one and very distinct change in strategy. It's something that we're very focused on from an evolution and opportunity standpoint. And the management team and I are very focused on delivering strong shareholder returns through a variety of very commanding strategies that we've identified, some of which we've spoken about today and more that we'll speak about in May. So we'll continue to be as transparent as we can be, and we welcome and continue to have very active dialogue with our shareholders. Well, there is a difference because over the last two years, the Board has gone through a pretty strong level of refreshment. We've added seven new trustees. The Board has and will continue to be very focused on good governance. I'm very happy with the new trustees that have joined the Public Storage board of good strong collection of different backgrounds, different business perspectives. And collectively, we're working on many things together. And we'll continue to look to and seek very strong counsel from the Board as it evolves over time. As I mentioned, we've added seven new trustees. So prior to that, the average tenure of the Board was 11 to 12 years. Now, it's about four. So with that comes, new ideas, new perspectives, and I'm very pleased with the overall caliber and focus at the Board at large has on the Company's direction and all the strategic initiatives that we're focused on. Yes, sure, Ron. So obviously, we've talked about now for the last two to three years. We've been in a very strong delivery pattern of new assets. You go back to 2017, about $4 billion of new assets were added to the market nationally. It ticked up in 2018 and '19, which, at the moment, feels like a peak, that was about $5 billion of deliveries. In 2020, as expected, we saw that taper down by about 10% to 12%, where now we're at 2021, and we're thinking that there's likely another 10% to 15% reduction in deliveries. It's come to different markets. It's had, as I mentioned earlier, some pretty detrimental impacts where it hit certain submarkets with an inordinate amount of oversupply. We're encouraged, however, that it's cyclically starting to taper down, but it's still with us. And even at a level this year, that could be somewhere between $3.5 or so billion to maybe $3.75 billion of deliveries, it's -- that's still a fair amount of new assets being delivered in many markets. As I mentioned, it has provided an opportunity for us to go out and acquire assets on one front. On our development platform, it's also given us a pocket of opportunity that we haven't seen until the last year or two, where we're actually not seeing as much competitive bidding on land sites. And it's creating another different opportunity that we uniquely enjoy because we do have an industry-leading development platform and our development teams out betting a higher level of land sites as we speak. So we're hopeful that, that continued decline of deliveries play through to counterbalance that. The self-storage sector is doing quite well. And funding is out there, and developers are still going to be encouraged in some areas to continue to put new product into markets. So we're tracking it actively. And we'll see how it plays through in the coming quarters. Yes, I think I'd point you to, Shurgard has got vibrant disclosures, and they can give you much more color on what's going on in the European markets. But knowing and understanding what's been impacting their business. It has been similar in many ways to what we've seen here in the United States, which, again, is an elevated level of demand, new users coming into the product itself. And they, too, are seeing good business drivers, many similarities between what we're seeing here in the United States. Yes, Mike. Yes, it's definitely giving us a different lens on the industry. As I mentioned, currently, we've got the program up to 120 properties, a sizable percentage of the assets that are coming into our pipeline are development assets. So it's another view of how much of that activity is on the front lines in many markets. That's helpful. We've actually bought four assets thus far from the platform itself. So it can be many times a different relationship opportunity to identify and actually acquire assets. And it's always helpful to get outside feedback on the different operational methodologies that we use, the reaction we've got from owners, the way that they're looking at the performance of assets. So holistically, it's been very additive, and it's given us yet again a different perspective on the industry in many different ways. So we're encouraged about our opportunities going into this year. The pipeline continues to grow. It is not fully weighted, but it is heavily weighted around continued construction activity or development activity, but we're also finding a number of owners that have given us, say, one, two or three assets initially, and now they're giving us more. So it's another way for us to continue to build relationships, and we look forward to strengthening as relationships as we continue -- as the program continues to expand. Yes, Rick, you're right. It is accelerating. We've been very pleased with even more near term, the assets that we delivered in 2019 and '20 are seeing much stronger demand and lease-up activity than we anticipated. So that's definitely encouraging. And as I mentioned, even if we're looking to some of the acquisitions that have lower levels of existing occupancy, we're seeing -- once we put those assets into our platform, really strong and acceleration from customer activity, lease-up and then we're stabilizing the asset in a shorter period of time. But frankly, and Tom's talked about this in prior calls as well. It is a product type that does take time to season from a revenue stabilization standpoint. But the quicker we are able to fill assets up and start maturing that revenue stream, the better off we are and putting, as we speak. Todd, are you specifically asking about acquisition deals or... Yes. And maybe just to give you a little bit more color to, Todd, as I mentioned, the occupancy on average, speaks to the fact that many of these assets are relatively new. But overall, we've been very pleased with the quality level of the assets that we've been able to acquire over the last two years in particular, as I mentioned, many of these sellers are coming to market in a way that they have some level of reticence to stay in the sector, they're not necessarily achieving either pro forma revenues or occupancies, but the overall quality of the assets that we continue to see and acquire has been very good. Yes. Many of them are looking for cash. It could be because it's a single asset that they developed or maybe they've got other asset types that they need to put more capital into and the rebalancing a broader portfolio. So different circumstances, but many of these conversations have come over some period of time as we built relationships with these owners and through our deep connections even through the brokerage community, too. So yes, David, the e rental channel, as I mentioned, has been quite vibrant. Customers are really drawn to it. We think that the sustainability and the utility of that channel will definitely go beyond whatever pandemic environment, driving our whatever pandemic related activity may be leading customers to use it because, frankly, we designed it and tested it before the pandemic. It was built around a very efficient and time-sensitive customer who wanted to be much more oriented toward a self-service transaction. So we've really seen good adaptability and adoption by customers. It's now approximately 50% of our move-in process. And to your point, it will likely have different kinds of beneficial impacts as we continue to study our operational model and the way that it too provides a different level of service to customers. We'll talk more about this in our Investor Day in May, but we're definitely very encouraged by the success of that channel so far and look forward to continue to optimize it. Yes, Michael, I would step back and tell you that we are supporters of both platforms. We're very pleased with the individual performance of each of those businesses. There are a variety of reasons why we have and do maintain our investment level in them. And ultimately, and to what degree that changes over time, I wouldn't speak to directly, but we're very pleased with our investment and the success of each of those entities. It's -- like I mentioned, Michael, I would just leave it as it's been, and we feel a good investment on our behalf. And that's as much color as I can give at this point. It would be strategically as it would be in any different investment that we have, something that we could continue to evaluate. And as any shift in focus or commitment takes place, we would certainly bring that forth. But at this point, I don't have anything to share with you. Yes. It's beginning with singles, doubles and triples. But as I mentioned, as the business evolves, we're actually starting to see a number of owners that have anywhere from, say, 10, 20 or 30 or more assets. And they're giving us the opportunity to basically display and show the kind of performance that those assets are able to attain under our own platform. We've seen good traction. And I think over time, that's a different way for the program to continue to evolve. The business as a whole is very reference oriented. So that matters. And that's something that, over time, as we show and display the amount of performance of these assets are able to attain under our own platform, I think will be very additive, and we're actually starting to see some of that as we speak. Great. Thanks for the feedback. Appreciate it."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Christy. Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that aside from those of historical fact, all statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. The risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results as described in yesterday's earnings release and in our reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today November 5, 2020. We assume no obligation to update or revise any of the statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our earnings release, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thank you, Ryan, and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid quarter and now we'd like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Alua Askarbek of Bank of America.\nAlua Askarbek: Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. So just looking at the transactions market, it seems like there was a good amount of activity in 3Q and you guys alluded that to -- alluded to that during your 2Q call. But there was also a surprising amount of portfolio deals. Can you give us some color about what you're seeing in the market currently and any of the opportunities going forward? And then also any color on cap rates and the recent 30 portfolio -- property portfolio deal under contract right now?\nJoe Russell: Okay. Sure Alua. The acquisition market clearly has opened up. We've been tracking it through the pandemic and spoke about the early months where a number of sellers paused and were reticent to bring properties into the market. But we've clearly seen many more do the reverse where they've looked at this environment as an opportune time to bring assets into the acquisition arena. The thing -- a number of things are continuing to fuel that. One is it's still a very good time to do a trade. There's very low interest rates availability of capital, there's a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines that's been anxious to get into the storage sector. And frankly, the storage sector continues to perform well. So there's been a window of opportunity that we've seen increase over the last month particularly in the quarter that set us up well to have a very active 2020. The things that we continue to do are look for assets that are particularly well positioned from a location and quality standpoint that meet our requirements relative to location and opportunity to round out presence whether they're in our prime core markets or other markets that we want to add additional product to. The thing that was unusual and we're encouraged by as we also as you asked have a sizable single portfolio under contract that we think is a great set of assets that will be very good for us to bring into the portfolio. In total, it's 36 properties across 15 markets, 13 different states. 24 of the assets are open and operating, but they're relatively new. Average age is two to three years, I would call them Class A properties in very good locations, and we're very excited to bring them into the portfolio knowing that we're looking for opportunities to lease-up properties because we have very good customer demand. So they'll be easily integrated and we anticipate closing the first 24 of those assets by the end of the year. With that portfolio which we're also well poised to capture and look for some I think interesting growth and performance opportunities as there's 12 additional properties in various phases of development that will be completed through 2021. Again Class A well-located assets and we're really pleased by the ability to capture that total portfolio. Another interesting part of the portfolio, it was -- it is an off-market deal. So it speaks to the level of relationships that we continue to build across the storage sector. This relationship has evolved over a longer period of time and we continue to look for those opportunities where they may play through. Beyond the large portfolio that I just talked about, we're also seeing a number of smaller opportunities, which we've been seeing through 2020 and frankly what we saw even in 2019. And so with that we're poised to have a very strong acquisition year, this year. I would tell you from a cap rate standpoint with the amount of capital and the cost of that capital. We're really not seeing any easing of cap rates and we'll have to continue to monitor that. We clearly have good access to capital. Ourselves our own cost of capital continues to be very attractive. Tom can give you a little color later in the call about what we see relative to funding through either the preferred market or the debt markets. But we're clearly seeing some good opportunities to put that capital to work and we are continuing to look and hunt for additional acquisitions going forward.\nAlua Askarbek: Great. Thank you. And then just a little bit on rent increases to existing customers, I know in the beginning you guys noted that you're not going to be increasing rents as much as you did in prior years. But with -- I guess now cases are going up, but is there -- do you have an expectation when you're going to be able to get back to your historical bonds?\nTom Boyle: Yeah. Well, let me give you a little bit of context, this is Tom, around what we've been doing through the quarter on existing tenants and then what we think the outlook is. As we noted in the 10-Q we did resume and we discussed on the last call, we resumed existing tenant rate increases in the third quarter. We did so initially on a test basis and have since increased the volumes of those rental rate increases that we've sent out as we've grown more confident in the performance of our existing tenants. Since we didn't send any increases in the second quarter, we did have a clinical backlog of potential tenants to increase rent on in the third quarter, and we did send those catch up rental rate increases. As you noted those increases went out with a lower magnitude out of increase given overall mindfulness of our customer base in this crisis environment and as you highlighted still very dynamic, as well as state and local price regulations in many of our markets. We expect some of that to continue as we move through future quarters, certainly navigating this dynamic health care environment is unpredictable. We would expect that the existing tenant rate increases will continue to be a modest drag on in-place rent growth as we move forward. Stepping back, customer activity has been solid. And I just highlighted the existing tenant performance has been good. That's across the board. So that collections are better, payment patterns have accelerated, move-outs are down, length of stays are extending and new customer demand is solid. So we're seeing good trends there. And overall move-in activity has been good. But existing tenants will continue to be a modest drag going forward.\nAlua Askarbek: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Smedes Rose of Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. My question is really just about move out activity. Your portfolio is always kind of generally had an upward bias in occupancies, but you did note that move-outs have slowed. And I'm just wondering as things normalize, I mean, do you have a sense of how much occupancy might be higher based on the slowdown in move-out activity? I'm just trying to think about how your occupancy may change over the next few quarters if things maybe get back to normal? And what might you do to encourage some of those customers to stay I guess?\nJoe Russell: Sure. So I'll provide a little context around the move-out activity, because it has been one of the surprises as we move through this pandemic period. As we rewind to April and early May, we had move-in volumes and move-out volumes that were lower. But as we moved into May and June and then, into the third quarter move-in activity has increased, but move-out activity has remained muted. And dissecting the geographies, the customer tenures, the customer segments with which move-outs are lower, it is really across the board and clearly being driven by the current health care environment. And you highlighted and we discussed in the 10-Q and the MD&A, the likelihood at point that rate of deceleration will moderate and we talked about in previous calls the fact that in other recessionary environments, we've actually seen the opposite play through, with higher move-outs given consumer stress. We've not experienced at this time. And in fact it was pretty consistent, through the third quarter, to give you a sense each of the months in the third quarter, saw 12% to 15% decline, in move-out volumes. And as I mentioned, it's across geographies, across customers tenure bans and customer segments. So really broad-based decline in move-outs, paired with good collection activity and accepting the rental rate increases that we've sent to-date. So we've encouraged by the existing tenants. We do have our eyes on, what could playout, as we move in this dynamic environment. And we do watching that very closely. But through October, move-outs continue to be lower.\nTom Boyle: And yeah Smedes, so what's playing through right now that again, month-by-month we're seeing more sustained and consistent consumer behavior. Work from home is additive, meeting is another factor that we're seeing from a survey standpoint, relative to the customers coming to the portfolio. And what's driving that decision. You've got a number of markets, whether you label them as, urban or high-density and/or related to even concentration of tax that use the Bay Area for instance, where we see system-wide our highest level of occupancies. Thousands of employees, have been given allow to move, out of that market, either temporarily or potentially permanently. And are shifting and amplifying the need for self-storage, as either they're dealing with the health crisis and the flexibility that they've got to work at either at home or completely different localization, seeing similar impacts right, again in the heart of New York, set of assets. So that's additive. The housing market is very strong right now. That's always a traditional and very good driver for our business. But housing sales were up over 20%, as we speak, on a year-over-year basis. And it's a driver. So you've got layers of different consumer patterns that are playing through, that are pointing to more sustained and prolonged need for storage space. So we don't know when and to what degree, it will shift back to a \"normal environment\", but the amount of sustained activity that we're seeing now into the eight month of this health crisis continues to be quite good.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. That's great color. And then, I'm just wondering, maybe broadly, you've talked before just kind of what you're seeing on the supply outlook overall? Or if you're seeing any kind of, changes on the increment versus your last update on, just overall nationwide supply dollars in development, that you typically talked about?\nJoe Russell: Yeah, not -- I wouldn't say, anything to point to that is materially different. We do think that 2020 will plus or minus calc out to be about a $4-or-so billion set of deliveries across all of our markets here in the United States. The anticipated shift down into deliveries in 2021 was something in the range of 15-or-so percent. So we could still see that, degradation and deliveries. But frankly it's still high. And with the continued interest from an investor base, to get into the self-storage sector and performance that the product type itself continues to have even in this challenging environment. As mentioned earlier, there is still a fair amount of capital that wants to get into the space, whether it's through acquisitions or even development. So, it's to something that we're keeping a close eye on but it really hasn't changed that much from our prior outlook.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Okay. Thank you guys.\nJoe Russell: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Spenser Allaway of Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. Can you guys provide a bit more color on what drove the material deceleration of marketing spend in the quarter? And where you see this trending for the balance of the year?\nJoe Russell: Sure. So, stepping back on marketing spend that's been a tool that we've utilized along with promotional discounts and move-in rates over the past several years and what was a tough customer acquisition environment. Given the impact of new supply in many of our markets. And so we did increase our spend over the last several years and have liked the returns that we've seen utilizing advertising spend and that really is across paid surge it social media we use television in the second quarter kind of a broad-based advertising approach to attract new customers. We do have real advantages in using advertising as a tool given our brand name and presence online. And so we like that too and we will continue to use it as we navigate this dynamic environment. In the second quarter, given lower top of funnel demand we were more aggressive on marketing spend. And as top of funnel demand improved as we moved into the third quarter we removed some of that advertising support. But as you note our advertising spend was up about 8% or 9% in the quarter and we will continue to use that tool as we play through what's a dynamic environment but we did not need the level of support we saw in the second quarter given improved top of funnel trends.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. And then maybe just lastly, we recently saw a large storage transaction with Blackstone acquiring the simply portfolio. Was this a deal you guys looked at? And can you comment on whether the portfolio would have been of interest to you?\nJoe Russell: So, we're active in all markets and have the opportunity to look at most deals. So I'll comment on is we're highly entrenched in most if not all the deals that are happening in any variety of different types of transactions large and small. And we are continuing to track and see the level of activity. I'm not really going to comment on our view and perception of that particular portfolio but we're highly entrenched and our acquisition team continues to be incredibly engaged whether they're marketed deals as that particular one was or deals that are not marketed which points to the portfolio I talked about earlier.\nTom Boyle: Yes. Maybe I like that transaction is emblematic of what Joe highlighted earlier around institutional capital looking to invest in self-stored because of its performance through cycles. And so it's interesting to see another institutional player put a significant amount of capital into the sector.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: Hi thanks. Tom helpful color on some of the move-out trends. Can you comment on move-in trends throughout the quarter and through October what the cadence was like? And then the strength in move-in rates was rather significant. They were rates were higher in the quarter than they've been in several years. Did you push move-in rates above market during the quarter just given where your occupancy is? Or was that increase sort of more commensurate with the market rent growth in your view?\nTom Boyle: Sure Todd. So, kind of stepping back on the move-in trends like I did with move-out trends. We did see move in activity kind of surge in March we saw it really slow down in April. We moved into a third phase that we call internally kind of recovery in May and June. And then really since July first seen an improvement in top of funnel demand pair that with reduced move-out activity as I just highlighted means that occupancy has moved higher in really all of our markets across the country. And that improved occupancy certainly reduced the inventory levels that we had. And that really persisted through the quarter. We finished the second quarter up about 50 basis points in occupancy. We finished the third quarter up 200 basis points proceeding here. We finished October up 230 basis points in occupancy and so customer trends being move-in and move-out have been good and with lower inventory, that's allowed us to achieve higher move-in rates. Our move-in rates were up 8.2% in the quarter, in October, to give you a sense, the strength of top of funnel and the move-out trends have continued, which has led move-in volumes to be up about 1% in October and move-in rates, up about 10%. So, the trends have continued and obviously seeing the benefit of demand for storage, both from our existing tenants who want to continue to use storage in this environment as Joe mentioned for many reasons, as well as new customers seeking new space.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And obviously, there's just a lot of I guess sort of ins and outs, when you think about demand. But Joe, I'm curious in a market like New York, you mentioned San Francisco, where a lot of workers have flexibility to work from home and move out of some of these high-cost markets, which the data and headlines suggest is happening. Why is that out migration activity translating into strong demand in those markets? And do you expect that to moderate or maybe unwind, I guess to some extent over time? Is that a risk in your view?\nJoe Russell: Well, it's a spectrum of different drivers, Todd. So, part of the flexibility for instance if you look at the Bay Area that many tech workers have been given is, when a big employer many of whom you -- anyone of us can point to gives signals and/or time frames where they may not be pulling their employees back, not for one or two months, for six months to a year, coupled with giving them full flexibility to be somewhere else. That could vary. So, some employees will still come back. There's no question about that, but it may be for several months or several quarters depending again on the unknown timing of the pandemic itself. And then to what degree these become permanent relocations and then some commensurate impact on the need to keep goods or whatever they're keeping it in one of our units in that particular market will be a question and can predict it, don't know. Fortunately, again, if you look at the Bay Area for instance, we have an opportunity to stand out there because we've got a very well-placed portfolio. It's very difficult to add new supply there. So, the different need for that space in that market long term is quite high. There's no question about it. And it's difficult to build there. So, it's not a market by any means that we\u2019re concerned about from an oversupply standpoint et cetera. This has just been a very unusual environment where this demand has been so elevated where I mentioned we've got system high occupancies of 97%, 98% this time a year. I mean, we have never seen that before. So, it's to be determined. It's hard to predict. And the flexibility and the way in which employees, whether they're tech-oriented or other traditional office users change over time is to be determined. But as Tom mentioned, we're seeing -- it's just in these urban or more dense markets we're seeing healthy demand across the entire system. We frankly don't have a market that's down in occupancy. It continues to percolate our lease-up of our newly built and required assets is very strong. And consumer demand continues to be very, very active, particularly for this time a year.\nTom Boyle: Yes. And Todd, maybe just to provide a couple of other market anecdotes for you. Markets like Charlotte for instance, we've seen very good incoming demand in a market that had been suffering from new supply over the last several years. We've seen good new customer demand, improving occupancies, improving rates. Even within the San Francisco Bay Area, while you can clearly make a case for a very urban peninsula and the city of San Francisco, we've seen strength in our lease-ups in San Jose for instance and a strong housing market there. So, there's -- we have a well placed portfolio around the country and we're seeing good demand in both markets that may see outflow as well as those that are seeing inflow.\nTodd Thomas: Right. That's interesting. Is the demand for larger units -- are you seeing that as individuals are maybe looking to rent larger spaces for their apartments or homes for a sort of period of time.\nTom Boyle: Actually it is opposite which is strength year-over-year has actually been in smaller spaces versus larger spaces believe it or not.\nJoe Russell: Yes. So theoretically you could argue that again if you just think of the demand that's tied to work from home it's just not somebody holistically leaving an entire house or an apartment, it may also be a very healthy level of demand tied to just needing that extra closet or that extra bedroom or that area is not only because it's a work from home maybe family members come back or whatever. And there are layers and layers of demand factors that we're tracking. But as we've said, it's solid demand.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim of Truist\nKi Bin Kim: Good morning out there. Just going back to some of the acquisitions you made in the quarter and fourth quarter, can you just provide some more color or parameters around yields, at least for your stabilized portion?\nJoe Russell: Ki Bin, I'm not going to give you specifics about the actual yield. I would tell you it's similar to ranges that we've looked for over time which on a stabilized basis would be 5% to 6% plus on a cash-on-cash yield or north of that. The thing that I didn\u2019t mentioned about the portfolio that we'll be closing this quarter is the occupancies about 35%. We look at that as a very good thing relative to again the opportunity to lease-up space based on the demand factors that we're seeing, the great locations that these assets are tied to and the quality of the assets. So it's a very good opportunity for us to stabilize those assets to put our own marketing and operational tactics and strategies into them. And we feel like we'll have very good returns once we get the assets stabilized. As you well know that can take anywhere from three to four years on a normalized basis, not only once you get to stabilized occupants at more stabilized revenue and pricing metrics. So we'll continue to look for again the stabilization of those assets. But as I mentioned, very high quality, good solid assets and adds in many ways you could consider it almost like a near-term or more recently delivered developments on our part. So again very good opportunity to drive good value from them.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thanks. And when I look at your same-store revenue, it improved slightly to negative 2.7% from minus 3% last quarter. Obviously, the underlying drivers are pointing towards a much better place, right where fee-based rates are up 8%, better occupancy and things like that. So I was wondering if you could just provide some more details behind the transitory nature of the underlying drivers and how that might benefit same-store revenue going forward, in particular things like existing customer rate increases. I'm not sure how much normally it contributes whereas in 3Q it didn't? And going forward how do we expect that to normalize? Just to understand that magnitude a little better?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Ki Bin, it's Tom. I think we spent some time talking last quarter around the cumulative impact of the pandemic, which was likely to continue to impact revenue growth trends as we move forward and we did see that into the third quarter. Operating metrics have removed more quickly than financial metrics and we \u2013 let's pick a part of the occupancy and rate equation. I commented earlier around how occupancy trends have improved with a combination of better top of funnel activity as well as lower move-out volumes. And so that's improved occupancy trends. In many of our markets we have reached occupancies that are frictional, meaning we are at 97%, 98% occupancy in the middle of the month, which is friction in our industry. So it's a matter of what play through with rates in some of those markets as we move forward. As you just highlighted and we spoke about earlier, existing tenant rate increases are not going to be a contributing factor to improving rent trends given the magnitude of the increases are likely to be lower as we move forward through the fourth quarter. That said, just looking at in-place rents from June 30 \u2013 at June 30 in-place rents were down 3.1% and we finished the quarter September 30, down 1.8%. And with existing tenants not contributing to that improvement that negative impact was more than offset by improved customer activity and the reduction of rent roll down. If you look at the third quarter of 2019, rent roll down was about 15%, and as we moved into the third quarter of 2020 that narrowed down to about 4%. So improved rent roll down more than offsetting the degradation from existing tenant rate increase drag in the quarter. Looking forward, aggregate contract rents recovered. So occupancy and rent combined to positive 20 basis points at September 30 and we've continued to see good customer trends through October so better rental income trends. Fees which have been a negative contributor to revenue growth in both the second and third quarters, we anticipate to continue to do so as we move forward and that's really driven by customers paying their rent, which is a great thing, but is a degradation in revenue and the growth. So I think, we spoke a little bit about that on the last call Ki Bin, but we continue to see that and we'd anticipate that through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Next?\nOperator: Your next question is Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on the balance sheet, Tom. You've got like $1.2 billion preferred that, I guess, are callable throughout 2021. I'm just sort of, curious on your thoughts about replacing them with new preferred. I think your last deal was sub 4%. And how do you, sort of, weigh that maybe against kind of putting some more debt on the balance sheet just given how lowly leveraged you are? And where do you think the comparable say 30-year kind of debt issuance would be for you today versus a preferred offering?\nTom Boyle: So, sure. So Steve, you highlighted what is a good opportunity in 2021, which is another year of potential preferred refinancing activity be it with debt or preferred. Looking at our preferred balance, we like having around a $4 billion preferred balance in the capital stack. We think it's good for the business through cycles. And the optionality both to have perpetual capital in the capital stack, but at the same time if interest rates decrease over time the ability to call them like we did this year, and you're highlighting the opportunity for next year. So throughout this year, we've redeemed about $1.2 billion of preferred. We haven't issued quite that much yet and we were active in the bond market in Europe in January. Financing markets, as Joe highlighted earlier are as attractive as they have ever been. Preferreds are sub-4% for us today, which is a record low, which presents that opportunity and we have great access to debt capital too. As we said in previous settings we'll look to utilize both preferreds and debt for incremental financing activity as we move through 2021 for both preferred refinancing as well as for potential acquisition opportunities and development which clearly, as Joe highlighted earlier is accelerating as we move through the fourth quarter. So good access to capital and we'll utilize both and we hope that we have the opportunity to refinance in 2021 like we did in 2020 and 2019.\nSteve Sakwa: So just do you have a sense for where like a 30-year bond offering, if you wanted to go longer out on the, sort of, curve how that would compare to a pref offering?\nTom Boyle: A 30-year bond is going to be cheaper. A 10-year bond is going to be even cheaper than that 5-year bond even cheaper than that. So we've got lots of tools in the toolkit.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then just on the acquisition front you guys from time to time have obviously, looked outside the U.S. and spent some time in Australia. Joe, I'm just curious, sort of, where your head is today about looking for international opportunities outside of the domestic opportunities.\nJoe Russell: Yes, Steve we're going to continue to look both domestic and internationally. So we have clearly, the opportunity from a knowledge base. We've learned a lot through our involvement and success through the Shurgard investment. And we feel over time that we can continue to grow both here domestically and internationally. It's always going to be subject to different types of opportunities and the particular market that may be for whatever set of reasons well-timed from an attractive point to either enter or find appropriate opportunities. So we're going to continue to assess opportunities both here domestically and internationally.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey. Thanks for the time. The first one is, just circling back on the demand question. Just trying to understand obviously looking at the analysis, just looking for sort of more thematic in terms of -- is there anything that stands out in terms of the demand driver in this period, whether it be college students, small businesses, work from home, or just people leaving the city. And the reason I ask that is, one of the questions we get a lot is, presumably, once the vaccine is here and it normalizes, really trying to get at which drivers are going to stay and pick around and which drivers were really just sort of a one timer? And maybe what new demand drivers we may not be thinking about again once we normalize? Thanks.\nJoe Russell: Yes. Ron, that's certainly something that we're going to continue to track, as these different demand factors play through. It's hard to predict the sustainability or the likelihood that some of them are here permanently or they\u2019re going to shift up and down. I already talked a little bit about the work-from-home demand factor. That's clearly new at this level of magnitude. And whether or not that sustains from a demand stat standpoint after the pandemic settles down or not, is to be determined. Many companies are looking at work-from-home platforms as different and new way of enhancing productivity and employee satisfaction. But the theoretical argument against that is there may be the opposite going through too. So it's a little bit hard to predict. And at the moment we're just going to continue to survey and understand and see these drivers. The interesting thing is they're all additive and they're continuing to drive as we've talked about, very optimized performance. We'll continue to learn from this and it's brought frankly a healthy and new set of customers into the storage sector, never used the product before. So I think, long term, that's a good thing. The adoption of the product continues to grow statistically. And it once again is proving that the product is highly resilient, it's highly adaptable and consumers like it. The things that we continue to do also are, find ways of making the customer interaction that much more effective, making it a much more easy decision and transaction. So many of the tools that we've been putting into our technological channels and options for customers are serving us well, about 40-plus percent of our move-in volume in the third quarter came from our e-rental platform that frankly was in test mode before the pandemic came about, but statistically we moved in 115,000 customers directly through that a channel and that transaction takes about five minutes and consumers love it. And that's not just because of the pandemic. It's just a great and easy way to capture a storage unit. So we've got different things that we're also able to test in a very challenging environment like this, that are frankly giving us even new and different tools that could lead to different levels of dealing with customers in a very different way than we were doing before that again are very aligned with their ability to think even more positively about needing a storage facility, because it's that much used or easier to capture and is that much more cost effective.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then my second question was, just digging in deeper a little bit into acquisition. Just trying to get sort of harder numbers and quantifying it. Clearly, at the cost of capital you talked about sort of the pipeline deals that have identified of at least $700 million. The question is, is there -- just for PSA, when you sort of take a step back and look at your team. Is there $500 million $1 billion maybe even more of acquisition opportunities that are for the company a year? Or just trying to understand what's the mitigating factor? Is there not enough sellers? Is it too competitive, but the company decided tomorrow to take acquisitions up, what would be the mitigating factor to getting to a number like that?\nJoe Russell: Well, I wouldn't say as simple as just saying we turned on and switch and said, let's just go buy whatever we can get our hands on. We have very disciplined analytics that we use that give us the right guidepost to say these are the relative. And I would say better timed opportunities to deploy capital. This is, at the moment, a good window to do that. Our cost of capital, as Tom reiterated, is very, very good. Our access to capital is very good. We know most of the markets that we operate in much better than others do. So we have different ways for us to step back and understand the relative ultimate capital allocation, performance and ability to drive value through not only our acquisition environment but our development and redevelopment activities. So, we have all those tools. We continue to analyze them. And we've got a balance sheet that can clearly accommodate multiple factors of the volume that we were even talking about this quarter. So, I don't see that as anyway a limiter, and we're going to continue to evaluate the timing and the quality and the fit of any particular acquisition, whether it's one-off, whether it's a medium-sized portfolio or a sizable one.\nRonald Kamdem: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: Hey. Good morning. This is an extension of Steve's earlier question. But what are you and the Board believe is the appropriate amount of leverage? All four legacy self-storage REIT share prices are up low-double-digits year-to-date on a total return basis. Yet balance sheets range from three turns of leverage for PSA including preferreds to more than six turns at peers. So during 100-year pandemic and recession when balance sheets should have mattered most -- it hasn't really benefited PSA. I'm just curious if views towards leverage have changed at all over the past eight months?\nJoe Russell: Yeah. What I would say is that our perspective around leverage is long-term held belief that we should have a conservative balance sheet that allows us to invest through cycles. That allowed us access to capital throughout this year as you highlighted. And I think this year has been somewhat unique. And in fact that we're in a deep recession and financing markets have been attractive throughout. I think we've also highlighted that we have capacity to utilize that balance sheet in times like this to fund acquisitions, and we're doing that in the second half of this year. So we definitely have some capacity from here to add incremental leverage. And we're doing that as we move forward. In terms of the appropriate amount of leverage, we think a conservative long-term view, and a single A rating is an appropriate place for a REIT of our size scale and capability.\nJonathan Hughes: So earlier you said you like having $4 billion of preferreds in the cap stack. I mean how do you over the exact number, why not more? I guess you said, you alluded to you can use more preferreds to go consolidate share, but are you talking upwards of another turn? I think leverage was $4 billion turns back in 2007, so do you have any range we could use.\nJoe Russell: So yes, Jon, the range is highlighted $4 billion. I didn't mean that that would be the maximum. I meant it more that I liked having $4 billion. So I would consider that. And why did I say $4 billion? It's because about the amount we have currently outstanding. Meaning I like the amount we have outstanding and over time would anticipate that to grow, and would anticipate our debt balance to grow as the company continues to grow and our EBITDA grows and the business grows.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay. I just want to make sure it wasn't like arbitrary. You like the number four or something like that. And then one more -- I figure it as much. I just -- the four stuck up to me. What about funding acquisitions, on a leverage-neutral basis by raising common equity. I realize that hasn't been done in, I think decade. But plenty of other large REITs still raise common equity to grow on a leverage-neutral basis, and given your trading to low four implied cap and above NAV, that would actually be accretive to NAV. Is that a possibility?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Common equity is in the toolkit and it's something that we could utilize as you highlight. At the same time we do have capability to finance with the debt in preferred markets and debt and preferred is cheaper than common equity. So we have the ability to do that over time. But it's certainly in the toolkit. The company over time has used it more for strategic opportunities. But as the company grows, it's certainly an option to finance, as well as debt and preferred NAV so it's in the toolkit. But certainly recently, we've been utilizing debt and preferred because we have capacity to do so.\nJonathan Hughes: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi good morning. Just hoping if you could talk a little bit about move up, but from a different perspective, I believe you mentioned earlier in the call that you typically see move-out increase during a normal \"recession\". So could you give us help again, what that has been historically through your many cycles? And just to think about the downside of if some of these benefits that are maybe onetime in nature to pass at some point actually?\nJoe Russell: Sure. And obviously we don't know that when we may find ourselves in a position where move-outs would accelerate. We do think that the current trends are impacted by the healthcare crisis that we're navigating through. In terms of prior crisis, if you look back at the financial crisis, we saw move-outs for several quarters up in the mid-single digits. And so -- that's an example. But what we've learned certainly through this experience is that, everyone is unique. And so, our ability to point to that is, what will happen when the pandemic eases, I think is limited and we're going to be certainly watching very closely in terms of what consumer activities will be like as we move through future quarters. And I would say it's unpredictable. And it's unpredictable because of the healthcare nature of this crisis, as well as the government activities to reduce the spread of the virus. So it's unpredictable past recessions would point to something like mid-single digits increase. Will this time be like last time? We don't know. \nJuan Sanabria: Fair enough. And just on the length of stay that you brought up as well. Where are we at today in your portfolio? And kind of how has that trended? And at what point, if at all you cross kind of a magic number where you maybe sneaking one more rate increase, assuming kind of the median length of stay? \nJoe Russell: Sure. So in terms of the benefit of length of state, you highlighted it which is okay, we get to see those longer-term tenants stay with us. We don't have to replace them and we have the opportunity to increase their rent over time. And that's already been playing out as we move through 2019 and into 2020. The length of stays we\u2019re extending last year and we started to get the beneficial impact of sending more rental rate increases last year. And as we moved into the second half of this year with the decreased move-outs more customers have been eligible for rental rate increases this year. And if this continues would anticipate that in the beginning of next year as well. And that's been somewhat of an offset to the fact that as I highlighted earlier, we've been sending lower magnitude rental rate increases. But I would say that's been on the margin at this point. And if the trend continues, it will accelerate.\nJuan Sanabria: So what is the average or medium length of stay? \nJoe Russell: It's about 10 months. \nJuan Sanabria: Great. And just on my super quick one. Did you say that the average occupancy was 35% for the portfolio you're acquiring that\u2019s, the one that's not in development? Is that\u2026\nJoe Russell: There's 24 -- yes there's 24 properties that are operating that are average two to three years at most an age. So they are in early phases of lease-up. So that portion of the 36 property portfolio is about 35% occupied. And there are 12 properties that are under construction that will be delivered in 2021 quarter-by-quarter. So the lease-up up opportunity on the existing 24 is very good.\nJuan Sanabria: Yes. But not necessarily yielding anything today like from an NOI perspective?\nJoe Russell : No. I mean, they've got to cure and stabilized levels of performance. But we're very confident as I mentioned relative to the quality of the location the Class A buildings and we're very confident across the markets that they are positioned and that we'll do quite well with them.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is Rick Skidmore of Goldman Sachs.\nRick Skidmore : Good morning, Joe and Tom. Just a really quick one. Operations declined from the second to the third quarter, which is kind of atypical for the seasonal. What was happening? Is that just lower personnel cost? And then as you look forward on that line, do you expect lower move-outs to help to bring that line down over time? Or do we -- should we expect kind of the normal seasonal pattern?\nJoe Russell: Yeah, Rick. We're definitely looking for and seeing opportunity from an optimization standpoint to find ways of moderating the pressure tied to payroll as a whole whether it's property and/or supervisory. So you saw some of that in the quarter. We are looking for and finding ways of optimizing operations on a number of fronts. Utilities also in the quarter were down nicely. That's tied to some intentional investments that we've made from an LED standpoint. So we've now got our entire 2,600-or-so portfolio on exterior LED lights, and we transitioned maybe about a third so far the portfolio from an interior standpoint to LED. So we're seeing nice savings relative to the utility cost. Again, utilities were down a little over 9% in the quarter. Repairs and maintenance were down. That can vary quarter-to-quarter depending on some of the repairs necessary across the portfolio, but we saw a good metric there. And overall, we continue to look for ways of optimizing costs. Tom's have been focused on looking at new and different ways of optimizing our marketing spend too. So, although, it was up -- it wasn't up as much as it's been in the last few quarters. So, again, we're looking for different ways of optimizing that spend too.\nRick Skidmore : Thanks, Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller: Yeah. Hi. Most questions have been answered, but can you just give us a quick update on third-party management and kind of how that's been trending?\nJoe Russell: Sure, Mike. So the program as a whole we've got 113 properties in the program we added seven in the quarter. The activity from a backlog standpoint and delivery standpoint is in some ways matching the kind of activity we're seeing on our own direct acquisition front. So we're seeing good percolation of owners that are interested in coming into the system. And we are finding high-quality assets and the program continues to build. The dominant factor as it has been since we came into the business is tied to new deliveries. So we've got a healthy growing pipeline of new assets that will also be coming into the portfolio over the next few quarters.\nMike Mueller: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Peterson of Jefferies.\nJon Petersen : Thanks. Sorry for if you had said this first. The portfolio you guys are buying is that from your third-party management business? And how are they currently branded?\nJoe Russell: Okay. They have their own.\nJon Petersen: Okay. And then I guess how should we think about the third-party management business in terms of an acquisition takeout kind of pipeline for you guys going forward?\nJoe Russell: I think it's a natural add junk to that business and we've had a handful of situations that have percolated on that front. We'll see how it plays over time. But it's overall a great opportunity to build relationships with owners whether they're one-off owners, they only own one or two assets or other owners that have multiple assets in multiple markets. So it's been and will continue to be a healthy way of broadening our tie to a different owner pool out there. So, we'll continue to look for and develop those kinds of relationships too, as the program builds. But the portfolio, the large portfolio that we're closing on this quarter is not in our platform.\nJon Petersen: Okay. Got it. All right. That's it. Thanks.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: You have a follow-up from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. I just wanted to circle back on late fees, and just trying to understand how much of the drop was sort of an inability to charge customers in light of the pandemic? How much of it is more auto pay and less cash pay, and therefore fees are naturally down how much of it is maybe customers that were normally paying those have left the portfolio? I'm just trying to kind of understand, what's driving that.\nJoe Russell: Yeah, Steve. So I'll provide a little bit more color around customer collections in aggregate, because that is the primary reason why fees are down. And so, as we look at rent collections, really starting in the second quarter and persisting through the third have been very solid. And some of the things you highlighted are contributing i.e. AutoPay is at a modestly higher percentage. But even away from AutoPay tenants customer payment patterns have accelerated and we're charging less in terms of fees. And so obviously, if you don't charge it, you're not going to collect it. Our receivable to be down around 30% through the quarter and that's persisted through the delinquency period for tenants meaning that receivables down about 30%. We wrote off about 30% less rent. We have about 30% fewer auctions in the quarter. So overall, customer health and payment patterns have improved, and that has led to lower fees, primarily from late fees which are charged for customers not paying their rent within a grace period, but also contributed from longer into the delinquency period lean fees and lean sale fees, but primarily driven by the grace period ending late fee in the first month of customers delinquency.\nSteve Sakwa: So would you look at this as a bigger structural change? Or you look at this as just, it's kind of a point in time more cyclical? Or do you expect us to stay down more permanently?\nJoe Russell: I think early on in the pandemic, we thought that it may have been more transitory and there was customer being supported by government stimulus certainly that was the case through April and unemployment benefits and the like. And some of that has been put in the rearview mirror, the trends have continued. It's something we're watching very closely month-over-month. I would tell you that, trends continued through October and payment patterns have been very good through the early part of November as well. So it feels like at least, for the foreseeable future or near to medium term, we're anticipating that will be the case, but we're watching it very closely.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nJoe Russell: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now hand the call back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Christy, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Yeah. Well, let me give you a little bit of context, this is Tom, around what we've been doing through the quarter on existing tenants and then what we think the outlook is. As we noted in the 10-Q we did resume and we discussed on the last call, we resumed existing tenant rate increases in the third quarter. We did so initially on a test basis and have since increased the volumes of those rental rate increases that we've sent out as we've grown more confident in the performance of our existing tenants. Since we didn't send any increases in the second quarter, we did have a clinical backlog of potential tenants to increase rent on in the third quarter, and we did send those catch up rental rate increases. As you noted those increases went out with a lower magnitude out of increase given overall mindfulness of our customer base in this crisis environment and as you highlighted still very dynamic, as well as state and local price regulations in many of our markets. We expect some of that to continue as we move through future quarters, certainly navigating this dynamic health care environment is unpredictable. We would expect that the existing tenant rate increases will continue to be a modest drag on in-place rent growth as we move forward. Stepping back, customer activity has been solid. And I just highlighted the existing tenant performance has been good. That's across the board. So that collections are better, payment patterns have accelerated, move-outs are down, length of stays are extending and new customer demand is solid. So we're seeing good trends there. And overall move-in activity has been good. But existing tenants will continue to be a modest drag going forward. And yeah Smedes, so what's playing through right now that again, month-by-month we're seeing more sustained and consistent consumer behavior. Work from home is additive, meeting is another factor that we're seeing from a survey standpoint, relative to the customers coming to the portfolio. And what's driving that decision. You've got a number of markets, whether you label them as, urban or high-density and/or related to even concentration of tax that use the Bay Area for instance, where we see system-wide our highest level of occupancies. Thousands of employees, have been given allow to move, out of that market, either temporarily or potentially permanently. And are shifting and amplifying the need for self-storage, as either they're dealing with the health crisis and the flexibility that they've got to work at either at home or completely different localization, seeing similar impacts right, again in the heart of New York, set of assets. So that's additive. The housing market is very strong right now. That's always a traditional and very good driver for our business. But housing sales were up over 20%, as we speak, on a year-over-year basis. And it's a driver. So you've got layers of different consumer patterns that are playing through, that are pointing to more sustained and prolonged need for storage space. So we don't know when and to what degree, it will shift back to a \"normal environment\", but the amount of sustained activity that we're seeing now into the eight month of this health crisis continues to be quite good. Yes. Maybe I like that transaction is emblematic of what Joe highlighted earlier around institutional capital looking to invest in self-stored because of its performance through cycles. And so it's interesting to see another institutional player put a significant amount of capital into the sector. Sure Todd. So, kind of stepping back on the move-in trends like I did with move-out trends. We did see move in activity kind of surge in March we saw it really slow down in April. We moved into a third phase that we call internally kind of recovery in May and June. And then really since July first seen an improvement in top of funnel demand pair that with reduced move-out activity as I just highlighted means that occupancy has moved higher in really all of our markets across the country. And that improved occupancy certainly reduced the inventory levels that we had. And that really persisted through the quarter. We finished the second quarter up about 50 basis points in occupancy. We finished the third quarter up 200 basis points proceeding here. We finished October up 230 basis points in occupancy and so customer trends being move-in and move-out have been good and with lower inventory, that's allowed us to achieve higher move-in rates. Our move-in rates were up 8.2% in the quarter, in October, to give you a sense, the strength of top of funnel and the move-out trends have continued, which has led move-in volumes to be up about 1% in October and move-in rates, up about 10%. So, the trends have continued and obviously seeing the benefit of demand for storage, both from our existing tenants who want to continue to use storage in this environment as Joe mentioned for many reasons, as well as new customers seeking new space. Yes. And Todd, maybe just to provide a couple of other market anecdotes for you. Markets like Charlotte for instance, we've seen very good incoming demand in a market that had been suffering from new supply over the last several years. We've seen good new customer demand, improving occupancies, improving rates. Even within the San Francisco Bay Area, while you can clearly make a case for a very urban peninsula and the city of San Francisco, we've seen strength in our lease-ups in San Jose for instance and a strong housing market there. So, there's -- we have a well placed portfolio around the country and we're seeing good demand in both markets that may see outflow as well as those that are seeing inflow. Actually it is opposite which is strength year-over-year has actually been in smaller spaces versus larger spaces believe it or not. Sure. Ki Bin, it's Tom. I think we spent some time talking last quarter around the cumulative impact of the pandemic, which was likely to continue to impact revenue growth trends as we move forward and we did see that into the third quarter. Operating metrics have removed more quickly than financial metrics and we \u2013 let's pick a part of the occupancy and rate equation. I commented earlier around how occupancy trends have improved with a combination of better top of funnel activity as well as lower move-out volumes. And so that's improved occupancy trends. In many of our markets we have reached occupancies that are frictional, meaning we are at 97%, 98% occupancy in the middle of the month, which is friction in our industry. So it's a matter of what play through with rates in some of those markets as we move forward. As you just highlighted and we spoke about earlier, existing tenant rate increases are not going to be a contributing factor to improving rent trends given the magnitude of the increases are likely to be lower as we move forward through the fourth quarter. That said, just looking at in-place rents from June 30 \u2013 at June 30 in-place rents were down 3.1% and we finished the quarter September 30, down 1.8%. And with existing tenants not contributing to that improvement that negative impact was more than offset by improved customer activity and the reduction of rent roll down. If you look at the third quarter of 2019, rent roll down was about 15%, and as we moved into the third quarter of 2020 that narrowed down to about 4%. So improved rent roll down more than offsetting the degradation from existing tenant rate increase drag in the quarter. Looking forward, aggregate contract rents recovered. So occupancy and rent combined to positive 20 basis points at September 30 and we've continued to see good customer trends through October so better rental income trends. Fees which have been a negative contributor to revenue growth in both the second and third quarters, we anticipate to continue to do so as we move forward and that's really driven by customers paying their rent, which is a great thing, but is a degradation in revenue and the growth. So I think, we spoke a little bit about that on the last call Ki Bin, but we continue to see that and we'd anticipate that through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year. Next? So, sure. So Steve, you highlighted what is a good opportunity in 2021, which is another year of potential preferred refinancing activity be it with debt or preferred. Looking at our preferred balance, we like having around a $4 billion preferred balance in the capital stack. We think it's good for the business through cycles. And the optionality both to have perpetual capital in the capital stack, but at the same time if interest rates decrease over time the ability to call them like we did this year, and you're highlighting the opportunity for next year. So throughout this year, we've redeemed about $1.2 billion of preferred. We haven't issued quite that much yet and we were active in the bond market in Europe in January. Financing markets, as Joe highlighted earlier are as attractive as they have ever been. Preferreds are sub-4% for us today, which is a record low, which presents that opportunity and we have great access to debt capital too. As we said in previous settings we'll look to utilize both preferreds and debt for incremental financing activity as we move through 2021 for both preferred refinancing as well as for potential acquisition opportunities and development which clearly, as Joe highlighted earlier is accelerating as we move through the fourth quarter. So good access to capital and we'll utilize both and we hope that we have the opportunity to refinance in 2021 like we did in 2020 and 2019. A 30-year bond is going to be cheaper. A 10-year bond is going to be even cheaper than that 5-year bond even cheaper than that. So we've got lots of tools in the toolkit. Thank you. Sure. Common equity is in the toolkit and it's something that we could utilize as you highlight. At the same time we do have capability to finance with the debt in preferred markets and debt and preferred is cheaper than common equity. So we have the ability to do that over time. But it's certainly in the toolkit. The company over time has used it more for strategic opportunities. But as the company grows, it's certainly an option to finance, as well as debt and preferred NAV so it's in the toolkit. But certainly recently, we've been utilizing debt and preferred because we have capacity to do so."

            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid quarter and now we'd like to open the call for questions. Okay. Sure Alua. The acquisition market clearly has opened up. We've been tracking it through the pandemic and spoke about the early months where a number of sellers paused and were reticent to bring properties into the market. But we've clearly seen many more do the reverse where they've looked at this environment as an opportune time to bring assets into the acquisition arena. The thing -- a number of things are continuing to fuel that. One is it's still a very good time to do a trade. There's very low interest rates availability of capital, there's a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines that's been anxious to get into the storage sector. And frankly, the storage sector continues to perform well. So there's been a window of opportunity that we've seen increase over the last month particularly in the quarter that set us up well to have a very active 2020. The things that we continue to do are look for assets that are particularly well positioned from a location and quality standpoint that meet our requirements relative to location and opportunity to round out presence whether they're in our prime core markets or other markets that we want to add additional product to. The thing that was unusual and we're encouraged by as we also as you asked have a sizable single portfolio under contract that we think is a great set of assets that will be very good for us to bring into the portfolio. In total, it's 36 properties across 15 markets, 13 different states. 24 of the assets are open and operating, but they're relatively new. Average age is two to three years, I would call them Class A properties in very good locations, and we're very excited to bring them into the portfolio knowing that we're looking for opportunities to lease-up properties because we have very good customer demand. So they'll be easily integrated and we anticipate closing the first 24 of those assets by the end of the year. With that portfolio which we're also well poised to capture and look for some I think interesting growth and performance opportunities as there's 12 additional properties in various phases of development that will be completed through 2021. Again Class A well-located assets and we're really pleased by the ability to capture that total portfolio. Another interesting part of the portfolio, it was -- it is an off-market deal. So it speaks to the level of relationships that we continue to build across the storage sector. This relationship has evolved over a longer period of time and we continue to look for those opportunities where they may play through. Beyond the large portfolio that I just talked about, we're also seeing a number of smaller opportunities, which we've been seeing through 2020 and frankly what we saw even in 2019. And so with that we're poised to have a very strong acquisition year, this year. I would tell you from a cap rate standpoint with the amount of capital and the cost of that capital. We're really not seeing any easing of cap rates and we'll have to continue to monitor that. We clearly have good access to capital. Ourselves our own cost of capital continues to be very attractive. Tom can give you a little color later in the call about what we see relative to funding through either the preferred market or the debt markets. But we're clearly seeing some good opportunities to put that capital to work and we are continuing to look and hunt for additional acquisitions going forward. Sure. So I'll provide a little context around the move-out activity, because it has been one of the surprises as we move through this pandemic period. As we rewind to April and early May, we had move-in volumes and move-out volumes that were lower. But as we moved into May and June and then, into the third quarter move-in activity has increased, but move-out activity has remained muted. And dissecting the geographies, the customer tenures, the customer segments with which move-outs are lower, it is really across the board and clearly being driven by the current health care environment. And you highlighted and we discussed in the 10-Q and the MD&A, the likelihood at point that rate of deceleration will moderate and we talked about in previous calls the fact that in other recessionary environments, we've actually seen the opposite play through, with higher move-outs given consumer stress. We've not experienced at this time. And in fact it was pretty consistent, through the third quarter, to give you a sense each of the months in the third quarter, saw 12% to 15% decline, in move-out volumes. And as I mentioned, it's across geographies, across customers tenure bans and customer segments. So really broad-based decline in move-outs, paired with good collection activity and accepting the rental rate increases that we've sent to-date. So we've encouraged by the existing tenants. We do have our eyes on, what could playout, as we move in this dynamic environment. And we do watching that very closely. But through October, move-outs continue to be lower. Yeah, not -- I wouldn't say, anything to point to that is materially different. We do think that 2020 will plus or minus calc out to be about a $4-or-so billion set of deliveries across all of our markets here in the United States. The anticipated shift down into deliveries in 2021 was something in the range of 15-or-so percent. So we could still see that, degradation and deliveries. But frankly it's still high. And with the continued interest from an investor base, to get into the self-storage sector and performance that the product type itself continues to have even in this challenging environment. As mentioned earlier, there is still a fair amount of capital that wants to get into the space, whether it's through acquisitions or even development. So, it's to something that we're keeping a close eye on but it really hasn't changed that much from our prior outlook. You bet. Sure. So, stepping back on marketing spend that's been a tool that we've utilized along with promotional discounts and move-in rates over the past several years and what was a tough customer acquisition environment. Given the impact of new supply in many of our markets. And so we did increase our spend over the last several years and have liked the returns that we've seen utilizing advertising spend and that really is across paid surge it social media we use television in the second quarter kind of a broad-based advertising approach to attract new customers. We do have real advantages in using advertising as a tool given our brand name and presence online. And so we like that too and we will continue to use it as we navigate this dynamic environment. In the second quarter, given lower top of funnel demand we were more aggressive on marketing spend. And as top of funnel demand improved as we moved into the third quarter we removed some of that advertising support. But as you note our advertising spend was up about 8% or 9% in the quarter and we will continue to use that tool as we play through what's a dynamic environment but we did not need the level of support we saw in the second quarter given improved top of funnel trends. So, we're active in all markets and have the opportunity to look at most deals. So I'll comment on is we're highly entrenched in most if not all the deals that are happening in any variety of different types of transactions large and small. And we are continuing to track and see the level of activity. I'm not really going to comment on our view and perception of that particular portfolio but we're highly entrenched and our acquisition team continues to be incredibly engaged whether they're marketed deals as that particular one was or deals that are not marketed which points to the portfolio I talked about earlier. Well, it's a spectrum of different drivers, Todd. So, part of the flexibility for instance if you look at the Bay Area that many tech workers have been given is, when a big employer many of whom you -- anyone of us can point to gives signals and/or time frames where they may not be pulling their employees back, not for one or two months, for six months to a year, coupled with giving them full flexibility to be somewhere else. That could vary. So, some employees will still come back. There's no question about that, but it may be for several months or several quarters depending again on the unknown timing of the pandemic itself. And then to what degree these become permanent relocations and then some commensurate impact on the need to keep goods or whatever they're keeping it in one of our units in that particular market will be a question and can predict it, don't know. Fortunately, again, if you look at the Bay Area for instance, we have an opportunity to stand out there because we've got a very well-placed portfolio. It's very difficult to add new supply there. So, the different need for that space in that market long term is quite high. There's no question about it. And it's difficult to build there. So, it's not a market by any means that we're concerned about from an oversupply standpoint et cetera. This has just been a very unusual environment where this demand has been so elevated where I mentioned we've got system high occupancies of 97%, 98% this time a year. I mean, we have never seen that before. So, it's to be determined. It's hard to predict. And the flexibility and the way in which employees, whether they're tech-oriented or other traditional office users change over time is to be determined. But as Tom mentioned, we're seeing -- it's just in these urban or more dense markets we're seeing healthy demand across the entire system. We frankly don't have a market that's down in occupancy. It continues to percolate our lease-up of our newly built and required assets is very strong. And consumer demand continues to be very, very active, particularly for this time a year. Yes. So theoretically you could argue that again if you just think of the demand that's tied to work from home it's just not somebody holistically leaving an entire house or an apartment, it may also be a very healthy level of demand tied to just needing that extra closet or that extra bedroom or that area is not only because it's a work from home maybe family members come back or whatever. And there are layers and layers of demand factors that we're tracking. But as we've said, it's solid demand. Thank you. Ki Bin, I'm not going to give you specifics about the actual yield. I would tell you it's similar to ranges that we've looked for over time which on a stabilized basis would be 5% to 6% plus on a cash-on-cash yield or north of that. The thing that I didn't mentioned about the portfolio that we'll be closing this quarter is the occupancies about 35%. We look at that as a very good thing relative to again the opportunity to lease-up space based on the demand factors that we're seeing, the great locations that these assets are tied to and the quality of the assets. So it's a very good opportunity for us to stabilize those assets to put our own marketing and operational tactics and strategies into them. And we feel like we'll have very good returns once we get the assets stabilized. As you well know that can take anywhere from three to four years on a normalized basis, not only once you get to stabilized occupants at more stabilized revenue and pricing metrics. So we'll continue to look for again the stabilization of those assets. But as I mentioned, very high quality, good solid assets and adds in many ways you could consider it almost like a near-term or more recently delivered developments on our part. So again very good opportunity to drive good value from them. Yes, Steve we're going to continue to look both domestic and internationally. So we have clearly, the opportunity from a knowledge base. We've learned a lot through our involvement and success through the Shurgard investment. And we feel over time that we can continue to grow both here domestically and internationally. It's always going to be subject to different types of opportunities and the particular market that may be for whatever set of reasons well-timed from an attractive point to either enter or find appropriate opportunities. So we're going to continue to assess opportunities both here domestically and internationally. Yes. Ron, that's certainly something that we're going to continue to track, as these different demand factors play through. It's hard to predict the sustainability or the likelihood that some of them are here permanently or they're going to shift up and down. I already talked a little bit about the work-from-home demand factor. That's clearly new at this level of magnitude. And whether or not that sustains from a demand stat standpoint after the pandemic settles down or not, is to be determined. Many companies are looking at work-from-home platforms as different and new way of enhancing productivity and employee satisfaction. But the theoretical argument against that is there may be the opposite going through too. So it's a little bit hard to predict. And at the moment we're just going to continue to survey and understand and see these drivers. The interesting thing is they're all additive and they're continuing to drive as we've talked about, very optimized performance. We'll continue to learn from this and it's brought frankly a healthy and new set of customers into the storage sector, never used the product before. So I think, long term, that's a good thing. The adoption of the product continues to grow statistically. And it once again is proving that the product is highly resilient, it's highly adaptable and consumers like it. The things that we continue to do also are, find ways of making the customer interaction that much more effective, making it a much more easy decision and transaction. So many of the tools that we've been putting into our technological channels and options for customers are serving us well, about 40-plus percent of our move-in volume in the third quarter came from our e-rental platform that frankly was in test mode before the pandemic came about, but statistically we moved in 115,000 customers directly through that a channel and that transaction takes about five minutes and consumers love it. And that's not just because of the pandemic. It's just a great and easy way to capture a storage unit. So we've got different things that we're also able to test in a very challenging environment like this, that are frankly giving us even new and different tools that could lead to different levels of dealing with customers in a very different way than we were doing before that again are very aligned with their ability to think even more positively about needing a storage facility, because it's that much used or easier to capture and is that much more cost effective. Well, I wouldn't say as simple as just saying we turned on and switch and said, let's just go buy whatever we can get our hands on. We have very disciplined analytics that we use that give us the right guidepost to say these are the relative. And I would say better timed opportunities to deploy capital. This is, at the moment, a good window to do that. Our cost of capital, as Tom reiterated, is very, very good. Our access to capital is very good. We know most of the markets that we operate in much better than others do. So we have different ways for us to step back and understand the relative ultimate capital allocation, performance and ability to drive value through not only our acquisition environment but our development and redevelopment activities. So, we have all those tools. We continue to analyze them. And we've got a balance sheet that can clearly accommodate multiple factors of the volume that we were even talking about this quarter. So, I don't see that as anyway a limiter, and we're going to continue to evaluate the timing and the quality and the fit of any particular acquisition, whether it's one-off, whether it's a medium-sized portfolio or a sizable one. Yeah. What I would say is that our perspective around leverage is long-term held belief that we should have a conservative balance sheet that allows us to invest through cycles. That allowed us access to capital throughout this year as you highlighted. And I think this year has been somewhat unique. And in fact that we're in a deep recession and financing markets have been attractive throughout. I think we've also highlighted that we have capacity to utilize that balance sheet in times like this to fund acquisitions, and we're doing that in the second half of this year. So we definitely have some capacity from here to add incremental leverage. And we're doing that as we move forward. In terms of the appropriate amount of leverage, we think a conservative long-term view, and a single A rating is an appropriate place for a REIT of our size scale and capability. So yes, Jon, the range is highlighted $4 billion. I didn't mean that that would be the maximum. I meant it more that I liked having $4 billion. So I would consider that. And why did I say $4 billion? It's because about the amount we have currently outstanding. Meaning I like the amount we have outstanding and over time would anticipate that to grow, and would anticipate our debt balance to grow as the company continues to grow and our EBITDA grows and the business grows. Sure. And obviously we don't know that when we may find ourselves in a position where move-outs would accelerate. We do think that the current trends are impacted by the healthcare crisis that we're navigating through. In terms of prior crisis, if you look back at the financial crisis, we saw move-outs for several quarters up in the mid-single digits. And so -- that's an example. But what we've learned certainly through this experience is that, everyone is unique. And so, our ability to point to that is, what will happen when the pandemic eases, I think is limited and we're going to be certainly watching very closely in terms of what consumer activities will be like as we move through future quarters. And I would say it's unpredictable. And it's unpredictable because of the healthcare nature of this crisis, as well as the government activities to reduce the spread of the virus. So it's unpredictable past recessions would point to something like mid-single digits increase. Will this time be like last time? We don't know. Sure. So in terms of the benefit of length of state, you highlighted it which is okay, we get to see those longer-term tenants stay with us. We don't have to replace them and we have the opportunity to increase their rent over time. And that's already been playing out as we move through 2019 and into 2020. The length of stays we're extending last year and we started to get the beneficial impact of sending more rental rate increases last year. And as we moved into the second half of this year with the decreased move-outs more customers have been eligible for rental rate increases this year. And if this continues would anticipate that in the beginning of next year as well. And that's been somewhat of an offset to the fact that as I highlighted earlier, we've been sending lower magnitude rental rate increases. But I would say that's been on the margin at this point. And if the trend continues, it will accelerate. It's about 10 months. There's 24 -- yes there's 24 properties that are operating that are average two to three years at most an age. So they are in early phases of lease-up. So that portion of the 36 property portfolio is about 35% occupied. And there are 12 properties that are under construction that will be delivered in 2021 quarter-by-quarter. So the lease-up up opportunity on the existing 24 is very good. No. I mean, they've got to cure and stabilized levels of performance. But we're very confident as I mentioned relative to the quality of the location the Class A buildings and we're very confident across the markets that they are positioned and that we'll do quite well with them. Yeah, Rick. We're definitely looking for and seeing opportunity from an optimization standpoint to find ways of moderating the pressure tied to payroll as a whole whether it's property and/or supervisory. So you saw some of that in the quarter. We are looking for and finding ways of optimizing operations on a number of fronts. Utilities also in the quarter were down nicely. That's tied to some intentional investments that we've made from an LED standpoint. So we've now got our entire 2,600-or-so portfolio on exterior LED lights, and we transitioned maybe about a third so far the portfolio from an interior standpoint to LED. So we're seeing nice savings relative to the utility cost. Again, utilities were down a little over 9% in the quarter. Repairs and maintenance were down. That can vary quarter-to-quarter depending on some of the repairs necessary across the portfolio, but we saw a good metric there. And overall, we continue to look for ways of optimizing costs. Tom's have been focused on looking at new and different ways of optimizing our marketing spend too. So, although, it was up -- it wasn't up as much as it's been in the last few quarters. So, again, we're looking for different ways of optimizing that spend too. Thank you. Sure, Mike. So the program as a whole we've got 113 properties in the program we added seven in the quarter. The activity from a backlog standpoint and delivery standpoint is in some ways matching the kind of activity we're seeing on our own direct acquisition front. So we're seeing good percolation of owners that are interested in coming into the system. And we are finding high-quality assets and the program continues to build. The dominant factor as it has been since we came into the business is tied to new deliveries. So we've got a healthy growing pipeline of new assets that will also be coming into the portfolio over the next few quarters. Thank you. Okay. They have their own. I think it's a natural add junk to that business and we've had a handful of situations that have percolated on that front. We'll see how it plays over time. But it's overall a great opportunity to build relationships with owners whether they're one-off owners, they only own one or two assets or other owners that have multiple assets in multiple markets. So it's been and will continue to be a healthy way of broadening our tie to a different owner pool out there. So, we'll continue to look for and develop those kinds of relationships too, as the program builds. But the portfolio, the large portfolio that we're closing on this quarter is not in our platform. Thank you. Yeah, Steve. So I'll provide a little bit more color around customer collections in aggregate, because that is the primary reason why fees are down. And so, as we look at rent collections, really starting in the second quarter and persisting through the third have been very solid. And some of the things you highlighted are contributing i.e. AutoPay is at a modestly higher percentage. But even away from AutoPay tenants customer payment patterns have accelerated and we're charging less in terms of fees. And so obviously, if you don't charge it, you're not going to collect it. Our receivable to be down around 30% through the quarter and that's persisted through the delinquency period for tenants meaning that receivables down about 30%. We wrote off about 30% less rent. We have about 30% fewer auctions in the quarter. So overall, customer health and payment patterns have improved, and that has led to lower fees, primarily from late fees which are charged for customers not paying their rent within a grace period, but also contributed from longer into the delinquency period lean fees and lean sale fees, but primarily driven by the grace period ending late fee in the first month of customers delinquency. I think early on in the pandemic, we thought that it may have been more transitory and there was customer being supported by government stimulus certainly that was the case through April and unemployment benefits and the like. And some of that has been put in the rearview mirror, the trends have continued. It's something we're watching very closely month-over-month. I would tell you that, trends continued through October and payment patterns have been very good through the early part of November as well. So it feels like at least, for the foreseeable future or near to medium term, we're anticipating that will be the case, but we're watching it very closely. Thanks, Steve."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Maria. And thanks to all of you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m here on the line of Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that all statements other than statements of historical fact included on this call are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the statements. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results that are described in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and in our reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, August 6, 2020. We assume no obligation to update or revise any of these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on the call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. As usual, we do ask that you keep your questions limited to two. After you ask two, please feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thank you, Ryan. And thanks for joining us today. Before I open the call for questions, I would first like to acknowledge and thank the full Public Storage team along with our customers and business partners as we have come together to ensure a safe environment. In the last four months during this pandemic, we have moved in over 400,000 new customers, as we continue to operate our entire 2,500 property portfolio. Clearly, this volume of activity has been a validation of the strength of our platform and the resiliency of self-storage. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. Joe, maybe I\u2019ll start the first question just on that point, as you mentioned, the volume is very strong and the results were better in the quarter I think than initially expected, if we compare comments to the last call. But, at the same time, I know your team is cautious on the second half of the year. I guess, can you tie those comments together?\nJoe Russell: Sure, Jeff. Yes. There\u2019s no question, as I noted, that we\u2019ve been very determined and focused on the amount of volume we\u2019ve been able to pull into the portfolio, coupled with obviously a number of crosscurrents. So, if you step back and think about the last four months during the pandemic, we kind of think of going through four different phases. And the early part of the pandemic, March and April, we did a number of things to ensure all the right safety protocols, we suspended auctions and really made sure that our entire environment was safe and secure as we were able to continue to operate all of our properties. We saw a little bit of degradation in demand, after an initial rush that came to us through primarily college and university shutting down early. So, we saw a bit of a rush. But then, not long after that, we started to see a bit of degradation. But then, going into the next phase, the second phase, we began to put even more focus on customer focus. We again suspended auctions and we opened up to a degree some of the customer accommodation practices again to be reflective of the environment. And we became more focused on different tools around top of funnel demand through advertising and other things that were proving to be actually quite effective. So, we started to see the residual benefit of that, and again a lift in demand and move in volume. In that phase, again, we continued along those same lines but continue to put even more focus on the ways in which we were able to draw new customers to the portfolio, while month after month seeing a very positive impact from far fewer move outs. And then finally, the most recent phase as we stand through the month of July, we\u2019ve actually now gone back to auctions. We have reinstituted rent increases in many parts of the portfolio. And again, we\u2019re starting to see very good reaction to the amount of activity, both on move-ins and lack of or lower move-outs. So, speaking to the second half of the year, yes, we do see a number of different pressures that I\u2019ll have Tom walk you through in a little bit more detail. But overall, as I noted, we\u2019ve been very pleased by the overall resiliency and the ability on our part to continue to drive this level of demand, and literally we are dealing with in many markets record high levels of occupancy. Tom, why don\u2019t you give a little bit more color on second half of the year?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Thanks, Joe. So, as Joe mentioned, operating metrics, we started to improve as we moved through the second quarter and have continued that post-quarter. So, we can spend more time there, if you like. But, I think part of your question was around the discussion around same-store revenue trends. So, how do those operating metrics translate to financial metrics and while operating metrics improve throughout the second quarter, financial metrics, we saw revenue growth in the same store pool deteriorate. So, if you think about the second quarter in aggregate into components, same store occupancy was up about 20 basis points, same store rents were down 2%. So, that leads you to your negative 1.8% performance for rental income in the same store pool in the second quarter. Fee collections were down 32% in the quarter. Those fee collections were down for two primary reasons. Earlier in the quarter, it related to customer accommodations and customers\u2019 requesting fee relief. And so, we did grant, the vast majority of those requests. But collections frankly were quite good through the quarter. And so, as we moved through the second quarter, our fee collections were lower year-over-year on about a 30% basis because customers were paying us sooner. And we anticipate that\u2019s likely to continue. At least we\u2019ve seen it continue through July at this point, which is leading to lower fee collections. So, that was the second quarter. As we think about the other component of your question around the second half, I just highlighted that rents were down 2% in the second quarter on average. We ended the quarter down 3.1% on contract rents. So, clearly, we\u2019re starting the third quarter in a lower year-over-year rent growth position. And we\u2019re still seeing fee collections lower because of good collections.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. Very helpful. I guess my one follow-up then, just to confirm, but are we seeing that the second half you think could be worse than 2Q? I think, that\u2019s where I\u2019m a bit confused. Because this seems like\u2026\nTom Boyle: We highlighted in the MD&A and the 10-Q, which is we think it\u2019s likely that the second half will have same-store revenue performance worse than the second quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Smedes Rose of Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I just wanted to -- I was interested that you talked about in your Q that bad debt expense was in line to historic levels. Does that just tie into what you just talked about or are you granting feel relief, so customers don\u2019t necessarily kind of fall into a bad debt category, or is there just something maybe I\u2019m just not understanding correctly?\nJoe Russell: No. I think, it\u2019s really pretty simple. Collection trends through the quarter were good. We had customers that were paying us earlier. We did have customers that while we had auctions paused for a period of time, stayed with us for a longer period of time. We\u2019ve begun to work through that during the quarter. And so, right now, we\u2019re sitting with about 20 basis points of occupancy that is delayed auction activities. But, as you think about bad debt through the quarter, it was pretty consistent year-over-year. And frankly, as we sit here today, away from what was written off in the second quarter, the receivable, as we ended the quarter, was actually down a little year-over-year.\nSmedes Rose: Okay.\nJoe Russell: Stepping back, it\u2019s obviously a focus of the team to focus on basics through the quarter, rent spaces and collecting rent. And I think, you saw a good customer reaction and validation that our spaces are important to them. And we saw a good team activity and rental activity. I think, there is also broader things that work. There\u2019s no question that government stimulus or government support for many individuals throughout the economy, we suspect helped our collection trends through the quarter. And as we look across industries, credit cards or otherwise, many other industries are seeing similar collection trends as the government has done a good bit to support individuals\u2019 finances.\nSmedes Rose: Okay, thanks. And then, just as a follow-up. You continue to make acquisitions and see things that you\u2019ve -- that you\u2019re purchasing. Just wondering if you could just speak to what\u2019s I guess compelling about the opportunities, is it cap rates, is it just the ability to manage it better, or kind of what are you sort of seeing now maybe versus kind of pre-pandemic, I guess, on your acquisition activity?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Sure, Smedes. There\u2019s no question, at the beginning of the pandemic, investment market on many fronts basically went into pause mode. We had, again, in the March and April timeframe, a handful of assets that had been already badded, we still thought they were very attractive investments for us to make. We closed on those deals toward the earlier part of the quarter. And then, things settled down. We actually began to see and continue through today a bit of an elevation of return to market and/or just conversations that we had in motion prior to the pandemic, a variety of different deals that continue to be particularly attractive. So, for the most part, the types of assets that are commanding normal or consistent cap rates, pre-pandemic, would be stabilized assets. There\u2019s still a lot of capital on the sidelines without looking for those types of investments. What we\u2019ve done alternatively is look for, again, value opportunities, particularly around assets that may not be stabilized and/or in parts of our markets that we think round out our presence. So, we are seeing a little bit more opening up of owners that are coming back to the market, some of which do not see a way to basically get out of some of the constraints. They may be under for either lending reasons or not making the yields that they had expected. And those conversations are becoming more vibrant, I\u2019ll tell you that. And with that we\u2019ve got, again, as we pointed to in the press release, we\u2019ve got, a few assets that are in motion. And we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll probably see more. There still are very few bigger portfolios on the market today. We are also seeing, maybe no surprise, a few more land holding opportunities coming up as well, where again, owners that have taken down positions and land maybe have taken them through various stages of entitlements that are not again seeing the pro forma and return expectations come through, particularly with what\u2019s going on with rates across most markets, are looking for a way to come out of those positions. So, the acquisition team is busy looking at many different types of opportunities. And we\u2019ll see how this continues to play for us in the coming quarters.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Spenser Allaway of Green Street Advisors.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on the resumed rate increases. Can you perhaps just quantify or provide more color around what percent of the portfolio has now seen rate increases and whether they have been to the same degree that you would have sent out to existing customers pre-COVID?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Thanks, Spenser. This is Tom. So, as Joe mentioned, we did pause existing tenant rate increases for the second quarter. They did resume on July 1st. And we resumed it really on a test basis on July 1st and have since more broadly resumed on August 1st and expect to on September 1st as well. In terms of the breadth of it across the country, those increases are broadly spread throughout the country. So, in the vast majority of the country, we\u2019re able to send existing tenant rate increases. The magnitude of them compared to prior years though is lower. And we did that on a test basis on July 1st to try to understand consumer behavior during the pandemic, and we saw encouraging trends there. But, as we look forward, there are headwinds to sending the same sorts of increases as we did in prior years, really related to state and local jurisdictions and the price-related regulations there. And so, we would anticipate that the magnitude of the increases will be lower on a year-over-year basis for the next several months or longer, depending on how long those regulations stay in place.\nSpenser Allaway: Perfect. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Good morning. Thank you. Can I just ask a follow-up on that rate increase? What percentage were accepted, and if you could maybe provide some ground there around the average increase?\nTom Boyle: Yes, sure. In terms of the percentage of those accepted, I\u2019m not going to get into details there. But I would say on a year-over-year basis, we saw good trends there as it relates to acceptance and continued rental activity with Public Storage. In terms of the magnitudes, typically I\u2019ve highlighted that, upper single-digits to 10% type increases. This year, we\u2019re averaging a little bit below that because of the things I just highlighted for Spenser. So, on average, a little bit lower than that.\nJohn Kim: And then, you mentioned, the revenue decline being more pronounced in the second half of the year. I\u2019m wondering if you could also provide commentary on the expenses side, and if you can, any potential savings from either marketing or other variable costs?\nJoe Russell: Yes. I\u2019ll begin with part of what you saw in the second quarter, we had elevated payroll cost that was tied to our PS Cares Fund where we were again boosting pay rate within our hourly employee ranks as well as providing a number of different accommodations reflective of the environment to support costs tied to childcare, more opportunity to take PTO, and again, look at the different opportunities or challenges that the workforce at large was dealing with. So, the pay rate increase did end at the end of the second quarter. So, you\u2019ll see some moderation down and the elevated cost of payroll, which was about 20% in the second quarter. And then, we\u2019ll also, as you see, be looking at lower taxes potentially because we saw property taxes come in lower at about 3.6% in the second quarter. And then, the other thing that we\u2019re going to keep an eye on is the cost of advertising and promotions with the remaining -- rest of the year.\nTom Boyle: Yes. And I\u2019d just highlight that there\u2019s pretty good line by line details in the MD&A and our 10-Q. But we would anticipate the growth moderates from the second quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.\nKi Bin Kim: Just going back to the existing customer rate increase program, I mean, it\u2019s my understanding that if you stop that program for three months, it really doesn\u2019t make a big impact, right? If you stop it for a prolonged period of time, that\u2019s when it starts to bleed into results and you start to see a bigger impact. So, I\u2019m just curious, like, what was the lack of contribution, if you will, in the second quarter from stopping that program, and how should that change going forward?\nJoe Russell: Sure. Taking a step back, pausing on existing tenants for any month will have a meaningful impact on in-place rents. And so as we paused throughout the second quarter, there was a cumulative impact of several months of not sending existing tenant increases. As I highlighted, not only did we not send those during the second quarter, when we resent them and are sending increases in the second half, they are at lower magnitudes, given some of the regulations and things that we\u2019re doing to be mindful of the environment. So, as you think about the contribution to second quarter rental rate trends that you saw that on average rent per occupied square foot was down 2% in the second quarter, the largest component of that decline from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter was really no or very little contribution from existing tenant rate increase. Rest of it was rent roll down, which we disclosed our move-in and move-out trends throughout the second quarter, which also were clearly contributing factors, particularly early on in the quarter.\nKi Bin Kim: And in terms of looking forward, that should moderate, I\u2019m assuming, because you\u2019re sending letter out again, even though at a lower rate?\nJoe Russell: Yes. We shouldn\u2019t have the same level of rental rate declines from existing tenants because we will be sending them out.\nKi Bin Kim: And just going back to the late fees and admin charges that were down, I think 30% or so year-over-year. Can you just give a little more color on what those fees are? Is it just late fees? And I\u2019m assuming if operations start to return back to normal, that segment probably should normalize pretty quickly, or am I missing something?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So, the different components of the late charges and administrative fees break down into several components. One is administrative fees that are charged at move-in. And so, that line item will trend based on move-in volumes. And you\u2019ve seen that over time, if move-in volumes are down, you\u2019re going to see those admin fees be a little bit down. So, we did see that in the second quarter. The other charges are related to late and then lien and lien sale fees, the largest component of it being late fees. So, if a customer doesn\u2019t pay their rent on time, a fee is charged to their account. That\u2019s where we saw improving collection trends reduced the amount of fees collected as we move through the quarter. I would say that down 32% in fees collected actually remained somewhat consistent through the second quarter and into July. But the composition of the driver changed as we moved through the quarter. In the month of April, in the first part of May, the majority of the driver there was fee accommodation, customers requesting fee relief. I shared on the last call that during the month of April, we had about 7% of our customers request some sort of customer accommodation, either rent or fee relief. The majority of that was fee relief and the majority of that was granted. As we moved through the quarter, the amount of requests that we received diminished and collection trends improved, such that by the time we got into June that down 30% in fee collections was driven primarily by better collection trends. And that\u2019s continued through July. In terms of how much into the future we can anticipate the fee trends will remain that way. It\u2019s hard to call. You would have asked us in March, whether collections would be meaningfully better year-over-year as we move through the quarter. And I don\u2019t think I would have sat here and told you that. But now, having seen it for a number of months and seen it through the month of July and good trends, even as we get into August here, it does feel like it\u2019s part of the environment. And as I highlighted, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s bigger factors there at work. And so, it\u2019s certainly a potential driver of lower same store revenues in the second half, because we continue to see it play out through the third quarter.\nJoe Russell: And just even again a little bit more perspective, Ki Bin, as Tom said, through the quarter and even through July that level of customer request has continued to diminish, coupled with fact customers are paying on time. So, the customer behavior through the pandemic has actually been quite strong. And it validates the way in which our platform has been well-tuned to not only address an environment like this, but it\u2019s been able to optimize the collection process as a whole?\nTom Boyle: Yes. And I think, clearly, lower fee collections isn\u2019t a great thing from a same-store revenue standpoint, but it\u2019s a great thing for the shape of our customers in the business and validates the demand for self-storage as well as the customers\u2019 value in using our space.\nKi Bin Kim: Right? I mean, no one can argue that people are paying on time, and yes less late fees as a bad thing. So, I\u2019m assuming then -- that\u2019s a good thing, right? So, I\u2019m assuming that there is kind of the mix of that fee structure that lower year-over-year is now the signup fee, the administrative fee, that\u2019s probably lower, right, or making a bigger impact?\nTom Boyle: It\u2019s that late fee, it is customers paying us on time, and we\u2019re seeing that in through July and August.\nJoe Russell: One other thing to add is, auction activity, as I mentioned through the phases, we had paused on auction activity for a chunk of the second quarter. We are doing auctions again. We do have a few municipalities where we\u2019re being held back. But, our auction overhang is actually quite limited. It accounts for only about 20 basis points of our overall occupancy. So that too talks to the way that we continue to be optimized around our entire collection process, our customer engagement process. And we've been able to calibrate that very efficiently, even in an environment where there's been a number of hurdles that had limited us, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, to do auctions. And we are basically back in the auction business in many parts of the portfolio. We're certainly abiding by areas where we're unable to do auctions, but the meaningful chunk of that part of our business has returned.\nTom Boyle: And maybe Ki Bin, I'll just grasp onto that to provide with the real benefit of that is as we move through the quarter, it really allowed us to re-rent that space as we got it back. And so as we moved through the quarter, we spoke about earlier around how average occupancy was up about 20 basis points. We ended the quarter up 50 basis points and again, that aged delinquency really represented about 20 basis points there. So call it up 30 basis points on a net basis. That's really continued to improve and at July 31, our occupancy was up 140 basis points. And again, about 20 basis points of impact of delayed auction activity. So net, up about 120 basis points in occupancy. And that's really related to the operating trends that Joe highlighted as we move through the different phases and improving trends and move-ins and continued lower move-outs, coupled with the fact that our delinquencies process was underway, allowed us to re-rent that space and move occupancy higher as we move through July.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just two quick ones from me. One is just trying to get a better understanding. We're hearing a lot about migration out of urban into sort of the suburban areas with the pandemic, whereas a little bit less density. And the question is really, are you seeing sort of anything in your portfolio that would suggest that's true? So our properties maybe better in sort of more suburban markets and they\u2019re seeing better activity than say your New York, or California, or something like that?\nJoe Russell: Ron, it's too soon to really tell if there's going to be a material and longstanding shift around suburban versus urban. We track by both areas. We look at density from a population standpoint how our properties are performing. You mentioned New York. Ironically, at the moment, New York\u2019s actually has been a huge beneficiary of the amount of demand that we've seen over the last quarter or so. San Francisco is the same. But again, we are not stepping back and basically putting any kind of a label on suburban versus urban, it's way too soon to tell. We have good diversification across all of our markets, I guess, whether they're in suburban or urban markets. And we will continue to track and see the lingering impact from the pandemic. And again, just the shift in overall patterns about where people choose to live, it's way too soon to tell. One thing that has been pronounced that we see from a demand standpoint in both markets is the work from home impact. We see many more of our customers coming to us, because they are not going to a traditional office they need more space at home. And by virtue of that, they're putting more stuff in our facilities. So that's been a meaningful additional demand factor that we've seen, both in urban and suburban markets.\nRonald Kamdem: And then the second question was just on just the July operating trends. I don\u2019t know if you've mentioned it already. But just what occupancy is sitting at and what the change in pricing? Thank you.\nTom Boyle: So I hit on that just a moment ago, but I'll get a little bit more context on operating trends in July. Move-in volumes were better in the month of July. Move-in volumes were down about 2%. Move-out volumes were actually down about 15%, which led to an increase in occupancy through the months. And I just highlighted July 30th, our occupancy was up around 140 basis points year-over-year. I would note that about 20 basis points of that is related to delayed auction activity. Overall, July, we saw continued improving operating trends, as Joe mentioned earlier.\nJoe Russell: One area I would also add on is our non same store portfolio, in particular has been quite vibrant. We have a fair amount of both new development acquisition opportunities for customers to move in. And we've seen an inordinate amount of move-in activity, which has been quite a good surprise or a good benefit based on a number of things we're seeing from a trend standpoint. So, I mentioned that we\u2019ve moved in about 400,000 customers in the last four months. If you just look at Q2 of the 300,000 or so customers that moved in, 60,000 of those move-ins came into our non same store portfolio. The non same store portfolio continues to do quite well from an occupancy growth standpoint and were up about 11%. Continue to see very good trends and tractions relative to both new builds, redevelopment, and acquisitions that we've added into the portfolio. That total pool is 13.5 million square feet and we continue to see very good performance and fill ups across all markets. Frankly, we haven't seen any of our acquisitions and developments going backwards in this environment. They have done the absolute opposite where they're filling up pretty dramatically.\nOperator: Our next question comes from one of Rick Skidmore of Goldman Sachs.\nRick Skidmore: Joe, just to follow up on a previous question on the external growth fronts. It sounded like your focus has been more domestic versus international. Is that the right way we should be thinking about your comments on the acquisition front?\nJoe Russell: So Rick, we're going to continue as we always have to look in many markets, both within and outside the U.S. I wouldn't say that our focus has changed over the long-term any differently. There's no question over the last few months. We've put particular focus on everything that's going on right here in the United States. But over time, we will continue to assess and look at opportunities beyond the United States.\nRick Skidmore: And then one bigger picture question, Joe. In the past, you've talked about supply growth and supply growth fading in 2020. Can you just talk about what you're seeing from a supply growth standpoint as the pandemic slowed developments or financing for new projects? And are you starting to see that manifest itself in your markets? Thank you.\nJoe Russell: There is still healthy amount of supply that continues to be delivered into 2020. Last quarter, we talked about the likelihood that it would be anywhere say 15% to 20% or so less than what was predicted, which would point to plus or minus at $5 billion or so level of deliveries in 2020. We think that's probably closer to $4 billion or less. There doesn't appear to be any slowdown this year anyway relative to those deliveries taking place. Although, some of them are taking longer. No surprise, many cities have slowed down their own approval processes, whether through inspections. Again, final occupancy permits, et cetera. So, we still think that there's a healthy amount of supply. It kind of goes into level of supply you saw in the 2017 or so era. Now looking out to '21 and beyond, I would expect, based again, on what I mentioned earlier. There will likely be more constraints around funding that many of these developers look for relative to construction loans. And again, the investment hurdles that either they and/or their partners are going to require to move forward on any particular acquisition, or any particular development, excuse me. So we're likely to see, again, another leg down. I don't know how hard and dramatic that might be. But it would be a welcome relief, particularly in the markets that we've been pointing to over the last couple of years that have been bit heavy with new supply. So, too soon to tell yet the lingering impact into '21 and beyond, but we're likely to see again another leg down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Mike Mueller of J.P. Morgan.\nMike Mueller: Just wondering, how are the year-over-year move in rate comps in July versus 2Q is down 14%?\nTom Boyle: So move-in rate change in the month of July was down a little over 4%, move-in volumes down about 2%, move-in rate down about 4%.\nMike Mueller: And I\u2019m curious the expansion of the third party management business. How's that trended over the past four months or so with the pandemic?\nJoe Russell: The number of properties we added to the platform in the quarter was nine. We have 106 properties now. The continues to grow. It's still dominated by properties that are going through various phases of construction. Although, we are also seeing stabilized and/or lease-up assets coming into the portfolio and the platform as well. So, not unlike what we saw in the acquisition arena to some degree, it would kick out a little quieter for a month or two on the early part of the pandemic. But as things have settled down, we're seeing good activity. And we continue to bring new properties into the platform, whether they're new and we're actually opening them. We opened again several in the quarter and we're bringing more into the portfolio as we\u2019re going through different phases of completion and development. The backlog is healthy and we're continuing to add to it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: I don't know if you can answer this, or maybe talk a little bit about the differences. But you said that your occupancy was effectively only inflated, if you will, by 20 to 30 basis points from the lack of auctions. And one of your peers yesterday talked about that number being closer to 150 basis points to maybe 200 basis points. And I'm just really trying to figure out, is there differences, or what the differences are that would cause such a large delta? And then, is there anything around maybe the unemployment insurance payments that came into folks over the last four months, providing them with more income that might have helped on the collection front and therefore, your fees are down as you talked about and that helps kind of keep the delinquencies and the auction process down. But just seem to be a very wide difference between you and your peer.\nTom Boyle: I think we've spoken about this. I'll reiterate some of the comments. I obviously can't speak to what others are seeing in the industry. But I'll comment on what we're seeing, which we did see better collection trends and that's driving lower fees. It's also, as we move back to conducting auctions, that's reduced the amount of backlog. So, combination of conducting lean sales, as well as better collections leading to 20 basis points of aged delinquency. I would highlight that we obviously worked with customers throughout the second quarter on different ways. As I highlighted, about 7% of our customers requested some form of relief in the second quarter, and we're very receptive to those sorts of requests as we helped customers that were having a tough time. But those really started to moderate as we move through the quarter. And as Joe highlighted, as we move through the different phases of the second quarter, we started to see better trends there. I think your comment around government support is a good one. And I do think that be it unemployment benefits or $1,200 checks. There's no question that across the country folks got some support through the second quarter, which likely helped collections in our business and in many businesses. And I don't think we're alone to highlight the collections. We're good through the second quarter. I think if you were to listen to banks or to credit card companies, they would likely say something similar. So I think that there is some support there. And ultimately, we'll see what the trajectory is of that support going forward, and that could certainly have an impact on our collection trends and others in the industry as well. But we generally covered most of the different components of it. Maybe one more stat as we just disclosed stats around, on this particular topic. I highlighted that customers are paying us earlier and that's resulted in, if you just look at the snapshot at June 30, our our rent receivable from customers who are less than 60 days is down about 35%. So, customers are paying for their storage space and finding good value in it. And we're working with them and obviously working with those that have been impacted by the pandemic to make sure that they receive the appropriate accommodation as well.\nSteve Sakwa: And then maybe a twist on Mike Mueller's question. I think he asked about the kind of the move-in rate, you said it was down 4%. But if you look at the July move-in rate against the July move-out rate, which I know you provide those quarterly in the 10-Qs. Do you have an idea, or do you know what that spread was in July?\nTom Boyle: I don't have that number right in front of me. I could tell you that the move out rate was down 6% year-over-year and the move-in rate was down 4%. So good trends as it relates to year-over-year comps. I don't, at my fingertips, have rate per square foot but we can follow up with that if that's important to you, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo.\nTodd Stender: Just as we look at your two newly developed properties that you opened in the quarter with the backdrop that you're looking, potentially it\u2019s slowing trends for the second half of the year. Can you just kind of compare your forecasted lease up period to a stabilized occupancy, maybe your current expectations to how they were compared to originally underwritten?\nJoe Russell: Well, Todd, I would just back up and give you maybe a little bit perspective on how we traditionally look at lease up periods to begin with, which frankly is, at the end of the day, no different now than it might've been pre pandemic. It's typical for a property to take three or four years to go through, not only occupancy, lease up at level of stability and stabilization that you're going to see from the maturing of the customer base, et cetera. So if anything, as I've mentioned, we've actually been seeing an accelerated lease up in properties that we put into development, redevelopment or even acquisition. And again, just because again we're even seeing that acceleration right now, we're not stepping back and retooling or resetting expectations. We'll have to see over time how this demand continues to trend. But it begins with the same premise, which is takes up to that three to four years typically for a property to get to that level of stabilization. We're going to look at that time period typically to decide whether or not to put the property in the same store and again, look at the stability that it typically plays out across different markets, et cetera. So no real change yet in the way that we're modeling and looking at the timeframe for stabilization.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the top Todd Thomas of Capital Markets. \nTodd Thomas: Joe, maybe Tom, you've talked now about improving trends throughout the second quarter and into July a couple of times, including the improvements in move in rates down just 4% year over year in July. I understand that the in place contract rents are lower at 3.1% at quarter end versus the down 2% for the second quarter on average. So the financial impact will continue to get worse in the second half. But how much of a lag would you expect there to be before the in place contractual rents on a year over year basis begin to stabilize and maybe begin to improve if trends in general remain consistent?\nJoe Russell: Sure, that's a good question. Unfortunately, I don't have a crystal ball in terms of exactly how the environment is going to play out from here. We're absolutely in an uncertain environment and one that none of us have lived through in the past to be able to understand what the healthcare impact, what the government policy impact will be and where we go from here is hard to predict, is no question starting the quarter with contract rents down 3.1%, is a much worse place than where we started the second quarter from a year-over-year standpoint. The benefits we have going into the third and fourth quarter are that right now, we are sending existing tenant rate increases but we're also being mindful of what the local jurisdictions regulations are around that and also the impact to our customer base in what is a tough healthcare environment. And so, I think it's hard to project going forward right now magnitude of those increases is lower year-over-year. So, that's not going to be a meaningful contributor to the upside of rental rate growth. And move in and move out trends, we're seeing good demand trends now and lower move outs. We've highlighted in the past that in the last downturn, we did see elevated move outs. We've seen the exact opposite this time to date. But we're also mindful that the healthcare situation could be having a significant impact on those trends. And as we move through this year and into next year, the developments on those fronts, I think will likely impact our move in and move out trends as well. So, I know that's a long winded way of saying. I don't really know when things would change materially. But I gave you a sense of what some of the drivers would be that would move in place rents.\nTodd Thomas: As we move further throughout the year here into the back half of the year, and we're looking at, I guess, potentially a more elongated leasing season. Do you expect to have a little bit more seasonal pricing power in August, September, maybe October, on a year-over-year basis than you would ordinarily in prior years?\nJoe Russell: I think the one thing I'd remind you there is that we're still facing an environment that we were in the first quarter of significant new supply being delivered into many of our markets in addition to navigating through this unique pandemic environment. I think Joe highlighted the improving operating trends. If you looked at it on a market-by-market basis, I would say the healthcare environment and situation was the biggest driver of market variance of operating trends in April. But as we move through the quarter into June and July, the biggest differentials from a market standpoint on operating trends, like move in to move out has been more the typical things that we would have been talking about, the impact of new supply in many of our sub markets. And I think that's likely to persist here, as Joe mentioned, future deliveries. So, I don't think the operating environment is such that while we've seen improving trends that it's going to get materially better in any sort of base case. But ultimately, we'll see where we go. We're still dealing with a lot of the headwinds that we spoke about earlier in the year.\nTodd Thomas: And just a follow up on a prior question, just regarding population trends and work from home trends. I know Public's footprints, national and scope and you're diversified, but you do have larger concentrations in some markets like LA and San Fran, New York. Are you having any discussions, or strategic discussions around sort of reallocating capital or thinking about investing differently in sort of a post-pandemic environment, or is it too soon to think about those strategies?\nJoe Russell: It's still too soon, Todd. We will obviously continue to assess the variety of different impacts this kind of environment puts into different markets and sub markets. The business is still very dominated by that very small trade area that three to five miles zone and in an urban environment even much smaller. So again, the portfolio is highly diversified. We enjoy the benefits of the diversification and we'll continue to assess that on an ongoing basis, just like we always have.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Ryan Burke for any additional closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Maria, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Joe. So, as Joe mentioned, operating metrics, we started to improve as we moved through the second quarter and have continued that post-quarter. So, we can spend more time there, if you like. But, I think part of your question was around the discussion around same-store revenue trends. So, how do those operating metrics translate to financial metrics and while operating metrics improve throughout the second quarter, financial metrics, we saw revenue growth in the same store pool deteriorate. So, if you think about the second quarter in aggregate into components, same store occupancy was up about 20 basis points, same store rents were down 2%. So, that leads you to your negative 1.8% performance for rental income in the same store pool in the second quarter. Fee collections were down 32% in the quarter. Those fee collections were down for two primary reasons. Earlier in the quarter, it related to customer accommodations and customers' requesting fee relief. And so, we did grant, the vast majority of those requests. But collections frankly were quite good through the quarter. And so, as we moved through the second quarter, our fee collections were lower year-over-year on about a 30% basis because customers were paying us sooner. And we anticipate that's likely to continue. At least we've seen it continue through July at this point, which is leading to lower fee collections. So, that was the second quarter. As we think about the other component of your question around the second half, I just highlighted that rents were down 2% in the second quarter on average. We ended the quarter down 3.1% on contract rents. So, clearly, we're starting the third quarter in a lower year-over-year rent growth position. And we're still seeing fee collections lower because of good collections. We highlighted in the MD&A and the 10-Q, which is we think it's likely that the second half will have same-store revenue performance worse than the second quarter. Sure. Thanks, Spenser. This is Tom. So, as Joe mentioned, we did pause existing tenant rate increases for the second quarter. They did resume on July 1st. And we resumed it really on a test basis on July 1st and have since more broadly resumed on August 1st and expect to on September 1st as well. In terms of the breadth of it across the country, those increases are broadly spread throughout the country. So, in the vast majority of the country, we're able to send existing tenant rate increases. The magnitude of them compared to prior years though is lower. And we did that on a test basis on July 1st to try to understand consumer behavior during the pandemic, and we saw encouraging trends there. But, as we look forward, there are headwinds to sending the same sorts of increases as we did in prior years, really related to state and local jurisdictions and the price-related regulations there. And so, we would anticipate that the magnitude of the increases will be lower on a year-over-year basis for the next several months or longer, depending on how long those regulations stay in place. Thank you. Yes, sure. In terms of the percentage of those accepted, I'm not going to get into details there. But I would say on a year-over-year basis, we saw good trends there as it relates to acceptance and continued rental activity with Public Storage. In terms of the magnitudes, typically I've highlighted that, upper single-digits to 10% type increases. This year, we're averaging a little bit below that because of the things I just highlighted for Spenser. So, on average, a little bit lower than that. Yes. And I'd just highlight that there's pretty good line by line details in the MD&A and our 10-Q. But we would anticipate the growth moderates from the second quarter. Sure. So, the different components of the late charges and administrative fees break down into several components. One is administrative fees that are charged at move-in. And so, that line item will trend based on move-in volumes. And you've seen that over time, if move-in volumes are down, you're going to see those admin fees be a little bit down. So, we did see that in the second quarter. The other charges are related to late and then lien and lien sale fees, the largest component of it being late fees. So, if a customer doesn't pay their rent on time, a fee is charged to their account. That's where we saw improving collection trends reduced the amount of fees collected as we move through the quarter. I would say that down 32% in fees collected actually remained somewhat consistent through the second quarter and into July. But the composition of the driver changed as we moved through the quarter. In the month of April, in the first part of May, the majority of the driver there was fee accommodation, customers requesting fee relief. I shared on the last call that during the month of April, we had about 7% of our customers request some sort of customer accommodation, either rent or fee relief. The majority of that was fee relief and the majority of that was granted. As we moved through the quarter, the amount of requests that we received diminished and collection trends improved, such that by the time we got into June that down 30% in fee collections was driven primarily by better collection trends. And that's continued through July. In terms of how much into the future we can anticipate the fee trends will remain that way. It's hard to call. You would have asked us in March, whether collections would be meaningfully better year-over-year as we move through the quarter. And I don't think I would have sat here and told you that. But now, having seen it for a number of months and seen it through the month of July and good trends, even as we get into August here, it does feel like it's part of the environment. And as I highlighted, there's no question there's bigger factors there at work. And so, it's certainly a potential driver of lower same store revenues in the second half, because we continue to see it play out through the third quarter. Yes. And I think, clearly, lower fee collections isn't a great thing from a same-store revenue standpoint, but it's a great thing for the shape of our customers in the business and validates the demand for self-storage as well as the customers' value in using our space. It's that late fee, it is customers paying us on time, and we're seeing that in through July and August. And maybe Ki Bin, I'll just grasp onto that to provide with the real benefit of that is as we move through the quarter, it really allowed us to re-rent that space as we got it back. And so as we moved through the quarter, we spoke about earlier around how average occupancy was up about 20 basis points. We ended the quarter up 50 basis points and again, that aged delinquency really represented about 20 basis points there. So call it up 30 basis points on a net basis. That's really continued to improve and at July 31, our occupancy was up 140 basis points. And again, about 20 basis points of impact of delayed auction activity. So net, up about 120 basis points in occupancy. And that's really related to the operating trends that Joe highlighted as we move through the different phases and improving trends and move-ins and continued lower move-outs, coupled with the fact that our delinquencies process was underway, allowed us to re-rent that space and move occupancy higher as we move through July. So I hit on that just a moment ago, but I'll get a little bit more context on operating trends in July. Move-in volumes were better in the month of July. Move-in volumes were down about 2%. Move-out volumes were actually down about 15%, which led to an increase in occupancy through the months. And I just highlighted July 30th, our occupancy was up around 140 basis points year-over-year. I would note that about 20 basis points of that is related to delayed auction activity. Overall, July, we saw continued improving operating trends, as Joe mentioned earlier. So move-in rate change in the month of July was down a little over 4%, move-in volumes down about 2%, move-in rate down about 4%. I think we've spoken about this. I'll reiterate some of the comments. I obviously can't speak to what others are seeing in the industry. But I'll comment on what we're seeing, which we did see better collection trends and that's driving lower fees. It's also, as we move back to conducting auctions, that's reduced the amount of backlog. So, combination of conducting lean sales, as well as better collections leading to 20 basis points of aged delinquency. I would highlight that we obviously worked with customers throughout the second quarter on different ways. As I highlighted, about 7% of our customers requested some form of relief in the second quarter, and we're very receptive to those sorts of requests as we helped customers that were having a tough time. But those really started to moderate as we move through the quarter. And as Joe highlighted, as we move through the different phases of the second quarter, we started to see better trends there. I think your comment around government support is a good one. And I do think that be it unemployment benefits or $1,200 checks. There's no question that across the country folks got some support through the second quarter, which likely helped collections in our business and in many businesses. And I don't think we're alone to highlight the collections. We're good through the second quarter. I think if you were to listen to banks or to credit card companies, they would likely say something similar. So I think that there is some support there. And ultimately, we'll see what the trajectory is of that support going forward, and that could certainly have an impact on our collection trends and others in the industry as well. But we generally covered most of the different components of it. Maybe one more stat as we just disclosed stats around, on this particular topic. I highlighted that customers are paying us earlier and that's resulted in, if you just look at the snapshot at June 30, our our rent receivable from customers who are less than 60 days is down about 35%. So, customers are paying for their storage space and finding good value in it. And we're working with them and obviously working with those that have been impacted by the pandemic to make sure that they receive the appropriate accommodation as well. I don't have that number right in front of me. I could tell you that the move out rate was down 6% year-over-year and the move-in rate was down 4%. So good trends as it relates to year-over-year comps. I don't, at my fingertips, have rate per square foot but we can follow up with that if that's important to you, Steve."

            "name": "Joe Russell",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan. And thanks for joining us today. Before I open the call for questions, I would first like to acknowledge and thank the full Public Storage team along with our customers and business partners as we have come together to ensure a safe environment. In the last four months during this pandemic, we have moved in over 400,000 new customers, as we continue to operate our entire 2,500 property portfolio. Clearly, this volume of activity has been a validation of the strength of our platform and the resiliency of self-storage. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Sure, Jeff. Yes. There's no question, as I noted, that we've been very determined and focused on the amount of volume we've been able to pull into the portfolio, coupled with obviously a number of crosscurrents. So, if you step back and think about the last four months during the pandemic, we kind of think of going through four different phases. And the early part of the pandemic, March and April, we did a number of things to ensure all the right safety protocols, we suspended auctions and really made sure that our entire environment was safe and secure as we were able to continue to operate all of our properties. We saw a little bit of degradation in demand, after an initial rush that came to us through primarily college and university shutting down early. So, we saw a bit of a rush. But then, not long after that, we started to see a bit of degradation. But then, going into the next phase, the second phase, we began to put even more focus on customer focus. We again suspended auctions and we opened up to a degree some of the customer accommodation practices again to be reflective of the environment. And we became more focused on different tools around top of funnel demand through advertising and other things that were proving to be actually quite effective. So, we started to see the residual benefit of that, and again a lift in demand and move in volume. In that phase, again, we continued along those same lines but continue to put even more focus on the ways in which we were able to draw new customers to the portfolio, while month after month seeing a very positive impact from far fewer move outs. And then finally, the most recent phase as we stand through the month of July, we've actually now gone back to auctions. We have reinstituted rent increases in many parts of the portfolio. And again, we're starting to see very good reaction to the amount of activity, both on move-ins and lack of or lower move-outs. So, speaking to the second half of the year, yes, we do see a number of different pressures that I'll have Tom walk you through in a little bit more detail. But overall, as I noted, we've been very pleased by the overall resiliency and the ability on our part to continue to drive this level of demand, and literally we are dealing with in many markets record high levels of occupancy. Tom, why don't you give a little bit more color on second half of the year? No. I think, it's really pretty simple. Collection trends through the quarter were good. We had customers that were paying us earlier. We did have customers that while we had auctions paused for a period of time, stayed with us for a longer period of time. We've begun to work through that during the quarter. And so, right now, we're sitting with about 20 basis points of occupancy that is delayed auction activities. But, as you think about bad debt through the quarter, it was pretty consistent year-over-year. And frankly, as we sit here today, away from what was written off in the second quarter, the receivable, as we ended the quarter, was actually down a little year-over-year. Stepping back, it's obviously a focus of the team to focus on basics through the quarter, rent spaces and collecting rent. And I think, you saw a good customer reaction and validation that our spaces are important to them. And we saw a good team activity and rental activity. I think, there is also broader things that work. There's no question that government stimulus or government support for many individuals throughout the economy, we suspect helped our collection trends through the quarter. And as we look across industries, credit cards or otherwise, many other industries are seeing similar collection trends as the government has done a good bit to support individuals' finances. Yes. Sure, Smedes. There's no question, at the beginning of the pandemic, investment market on many fronts basically went into pause mode. We had, again, in the March and April timeframe, a handful of assets that had been already badded, we still thought they were very attractive investments for us to make. We closed on those deals toward the earlier part of the quarter. And then, things settled down. We actually began to see and continue through today a bit of an elevation of return to market and/or just conversations that we had in motion prior to the pandemic, a variety of different deals that continue to be particularly attractive. So, for the most part, the types of assets that are commanding normal or consistent cap rates, pre-pandemic, would be stabilized assets. There's still a lot of capital on the sidelines without looking for those types of investments. What we've done alternatively is look for, again, value opportunities, particularly around assets that may not be stabilized and/or in parts of our markets that we think round out our presence. So, we are seeing a little bit more opening up of owners that are coming back to the market, some of which do not see a way to basically get out of some of the constraints. They may be under for either lending reasons or not making the yields that they had expected. And those conversations are becoming more vibrant, I'll tell you that. And with that we've got, again, as we pointed to in the press release, we've got, a few assets that are in motion. And we're confident that we'll probably see more. There still are very few bigger portfolios on the market today. We are also seeing, maybe no surprise, a few more land holding opportunities coming up as well, where again, owners that have taken down positions and land maybe have taken them through various stages of entitlements that are not again seeing the pro forma and return expectations come through, particularly with what's going on with rates across most markets, are looking for a way to come out of those positions. So, the acquisition team is busy looking at many different types of opportunities. And we'll see how this continues to play for us in the coming quarters. Yes. I'll begin with part of what you saw in the second quarter, we had elevated payroll cost that was tied to our PS Cares Fund where we were again boosting pay rate within our hourly employee ranks as well as providing a number of different accommodations reflective of the environment to support costs tied to childcare, more opportunity to take PTO, and again, look at the different opportunities or challenges that the workforce at large was dealing with. So, the pay rate increase did end at the end of the second quarter. So, you'll see some moderation down and the elevated cost of payroll, which was about 20% in the second quarter. And then, we'll also, as you see, be looking at lower taxes potentially because we saw property taxes come in lower at about 3.6% in the second quarter. And then, the other thing that we're going to keep an eye on is the cost of advertising and promotions with the remaining -- rest of the year. Sure. Taking a step back, pausing on existing tenants for any month will have a meaningful impact on in-place rents. And so as we paused throughout the second quarter, there was a cumulative impact of several months of not sending existing tenant increases. As I highlighted, not only did we not send those during the second quarter, when we resent them and are sending increases in the second half, they are at lower magnitudes, given some of the regulations and things that we're doing to be mindful of the environment. So, as you think about the contribution to second quarter rental rate trends that you saw that on average rent per occupied square foot was down 2% in the second quarter, the largest component of that decline from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter was really no or very little contribution from existing tenant rate increase. Rest of it was rent roll down, which we disclosed our move-in and move-out trends throughout the second quarter, which also were clearly contributing factors, particularly early on in the quarter. Yes. We shouldn't have the same level of rental rate declines from existing tenants because we will be sending them out. And just even again a little bit more perspective, Ki Bin, as Tom said, through the quarter and even through July that level of customer request has continued to diminish, coupled with fact customers are paying on time. So, the customer behavior through the pandemic has actually been quite strong. And it validates the way in which our platform has been well-tuned to not only address an environment like this, but it's been able to optimize the collection process as a whole? One other thing to add is, auction activity, as I mentioned through the phases, we had paused on auction activity for a chunk of the second quarter. We are doing auctions again. We do have a few municipalities where we're being held back. But, our auction overhang is actually quite limited. It accounts for only about 20 basis points of our overall occupancy. So that too talks to the way that we continue to be optimized around our entire collection process, our customer engagement process. And we've been able to calibrate that very efficiently, even in an environment where there's been a number of hurdles that had limited us, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, to do auctions. And we are basically back in the auction business in many parts of the portfolio. We're certainly abiding by areas where we're unable to do auctions, but the meaningful chunk of that part of our business has returned. Ron, it's too soon to really tell if there's going to be a material and longstanding shift around suburban versus urban. We track by both areas. We look at density from a population standpoint how our properties are performing. You mentioned New York. Ironically, at the moment, New York's actually has been a huge beneficiary of the amount of demand that we've seen over the last quarter or so. San Francisco is the same. But again, we are not stepping back and basically putting any kind of a label on suburban versus urban, it's way too soon to tell. We have good diversification across all of our markets, I guess, whether they're in suburban or urban markets. And we will continue to track and see the lingering impact from the pandemic. And again, just the shift in overall patterns about where people choose to live, it's way too soon to tell. One thing that has been pronounced that we see from a demand standpoint in both markets is the work from home impact. We see many more of our customers coming to us, because they are not going to a traditional office they need more space at home. And by virtue of that, they're putting more stuff in our facilities. So that's been a meaningful additional demand factor that we've seen, both in urban and suburban markets. One area I would also add on is our non same store portfolio, in particular has been quite vibrant. We have a fair amount of both new development acquisition opportunities for customers to move in. And we've seen an inordinate amount of move-in activity, which has been quite a good surprise or a good benefit based on a number of things we're seeing from a trend standpoint. So, I mentioned that we've moved in about 400,000 customers in the last four months. If you just look at Q2 of the 300,000 or so customers that moved in, 60,000 of those move-ins came into our non same store portfolio. The non same store portfolio continues to do quite well from an occupancy growth standpoint and were up about 11%. Continue to see very good trends and tractions relative to both new builds, redevelopment, and acquisitions that we've added into the portfolio. That total pool is 13.5 million square feet and we continue to see very good performance and fill ups across all markets. Frankly, we haven't seen any of our acquisitions and developments going backwards in this environment. They have done the absolute opposite where they're filling up pretty dramatically. So Rick, we're going to continue as we always have to look in many markets, both within and outside the U.S. I wouldn't say that our focus has changed over the long-term any differently. There's no question over the last few months. We've put particular focus on everything that's going on right here in the United States. But over time, we will continue to assess and look at opportunities beyond the United States. There is still healthy amount of supply that continues to be delivered into 2020. Last quarter, we talked about the likelihood that it would be anywhere say 15% to 20% or so less than what was predicted, which would point to plus or minus at $5 billion or so level of deliveries in 2020. We think that's probably closer to $4 billion or less. There doesn't appear to be any slowdown this year anyway relative to those deliveries taking place. Although, some of them are taking longer. No surprise, many cities have slowed down their own approval processes, whether through inspections. Again, final occupancy permits, et cetera. So, we still think that there's a healthy amount of supply. It kind of goes into level of supply you saw in the 2017 or so era. Now looking out to '21 and beyond, I would expect, based again, on what I mentioned earlier. There will likely be more constraints around funding that many of these developers look for relative to construction loans. And again, the investment hurdles that either they and/or their partners are going to require to move forward on any particular acquisition, or any particular development, excuse me. So we're likely to see, again, another leg down. I don't know how hard and dramatic that might be. But it would be a welcome relief, particularly in the markets that we've been pointing to over the last couple of years that have been bit heavy with new supply. So, too soon to tell yet the lingering impact into '21 and beyond, but we're likely to see again another leg down. The number of properties we added to the platform in the quarter was nine. We have 106 properties now. The continues to grow. It's still dominated by properties that are going through various phases of construction. Although, we are also seeing stabilized and/or lease-up assets coming into the portfolio and the platform as well. So, not unlike what we saw in the acquisition arena to some degree, it would kick out a little quieter for a month or two on the early part of the pandemic. But as things have settled down, we're seeing good activity. And we continue to bring new properties into the platform, whether they're new and we're actually opening them. We opened again several in the quarter and we're bringing more into the portfolio as we're going through different phases of completion and development. The backlog is healthy and we're continuing to add to it. Well, Todd, I would just back up and give you maybe a little bit perspective on how we traditionally look at lease up periods to begin with, which frankly is, at the end of the day, no different now than it might've been pre pandemic. It's typical for a property to take three or four years to go through, not only occupancy, lease up at level of stability and stabilization that you're going to see from the maturing of the customer base, et cetera. So if anything, as I've mentioned, we've actually been seeing an accelerated lease up in properties that we put into development, redevelopment or even acquisition. And again, just because again we're even seeing that acceleration right now, we're not stepping back and retooling or resetting expectations. We'll have to see over time how this demand continues to trend. But it begins with the same premise, which is takes up to that three to four years typically for a property to get to that level of stabilization. We're going to look at that time period typically to decide whether or not to put the property in the same store and again, look at the stability that it typically plays out across different markets, et cetera. So no real change yet in the way that we're modeling and looking at the timeframe for stabilization. Sure, that's a good question. Unfortunately, I don't have a crystal ball in terms of exactly how the environment is going to play out from here. We're absolutely in an uncertain environment and one that none of us have lived through in the past to be able to understand what the healthcare impact, what the government policy impact will be and where we go from here is hard to predict, is no question starting the quarter with contract rents down 3.1%, is a much worse place than where we started the second quarter from a year-over-year standpoint. The benefits we have going into the third and fourth quarter are that right now, we are sending existing tenant rate increases but we're also being mindful of what the local jurisdictions regulations are around that and also the impact to our customer base in what is a tough healthcare environment. And so, I think it's hard to project going forward right now magnitude of those increases is lower year-over-year. So, that's not going to be a meaningful contributor to the upside of rental rate growth. And move in and move out trends, we're seeing good demand trends now and lower move outs. We've highlighted in the past that in the last downturn, we did see elevated move outs. We've seen the exact opposite this time to date. But we're also mindful that the healthcare situation could be having a significant impact on those trends. And as we move through this year and into next year, the developments on those fronts, I think will likely impact our move in and move out trends as well. So, I know that's a long winded way of saying. I don't really know when things would change materially. But I gave you a sense of what some of the drivers would be that would move in place rents. I think the one thing I'd remind you there is that we're still facing an environment that we were in the first quarter of significant new supply being delivered into many of our markets in addition to navigating through this unique pandemic environment. I think Joe highlighted the improving operating trends. If you looked at it on a market-by-market basis, I would say the healthcare environment and situation was the biggest driver of market variance of operating trends in April. But as we move through the quarter into June and July, the biggest differentials from a market standpoint on operating trends, like move in to move out has been more the typical things that we would have been talking about, the impact of new supply in many of our sub markets. And I think that's likely to persist here, as Joe mentioned, future deliveries. So, I don't think the operating environment is such that while we've seen improving trends that it's going to get materially better in any sort of base case. But ultimately, we'll see where we go. We're still dealing with a lot of the headwinds that we spoke about earlier in the year. It's still too soon, Todd. We will obviously continue to assess the variety of different impacts this kind of environment puts into different markets and sub markets. The business is still very dominated by that very small trade area that three to five miles zone and in an urban environment even much smaller. So again, the portfolio is highly diversified. We enjoy the benefits of the diversification and we'll continue to assess that on an ongoing basis, just like we always have."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Erica. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m here on the line of Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that all statements other than statements of historical fact included on this call are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the statements. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results that are described in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and in our reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, May 1, 2020. We assume no obligation to update or revise any of the statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website publicstorage.com. As usual, we do ask that you keep your questions limited to two initially. Of course, after that, please feel free to jump back in queue, if you have additional questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thank you, Ryan. And thank you for joining us. We wish the best for all of you listening in today, particularly those that have been personally impacted by the pandemic. I want to begin by thanking our employees, customers and business partners for their extraordinary efforts and flexibility as we adapt to this environment. Our focus is simple. Safety is the top priority in everything we do, protecting our employees and customers. We are operating our entire 2,500-plus portfolio in all markets as we are an essential business. The need for self-storage even in disruptive times like these is yet again being validated. In that regard, our priorities beyond safety includes servicing new and existing customers as our communities navigate through these challenging times. To do so, we are supporting our frontline employees in several ways to optimize customer service. Protocols are in place that reinforce social distancing, keeping properties clean, and offering customers multiple avenues to rent or access their space in a contactless way. At the start of the pandemic, we also established the PS Cares Fund, which provides childcare coverage, extended pay time off and additional hourly compensation to our entire team of property managers. I can\u2019t overstate how valuable their commitment to Public Storage has been and will continue to be as they serve our 1.5 million customers. As Public Storage approaches its 50th year, we have clearly weathered significant economic cycles, and this one will likely rank as one of the most extreme. We have a proven playbook to maneuver through severe economic and natural disasters. Our teams are battle tested, our product is resilient, and we have intentionally crafted a fortress balance sheet to not only survive, but thrive in times like these. At its core, the full Public Storage team is well equipped to not only face whatever challenges arise in the near term, but confidently, we will find new ways of applying our unique strength and fortitude to find opportunities. Now, I will hand the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. Good afternoon and hope all of you are doing okay. First question, just trying to tie some of the comments, Joe, you made on the, I guess fundamentals or what you\u2019re seeing and the market validates the stability of the sector, resilience in the past versus some of the -- I guess, the color around COVID-19 in your press release, which seemed to be much more cautious. Can you just, I guess, discuss? That\u2019s as my first question.\nJoe Russell: Yes. Sure, Jeff. So, again, we\u2019re obviously in an environment that is new and different for everybody. We\u2019ve all been through, a number of economic cycles of different degrees. As I mentioned, we, in particular, from time to time, go through what we call natural disasters, hurricanes, and otherwise. This is clearly even different than those because it\u2019s health and science related. The predictability of this environment is to be determined, at best with a lot of information none of us have dealt with before. When we do look back at prior cycles, again, our product type has played through very well and even the great recession. We were pleasantly surprised by again the resiliency and the adaptability and relevance of the property type itself. On one hand, we clearly know that there continues to be a high degree of need and usage of the product. This month or last month, April, we moved in 82,000 customers into our portfolio. Now, again, that\u2019s down, but on the flip side, there\u2019s vibrancy there, there\u2019s need. We see it also with the amount of activity at our properties that we can now track holistically, because we have a centralized access system. So, again, whether it\u2019s at a raw consumer level and/or anything that tiers into service oriented from a business that may or may not be facility, even the type of activity that\u2019s going on with this COVID economy. There is a true and I think valid need for the product itself. So we are looking at the future with a fair degree of caution, because, frankly, we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to play through. And I don\u2019t know how realistic you can predict anything, because we\u2019re six weeks into this. And there\u2019s just going to be a number of things as we\u2019re discovering day-to-day, week-to-week that this environment will create even additional types of pressure points that we haven\u2019t seen before. Now, again, other things though are somewhat similar so far to what we\u2019ve seen with extreme economic cycles. So, in the great recession, our delinquency hovered around, again, a 2% factor or so through the month of April, very similar. So, our customer base, even through the month of April, from a collection and payment standpoint, was consistent, even on a year-over-year basis. So, it\u2019s a mixture and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to again continue to react to. We\u2019ve got great tools to be nimble. We\u2019ve got great analytics to continue to address, again, whatever continues to surface or does surface that we need to address, and address through different tactics, strategies, et cetera. So, that would basically be an overview of how, again, we\u2019re looking at this environment, and clearly in a position that the predictability of it is still unknown.\nJeff Spector: My second question then, if we could talk about the strength of the balance sheet and opportunities. I think, you discussed this quickly in your opening remarks. Are you seeing -- what are you seeing today? And how should we think about this? And how can PSA take advantage during this downturn verse? I think one of the regrets was not being a bit more aggressive during the world financial crisis. \nJoe Russell: Sure. Well, Tom can talk a little bit more specifically about the balance sheet as it stands today. So, I\u2019ll let him do that in a sec. But, again, looking at extreme cycles like this one is likely to be, there is evidence, it\u2019s very early, but it won\u2019t be surprising. If, again, a number of owners that have come into the sector, particularly over the last three or four years where we\u2019ve seen an abundance of new supply coming into the market, particularly with owners and ownership structures that may not be well suited to deal with something like this. There could be, again, a predictable fact, which would be more ability to capture assets, again, a price point that we think is very different and much more attractive than it\u2019s been over the last, say, three or four years. We\u2019re starting to hear, again, some rumblings around assets that I would say are underwater, where they\u2019ve been funded through a certain level of debt. And the valuations are below that value. And so, we\u2019re starting, again, to hear some of that out in the market. And, again, it\u2019s early, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to us. And the ability for us to in particular, take advantage of an environment that could create that additional level of transaction activity, the balance sheet is ready for it. And it\u2019s ready in a meaningful way. So, we\u2019ll see how that plays through. And I\u2019ll hand it over to Tom. And he can give you a little bit more color on where the balance sheet stands today.\nTom Boyle: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Yes. Balance sheet is in great shape, as we\u2019ve discussed on previous quarterly calls. And we\u2019re sitting right now with debt to EBITDA just to touch over 1 times, fixed charge coverage around 8 times, and over $700 million in cash on the balance sheet. So, we feel very good about our financial and liquidity position to take advantage of potential opportunity, should it arise. As Joe mentioned, we\u2019re starting to see the early signs of that.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. I wish everyone well.\nJoe Russell: I appreciate, Jeff, you too. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeremy Metz: Hey, guys. Joe, Tom, I was wondering if you could just give a little more color on the trends and what happened in April in terms of occupancy and where you ended turnover move-in rents. And then it sounded like delinquencies were 2% for April and that was in line with last year. Was that right as well?\nTom Boyle: Sure, Jeremy. I\u2019ll walk through a number of those points. It\u2019s Tom. So, stepping back, looking at activity through the quarter and then into April, we had a pretty good quarter on move-in, which really began in January, February, we were up, call it 5%, 10% on move-ins in January. In March, we saw a meaningful increase in demand, as customers pulled forward activity that would typically occur later in the second quarter, most notably college students, and others ahead of stay-at-home orders. One week in March, for instance, move-ins were up about 20% to give you context. But then, that volume started to decline significantly, as folks were encouraged to stay at home. Overall search volumes have come down. Inbound sales calls are down about 25% in April. Web visits are down about 7% in April. Overall move-in activity through the month of April was down 17%, despite decreases in rental rates of circa 20% to drive volume across the country. So, for those customers that have a storage need, we\u2019re providing space with enhanced precautions in our properties and utilizing our e-rental online lease. Somewhat encouraging, as Joe mentioned, over 80% of last year\u2019s seasonal activity we experienced in April, which speaks to demand for the product even in tough times. Trends modestly improved as we moved through April. So, last week of April, for instance, move-in volumes were down about 11%. But again, it reduced rental rates. Somewhat offsetting the decline in move-ins was an anticipated decline in move-outs. So, move-out volumes, not taking into account auction-related move-outs was down 9% in the month of April. We\u2019re watching this metric closely and anticipate that stay-at-home orders are lifted, we may see an increase in pent-up move-out volume. We\u2019ve talked about in the past that in 2009, there was a shift in consumer behavior with longer length of stay customers moving out. We have not seen that to date. Our existing tenants continue to perform well and move-outs remain down. As Joe mentioned, we have seen less overall activity of property, so not just move-ins and move-outs, but customer visits to the property. Our new centralized access system gives us insights into what\u2019s going on at the properties, and April activity was down about 20% versus March. In terms of occupancy, we ended the first quarter up about 60, 70 basis points in occupancy. As we disclosed, part of that was attributable to the fact that we had postponed auctions of delinquent customers. We\u2019ve continued to do that through the month of April. So, our occupancy at the end of April was up about 30 basis points. But, if you take into account the fact that we have some customers with us that we may have otherwise auctioned in prior years, our occupancy was down on a year-over-year basis. Still up seasonally on an absolute basis, but down on a year-over-year basis. Moving to collections, which is the third prong of your commentary. As noted in the press release and as Joe just highlighted, April rent collections were very consistent with prior year, and that is consistent with what we saw in 2009. We\u2019ve collected about 95% of our April rent at this point, which is right in line with where we were last year at this time. So, as the duration of this pandemic elongates and we react to where we go from here, could very likely put more pressure on the consumer. And we\u2019ll have to monitor that as we go forward. But at this point, collections are very much in line.\nJeremy Metz: That\u2019s great color. And my second question, I\u2019m going to double up a little bit here. I just wanted to see, Tom, if you can expand a little more from what you see in April but kind of talk about it from a regional perspective. How\u2019s Texas performing, just given the fall off in energy, Southern California, given the closures, Florida, what about areas that are starting to reopen? What are you starting to see there? And then, just, if I could add on is just on the business customer side. It sounds like, they\u2019re pretty steady right now. But, when do you expect to start hearing from them and what sort of trajectory are you seeing there -- or would you foresee there? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: So, there are regional trends that are worth speaking to. I think, the high level takeaway is that the Northeast has been more impacted. And we\u2019ve seen slower rates of move-ins in the Northeast, also slower rates of move-outs, but slower rates of move-ins. So, as you look at New York or Boston or Philadelphia, and really, you can expand that up and down the East Coast because that would put Miami probably in that category as well. Along the West Coast, move-in volumes have been more similar with prior years, still down, but down more in the 5% to 10% range in many of those markets versus higher in the northeast. And then that extends through the Southwest and into Texas. Houston is a market that certainly with the combination of the pandemic as well as with what\u2019s going on with oil prices, one that we and we suspect others are watching closely, we have seen move-in volumes hold up reasonably well in Houston, but we have cut rate in order to drive that volume more meaningfully in Houston than we have in other markets in Texas and the West Coast that I highlighted.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning. I know that the industry has kind of gone to a temporary hold on existing customer rent increases, which has really been kind of the single driver of revenue growth for the industry. I\u2019m just curious, what is the timetable on that. I assume that that\u2019s still in place for May. And how long do you think that that might be on hold for?\nJoe Russell: Sure. So, we thought it made sense and was appropriate to pause that program as we move through March. And we did not send existing tenant rate increases out for June 1st billing. So, that will continue through the second quarter. Stepping back, existing tenant rent increases in a more normal time, are managed at a very granular level, using data analytics to drive, what we send, when we send it and the magnitude. That will be an important part of where we go from here and how we restart at the appropriate time, recognizing that consumer behavior could be a little bit different, post this event than what it was before. But, we\u2019ll be using the same tools that we have in the past in order to determine those rental rate increases and the appropriate time with which to send them.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. And Tom, just as a follow-up, is there something, is there a guidepost, is it about the amount of country that\u2019s open? I mean, what sort of guidepost should we be looking forward to kind of determine when those may be appropriate?\nTom Boyle: Yes. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a number of different things. Certainly, the situations that are going on in the local economies, consumer behavior that we\u2019re seeing, and we\u2019ll react to a number of those things as we see them. At this point, we thought it prudent not to send them out at the end of April for June 1 effective.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay, thanks. And you mentioned in the press release, increasing kind of hourly wages by $3 at least -- it sounded like at least for the second quarter. Maybe just talk about expenses overall. I think, maybe online marketing costs were still up. Just how are those trending and how do you expect employee costs to kind of trend through the balance of the year?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Steve, first on personnel-related expense. Yes, that\u2019ll be elevated through Q2, by virtue of the things that we\u2019ve discussed about. We put some information on that in the Q as well. And, again, we\u2019ll continue to moderate and understand, again, how we need to react to the overall environment going forward into the second half of the year. And we\u2019re looking at all expense levels across the Company as a whole. The burden of tax increases is still with us. We don\u2019t really have a way to predict that going one direction or another at the moment, other than that it\u2019s just continuing to be elevated. And Tom, can give you a little bit more color on another component of our expense tied to the advertising. So, again, that\u2019s been a vibrant tool for us. We\u2019re going to continue to use it aggressively. But, again, it\u2019s going to be a factor in the mix as well. We continue to look at all of our operational expenses, whether again, it\u2019s tied to vendor contracts, the amount of maintenance capital that we\u2019re putting into the portfolio, et cetera. So, it\u2019s definitely something that we continue to focus on and look for ways of, in this environment to optimizing overall cost levels. And, Tom, if you want to give a little bit more color on what we\u2019re doing with advertising and marketing spend?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Thanks, Joe. I\u2019d just briefly touch on that, because that\u2019s a lever that we pulled pretty hard through 2019 in the first quarter. And in the first quarter, like we saw last year, we saw pretty good demand response from that. And that\u2019s continued through in April. So, we\u2019re going to continue pushing pretty hard on advertising, as we continue to see a great response to the Public Storage brand, online. And so, we\u2019d anticipate that then remains somewhat elevated as we seek to drive volume to our website, call center and the properties.\nOperator: Your next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc.\nTodd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the April trends. That information is helpful. It sounds like you haven\u2019t yet seen an increase in move-outs though. And I\u2019m just curious, if you look back at prior cycles -- and I realize this is a different environment than what you\u2019ve seen in prior cycles. But any sense, what kind of lag you might expect to see between job loss and move-outs?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Todd, I think, looking back at 2009 as a guidepost, but 2009 was a different environment. And as I look at move-in, move-out trends in 2009, they were more gradual as they came on than what we\u2019ve seen to-date. So, to give you a context, we did see a material increase in move-outs. But as you look at the quarters in which they took place in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, the magnitude of those were in the mid-single-digits, which as you compare that to the orders of magnitude that we\u2019re seeing and the sharp decrease in move-ins and move-outs already at this juncture, given the pandemic, it\u2019s a different reaction, given the fact that folks are being encouraged to stay-at-home and we\u2019re all kind of awaiting scientific research and developments. So, I think it\u2019s hard to point back at that and say it\u2019s a perfect analog, to be honest. But, it did happen with increased move-outs pretty quickly on the back of declines in employment in the fourth quarter of 2008. I think, one of the biggest drivers now is not just job loss, as it relates to move-outs, but it\u2019s also the fact that there are customers who are staying at home and maybe don\u2019t want to come visit our properties to move out right now, because they feel good about the safety and security of their goods at our properties. So, we\u2019ll see where we go from here. But, your point that you made is the right one, which is we have not seen any noticeable shift to-date and in fact move-ins -- move-outs are down.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, the rent reductions for new move-in customers that you mentioned, Tom, I think 20%, is that across the platform on average? And can you talk about whether or not you anticipate needing to change pricing going forward here, based on, either call volumes or site visits and just I guess rentals and conversions overall?\nTom Boyle: Yes, sure. We do actively manage our pricing on a day-to-day basis across the country at a unit size and property level basis. And so, as you would expect, my comments around volumes being different by region, pricing strategy is different by region as well. And so, there\u2019s some regions in the country where pricing is only down, call it 5% year-over-year, and there\u2019s others where pricing is down 30%. And so, there\u2019s a good mix there. And we\u2019re managing that dynamically in order to drive both, volume as well as revenue outcome.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. But normally in the peak leasing season, there would be a few large net move-in months in a row. You\u2019d be raising rates, right? So, you\u2019re discounting and lowering rents here. Do you expect to be able to begin to take that pressure off a little bit and be able to move rents higher on a seasonal basis at all throughout the spring and summer months?\nTom Boyle: Well, I think, looking at last year as a guidepost is probably thrown out the window. We manage our pricing, advertising, promotion strategies on a realtime basis at all times regardless of what\u2019s going on. And certainly, we\u2019re reacting to different signals that are coming in this year than what we saw last year. Your point on seasonality, we\u2019ve already seen an impact to the seasonality to-date, which is the college students that with college going to e-learning and shutting down physical presence in the month of March, we saw that activity pull forward. As we move into the month of May and June, you\u2019d have other seasonal use cases that would come up. Whether we see those this year, I think is to be determined and may very well differ materially by region and jurisdiction, given how things are managed with stay-at-home orders this year. So, I think it\u2019s too early to comment too much on what seasonality may play out through the second and third quarters. But, we\u2019ll be managing real time as we always do.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to just ask you, going back to the compensation increases that you put in place for the second quarter, and you noted that you might extend them. And I was just wondering, if the decision around potentially extending them to do with shutdowns and disruption from this pandemic, or is it more just a reflection of kind of competition for that level of worker at the property level or kind of I guess what are the issues that would help you make that decision?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Smedes. Yes. I wouldn\u2019t take that as we intend to do any of the things you\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s really, we felt comfortable in the near term that the range of issues that our employee base was facing, we thought the right thing to do was to elevate their level of overall compensation and other tools they had at their disposal that we could help fund, whether it was childcare or extended time off, et cetera. So, again, because of the unpredictability going into the second half of this year, and frankly, even for the rest of this quarter, I mean, we\u2019ll see how things go. I\u2019ll tell you though that the variety of wage rates we have nationally is something that we constantly do evaluate, we look at again the relative pay for the scope and the applicability of skill for the type of compensation that we have, and we think we\u2019re aligned in that regard. And again, that\u2019s just something that we\u2019ll continue to be fluid. Clearly one of the things that we have the ability to do and we clearly thought it was the right thing to do was to, again, give additional support to our frontline workers in particular, as I mentioned in my opening comments a critical part of our overall operational strategies and taking care of customers, et cetera. So it\u2019s just something that will continue to evaluate, again, in an environment that has a lot of unpredictability, even around the way even some of the stimulus packages are working and other things that are at everybody\u2019s potential access, but at the same time, knowing that we have the ability to give additional support and we thought it was the right thing to do.\nSmedes Rose: Yes. That makes sense. Thank you. I mean, the other thing I just want to ask you for the behavior -- or sort of pricing behavior of facilities that are still in lease-up. Has PSA taken a more aggressive approach on rates there, just to kind of gain, whatever kind of market share there is available or what\u2019s happened, I guess, specifically at those properties versus your stabilized assets?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Smedes, those properties continue to lease up. We have reacted to the new pricing environment and have lowered pricing on many of those as well. But, again, depending on the level of volume and interest going on in those individual markets, it\u2019s around the trade areas of those properties. But they\u2019ve continued to lease up through the month of April, which we\u2019re encouraged by, albeit at lower pricing.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Great, thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: Hey. Good morning out there. First off, thanks for the outlook commentary in yesterday\u2019s release. I found it to be very helpful. Could you just remind us of your average length of stay, which I believe is a bit higher than your appears? And do you think that makes them more or less price sensitive to renewal rate increases whenever those are, of course, slated to resume?\nTom Boyle: Sure, our average length of stay is right around 10 months. And that\u2019s really a barbell between some customers that have use cases for storage that are very short-term in nature, be it between apartments et cetera. And those customers that are using the space for longer term needs, be it a storing seasonal goods, businesses, an extension of folks\u2019 homes et cetera. And in terms of sensitivity to rate increases, there\u2019s a lots of different factors that play into that, stickiness of customers, once you get past really that one year mark is quite sticky. And that\u2019s remained the case through the month of April. And we\u2019ll have to evaluate what consumer behavior may change and business behavior may change as we move through navigating this pandemic. But at this point, no changes.\nJonathan Hughes: Maybe another -- maybe a similar question. I mean, what percentage of your customers have been there for over a year and over two years?\nTom Boyle: Yes. About 60% of our customers, a little less than 60% of our customers have been with us for longer than a year and a little over 40% of our customers have been with us for longer than two.\nJonathan Hughes: And what percentage of those are on AutoPay?\nTom Boyle: Yes. A good percentage -- AutoPay for us is around 50% of the tenant base. We haven\u2019t seen any change in AutoPay signups or any cancellation trends. It\u2019s very consistent.\nJonathan Hughes: I\u2019m going to sneak in one more. Have you looked at expanding the size of your credit facility to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities, or do you feel you have enough capacity with free cash flow, and what\u2019s your cash and revolver capacity for any opportunities you pursue?\nTom Boyle: Yes, sure. I think, we feel very good about our current liquidity with over $700 million in cash on the balance sheet, entirely undrawn revolver and access to capital markets, given our uniquely low leverage and high coverage. And so, we feel very good about the firepower we have in order to fund potential opportunities. And we await that opportunity in the next several quarters.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey. Just a couple of quick ones. Thanks for the disclosure. I thought that was very helpful. The first is just, can you just talk about maybe sort of the small business tenant in the portfolio? Just high level, sort of where the exposure and how are they faring in this environment, to the extent that you can?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So, small business customers are a component of our tenant base. They typically are good paying customers as it relates to collections and that\u2019s continued through the month of April. And the one notable trend I would highlight is, we have seen a decrease in move-in volume more pronounced for business customers than we have for individual consumers, particularly over the last four weeks. So, that\u2019s not surprising in this environment, given the fact that many businesses are not open and operational and folks are being encouraged to stay-at-home. So, I wouldn\u2019t point to anything concerning there, but we have seen a decline in move-in volume more so.\nRonald Kamdem: And what percent is the business customer of the portfolio?\nTom Boyle: Yes. So, there\u2019s a variety of different businesses that use our space. We have about 5%, 6% of customers that are true businesses that sign business leases with us. And then, we have appreciably more customers that are business users that by survey indicate something, more like 15%, 20% of our customer base, which is sales reps and others that use our space. And those customers -- so, yes, that gives you a sense of the composition.\nRonald Kamdem: Very helpful. Just another quick one. Just looking at late charges and administrative fees, just saw it was down 3.5% year-over-year. Is there a thought, either this go round or did you do this last cycle as well in terms of trying to deal with customers and potentially waiving some late fees or is there sort of no change in strategy there?\nTom Boyle: Yes, sure. So, one of the things that we did was provide some incremental customer accommodation for those impacted by the pandemic. And I would highlight that our operational teams have dealt with crisis situations over the past several years and are well-equipped to deal with situations that materially impact local communities. And so, while that\u2019s historically happened in very tight geographies, in this case, it really happened across the country, but our operational team pivoted to that stance very quickly and effectively. And so, we are, waiving fees, reducing rent in some instances and working with delinquent customers across the country for those impacted by the COVID pandemic. We already talked about the fact that we\u2019ve paused auctions and existing tenant rate increases as well, but I\u2019ve been really impressed by our operation team\u2019s ability to move into crisis mode and to help those that have been impacted to-date. And that is a driver of some of the fees that you highlight, and would expect that to be the case as we move through the second quarter as well.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. One more if I may. I just was noticing that -- I think Minneapolis was -- looked like it was additive in the Q this quarter in terms of markets you called with supply, hopefully I got that right. But, could you just maybe provide a little bit more color or maybe what\u2019s happening there to warrant that call out?\nJoe Russell : Yes. Sure, Ronald. Minneapolis is a market that, first of all, we have significant market share and presence. So, over the last two years, we\u2019ve boosted that by doing three things. We\u2019ve added to our own portfolio through acquisitions, ground up development and redevelopment in a market that we hadn\u2019t actually had a lot of investment activity in for some time. We like and see I think very good long-term traction relative to the market itself and the additional inventory and new properties that we put into that market. All told, for us directly is about 10,000 units. And lease-up there is going well on the new properties. We\u2019re not seeing a like-for-like additional magnitude of new development going in the market, but there\u2019s some. But, we felt it was relevant to call it out because, again, our same-store is not progressing as well as some other markets have been in the near-term. But, we feel like the stabilization that will take place over the next one to two years as, again, we see good absorption of the new product and any of the things that are happening in our existing properties correct as well. So, again, the market is I think well-poised for future growth. And we\u2019re really pleased with the additive scale and the range of new assets, either directly built and/or acquired that we put into that market.\nRyan Burke: It\u2019s Ryan Burke. We do have a number of analysts left that want to ask questions. So, please do try to keep it to two and then feel free to jump back in queue.\nRonald Kamdem: Sure, thanks. Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Thanks, Ronald.\nOperator: Your next question is from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.\nTodd Stender: Hi. Thanks. Just to flash out that rent relief question that you may offer tenants, if they ask. Is it deferred, is it the expectation that you\u2019ll receive it later on? Maybe just trying to flush that out, is it a maintenance -- ability to maintain occupancy, so you\u2019ll give a rent holiday? How are you looking at that?\nTom Boyle: Yes. I would say, first off, it\u2019s been a relatively modest amount of requests that have come in for things like that. We have a little bit of a different business than many other real estate asset types that may have long term leases and may be talking about blend and extends and things like that. We have month to month leases. So, as we think about customers and their rent and navigating this environment, obviously one of the choices that customers have is they have the ability to move out. And so, extending payment plans or otherwise are a little bit less applicable for our product type than others. But, we have a variety of different tools to work with customers impacted by this pandemic.\nTodd Stender: Right, understood. And then, how about your stance on share buybacks, as you look at the stock come inside of maybe our NAV estimate. Are you looking at putting cash to work, should the stock decline?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Stock buybacks are something that one, we have authorization from the Board to undertake; and two, it\u2019s part of our regular capital allocation dialogue. We are hopeful and optimistic that this pandemic could create a different business environment and different acquisition pricing environment, which could allow us to use our balance sheet to grow the portfolio in an attractive manner. And we will see how that plays out. And in addition to that, stock buybacks are another tool that we have to allocate capital. At this point, we have not bought back in stock.\nTodd Stender: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. I just want to verify a couple comments you guys made earlier. You said April -- at the end of April, occupancy was up 30 basis points, but that included some units that were -- haven\u2019t been auctioned off yet. So, if you look at it, maybe from a paying occupancy standpoint, how does April look year-over-year?\nTom Boyle: Well, we finished April down about 40, 50 basis points in occupancy, if you take out those units that may have been auctioned in the previous year.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And in terms of move-in rates, you ended the first quarter down 4.2%. How did that trend in April?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Ki Bin, I\u2019ve already commented on that in terms of the range of different move-in rates by different markets, on average. It\u2019s down around 20%.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Sorry. I was confused about volume versus rate. All right. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan.\nMike Mueller: In terms of the planned capital spending that you talked about the case for property upgrades and everything. Is there going to be any disruption to that or any notable change to the budgeted amounts? \nTom Boyle: So, yes, Mike, we obviously reset that from what we spoke to a quarter ago where we were looking at something along the lines of $250 million or so. And we have reset that to about $175 million. So, there\u2019s some things in the mix there that have led to the reduction. One is, a number of the capital projects that we launched into 2019 carried into this year along with some of our strategic investments around what we call our Property of Tomorrow initiative. We\u2019ve tapered that down knowing that we\u2019re going to be looking at delays from -- and approval and/or permitting basis in one regard through the next few months, based on what we\u2019re seeing at the moment, as cities have shut down many of their own staffing levels and/or sets of approvals that come through when you\u2019re doing work along those lines, coupled with the fact that we think we\u2019re going to go into a much more beneficial arena, even for bidding and continuing from a scale standpoint, the transition of properties to our Gen 5 standard that the Property of Tomorrow programs align with. So, that was one component. A number of other things that also we were intending to do through this year, not in any way related to functionality of properties or anything else, but it just makes sense based on availability and predictability of not only vendor effectiveness but even from a cost standpoint, we think we\u2019re going to be much better suited to do more of that going into 2021. On the flip side of that, we still are anticipating about $175 million that will happen this year. And it ties to things that we will continue to do as we always do, keeping our properties highly functional, doing repairs, doing everything that we can to facilitate high degree of customer move-ins and high occupancy. We also still are doing a few things that vendor friction aside that we think we can still do in this environment that would also relate to upgrades to LED and energy efficiency. We\u2019re putting solar on a number of properties. So, that\u2019s really what\u2019s led to the reset on our expectation for 2020.\nOperator: Your next question is from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisor.\nSpenser Allaway: Actually, all of my questions have been asked. Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Parker Decraene with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here. So, just a couple of questions. The first is more strategic. This pandemic is going to change the way we live, work and play, both in the near-term, but certainly over a longer term. Have you given thought about the live part of it in? And if there is going to be a shift of population out of urban dense cities into more suburban house living, even a modest shift, but it could certainly accelerate, how does that change the dynamics of demand for your product?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Michael, we\u2019ll see how that does play through. Obviously, we have the benefit with 2,500 locations, 38 states. We\u2019ve got a sizeable portfolio of both urban and suburban related. It\u2019s too soon to tell yet, if one is being benefited versus the other. So, we\u2019ll assess that and see what kinds of trends might play through just on, again, how the population shifts one direction or another from, as you mentioned, a pure urban desirability to something that maybe more desirable from a suburban standpoint. But, don\u2019t know yet. But, we\u2019ve got plenty of tentacles out there as we continue to see the type of impact that this environment may create in that regard. It\u2019s not coming through yet meaningful, other than Tom mentioned that we have seen a little bit more of a impact in the Northeast, and I think you can make sense of that really more from a health standpoint and a science standpoint, because that\u2019s frankly where the most dramatic impact to the COVID virus has been so far. And again, many of those communities are in major lockdowns. So, we\u2019ll see. And we play in both arenas very actively, continually as we speak. We\u2019re making development decisions, both in suburban and urban markets. We use a lot of demographic data to point us even on a very micro basis where to locate and invest in properties, where we think we can continue to see good demand.\nMichael Bilerman: And I think about the shift that you made into some extraordinary larger facilities in more urban markets. Is there anything you can glean from those during this pandemic yet?\nTom Boyle: It\u2019s tough. Michael, it\u2019s really tough to isolate what longer term trends will be based on the last six weeks that we\u2019ve been navigating this pandemic. Because I think the bigger driver of activity over the past 6 weeks has been people dealing with this crisis and navigating it both for their personal use as well as for their business. And I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s indicative of what the longer term impact, to your point to that could be 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 years down the road as it relates to customers\u2019 affinity towards urban living versus suburban or ex-urb living. The last 6 weeks wouldn\u2019t point to anything notable, and they\u2019ve been a very unique 6 weeks in our history.\nJoe Russell: Yes. And I think, the other thing is, again the reason, we think through and design and either build or invest in our larger assets, whether again, they\u2019re in urban or suburban markets is, it\u2019s highly correlated to again demographic data, which is both, population based and it\u2019s competitive based. So, some of our very largest properties even through the last few weeks are doing just as well as they\u2019ve done historically.\nMichael Bilerman: Right.\nJoe Russell: So, it\u2019s way too soon to tell.\nMichael Bilerman: And then, second question is just in terms of operations, and thank you for the detail on the Q in the press release. Can you talk about same-store NOI being negative for the rest of the year, given the pressures on revenues and certainly the investments you\u2019re making in your employee base and to keep your facility safe and clean, and so about the revenue and expense impact? If you look to the last two recessions that we\u2019ve gone through, in the early 2000s, same-store NOI cost in the self-storage sector was down high--single-digits year-over-year basis. If you go back to the \u201809, \u201810\u2019s timeframe, it was down 4 to 6% on a quarterly -- year-over-year basis. How should we -- what type of goalposts should investors think about in terms of the rate of decline? I think, you talked about it will be a much quicker impact to your business than the prior recessions, just given all these stay-at-home orders and a complete halt in the economy. Should we be gearing up for a high-single-digit, maybe even a double-digit decline given a expense drag? Is that where our mind should be at by the end of the year?\nJoe Russell: Well, Michael, first of all, you know well, we don\u2019t guide, even in \u201cnormal times\u201d. And it\u2019s the crystal ball. I mean, we clearly don\u2019t know what direction this could play through. You\u2019re right. I mean, it has been a severe and very dramatic change, jobless claims are down at 30 million. I mean, that\u2019s a massive shock to the entire economy. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take for that to correct. I don\u2019t know how long it will play through, what kind of impact it could have on our broad customer base, and GDP growth is going to be ugly from a predictability standpoint, this quarter in particular. So, we\u2019ll see.\nTom Boyle: Yes. And Michael, you obviously point to the right historical benchmarks, but I\u2019m not sure that they\u2019re really analogous to my points earlier and to Joe\u2019s comments. So, we provided some line by line detail as to what we\u2019re seeing at this point. As we move forward through 2020, a lot of what we see will be driven by science and political decisions of which is difficult to underwrite. And, we try to provide you the color and the context around what the drivers are, but we\u2019ll see as we go from here.\nMichael Bilerman: Yes. No, I know, you don\u2019t provide guidance and that\u2019s why I said, I appreciate the details and taking all the questions on the call about impact. You did put out there a negative number. I just didn\u2019t know whether you could at least goalpost a little bit about how negative. Well, that\u2019s what I was just trying to frame.\nJoe Russell: Yes. For eight quarters, it\u2019s kind of between 1% and 2%, so.\nTom Boyle: Right. Yes. So revenue growth is between 1% and 2% for the last eight quarters. And I think over that last eight quarters, same-store NOI has probably been -- with maybe the exception of third quarter last year, between 0% and 1%.\nJoe Russell: Yes.\nTom Boyle: So, certainly we\u2019re not in that environment that we were in over the last eight quarters. We\u2019re seeing a decline in move-in volumes. Our existing tenants are performing well at this point, but we remain to see where they go from here. And collections have been solid in April.\nMichael Bilerman: Yes. Thanks for the time.\nJoe Russell: Great. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeremy Metz: Hey. Just one quick follow-up. Joe and Tom, you guys both commented earlier on capital allocations, you mentioned acquisitions. You had a question about stock buybacks in there somewhere. I was just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the marginal dollar there versus reinvesting in your existing portfolio, just given the pullback that we saw outlined in the Q for the CapEx program.\nJoe Russell: Yes. Jeremy, like always, as Tom alluded to, I mean, that\u2019s -- stock buyback is in and of itself from a capital allocation decisions, something that, again, has always been an alternative. We\u2019ll continue to assess it. I couldn\u2019t at this point guide you to, okay, where\u2019s it stack ranker, how are we benchmarking it against, other uses of capital at the moment. The thing that\u2019s on the horizon, likely, though, that we\u2019ve already talked to is, with the potential impact to a number of owners that have put anywhere from say 1,500 to 2,000 properties collectively into our sector over the last three to four years, a lot of those investments are not going to come close to the pro forma expectations or underwriting hurdles that they had put forth. So, we would anticipate but we\u2019ll see that like other big corrections that this too will lead to an opportunity for us to allocate capital that direction, but to be determined. So, we\u2019ve got a variety of different capital allocation options, and we\u2019ll continue to assess them as this thing plays through.\nJeremy Metz: Yes. No, that\u2019s right. I think, I was just trying to think through high-grading the portfolio externally versus focusing on the internal, which you guys have made a big priority in recent years. So, I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nJoe Russell: Yes. Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Ryan Burke for any closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We certainly hope the best for everyone as we continue to manage through this interesting environment.\nJoe Russell: Thanks, all. Stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Joe. Yes. Balance sheet is in great shape, as we've discussed on previous quarterly calls. And we're sitting right now with debt to EBITDA just to touch over 1 times, fixed charge coverage around 8 times, and over $700 million in cash on the balance sheet. So, we feel very good about our financial and liquidity position to take advantage of potential opportunity, should it arise. As Joe mentioned, we're starting to see the early signs of that. Thank you. Sure, Jeremy. I'll walk through a number of those points. It's Tom. So, stepping back, looking at activity through the quarter and then into April, we had a pretty good quarter on move-in, which really began in January, February, we were up, call it 5%, 10% on move-ins in January. In March, we saw a meaningful increase in demand, as customers pulled forward activity that would typically occur later in the second quarter, most notably college students, and others ahead of stay-at-home orders. One week in March, for instance, move-ins were up about 20% to give you context. But then, that volume started to decline significantly, as folks were encouraged to stay at home. Overall search volumes have come down. Inbound sales calls are down about 25% in April. Web visits are down about 7% in April. Overall move-in activity through the month of April was down 17%, despite decreases in rental rates of circa 20% to drive volume across the country. So, for those customers that have a storage need, we're providing space with enhanced precautions in our properties and utilizing our e-rental online lease. Somewhat encouraging, as Joe mentioned, over 80% of last year's seasonal activity we experienced in April, which speaks to demand for the product even in tough times. Trends modestly improved as we moved through April. So, last week of April, for instance, move-in volumes were down about 11%. But again, it reduced rental rates. Somewhat offsetting the decline in move-ins was an anticipated decline in move-outs. So, move-out volumes, not taking into account auction-related move-outs was down 9% in the month of April. We're watching this metric closely and anticipate that stay-at-home orders are lifted, we may see an increase in pent-up move-out volume. We've talked about in the past that in 2009, there was a shift in consumer behavior with longer length of stay customers moving out. We have not seen that to date. Our existing tenants continue to perform well and move-outs remain down. As Joe mentioned, we have seen less overall activity of property, so not just move-ins and move-outs, but customer visits to the property. Our new centralized access system gives us insights into what's going on at the properties, and April activity was down about 20% versus March. In terms of occupancy, we ended the first quarter up about 60, 70 basis points in occupancy. As we disclosed, part of that was attributable to the fact that we had postponed auctions of delinquent customers. We've continued to do that through the month of April. So, our occupancy at the end of April was up about 30 basis points. But, if you take into account the fact that we have some customers with us that we may have otherwise auctioned in prior years, our occupancy was down on a year-over-year basis. Still up seasonally on an absolute basis, but down on a year-over-year basis. Moving to collections, which is the third prong of your commentary. As noted in the press release and as Joe just highlighted, April rent collections were very consistent with prior year, and that is consistent with what we saw in 2009. We've collected about 95% of our April rent at this point, which is right in line with where we were last year at this time. So, as the duration of this pandemic elongates and we react to where we go from here, could very likely put more pressure on the consumer. And we'll have to monitor that as we go forward. But at this point, collections are very much in line. So, there are regional trends that are worth speaking to. I think, the high level takeaway is that the Northeast has been more impacted. And we've seen slower rates of move-ins in the Northeast, also slower rates of move-outs, but slower rates of move-ins. So, as you look at New York or Boston or Philadelphia, and really, you can expand that up and down the East Coast because that would put Miami probably in that category as well. Along the West Coast, move-in volumes have been more similar with prior years, still down, but down more in the 5% to 10% range in many of those markets versus higher in the northeast. And then that extends through the Southwest and into Texas. Houston is a market that certainly with the combination of the pandemic as well as with what's going on with oil prices, one that we and we suspect others are watching closely, we have seen move-in volumes hold up reasonably well in Houston, but we have cut rate in order to drive that volume more meaningfully in Houston than we have in other markets in Texas and the West Coast that I highlighted. Yes. I'd say, it's a number of different things. Certainly, the situations that are going on in the local economies, consumer behavior that we're seeing, and we'll react to a number of those things as we see them. At this point, we thought it prudent not to send them out at the end of April for June 1 effective. Sure. Thanks, Joe. I'd just briefly touch on that, because that's a lever that we pulled pretty hard through 2019 in the first quarter. And in the first quarter, like we saw last year, we saw pretty good demand response from that. And that's continued through in April. So, we're going to continue pushing pretty hard on advertising, as we continue to see a great response to the Public Storage brand, online. And so, we'd anticipate that then remains somewhat elevated as we seek to drive volume to our website, call center and the properties. Sure. Todd, I think, looking back at 2009 as a guidepost, but 2009 was a different environment. And as I look at move-in, move-out trends in 2009, they were more gradual as they came on than what we've seen to-date. So, to give you a context, we did see a material increase in move-outs. But as you look at the quarters in which they took place in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, the magnitude of those were in the mid-single-digits, which as you compare that to the orders of magnitude that we're seeing and the sharp decrease in move-ins and move-outs already at this juncture, given the pandemic, it's a different reaction, given the fact that folks are being encouraged to stay-at-home and we're all kind of awaiting scientific research and developments. So, I think it's hard to point back at that and say it's a perfect analog, to be honest. But, it did happen with increased move-outs pretty quickly on the back of declines in employment in the fourth quarter of 2008. I think, one of the biggest drivers now is not just job loss, as it relates to move-outs, but it's also the fact that there are customers who are staying at home and maybe don't want to come visit our properties to move out right now, because they feel good about the safety and security of their goods at our properties. So, we'll see where we go from here. But, your point that you made is the right one, which is we have not seen any noticeable shift to-date and in fact move-ins -- move-outs are down. Yes, sure. We do actively manage our pricing on a day-to-day basis across the country at a unit size and property level basis. And so, as you would expect, my comments around volumes being different by region, pricing strategy is different by region as well. And so, there's some regions in the country where pricing is only down, call it 5% year-over-year, and there's others where pricing is down 30%. And so, there's a good mix there. And we're managing that dynamically in order to drive both, volume as well as revenue outcome. Well, I think, looking at last year as a guidepost is probably thrown out the window. We manage our pricing, advertising, promotion strategies on a realtime basis at all times regardless of what's going on. And certainly, we're reacting to different signals that are coming in this year than what we saw last year. Your point on seasonality, we've already seen an impact to the seasonality to-date, which is the college students that with college going to e-learning and shutting down physical presence in the month of March, we saw that activity pull forward. As we move into the month of May and June, you'd have other seasonal use cases that would come up. Whether we see those this year, I think is to be determined and may very well differ materially by region and jurisdiction, given how things are managed with stay-at-home orders this year. So, I think it's too early to comment too much on what seasonality may play out through the second and third quarters. But, we'll be managing real time as we always do. Thank you. Sure, our average length of stay is right around 10 months. And that's really a barbell between some customers that have use cases for storage that are very short-term in nature, be it between apartments et cetera. And those customers that are using the space for longer term needs, be it a storing seasonal goods, businesses, an extension of folks' homes et cetera. And in terms of sensitivity to rate increases, there's a lots of different factors that play into that, stickiness of customers, once you get past really that one year mark is quite sticky. And that's remained the case through the month of April. And we'll have to evaluate what consumer behavior may change and business behavior may change as we move through navigating this pandemic. But at this point, no changes. Yes. About 60% of our customers, a little less than 60% of our customers have been with us for longer than a year and a little over 40% of our customers have been with us for longer than two. Yes. A good percentage -- AutoPay for us is around 50% of the tenant base. We haven't seen any change in AutoPay signups or any cancellation trends. It's very consistent. Yes, sure. I think, we feel very good about our current liquidity with over $700 million in cash on the balance sheet, entirely undrawn revolver and access to capital markets, given our uniquely low leverage and high coverage. And so, we feel very good about the firepower we have in order to fund potential opportunities. And we await that opportunity in the next several quarters. Sure. So, small business customers are a component of our tenant base. They typically are good paying customers as it relates to collections and that's continued through the month of April. And the one notable trend I would highlight is, we have seen a decrease in move-in volume more pronounced for business customers than we have for individual consumers, particularly over the last four weeks. So, that's not surprising in this environment, given the fact that many businesses are not open and operational and folks are being encouraged to stay-at-home. So, I wouldn't point to anything concerning there, but we have seen a decline in move-in volume more so. Yes. So, there's a variety of different businesses that use our space. We have about 5%, 6% of customers that are true businesses that sign business leases with us. And then, we have appreciably more customers that are business users that by survey indicate something, more like 15%, 20% of our customer base, which is sales reps and others that use our space. And those customers -- so, yes, that gives you a sense of the composition. Yes, sure. So, one of the things that we did was provide some incremental customer accommodation for those impacted by the pandemic. And I would highlight that our operational teams have dealt with crisis situations over the past several years and are well-equipped to deal with situations that materially impact local communities. And so, while that's historically happened in very tight geographies, in this case, it really happened across the country, but our operational team pivoted to that stance very quickly and effectively. And so, we are, waiving fees, reducing rent in some instances and working with delinquent customers across the country for those impacted by the COVID pandemic. We already talked about the fact that we've paused auctions and existing tenant rate increases as well, but I've been really impressed by our operation team's ability to move into crisis mode and to help those that have been impacted to-date. And that is a driver of some of the fees that you highlight, and would expect that to be the case as we move through the second quarter as well. Yes. I would say, first off, it's been a relatively modest amount of requests that have come in for things like that. We have a little bit of a different business than many other real estate asset types that may have long term leases and may be talking about blend and extends and things like that. We have month to month leases. So, as we think about customers and their rent and navigating this environment, obviously one of the choices that customers have is they have the ability to move out. And so, extending payment plans or otherwise are a little bit less applicable for our product type than others. But, we have a variety of different tools to work with customers impacted by this pandemic. Sure. Stock buybacks are something that one, we have authorization from the Board to undertake; and two, it's part of our regular capital allocation dialogue. We are hopeful and optimistic that this pandemic could create a different business environment and different acquisition pricing environment, which could allow us to use our balance sheet to grow the portfolio in an attractive manner. And we will see how that plays out. And in addition to that, stock buybacks are another tool that we have to allocate capital. At this point, we have not bought back in stock. Thanks. Well, we finished April down about 40, 50 basis points in occupancy, if you take out those units that may have been auctioned in the previous year. Yes. Ki Bin, I've already commented on that in terms of the range of different move-in rates by different markets, on average. It's down around 20%. Great. Thank you. So, yes, Mike, we obviously reset that from what we spoke to a quarter ago where we were looking at something along the lines of $250 million or so. And we have reset that to about $175 million. So, there's some things in the mix there that have led to the reduction. One is, a number of the capital projects that we launched into 2019 carried into this year along with some of our strategic investments around what we call our Property of Tomorrow initiative. We've tapered that down knowing that we're going to be looking at delays from -- and approval and/or permitting basis in one regard through the next few months, based on what we're seeing at the moment, as cities have shut down many of their own staffing levels and/or sets of approvals that come through when you're doing work along those lines, coupled with the fact that we think we're going to go into a much more beneficial arena, even for bidding and continuing from a scale standpoint, the transition of properties to our Gen 5 standard that the Property of Tomorrow programs align with. So, that was one component. A number of other things that also we were intending to do through this year, not in any way related to functionality of properties or anything else, but it just makes sense based on availability and predictability of not only vendor effectiveness but even from a cost standpoint, we think we're going to be much better suited to do more of that going into 2021. On the flip side of that, we still are anticipating about $175 million that will happen this year. And it ties to things that we will continue to do as we always do, keeping our properties highly functional, doing repairs, doing everything that we can to facilitate high degree of customer move-ins and high occupancy. We also still are doing a few things that vendor friction aside that we think we can still do in this environment that would also relate to upgrades to LED and energy efficiency. We're putting solar on a number of properties. So, that's really what's led to the reset on our expectation for 2020. It's tough. Michael, it's really tough to isolate what longer term trends will be based on the last six weeks that we've been navigating this pandemic. Because I think the bigger driver of activity over the past 6 weeks has been people dealing with this crisis and navigating it both for their personal use as well as for their business. And I'm not sure if that's indicative of what the longer term impact, to your point to that could be 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 years down the road as it relates to customers' affinity towards urban living versus suburban or ex-urb living. The last 6 weeks wouldn't point to anything notable, and they've been a very unique 6 weeks in our history. Yes. And Michael, you obviously point to the right historical benchmarks, but I'm not sure that they're really analogous to my points earlier and to Joe's comments. So, we provided some line by line detail as to what we're seeing at this point. As we move forward through 2020, a lot of what we see will be driven by science and political decisions of which is difficult to underwrite. And, we try to provide you the color and the context around what the drivers are, but we'll see as we go from here. Right. Yes. So revenue growth is between 1% and 2% for the last eight quarters. And I think over that last eight quarters, same-store NOI has probably been -- with maybe the exception of third quarter last year, between 0% and 1%. So, certainly we're not in that environment that we were in over the last eight quarters. We're seeing a decline in move-in volumes. Our existing tenants are performing well at this point, but we remain to see where they go from here. And collections have been solid in April. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Ryan. And thank you for joining us. We wish the best for all of you listening in today, particularly those that have been personally impacted by the pandemic. I want to begin by thanking our employees, customers and business partners for their extraordinary efforts and flexibility as we adapt to this environment. Our focus is simple. Safety is the top priority in everything we do, protecting our employees and customers. We are operating our entire 2,500-plus portfolio in all markets as we are an essential business. The need for self-storage even in disruptive times like these is yet again being validated. In that regard, our priorities beyond safety includes servicing new and existing customers as our communities navigate through these challenging times. To do so, we are supporting our frontline employees in several ways to optimize customer service. Protocols are in place that reinforce social distancing, keeping properties clean, and offering customers multiple avenues to rent or access their space in a contactless way. At the start of the pandemic, we also established the PS Cares Fund, which provides childcare coverage, extended pay time off and additional hourly compensation to our entire team of property managers. I can't overstate how valuable their commitment to Public Storage has been and will continue to be as they serve our 1.5 million customers. As Public Storage approaches its 50th year, we have clearly weathered significant economic cycles, and this one will likely rank as one of the most extreme. We have a proven playbook to maneuver through severe economic and natural disasters. Our teams are battle tested, our product is resilient, and we have intentionally crafted a fortress balance sheet to not only survive, but thrive in times like these. At its core, the full Public Storage team is well equipped to not only face whatever challenges arise in the near term, but confidently, we will find new ways of applying our unique strength and fortitude to find opportunities. Now, I will hand the call over to the operator for questions. Yes. Sure, Jeff. So, again, we're obviously in an environment that is new and different for everybody. We've all been through, a number of economic cycles of different degrees. As I mentioned, we, in particular, from time to time, go through what we call natural disasters, hurricanes, and otherwise. This is clearly even different than those because it's health and science related. The predictability of this environment is to be determined, at best with a lot of information none of us have dealt with before. When we do look back at prior cycles, again, our product type has played through very well and even the great recession. We were pleasantly surprised by again the resiliency and the adaptability and relevance of the property type itself. On one hand, we clearly know that there continues to be a high degree of need and usage of the product. This month or last month, April, we moved in 82,000 customers into our portfolio. Now, again, that's down, but on the flip side, there's vibrancy there, there's need. We see it also with the amount of activity at our properties that we can now track holistically, because we have a centralized access system. So, again, whether it's at a raw consumer level and/or anything that tiers into service oriented from a business that may or may not be facility, even the type of activity that's going on with this COVID economy. There is a true and I think valid need for the product itself. So we are looking at the future with a fair degree of caution, because, frankly, we just don't know what's going to play through. And I don't know how realistic you can predict anything, because we're six weeks into this. And there's just going to be a number of things as we're discovering day-to-day, week-to-week that this environment will create even additional types of pressure points that we haven't seen before. Now, again, other things though are somewhat similar so far to what we've seen with extreme economic cycles. So, in the great recession, our delinquency hovered around, again, a 2% factor or so through the month of April, very similar. So, our customer base, even through the month of April, from a collection and payment standpoint, was consistent, even on a year-over-year basis. So, it's a mixture and it's something that we're going to again continue to react to. We've got great tools to be nimble. We've got great analytics to continue to address, again, whatever continues to surface or does surface that we need to address, and address through different tactics, strategies, et cetera. So, that would basically be an overview of how, again, we're looking at this environment, and clearly in a position that the predictability of it is still unknown. Sure. Well, Tom can talk a little bit more specifically about the balance sheet as it stands today. So, I'll let him do that in a sec. But, again, looking at extreme cycles like this one is likely to be, there is evidence, it's very early, but it won't be surprising. If, again, a number of owners that have come into the sector, particularly over the last three or four years where we've seen an abundance of new supply coming into the market, particularly with owners and ownership structures that may not be well suited to deal with something like this. There could be, again, a predictable fact, which would be more ability to capture assets, again, a price point that we think is very different and much more attractive than it's been over the last, say, three or four years. We're starting to hear, again, some rumblings around assets that I would say are underwater, where they've been funded through a certain level of debt. And the valuations are below that value. And so, we're starting, again, to hear some of that out in the market. And, again, it's early, but it wouldn't be surprising to us. And the ability for us to in particular, take advantage of an environment that could create that additional level of transaction activity, the balance sheet is ready for it. And it's ready in a meaningful way. So, we'll see how that plays through. And I'll hand it over to Tom. And he can give you a little bit more color on where the balance sheet stands today. I appreciate, Jeff, you too. Thank you. Sure. So, we thought it made sense and was appropriate to pause that program as we move through March. And we did not send existing tenant rate increases out for June 1st billing. So, that will continue through the second quarter. Stepping back, existing tenant rent increases in a more normal time, are managed at a very granular level, using data analytics to drive, what we send, when we send it and the magnitude. That will be an important part of where we go from here and how we restart at the appropriate time, recognizing that consumer behavior could be a little bit different, post this event than what it was before. But, we'll be using the same tools that we have in the past in order to determine those rental rate increases and the appropriate time with which to send them. Yes. Steve, first on personnel-related expense. Yes, that'll be elevated through Q2, by virtue of the things that we've discussed about. We put some information on that in the Q as well. And, again, we'll continue to moderate and understand, again, how we need to react to the overall environment going forward into the second half of the year. And we're looking at all expense levels across the Company as a whole. The burden of tax increases is still with us. We don't really have a way to predict that going one direction or another at the moment, other than that it's just continuing to be elevated. And Tom, can give you a little bit more color on another component of our expense tied to the advertising. So, again, that's been a vibrant tool for us. We're going to continue to use it aggressively. But, again, it's going to be a factor in the mix as well. We continue to look at all of our operational expenses, whether again, it's tied to vendor contracts, the amount of maintenance capital that we're putting into the portfolio, et cetera. So, it's definitely something that we continue to focus on and look for ways of, in this environment to optimizing overall cost levels. And, Tom, if you want to give a little bit more color on what we're doing with advertising and marketing spend? Yes, Smedes. Yes. I wouldn't take that as we intend to do any of the things you're talking about. It's really, we felt comfortable in the near term that the range of issues that our employee base was facing, we thought the right thing to do was to elevate their level of overall compensation and other tools they had at their disposal that we could help fund, whether it was childcare or extended time off, et cetera. So, again, because of the unpredictability going into the second half of this year, and frankly, even for the rest of this quarter, I mean, we'll see how things go. I'll tell you though that the variety of wage rates we have nationally is something that we constantly do evaluate, we look at again the relative pay for the scope and the applicability of skill for the type of compensation that we have, and we think we're aligned in that regard. And again, that's just something that we'll continue to be fluid. Clearly one of the things that we have the ability to do and we clearly thought it was the right thing to do was to, again, give additional support to our frontline workers in particular, as I mentioned in my opening comments a critical part of our overall operational strategies and taking care of customers, et cetera. So it's just something that will continue to evaluate, again, in an environment that has a lot of unpredictability, even around the way even some of the stimulus packages are working and other things that are at everybody's potential access, but at the same time, knowing that we have the ability to give additional support and we thought it was the right thing to do. Yes. Smedes, those properties continue to lease up. We have reacted to the new pricing environment and have lowered pricing on many of those as well. But, again, depending on the level of volume and interest going on in those individual markets, it's around the trade areas of those properties. But they've continued to lease up through the month of April, which we're encouraged by, albeit at lower pricing. Great, thank you. Yes. Sure, Ronald. Minneapolis is a market that, first of all, we have significant market share and presence. So, over the last two years, we've boosted that by doing three things. We've added to our own portfolio through acquisitions, ground up development and redevelopment in a market that we hadn't actually had a lot of investment activity in for some time. We like and see I think very good long-term traction relative to the market itself and the additional inventory and new properties that we put into that market. All told, for us directly is about 10,000 units. And lease-up there is going well on the new properties. We're not seeing a like-for-like additional magnitude of new development going in the market, but there's some. But, we felt it was relevant to call it out because, again, our same-store is not progressing as well as some other markets have been in the near-term. But, we feel like the stabilization that will take place over the next one to two years as, again, we see good absorption of the new product and any of the things that are happening in our existing properties correct as well. So, again, the market is I think well-poised for future growth. And we're really pleased with the additive scale and the range of new assets, either directly built and/or acquired that we put into that market. Thanks, Ronald. Great. Thank you. Yes. Michael, we'll see how that does play through. Obviously, we have the benefit with 2,500 locations, 38 states. We've got a sizeable portfolio of both urban and suburban related. It's too soon to tell yet, if one is being benefited versus the other. So, we'll assess that and see what kinds of trends might play through just on, again, how the population shifts one direction or another from, as you mentioned, a pure urban desirability to something that maybe more desirable from a suburban standpoint. But, don't know yet. But, we've got plenty of tentacles out there as we continue to see the type of impact that this environment may create in that regard. It's not coming through yet meaningful, other than Tom mentioned that we have seen a little bit more of a impact in the Northeast, and I think you can make sense of that really more from a health standpoint and a science standpoint, because that's frankly where the most dramatic impact to the COVID virus has been so far. And again, many of those communities are in major lockdowns. So, we'll see. And we play in both arenas very actively, continually as we speak. We're making development decisions, both in suburban and urban markets. We use a lot of demographic data to point us even on a very micro basis where to locate and invest in properties, where we think we can continue to see good demand. Yes. And I think, the other thing is, again the reason, we think through and design and either build or invest in our larger assets, whether again, they're in urban or suburban markets is, it's highly correlated to again demographic data, which is both, population based and it's competitive based. So, some of our very largest properties even through the last few weeks are doing just as well as they've done historically. So, it's way too soon to tell. Well, Michael, first of all, you know well, we don't guide, even in \u201cnormal times\u201d. And it's the crystal ball. I mean, we clearly don't know what direction this could play through. You're right. I mean, it has been a severe and very dramatic change, jobless claims are down at 30 million. I mean, that's a massive shock to the entire economy. I don't know how long it's going to take for that to correct. I don't know how long it will play through, what kind of impact it could have on our broad customer base, and GDP growth is going to be ugly from a predictability standpoint, this quarter in particular. So, we'll see. Yes. For eight quarters, it's kind of between 1% and 2%, so. Yes. Great. Thank you. Yes. Jeremy, like always, as Tom alluded to, I mean, that's -- stock buyback is in and of itself from a capital allocation decisions, something that, again, has always been an alternative. We'll continue to assess it. I couldn't at this point guide you to, okay, where's it stack ranker, how are we benchmarking it against, other uses of capital at the moment. The thing that's on the horizon, likely, though, that we've already talked to is, with the potential impact to a number of owners that have put anywhere from say 1,500 to 2,000 properties collectively into our sector over the last three to four years, a lot of those investments are not going to come close to the pro forma expectations or underwriting hurdles that they had put forth. So, we would anticipate but we'll see that like other big corrections that this too will lead to an opportunity for us to allocate capital that direction, but to be determined. So, we've got a variety of different capital allocation options, and we'll continue to assess them as this thing plays through. Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. Thanks, all. Stay safe. Thank you."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the phone will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Katherine. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I\u2019m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, February 23, 2022, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that could become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, feel free to jump back in queue with anything additional. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I would like to begin the call by reviewing a few of the significant highlights from 2021 and then discuss our outlook for 2022. Last year, the Public Storage team unlocked opportunities in one of the most historically vibrant eras for the self-storage industry. Our priorities have included capturing excellent customer demand, enhancing operations through the digitalization of our platform, acquiring individual assets and portfolios that provide outsized growth, and our ongoing investment in our people. On top of this, we have funded growth through a combination of exceptionally low-cost debt and preferred issuances giving us significant firepower to expand the business going forward. There are four areas that were critical to our success in 2021, which have also set the stage for an equally, if not more powerful, 2022. First, listening to our customers. We found innovative ways to solve what many new customers told us they wanted, a fast and efficient way to lease a storage space on their own time frame. Through our e-rental offering, approximately 50% of our new customers now self-select their space digitally. No operator in the industry comes close to this level of adoption. Our existing customers told us they wanted more tools to interface with Public Storage. This led to the full rollout of the PS app, which now has over 1 million downloads, offering an array of self-directed service options, including digital property access and account management. Second, driving our industry-leading 4-factor growth platform. We acquired 232 assets totaling 22 million square feet for approximately $5.1 billion, adding quality and scale to our market presence, nationally. This included two $1.5 billion-plus portfolios, which were additive to our operating platform in the desirable markets of Washington, D.C. and Dallas Fort Worth. Through development, the Public Storage real estate and construction teams grew our pipeline to approximately $800 million as we deliver Generation Five properties to markets from coast to coast. And we added 79 assets across 22 states to our management platform with easy integration of both, existing and newly built assets. Third, an ongoing commitment to invest in our people. In 2021, we increased hourly wages by 14%. We enhanced training to facilitate career progression with new positions in field operations. And recently, we were named by Forbes as one of America\u2019s best large employers. Then fourth, the effective utilization of our powerful balance sheet. We issued $5 billion of new debt instruments, refinanced $1.2 billion of preferred equity, and took the overall blended cost of debt and preferred from 3.9% to 2.7%. As we enter 2022, the balance sheet is primed to fund growth. We have approximately $1 billion in cash and will likely generate another $700 million in free cash flow. Now, turning to this year. We have launched 2022 with a high degree of confidence that Public Storage is poised for another strong year. The components of our outlook are anchored by three areas. One, customer behavior has set the stage for another good, busy season. Through our own data, we see demand from both, traditional and newer factors, including the fifth D, Decluttering. Also, the high cost of housing, a strong economy, generational adoption of self-storage and business users continue to create a vibrant customer acquisition and retention opportunity. Two, limited growth in new supply nationally. Our view is we are in a three-year holding pattern of new supply deliveries, which began in 2021. We are likely to see a range of 500 to 600 property deliveries take place annually through 2023 due to elevated risk tied to city approvals, higher component, labor and land costs. And three, our commanding non-same-store portfolio, which is now 25% of our total portfolio. With the investment activity in 2021, our non-same-store portfolio has grown significantly and is now comprised of 513 assets, approximately 50 million square feet and has current occupancy of approximately 84%. The earnings power tied to the sizable asset base is significant and will likely continue. The portfolio is suited for outsized growth due to the quality of the assets, exceptional locations and the lease-up activity we see as self-storage demand continues, particularly under the Public Storage brand. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. We finished the year with strong financial performance. We reported core FFO of $3.54 for the quarter and $12.93 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range and representing 21.9% growth over 2020. Now, let\u2019s look at the contributors for this quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 13.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. That performance was consistent with the last quarter despite tough comps and a modest return of seasonality through the fall. Growth was driven by rate with two factors leading to the continued strength. First, strong demand and limited inventory allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 19% versus 2020. We\u2019re comparing to pre-pandemic levels, 33% versus 2019. Secondly, existing tenant rate increases also contributed with lengthening customer stays in comparing to a period in 2020 when we were impacted by rental rate regulation in many markets. Now, on to operating expenses. As we had discussed on prior calls, we had higher expense growth in the fourth quarter driven by property tax timing. But if you look at the full year operating expenses, we reported same-store operating expense growth down 2%, representing record company performance. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 12.2% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter, adding $61 million in NOI or roughly half of the full portfolio NOI growth. Now, I\u2019m going to shift gears to the outlook. We introduced 2022 core FFO guidance with a $15.20 midpoint, representing 17.5% growth from 2021. We\u2019re anticipating another year of strong customer demand for self-storage, as Joe highlighted earlier, leading to same-store revenue growth of 13.5% at the midpoint, roughly in line with second half \u201821 growth levels. As we look at the components of revenue, occupancy is likely to fall as we move through the year but remain above 2019 levels. Rate will be the strongest driver of performance going forward. Continued strength from move-in rents and existing tenant increased contribution. Notably, the long-running rent restrictions expired in Los Angeles, adding circa 1.5% to 2% on the full company same-store revenue outlook. Los Angeles is our largest market poised to accelerate with our industry-leading portfolio and team as well as our recently completed capital investments in this market through our Property of Tomorrow program. On expenses, our expectations are for 6% to 8% expense growth, driven primarily by property tax and payroll growth. That leads to NOI growth at the midpoint of 15.7%, roughly in line with 2021 strong performance. Our non-same-store acquisition and development properties are poised to be a strong contributor again in 2022, growing from $281 million of NOI contribution in \u201821 to $450 million at the midpoint for 2022. Included in that is our plan to add $1 billion in acquisitions and $250 million of development deliveries this year. Looking ahead past 2022 for the non-same store, we added one element to our guidance for the year compared to last year. The incremental non-same-store NOI to stabilization from the acquisitions and developments completed ahead of year-end \u201821. It represents the annual incremental NOI to be gained at stabilization in addition to our 2022 NOI expectations for those properties. It equates to approximately 5% yields on recent acquisitions and 10% yields on development, and we anticipate capturing roughly half of that embedded growth in \u201823 and the rest over \u201824 and \u201825. This pool of lease-up assets will be a powerful growth engine over the next several years. And last but not least, our low leverage balance sheet gives us capacity to fund growth and, at the same time, is well laddered with long-term debt and $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions against a rising interest rate environment. In addition to external financing, we expect to retain approximately $700 million of cash flow to reinvest into our growth for the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thanks, Tom. In summary, we look at 2022 as another milestone year for Public Storage. We are also reflecting on our past as we look to the future by officially marking our 50th year as the largest owner and operator of self-storage in the United States. I want to thank you for your support, and on behalf of our 5,500 associates of Public Storage, thank you for your confidence in our abilities to lead this industry into the next 50 years. And with that, we\u2019ll open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question today from Elvis Rodriguez with Bank of America.\nElvis Rodriguez: Good morning, out there. And congrats on the quarter and year. Quick question on the same-store pool. I know there\u2019s been discussion on potentially the conservatism in your pool versus peers. Tom, are you able to share how much more you think same-store NOI would have been -- the outlook would have been, if you followed your peers\u2019 definition?\nTom Boyle: Well, stepping back, the way we approach same-store reporting is to report in our same-store the properties that have been stabilized for several years for comparable purposes. So, we look at both, how the occupancy is set up versus the market as well as how rents are versus the local submarkets. And because of that, our same-store represents truly stabilized operating performance year-in and year-out. That said, we just spent some time talking about the power of our non-same-store and the growth that\u2019s embedded there. And you can see in our supplement, the yields that we\u2019re achieving there and the growth that\u2019s embedded, as I just spoke to. So, we\u2019re also achieving that non-same-store growth. As it relates to what our peers report, I won\u2019t get into their reporting versus ours or otherwise, but would highlight the growth potential in our non-same-store pool of unstabilized assets as well as our core reporting for our same-store.\nElvis Rodriguez: Great. And just to follow up on the LA moratoriums expiring. I know you mentioned 1.5% to 2% on the revenue side. Are you able to share what the contribution is on the NOI side?\nTom Boyle: I\u2019d have to do some quick math there. It\u2019s going to be a little bit north of that, given operating leverage, but we can get back to you on what exactly that number is. But 1.5% to 2% on the revenue side, and as we highlighted, 6% to 8% operating expense growth. So that\u2019s the difference.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Can you break down the components that give you comfort guiding to the same-store revenue guidance, well up to 15%? And that\u2019s coming on the tougher comparison. So, we understand that all the restrictions of LA County adds 150 to 200 basis points. But can you help us understand kind of what\u2019s driving -- is there a change in existing customer rent increases, or what your expectation is for kind of street rates for the upcoming year that gives you comfort to get to that higher level?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So, let me take a stab at that. And Joe, you can chime in as well. As Joe mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to see strong customer momentum as we begin the year. And we\u2019re starting the year, frankly, with the best rent growth and record occupancies heading into 2022. So, that certainly is encouraging. As we move through the year, what we\u2019re already experiencing is continued strong move-in rent trends, and we\u2019d anticipate that to continue through the first half of the year as we compare against early 2021. And then we expect move-in rent trends to moderate as we move to the back half of the year. We\u2019re already seeing that in certain markets. If you look at a market like New York, that was stronger out of the gate in 2020 per se but has moderated in growth since, still at pretty healthy growth rates for the quarter, is experiencing move-in rate growth in the fourth quarter in the 7% range. So, we\u2019ve seen that growth start to moderate in certain earlier recovery markets. So, we anticipate that to play through in the system. At the same time, as we sit here today, we\u2019re seeing really strong contribution from markets like Miami and Atlanta who experienced north of 30% move in rent growth in the fourth quarter. So, we\u2019ve got some room to moderate from here. The second component with that as it relates to new customer demand is seasonality. We talked in the past about how we expected some return to modest seasonality in 2021, and we saw that. If you looked at occupancy trends from peak to trough in 2020, which was an unusual year given the pandemic, we saw about a 40 basis-point occupancy decline from peak to trough. Last year, in 2021, we saw about 170 basis-point decline from peak to trough. And in 2022, our expectations are for a more normal year, again, easing into more seasonal patterns with about a 250 basis points peak to trough decline. The third piece, which is really important, is the existing tenant rate increase contribution, which I highlighted, which will further add to the move-in rent momentum on rate. And you highlighted, is there something different there? And there certainly is. We just highlighted that in LA County, for instance, we\u2019ve been subject to rent restrictions for a number of years. That hadn\u2019t allowed us to utilize our existing tenant rate increase program as we typically would. So, that\u2019s certainly the case in Los Angeles, but it was the case in other markets as well through the back half of 2020 and into the beginning of 2021. So, we have tailwinds on existing tenant rate increases because of that as well as the lengthening customer stays, which gives us the ability to send more increases on a year-over-year basis than we\u2019ve done in the past. And Joe, anything you\u2019d like to add to that?\nJoe Russell: Yes. And just with all that said, Michael, another area that I touched in my opening comments is the environment from a supply standpoint is materially different than it has been over the last several years, even though we\u2019re likely to see continued deliveries. You know that we\u2019re the only public developer of self-storage assets on a national basis. We\u2019ve got the biggest team out there looking and sourcing both land sites and taking assets through various stages of development. And I\u2019ll tell you the amount of hurdles that are in today\u2019s environment are much tougher, and it\u2019s giving us a nice window to point to the number of levels of metrics and the level of confidence that Tom just talked about why this year is likely to be every bit as vibrant as what we saw in 2021. And we don\u2019t really see any looming evidence of a surge of new development coming into play outside of what we\u2019re going to see in 2022 and likely 2023. So overall, it\u2019s a continued good window for us to operate with good pricing power, low levels of supply and very good customer demand, both new and then existing customer behavior.\nMichael Goldsmith: And as a quick follow-up, since you touched on New York and Miami markets, can you just talk a little bit about New York as an example of -- is that going to -- you\u2019re kind of leading the way, I guess, in terms of like the maturation as we kind of enter this post-pandemic phase. And should rest of your markets sort of follow a similar curve where you\u2019re starting to see a little bit of a moderation in the rent growth there? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: I do think that there\u2019s an element of that that I think resonates. I think if you look at our strongest markets in the summer of 2020, they were San Francisco and New York. And we saw some dislocation related demand as well as moving activity and the like. And those markets have remained strong, but they haven\u2019t continued their acceleration, like you\u2019ve seen in the Miami or Atlanta, where really pro-cyclical demand drivers, as we talked through last year, employment growth, population growth, housing activity really driving strong demand where we see that continued to accelerate through 2021. I do think that we look at those markets as -- meaning New York and San Francisco as markets where we may be past the peak levels of demand but remain very, very healthy. You look at San Francisco for the fourth quarter, for instance, occupancy was down 130 basis points, but the 96.4% occupied and continued momentum in that market. And so, I do think that that\u2019s a case of what could be a medium-term stabilization for some of these markets as the growth matures, but we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. But as we sit here today, Miami\u2019s fourth quarter growth was at 23%. It was up 100 basis points in occupancy, and move-in rents were up 31% in the quarter. So, continued really strong momentum in Miami, which is one of our largest markets as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: I\u2019m going to try to speak slowly since I\u2019m hearing a pretty big echo. Revenue growth has been incredibly strong in your Sunbelt markets, and I think it\u2019s safe to say, those are more free markets, not subject to pricing restrictions, like LA. So, as you look ahead to 2022, obviously, comps are difficult. But how do you expect the occupancy and rate to trend in the Sunbelt markets? Do you see more kind of occupancy loss versus the overall portfolio as maybe strong in migration to those markets kind of unwind? And then on the rate side, do you think more like high-single-digit rate growth versus what appears to be low-double-digit embedded in the overall revenue growth guidance?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So, maybe let me take the second part of that question first, which is what do we anticipate in some of the Sunbelt markets we\u2019re seeing real strength. And I\u2019d say, certainly, as you look at occupancy growth, we\u2019re at 97.2% occupancy in Miami in the quarter. There\u2019s not a lot of room for that to move higher. It really is a rate story, and we are achieving strong rental rate growth, as you highlighted there. And I think that there\u2019s a continuation of that as we get through the year. But no question, we\u2019re going to have much tougher comps in the second half in places like Miami and Atlanta. So, we\u2019re likely to see that rate of growth moderate but at those higher rents, i.e., we\u2019re not expecting to see significant deceleration or going backwards in operating fundamentals, given the -- what we think is the durability of demand in those markets. So, hopefully, that...\nJonathan Hughes: Yes. That definitely answers the question. And my last one, so looking at NOI growth guidance and the flow-through to earnings. If same-store NOI growth guidance is, say, 16% this year, how is FFO growth guidance not significantly more than that? You\u2019ve done a great job utilizing the balance sheet to fund last year\u2019s acquisitions with low fixed rate debt and preferreds. But why aren\u2019t we seeing the leverage impact flow through to earnings in a more meaningful way?\nTom Boyle: Sure. That\u2019s a good question. So, if you take a look at the contributions of growth in 2022 and compare them to 2021, clearly, one of the big drivers of growth outside of the same-store pool is going to be our acquisition activity. And if you look at the two chunky quarters of acquisition volumes last year, we had the ezStorage transaction, and a number of others take place in the second quarter of last year, which really were contributors to 2021 growth. And in addition to that, that portfolio, in particular, was a more stabilized portfolio. It came in at 86% occupied, and we were able to achieve improved operations there pretty quickly through the year such that we recognized a good bit of the growth there. If you think about the fourth quarter activity and a lot of the other activity and acquisitions last year, much of it was unstabilized. So we spent some time talking about the All Storage portfolio and the stabilization to come there on our last call. And so, what that means is it\u2019s coming in at lower yields given lower occupancies and rental rates, and we\u2019re going to seek to stabilize those portfolios over the next several years, which leads to the embedded growth that I spoke to in \u201823, \u201824, \u201825, but also means there\u2019s going to be less of a big bang impact per se in 2022. But ultimately, we\u2019ll see how the path of that lease-up takes place over this year and the coming years, and we\u2019ll update you on that in coming calls.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go now to Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: First question, I just wanted to touch on the uplift to same-store revenue growth that you\u2019re anticipating in LA and in California in general. Can you just talk about the expected cadence of that incremental contribution to the top line? I\u2019m curious if growth is going to accelerate throughout the year somewhat ratably or -- and also whether you would expect more upside in 2023, or do you anticipate the full benefit to be largely realized in \u201822?\nTom Boyle: That\u2019s a great question, Todd. So, I think if you look at the different markets and the growth profiles, you highlighted LA, and so I\u2019ll spend some time on that, but I want to talk about the portfolio as a whole. So we went through a period last year where we saw acceleration really across the board in all of our markets. And we\u2019re sitting here in early 2022, talking about the tailwinds that we have in LA, which is our largest market. No question, it\u2019s poised to accelerate from here. And as you\u2019d expect, we\u2019re starting from a place where the rent restrictions expired at the end of the year. It will take us some time to see that acceleration play through in the coming quarters, but a good chunk of the rate component of that will be achieved through the busy season this year. So, we\u2019ll have more to talk about as we get through the first half. So, as LA is accelerating and maybe some of the other markets that have been subject to rent restrictions accelerating, we would anticipate that there are others that see a rate of revenue growth start to decline and go the other direction, and that\u2019s kind of inherent in the midpoint of our range being somewhat consistent with what we reported through the second half of 2021. We\u2019re going to have some markets that are accelerating, and we\u2019re going to have some markets that are decelerating. The rate of growth in a market, say, like Miami and Atlanta is unlikely to maintain at these levels, but are likely to still grow at very healthy rates through 2022. So, we are likely heading into a year where we see some acceleration and some deceleration, which we view as healthy into 2022.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then, Joe, your comments about new supply being in a little bit of a holding pattern at about 500 to 600 facilities per year through \u201823, I guess a couple of questions. First, can you elaborate on why you\u2019re not expecting to see an increase in new supply? And what\u2019s holding back development activity from ramping up a bit? And then, 500 to 600 facilities is still relatively elevated. How do you see the delivery of new projects cycling throughout the country? Are there certain markets where you would expect to see some pressure on operations in 2022 from new development deliveries?\nJoe Russell: So yes, the first part of the question, Todd, there are a lot of headwinds that we see, in particular, as we\u2019re an active developer and we\u2019re in a variety of different stages. So, you\u2019ve got constraints around city processes. Many cities have not even come close to normal levels of operations for approvals. You\u2019ve got supply chain and component availability issues that are not easing in any material way as we\u2019re entering into 2022, and there\u2019s elevated cost that goes with that and labor availability. So, there are a lot of different factors that are creating not only, I would say, material delays in some cases, but it gives many developers a lot of pause to jump into an environment right here where there\u2019s a lot of unknown consequences to both, timing and cost. So, I don\u2019t disagree that 500 to 600, you may step back and go, there\u2019s still a level of volume there. And both, with our own statistics and the data that we derive from other sources, we think that\u2019s a reasonable amount of development activity that\u2019s still at hand. The development business in our sector is highly fragmented, and you\u2019re going to see it continue to play through by, more often than not, small developers that may be going through a process on one site at a time or, in some cases, for the first time. So, there\u2019s a lot of different crosscurrents that are creating the delays that I\u2019m speaking to. And what we see in our own portfolio is more and more angst around committed deliveries; the vendors that you\u2019re dealing with, whether they\u2019re tied to concrete or steel or labor availability. There\u2019s just a lot of different factors that are creating, what I would say, headwinds around elevated levels of deliveries. So, we\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019re going to be in this holding pattern, both this year and likely into next year. I wouldn\u2019t tell you that any particular markets getting oversupplied. So, that\u2019s a positive thing, where in past cycles, particularly when we were seeing many more properties being delivered nationally, you could see and measure the impacts in certain markets because of the abundance of new supply that was literally hitting the ground and coming up very quickly. So, it\u2019s a very different development dynamic as we speak, and it continues to be a good window for us to go out and compete for land sites. We\u2019re seeing fewer levels of competition, as I\u2019ve talked about for the last several quarters. But to, again, go into the sector right now as a first time or a small developer, you\u2019re going to have a far level and a higher degree of risk, and that\u2019s creating some level of discipline or pull back.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go now to Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Can you just talk about your appetite today for expanding internationally, especially given many of the larger portfolio yields in the U.S. have dried out just specifically thinking about your former interest in the Australian market or expanding further into Europe?\nJoe Russell: So yes, Spenser, we\u2019ve certainly got the capability to think broader than just domestic opportunities. Clearly, we\u2019ve seen a very vibrant ability to grow and capture well-placed and good opportunities right here in the U.S. We will keep and have the ability to think outside U.S. borders. I\u2019m not going to point to any particular part of the global opportunity. One of the things that comes through with international expansion is the depth of any particular market, the maturity of any particular market, and with that, what kind of opportunity and timing could play for us compared to the opportunities that we see right here in the U.S. So, again, from a knowledge and capability standpoint, we\u2019re very confident when the right opportunities surface. We\u2019re going to be very, I would say, surgical on those kinds of opportunities. But at the moment, we continue to stay very-focused on a very good opportunity set right here in the United States.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. And can you provide a little color on how storage fundamentals have been trending in Europe or the Australian market, if you have it detailed?\nJoe Russell: Yes. I would point you to our associates at Shurgard. They can give you very good color because they\u2019re very deep into the Western European markets, and I would rely on their commentary and perspective on what they\u2019re seeing there. And to Australia, I could only basically just talk to the fact that it is a market that continues to embrace self-storage. There\u2019s good demand factors that play through in the Australian economy. And again, I look to the operators that are in that market to give you even more specific color on what\u2019s going on there.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take the next question from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Maybe just starting with the fact that I think storage has benefited from the uncertainty of the past few years and that the return to normal has taken longer than expected. So, as behavior normalizes, what\u2019s your view on how much of the strength of storage demand is permanent versus thinking that post-COVID normalization is a negative for PSA?\nJoe Russell: Yes. I mean, it\u2019s definitely a good question and, theoretically, how quickly or will we ever revert back to what things were like pre-pandemic, coupled with the fact the impacts of the pandemic are now a solid two years plus into the overall economy, behaviors, the way companies have reset, again, workforces, the way people are living their lives. There\u2019s a whole different host of different drivers that are at hand beyond just the more obvious factors that might have been tied just directly to the impacts of the pandemic itself. Certainly, at the beginning of the pandemic, the very quick reversion to pure work-from-home environment has created some outsized demand from that alone. But you could argue today, the hybrid situation or the way people have reverted to living lives differently, whether it\u2019s through their own work environments, home environments, the way people are moving and then on top of that, some of the other things, I mentioned in my opening comments, tied to generational demand, a very strong housing market, there\u2019s population shifts that are going on, and there\u2019s certainly strong relativity why, no surprise, Florida and Texas are two of our very strongest markets because of population migration in. So, there are many other factors that continue to drive both, adoption and the need for self-storage. Financially, if you think about the cost of housing, whether you\u2019re an owner or a renter, continues to escalate at a very strong level. And storage can be a very sensible and financial alternative to diffusing some of that cost. So, we\u2019re very confident that the inherent benefits of storage will continue to play through. And the things that we\u2019ve learned through the pandemic, many of which could be longstanding and deep-seated, will continue to serve both us and the sector very well.\nCaitlin Burrows: You did mention business customers as one of your positive drivers earlier in the call. Could you just talk about these business users and maybe last-mile delivery? In particular, are you seeing increased demand for this? And if so, how significant do you think it could become?\nJoe Russell: A little bit harder to peg at a specific number, but there\u2019s no question we do see elevated level of business-oriented customers. If you think about how tight and expensive, again, the industrial market continues to be and with changes in distribution, you mentioned last-mile or different distribution patterns or different types of smaller companies needing spot space, what I mean by that is something that they may think they only need for a month or two without having to sign a long-term lease, storage is a great fit. We\u2019ve seen this historically. But with the economy coming back and smaller businesses resuscitating, we\u2019re seeing good levels of business demand come into the portfolio as well.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go now to Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I just wanted to ask a little bit about your development pipeline. I think, you said you were still targeting 10% stabilized returns. And we\u2019ve heard for a while, not just in storage but across multiple asset classes of higher construction costs, higher supply costs, longer lead times, and I\u2019m just wondering, has your yield moved out to where you think you could stabilize? Has it come down from maybe where it might have been, had we not seen increase in construction costs? And if not, like how have you managed to maybe sort of avoid some of these issues?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So, let me clarify what I had mentioned about 10% yields. So, the 10% yield that I was speaking to is where we expect the previously delivered developments to achieve stabilization. And you can see in the supplement that, for instance, the 2017 or 2018 development vintages are already north of 8% here in the fourth quarter on an annualized basis. So, I wanted to provide some road map to where the vintages through 2021 are set to stabilize, but that\u2019s not meant to suggest that a 10% yield is our target. What we\u2019ve historically highlighted is, plus or minus 8% property level yield upon stabilization, call it, three or four years out is a target range, obviously, modulates by market and asset type and submarket. But -- so we aren\u2019t moving target yields to 10%, but we do expect to achieve circa 10% on those that have been delivered. And then, the second point is on -- as it relates to construction costs and the challenges associated with development today, I\u2019ll let Joe chime in on that.\nJoe Russell: Yes. Smedes, as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s elevated, not only timing and execution, but cost pressure that\u2019s playing through. We\u2019ll see how that continues with, hopefully, some easing of some of the supply chain issues that are out there. But there\u2019s no question, labor in and of itself is a very commanding factor. Market to market, that can be quite pronounced. And then, there\u2019s been a high degree of volatility, for instance in steel over the last few months. We\u2019re keeping a very close eye on that. But, if you\u2019re a smaller developer and you\u2019re, either not by experience and/or knowledge or even scale and size, able to deal with some of these wide-ranging cost impacts, as I mentioned, I think there\u2019s going to be more discipline playing through, we\u2019re keeping a very close eye on it. That\u2019s the benefit of having the size and the capability of our own development and construction teams. So, they\u2019re working very hard to see and understand and contain the elevated level of costs that are playing through on asset development right now.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thanks. And you mentioned that the length of stay continues to extend. I was just wondering, could you update us on where that is now? And maybe as a reminder, what was it kind of pre-pandemic?\nTom Boyle: Sure. I think one of the metrics that I\u2019d highlight that with is the average length of stay of our customers that are in-house today. And pre-pandemic, that average length of stay was about 33 or 34 months. So, approaching three years, but just a touch under. Today, that average length of stay of the in-house tenants is just about 40 months. So, we moved a meaningful way past that three-year threshold and continue to see that play through the beginning part of this year as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore.\nSamir Khanal: Hey Tom, I know you mentioned the rent restrictions being lifted in LA. But I mean, is there any potential benefits that could come from other markets this year that we haven\u2019t thought about this as a driver for growth?\nTom Boyle: Sure. There were certainly other markets that experience rental rate restrictions and have a similar benefit but not anywhere to the same degree as Los Angeles. And so ,we specifically called out Los Angeles. But as you\u2019d anticipate, there were a number of other markets, including New York, New Jersey, San Francisco, the rest of California, and really many of our markets that at some point over the past two years have rental rate restrictions. And there are modest benefits in those markets as well, but nothing like Los Angeles County, given the duration of those rental restrictions and the size of the Los Angeles market for us. But there are some other tailwinds playing through with existing tenant rate increases because of that through 2022 in other markets also, but always embedded in the outlook that we provided for \u201822.\nOperator: And we have a follow-up question from Elvis Rodriguez with Bank of America.\nElvis Rodriguez: Sorry, if I missed this. Are you able to share where occupancy is year-to-date?\nTom Boyle: Yes. On a year-on-year basis, we\u2019ve seen occupancy that ended the year, call it, 50, 60 basis points above prior year at record levels. We are starting to see some of that moderation through January and into February. We\u2019re just right around flat at this point year-over-year. But again, at record occupancies for this time of year as we sit here at the end of February.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go now to Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ronald, you\u2019re line is open. Please check mute function on your phone. We\u2019ll go to Mike Mueller with JP Morgan.\nMike Mueller: Tom, does guidance assume additional street rate growth in 2022, or is it a little bit more taking what\u2019s in place today, plus the rate increases?\nTom Boyle: Yes. If you look at the move-in rents, I think is the term we would like to use, which is what do we actually achieve in rents for customers to sign contracts through the first part of the year, there is a benefit certainly as we look at where we ended the fourth quarter in move-in rents compared to the first quarter of 2021, for instance. And so some of the growth that we\u2019re going to experience is certainly associated with the fact that just maintaining rents from the fourth quarter will be positive year-over-year growth into the first quarter. That is probably the biggest chunk of rental rate growth for move-ins through the first two months of the year, and then we do -- first -- I\u2019m sorry, two quarters of the year. And then we do anticipate modest rental rate growth for move-ins thereafter as well, but certainly moderating from the rate of growth that we\u2019ve seen through the first quarter and third quarter of last year.\nMike Mueller: Got it. And then, I apologize if I missed this. But on the acquisitions that are under contract or have closed for 2022, what\u2019s an average occupancy on them?\nJoe Russell: Close to what we saw in 2021. It averages in the high-50%, low-60%. We\u2019ve got a combination of assets that are in various stages of stabilization in the pipeline. And tactically or strategically, we\u2019re going to continue to look for those assets going forward as well. They\u2019ve been well suited to many of our investment strategies, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right out of the gate here at the beginning of the year.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey. Can you hear me now? Okay. I can hear myself actually. Just really quickly on the same-store revenue guidance, I just wanted a little bit more color on sort of the upper and the lower end of the range. How are you guys thinking about that? Is it just sensitivity on elasticity on pushing rate? Is there anything else that goes into hitting the top of that guidance versus the bottom? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: Sure. So, we did widen the same-store revenue range from, call it, 1.5% range to 3% for this year and trying to capture more of those potential outcomes compared to what we did last year. But in terms of elements that would drive the top end versus the bottom, I think you can probably anticipate what they are, i.e., stronger customer demand, more rental rate strength for move-ins, even longer length of stays in the higher end case. And the flip side, true for the lower end case. So, nothing in particular that I\u2019d highlight that would be unique about the range there.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then, just asking differently. So just to understand, the guidance assumes just normal seasonality where peak leasing season, you should see reacceleration and then slowing down in the later back of the year. Is that how we should think about it?\nTom Boyle: Yes.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go now to Keegan Carl with Berenberg.\nKeegan Carl: Just curious if you could take a stab at quantifying how many of your customers are falling to the new fifth D, Decluttering? Is there any sort of visible shift in the demographics that you\u2019re seeing with your new customer pool?\nJoe Russell: So, one of the things, we do a vibrant amount of customer surveys with both new and existing customers. So, there\u2019s been some natural gravitation to new generational users that have come into the portfolio through the pandemic needing more space for a variety of different reasons was a more pronounced driver. It hasn\u2019t gone away by any means. It\u2019s moderated a small amount, but it\u2019s still a sizable component of the kind of demand that\u2019s playing through as we\u2019re surveying customer needs as they come into the portfolio. And then, it goes to the whole host of other drivers that we\u2019ve been talking to as well, whether it\u2019s the amount of activity tied to home sales, movement from market to market and then our classic definitions of the other 4 Ds, which are very deep-seated drivers of self-storage in and of itself. The cluttering or Decluttering factor, I do think it\u2019s got some long-lasting effects, not only because there\u2019s still a strong hybrid work environment that\u2019s playing through many economies, but it\u2019s also tied to the cost of either being an owner or a renter. So that, too, is going to create more need for more space at home.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go now to Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Just a couple of balance sheet questions. You have $580 million of preferred debt -- or equity, sorry, coming due. How should we think about that holistically, just refinance that preferred equity or combination of that? And secondly, I think you have about $700 million of floating rate debt. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s hedged or not, but any additional color on how you\u2019re thinking about that in a rising rate environment?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Great question, Ki Bin. So, we have had the opportunity to refinance a significant amount of preferred stock over the last several years. Call it, $2.5 billion of preferred stock has been refinanced at lower rates, and that contributed to the decrease in cost of in-place capital that Joe highlighted earlier. As we move through the year, certainly, we would look to refinance those to the extent that we can lock in attractive, permanent like-for-like capital as well and keep that kind of cornerstone of the capital structure, which is incredibly attractive in a rising interest rate environment, given we\u2019ll never have to refinance the preferred stock and take advantage of opportunities where we can ratchet lower that cost of financing. So, we have, as you mentioned, $580 million that we could potentially address this year, but we\u2019ll have to see where the market is at that time. And then, as it relates to the floating rate question, we did issue floating rate notes as part of the financing package for ezStorage last year. Those are callable notes that we\u2019ll look to refinance here in the coming years. We have not fixed those. So, we have an ability to prepay those and manage the interest rate risk as we go.\nKi Bin Kim: And I know this next topic has been brought up from time to time, but just holistically speaking, how do you guys think about your investment in TSG and Shurgard? Are these basically whoever holds, or is it reasonable to expect if you see some acquisition opportunity that these be possible sources of capital?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Ki Bin, we at a Board level, continue to evaluate the -- both, benefit of our investments in either entity and the commitment that we continue to have in either entity. So, that\u2019s an ongoing Board review process that\u2019s in place. And when and if we make a change in our commitment to either entity, we would certainly communicate that. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the returns that each set of investments have garnered for us, and we continue to be committed to each entity and are pleased by their performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Curious on California and LA, specifically, if you can share the loss of lease in the portfolio or what price versus market, and is the main upside same-store revenues from new leasing or in [Technical Difficulty] back to market?\nTom Boyle: Great. That\u2019s a very good question. So, we did experience through 2021 a situation where move-in rents and in-place rents were very consistent in Los Angeles. And in fact, move-in rents in some instances moved higher in some of the properties here in Los Angeles because of the dynamics of the rental rate restrictions. That said, the contribution going forward of rental rate growth with the regulations no longer in place are both, move-in rents as well as existing tenant rate increases. So, in other words, we had an inability to increase move-in rents above the rental rate restrictions, the same way it was for existing tenants. So, I would say it\u2019s both parts, both moving existing tenants higher as well as continuing to cycle through new tenants into our portfolio in Los Angeles at higher rents than we\u2019ve done in previous years. So, both sides.\nJuan Sanabria: Great. Thanks. And then, since David Lee [ph] is on the call. So, curious if he has any intent, since he\u2019s on call, to share. And if not, [Technical Difficulty]. Is that bringing you guys above market, the kind of change in strategy there, or is it just kind of a market to [Technical Difficulty] hourly workers?\nJoe Russell: Yes. There\u2019s a number of different components that went into the range of wage increases, coupled with, as I mentioned, us putting even more focus on employee development, additional positions within operations. What we continue to do is compete for and reward very strong capabilities within our property management ranks. It\u2019s a tough environment from a competitive standpoint with the wage pressures and just availability of hourly employees. But we think we\u2019ve got very strong and compelling reasons to attract and retain employees, and we continue to use a lot of very vibrant strategies to not only bring very talented property management level employees into the business, but to reward them and give them longer-term career opportunities with us as well. So, it\u2019s a part of the business we continue to focus on very aggressively. And we\u2019re pleased by a number of things that we\u2019ve not only done relative to just pure wage rates but also career and growth opportunities within operations as well.\nOperator: We have no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the call back to Ryan Burke for closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We apologize for the echo that we understand you were hearing during the question session. So, we\u2019ll certainly get that remedied moving forward. We\u2019ll talk to you all soon. Have a great day, and take care.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. We finished the year with strong financial performance. We reported core FFO of $3.54 for the quarter and $12.93 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range and representing 21.9% growth over 2020. Now, let's look at the contributors for this quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 13.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. That performance was consistent with the last quarter despite tough comps and a modest return of seasonality through the fall. Growth was driven by rate with two factors leading to the continued strength. First, strong demand and limited inventory allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 19% versus 2020. We're comparing to pre-pandemic levels, 33% versus 2019. Secondly, existing tenant rate increases also contributed with lengthening customer stays in comparing to a period in 2020 when we were impacted by rental rate regulation in many markets. Now, on to operating expenses. As we had discussed on prior calls, we had higher expense growth in the fourth quarter driven by property tax timing. But if you look at the full year operating expenses, we reported same-store operating expense growth down 2%, representing record company performance. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 12.2% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter, adding $61 million in NOI or roughly half of the full portfolio NOI growth. Now, I'm going to shift gears to the outlook. We introduced 2022 core FFO guidance with a $15.20 midpoint, representing 17.5% growth from 2021. We're anticipating another year of strong customer demand for self-storage, as Joe highlighted earlier, leading to same-store revenue growth of 13.5% at the midpoint, roughly in line with second half \u201821 growth levels. As we look at the components of revenue, occupancy is likely to fall as we move through the year but remain above 2019 levels. Rate will be the strongest driver of performance going forward. Continued strength from move-in rents and existing tenant increased contribution. Notably, the long-running rent restrictions expired in Los Angeles, adding circa 1.5% to 2% on the full company same-store revenue outlook. Los Angeles is our largest market poised to accelerate with our industry-leading portfolio and team as well as our recently completed capital investments in this market through our Property of Tomorrow program. On expenses, our expectations are for 6% to 8% expense growth, driven primarily by property tax and payroll growth. That leads to NOI growth at the midpoint of 15.7%, roughly in line with 2021 strong performance. Our non-same-store acquisition and development properties are poised to be a strong contributor again in 2022, growing from $281 million of NOI contribution in \u201821 to $450 million at the midpoint for 2022. Included in that is our plan to add $1 billion in acquisitions and $250 million of development deliveries this year. Looking ahead past 2022 for the non-same store, we added one element to our guidance for the year compared to last year. The incremental non-same-store NOI to stabilization from the acquisitions and developments completed ahead of year-end \u201821. It represents the annual incremental NOI to be gained at stabilization in addition to our 2022 NOI expectations for those properties. It equates to approximately 5% yields on recent acquisitions and 10% yields on development, and we anticipate capturing roughly half of that embedded growth in \u201823 and the rest over \u201824 and \u201825. This pool of lease-up assets will be a powerful growth engine over the next several years. And last but not least, our low leverage balance sheet gives us capacity to fund growth and, at the same time, is well laddered with long-term debt and $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions against a rising interest rate environment. In addition to external financing, we expect to retain approximately $700 million of cash flow to reinvest into our growth for the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Joe. Well, stepping back, the way we approach same-store reporting is to report in our same-store the properties that have been stabilized for several years for comparable purposes. So, we look at both, how the occupancy is set up versus the market as well as how rents are versus the local submarkets. And because of that, our same-store represents truly stabilized operating performance year-in and year-out. That said, we just spent some time talking about the power of our non-same-store and the growth that's embedded there. And you can see in our supplement, the yields that we're achieving there and the growth that's embedded, as I just spoke to. So, we're also achieving that non-same-store growth. As it relates to what our peers report, I won't get into their reporting versus ours or otherwise, but would highlight the growth potential in our non-same-store pool of unstabilized assets as well as our core reporting for our same-store. I'd have to do some quick math there. It's going to be a little bit north of that, given operating leverage, but we can get back to you on what exactly that number is. But 1.5% to 2% on the revenue side, and as we highlighted, 6% to 8% operating expense growth. So that's the difference. Sure. So, let me take a stab at that. And Joe, you can chime in as well. As Joe mentioned, we're continuing to see strong customer momentum as we begin the year. And we're starting the year, frankly, with the best rent growth and record occupancies heading into 2022. So, that certainly is encouraging. As we move through the year, what we're already experiencing is continued strong move-in rent trends, and we'd anticipate that to continue through the first half of the year as we compare against early 2021. And then we expect move-in rent trends to moderate as we move to the back half of the year. We're already seeing that in certain markets. If you look at a market like New York, that was stronger out of the gate in 2020 per se but has moderated in growth since, still at pretty healthy growth rates for the quarter, is experiencing move-in rate growth in the fourth quarter in the 7% range. So, we've seen that growth start to moderate in certain earlier recovery markets. So, we anticipate that to play through in the system. At the same time, as we sit here today, we're seeing really strong contribution from markets like Miami and Atlanta who experienced north of 30% move in rent growth in the fourth quarter. So, we've got some room to moderate from here. The second component with that as it relates to new customer demand is seasonality. We talked in the past about how we expected some return to modest seasonality in 2021, and we saw that. If you looked at occupancy trends from peak to trough in 2020, which was an unusual year given the pandemic, we saw about a 40 basis-point occupancy decline from peak to trough. Last year, in 2021, we saw about 170 basis-point decline from peak to trough. And in 2022, our expectations are for a more normal year, again, easing into more seasonal patterns with about a 250 basis points peak to trough decline. The third piece, which is really important, is the existing tenant rate increase contribution, which I highlighted, which will further add to the move-in rent momentum on rate. And you highlighted, is there something different there? And there certainly is. We just highlighted that in LA County, for instance, we've been subject to rent restrictions for a number of years. That hadn't allowed us to utilize our existing tenant rate increase program as we typically would. So, that's certainly the case in Los Angeles, but it was the case in other markets as well through the back half of 2020 and into the beginning of 2021. So, we have tailwinds on existing tenant rate increases because of that as well as the lengthening customer stays, which gives us the ability to send more increases on a year-over-year basis than we've done in the past. And Joe, anything you'd like to add to that? I do think that there's an element of that that I think resonates. I think if you look at our strongest markets in the summer of 2020, they were San Francisco and New York. And we saw some dislocation related demand as well as moving activity and the like. And those markets have remained strong, but they haven't continued their acceleration, like you've seen in the Miami or Atlanta, where really pro-cyclical demand drivers, as we talked through last year, employment growth, population growth, housing activity really driving strong demand where we see that continued to accelerate through 2021. I do think that we look at those markets as -- meaning New York and San Francisco as markets where we may be past the peak levels of demand but remain very, very healthy. You look at San Francisco for the fourth quarter, for instance, occupancy was down 130 basis points, but the 96.4% occupied and continued momentum in that market. And so, I do think that that's a case of what could be a medium-term stabilization for some of these markets as the growth matures, but we'll have to see how that plays out. But as we sit here today, Miami's fourth quarter growth was at 23%. It was up 100 basis points in occupancy, and move-in rents were up 31% in the quarter. So, continued really strong momentum in Miami, which is one of our largest markets as well. Sure. So, maybe let me take the second part of that question first, which is what do we anticipate in some of the Sunbelt markets we're seeing real strength. And I'd say, certainly, as you look at occupancy growth, we're at 97.2% occupancy in Miami in the quarter. There's not a lot of room for that to move higher. It really is a rate story, and we are achieving strong rental rate growth, as you highlighted there. And I think that there's a continuation of that as we get through the year. But no question, we're going to have much tougher comps in the second half in places like Miami and Atlanta. So, we're likely to see that rate of growth moderate but at those higher rents, i.e., we're not expecting to see significant deceleration or going backwards in operating fundamentals, given the -- what we think is the durability of demand in those markets. So, hopefully, that... Sure. That's a good question. So, if you take a look at the contributions of growth in 2022 and compare them to 2021, clearly, one of the big drivers of growth outside of the same-store pool is going to be our acquisition activity. And if you look at the two chunky quarters of acquisition volumes last year, we had the ezStorage transaction, and a number of others take place in the second quarter of last year, which really were contributors to 2021 growth. And in addition to that, that portfolio, in particular, was a more stabilized portfolio. It came in at 86% occupied, and we were able to achieve improved operations there pretty quickly through the year such that we recognized a good bit of the growth there. If you think about the fourth quarter activity and a lot of the other activity and acquisitions last year, much of it was unstabilized. So we spent some time talking about the All Storage portfolio and the stabilization to come there on our last call. And so, what that means is it's coming in at lower yields given lower occupancies and rental rates, and we're going to seek to stabilize those portfolios over the next several years, which leads to the embedded growth that I spoke to in \u201823, \u201824, \u201825, but also means there's going to be less of a big bang impact per se in 2022. But ultimately, we'll see how the path of that lease-up takes place over this year and the coming years, and we'll update you on that in coming calls. That's a great question, Todd. So, I think if you look at the different markets and the growth profiles, you highlighted LA, and so I'll spend some time on that, but I want to talk about the portfolio as a whole. So we went through a period last year where we saw acceleration really across the board in all of our markets. And we're sitting here in early 2022, talking about the tailwinds that we have in LA, which is our largest market. No question, it's poised to accelerate from here. And as you'd expect, we're starting from a place where the rent restrictions expired at the end of the year. It will take us some time to see that acceleration play through in the coming quarters, but a good chunk of the rate component of that will be achieved through the busy season this year. So, we'll have more to talk about as we get through the first half. So, as LA is accelerating and maybe some of the other markets that have been subject to rent restrictions accelerating, we would anticipate that there are others that see a rate of revenue growth start to decline and go the other direction, and that's kind of inherent in the midpoint of our range being somewhat consistent with what we reported through the second half of 2021. We're going to have some markets that are accelerating, and we're going to have some markets that are decelerating. The rate of growth in a market, say, like Miami and Atlanta is unlikely to maintain at these levels, but are likely to still grow at very healthy rates through 2022. So, we are likely heading into a year where we see some acceleration and some deceleration, which we view as healthy into 2022. Sure. So, let me clarify what I had mentioned about 10% yields. So, the 10% yield that I was speaking to is where we expect the previously delivered developments to achieve stabilization. And you can see in the supplement that, for instance, the 2017 or 2018 development vintages are already north of 8% here in the fourth quarter on an annualized basis. So, I wanted to provide some road map to where the vintages through 2021 are set to stabilize, but that's not meant to suggest that a 10% yield is our target. What we've historically highlighted is, plus or minus 8% property level yield upon stabilization, call it, three or four years out is a target range, obviously, modulates by market and asset type and submarket. But -- so we aren't moving target yields to 10%, but we do expect to achieve circa 10% on those that have been delivered. And then, the second point is on -- as it relates to construction costs and the challenges associated with development today, I'll let Joe chime in on that. Sure. I think one of the metrics that I'd highlight that with is the average length of stay of our customers that are in-house today. And pre-pandemic, that average length of stay was about 33 or 34 months. So, approaching three years, but just a touch under. Today, that average length of stay of the in-house tenants is just about 40 months. So, we moved a meaningful way past that three-year threshold and continue to see that play through the beginning part of this year as well. Sure. There were certainly other markets that experience rental rate restrictions and have a similar benefit but not anywhere to the same degree as Los Angeles. And so ,we specifically called out Los Angeles. But as you'd anticipate, there were a number of other markets, including New York, New Jersey, San Francisco, the rest of California, and really many of our markets that at some point over the past two years have rental rate restrictions. And there are modest benefits in those markets as well, but nothing like Los Angeles County, given the duration of those rental restrictions and the size of the Los Angeles market for us. But there are some other tailwinds playing through with existing tenant rate increases because of that through 2022 in other markets also, but always embedded in the outlook that we provided for \u201822. Yes. On a year-on-year basis, we've seen occupancy that ended the year, call it, 50, 60 basis points above prior year at record levels. We are starting to see some of that moderation through January and into February. We're just right around flat at this point year-over-year. But again, at record occupancies for this time of year as we sit here at the end of February. Yes. If you look at the move-in rents, I think is the term we would like to use, which is what do we actually achieve in rents for customers to sign contracts through the first part of the year, there is a benefit certainly as we look at where we ended the fourth quarter in move-in rents compared to the first quarter of 2021, for instance. And so some of the growth that we're going to experience is certainly associated with the fact that just maintaining rents from the fourth quarter will be positive year-over-year growth into the first quarter. That is probably the biggest chunk of rental rate growth for move-ins through the first two months of the year, and then we do -- first -- I'm sorry, two quarters of the year. And then we do anticipate modest rental rate growth for move-ins thereafter as well, but certainly moderating from the rate of growth that we've seen through the first quarter and third quarter of last year. Sure. So, we did widen the same-store revenue range from, call it, 1.5% range to 3% for this year and trying to capture more of those potential outcomes compared to what we did last year. But in terms of elements that would drive the top end versus the bottom, I think you can probably anticipate what they are, i.e., stronger customer demand, more rental rate strength for move-ins, even longer length of stays in the higher end case. And the flip side, true for the lower end case. So, nothing in particular that I'd highlight that would be unique about the range there. Yes. Sure. Great question, Ki Bin. So, we have had the opportunity to refinance a significant amount of preferred stock over the last several years. Call it, $2.5 billion of preferred stock has been refinanced at lower rates, and that contributed to the decrease in cost of in-place capital that Joe highlighted earlier. As we move through the year, certainly, we would look to refinance those to the extent that we can lock in attractive, permanent like-for-like capital as well and keep that kind of cornerstone of the capital structure, which is incredibly attractive in a rising interest rate environment, given we'll never have to refinance the preferred stock and take advantage of opportunities where we can ratchet lower that cost of financing. So, we have, as you mentioned, $580 million that we could potentially address this year, but we'll have to see where the market is at that time. And then, as it relates to the floating rate question, we did issue floating rate notes as part of the financing package for ezStorage last year. Those are callable notes that we'll look to refinance here in the coming years. We have not fixed those. So, we have an ability to prepay those and manage the interest rate risk as we go. Great. That's a very good question. So, we did experience through 2021 a situation where move-in rents and in-place rents were very consistent in Los Angeles. And in fact, move-in rents in some instances moved higher in some of the properties here in Los Angeles because of the dynamics of the rental rate restrictions. That said, the contribution going forward of rental rate growth with the regulations no longer in place are both, move-in rents as well as existing tenant rate increases. So, in other words, we had an inability to increase move-in rents above the rental rate restrictions, the same way it was for existing tenants. So, I would say it's both parts, both moving existing tenants higher as well as continuing to cycle through new tenants into our portfolio in Los Angeles at higher rents than we've done in previous years. So, both sides."

            "name": "Joe Russell",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I would like to begin the call by reviewing a few of the significant highlights from 2021 and then discuss our outlook for 2022. Last year, the Public Storage team unlocked opportunities in one of the most historically vibrant eras for the self-storage industry. Our priorities have included capturing excellent customer demand, enhancing operations through the digitalization of our platform, acquiring individual assets and portfolios that provide outsized growth, and our ongoing investment in our people. On top of this, we have funded growth through a combination of exceptionally low-cost debt and preferred issuances giving us significant firepower to expand the business going forward. There are four areas that were critical to our success in 2021, which have also set the stage for an equally, if not more powerful, 2022. First, listening to our customers. We found innovative ways to solve what many new customers told us they wanted, a fast and efficient way to lease a storage space on their own time frame. Through our e-rental offering, approximately 50% of our new customers now self-select their space digitally. No operator in the industry comes close to this level of adoption. Our existing customers told us they wanted more tools to interface with Public Storage. This led to the full rollout of the PS app, which now has over 1 million downloads, offering an array of self-directed service options, including digital property access and account management. Second, driving our industry-leading 4-factor growth platform. We acquired 232 assets totaling 22 million square feet for approximately $5.1 billion, adding quality and scale to our market presence, nationally. This included two $1.5 billion-plus portfolios, which were additive to our operating platform in the desirable markets of Washington, D.C. and Dallas Fort Worth. Through development, the Public Storage real estate and construction teams grew our pipeline to approximately $800 million as we deliver Generation Five properties to markets from coast to coast. And we added 79 assets across 22 states to our management platform with easy integration of both, existing and newly built assets. Third, an ongoing commitment to invest in our people. In 2021, we increased hourly wages by 14%. We enhanced training to facilitate career progression with new positions in field operations. And recently, we were named by Forbes as one of America's best large employers. Then fourth, the effective utilization of our powerful balance sheet. We issued $5 billion of new debt instruments, refinanced $1.2 billion of preferred equity, and took the overall blended cost of debt and preferred from 3.9% to 2.7%. As we enter 2022, the balance sheet is primed to fund growth. We have approximately $1 billion in cash and will likely generate another $700 million in free cash flow. Now, turning to this year. We have launched 2022 with a high degree of confidence that Public Storage is poised for another strong year. The components of our outlook are anchored by three areas. One, customer behavior has set the stage for another good, busy season. Through our own data, we see demand from both, traditional and newer factors, including the fifth D, Decluttering. Also, the high cost of housing, a strong economy, generational adoption of self-storage and business users continue to create a vibrant customer acquisition and retention opportunity. Two, limited growth in new supply nationally. Our view is we are in a three-year holding pattern of new supply deliveries, which began in 2021. We are likely to see a range of 500 to 600 property deliveries take place annually through 2023 due to elevated risk tied to city approvals, higher component, labor and land costs. And three, our commanding non-same-store portfolio, which is now 25% of our total portfolio. With the investment activity in 2021, our non-same-store portfolio has grown significantly and is now comprised of 513 assets, approximately 50 million square feet and has current occupancy of approximately 84%. The earnings power tied to the sizable asset base is significant and will likely continue. The portfolio is suited for outsized growth due to the quality of the assets, exceptional locations and the lease-up activity we see as self-storage demand continues, particularly under the Public Storage brand. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thanks, Tom. In summary, we look at 2022 as another milestone year for Public Storage. We are also reflecting on our past as we look to the future by officially marking our 50th year as the largest owner and operator of self-storage in the United States. I want to thank you for your support, and on behalf of our 5,500 associates of Public Storage, thank you for your confidence in our abilities to lead this industry into the next 50 years. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Yes. And just with all that said, Michael, another area that I touched in my opening comments is the environment from a supply standpoint is materially different than it has been over the last several years, even though we're likely to see continued deliveries. You know that we're the only public developer of self-storage assets on a national basis. We've got the biggest team out there looking and sourcing both land sites and taking assets through various stages of development. And I'll tell you the amount of hurdles that are in today's environment are much tougher, and it's giving us a nice window to point to the number of levels of metrics and the level of confidence that Tom just talked about why this year is likely to be every bit as vibrant as what we saw in 2021. And we don't really see any looming evidence of a surge of new development coming into play outside of what we're going to see in 2022 and likely 2023. So overall, it's a continued good window for us to operate with good pricing power, low levels of supply and very good customer demand, both new and then existing customer behavior. So yes, the first part of the question, Todd, there are a lot of headwinds that we see, in particular, as we're an active developer and we're in a variety of different stages. So, you've got constraints around city processes. Many cities have not even come close to normal levels of operations for approvals. You've got supply chain and component availability issues that are not easing in any material way as we're entering into 2022, and there's elevated cost that goes with that and labor availability. So, there are a lot of different factors that are creating not only, I would say, material delays in some cases, but it gives many developers a lot of pause to jump into an environment right here where there's a lot of unknown consequences to both, timing and cost. So, I don't disagree that 500 to 600, you may step back and go, there's still a level of volume there. And both, with our own statistics and the data that we derive from other sources, we think that's a reasonable amount of development activity that's still at hand. The development business in our sector is highly fragmented, and you're going to see it continue to play through by, more often than not, small developers that may be going through a process on one site at a time or, in some cases, for the first time. So, there's a lot of different crosscurrents that are creating the delays that I'm speaking to. And what we see in our own portfolio is more and more angst around committed deliveries; the vendors that you're dealing with, whether they're tied to concrete or steel or labor availability. There's just a lot of different factors that are creating, what I would say, headwinds around elevated levels of deliveries. So, we're pretty confident that we're going to be in this holding pattern, both this year and likely into next year. I wouldn't tell you that any particular markets getting oversupplied. So, that's a positive thing, where in past cycles, particularly when we were seeing many more properties being delivered nationally, you could see and measure the impacts in certain markets because of the abundance of new supply that was literally hitting the ground and coming up very quickly. So, it's a very different development dynamic as we speak, and it continues to be a good window for us to go out and compete for land sites. We're seeing fewer levels of competition, as I've talked about for the last several quarters. But to, again, go into the sector right now as a first time or a small developer, you're going to have a far level and a higher degree of risk, and that's creating some level of discipline or pull back. So yes, Spenser, we've certainly got the capability to think broader than just domestic opportunities. Clearly, we've seen a very vibrant ability to grow and capture well-placed and good opportunities right here in the U.S. We will keep and have the ability to think outside U.S. borders. I'm not going to point to any particular part of the global opportunity. One of the things that comes through with international expansion is the depth of any particular market, the maturity of any particular market, and with that, what kind of opportunity and timing could play for us compared to the opportunities that we see right here in the U.S. So, again, from a knowledge and capability standpoint, we're very confident when the right opportunities surface. We're going to be very, I would say, surgical on those kinds of opportunities. But at the moment, we continue to stay very-focused on a very good opportunity set right here in the United States. Yes. I would point you to our associates at Shurgard. They can give you very good color because they're very deep into the Western European markets, and I would rely on their commentary and perspective on what they're seeing there. And to Australia, I could only basically just talk to the fact that it is a market that continues to embrace self-storage. There's good demand factors that play through in the Australian economy. And again, I look to the operators that are in that market to give you even more specific color on what's going on there. Yes. I mean, it's definitely a good question and, theoretically, how quickly or will we ever revert back to what things were like pre-pandemic, coupled with the fact the impacts of the pandemic are now a solid two years plus into the overall economy, behaviors, the way companies have reset, again, workforces, the way people are living their lives. There's a whole different host of different drivers that are at hand beyond just the more obvious factors that might have been tied just directly to the impacts of the pandemic itself. Certainly, at the beginning of the pandemic, the very quick reversion to pure work-from-home environment has created some outsized demand from that alone. But you could argue today, the hybrid situation or the way people have reverted to living lives differently, whether it's through their own work environments, home environments, the way people are moving and then on top of that, some of the other things, I mentioned in my opening comments, tied to generational demand, a very strong housing market, there's population shifts that are going on, and there's certainly strong relativity why, no surprise, Florida and Texas are two of our very strongest markets because of population migration in. So, there are many other factors that continue to drive both, adoption and the need for self-storage. Financially, if you think about the cost of housing, whether you're an owner or a renter, continues to escalate at a very strong level. And storage can be a very sensible and financial alternative to diffusing some of that cost. So, we're very confident that the inherent benefits of storage will continue to play through. And the things that we've learned through the pandemic, many of which could be longstanding and deep-seated, will continue to serve both us and the sector very well. A little bit harder to peg at a specific number, but there's no question we do see elevated level of business-oriented customers. If you think about how tight and expensive, again, the industrial market continues to be and with changes in distribution, you mentioned last-mile or different distribution patterns or different types of smaller companies needing spot space, what I mean by that is something that they may think they only need for a month or two without having to sign a long-term lease, storage is a great fit. We've seen this historically. But with the economy coming back and smaller businesses resuscitating, we're seeing good levels of business demand come into the portfolio as well. Yes. Smedes, as I mentioned earlier, there's no question there's elevated, not only timing and execution, but cost pressure that's playing through. We'll see how that continues with, hopefully, some easing of some of the supply chain issues that are out there. But there's no question, labor in and of itself is a very commanding factor. Market to market, that can be quite pronounced. And then, there's been a high degree of volatility, for instance in steel over the last few months. We're keeping a very close eye on that. But, if you're a smaller developer and you're, either not by experience and/or knowledge or even scale and size, able to deal with some of these wide-ranging cost impacts, as I mentioned, I think there's going to be more discipline playing through, we're keeping a very close eye on it. That's the benefit of having the size and the capability of our own development and construction teams. So, they're working very hard to see and understand and contain the elevated level of costs that are playing through on asset development right now. Close to what we saw in 2021. It averages in the high-50%, low-60%. We've got a combination of assets that are in various stages of stabilization in the pipeline. And tactically or strategically, we're going to continue to look for those assets going forward as well. They've been well suited to many of our investment strategies, and that's what we're seeing right out of the gate here at the beginning of the year. So, one of the things, we do a vibrant amount of customer surveys with both new and existing customers. So, there's been some natural gravitation to new generational users that have come into the portfolio through the pandemic needing more space for a variety of different reasons was a more pronounced driver. It hasn't gone away by any means. It's moderated a small amount, but it's still a sizable component of the kind of demand that's playing through as we're surveying customer needs as they come into the portfolio. And then, it goes to the whole host of other drivers that we've been talking to as well, whether it's the amount of activity tied to home sales, movement from market to market and then our classic definitions of the other 4 Ds, which are very deep-seated drivers of self-storage in and of itself. The cluttering or Decluttering factor, I do think it's got some long-lasting effects, not only because there's still a strong hybrid work environment that's playing through many economies, but it's also tied to the cost of either being an owner or a renter. So that, too, is going to create more need for more space at home. Yes. Ki Bin, we at a Board level, continue to evaluate the -- both, benefit of our investments in either entity and the commitment that we continue to have in either entity. So, that's an ongoing Board review process that's in place. And when and if we make a change in our commitment to either entity, we would certainly communicate that. We've been very pleased with the returns that each set of investments have garnered for us, and we continue to be committed to each entity and are pleased by their performance. Yes. There's a number of different components that went into the range of wage increases, coupled with, as I mentioned, us putting even more focus on employee development, additional positions within operations. What we continue to do is compete for and reward very strong capabilities within our property management ranks. It's a tough environment from a competitive standpoint with the wage pressures and just availability of hourly employees. But we think we've got very strong and compelling reasons to attract and retain employees, and we continue to use a lot of very vibrant strategies to not only bring very talented property management level employees into the business, but to reward them and give them longer-term career opportunities with us as well. So, it's a part of the business we continue to focus on very aggressively. And we're pleased by a number of things that we've not only done relative to just pure wage rates but also career and growth opportunities within operations as well."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the phone will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Emma. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm here with Joe Russell, CEO; Tom Boyle, CFO; and Mike McGowan, Senior Vice President of Acquisitions. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, November 2nd, 2021, and we assume no obligation to update or revise or supplement statements become untrue because of subsequent events.  A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports, and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, PublicStorage.com. As usual, we do ask that you keep yourself limited to two questions to begin with. Of course, if you have more, feel free to jump back in queue with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Russell: Thanks, Ryan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin with the obvious. Overall, business is excellent. I do want to thank the entire team at Public Storage for their efforts. Our team members from our properties, to the corporate office and back, are focused on driving this level of performance. Across our industry and consistently throughout our markets, more customers than ever before have been drawn to the benefits of using self-storage. We have often characterized additive demand coming from life events, which we've referred to as the 4 Ds; divorce, death, dislocation and disasters. For the last several quarters a 5th D has emerged; Decluttering.  Customers need more space at home due to the shifts in working and living environments across all markets. Unfortunately, the customers that have come to us during the pandemic are now behaving more like traditional customers, meaning they are staying in place as they have come to appreciate the convenience and cost benefit of using cell storage, particularly as residential and commercial spaces become more expensive. With that said, demand remains historically strong. In the third quarter, our revenue, NOI, and cash flow per share foot, reached record levels once again. As we wrap up 2021, the outlook for 2022 and beyond is favorable as well.  The utilization rate of self-storage continues to climb, as it has for decades, which is now at 11% of the US population. Millennials and Gen Zs, two big user groups, are aging into our core customer life-stage, driven once again, by the 5Ds. And Public Storage is leading the self-storage industry's transformation, towards a customer experience, that provides digital, as well as traditional options, across the entire customer journey. We have a deep-seated commitment to listen to what our customers want and they are giving us vibrant input that directs our priorities. This has led to some exciting changes in our customer offerings. One example we have spoken to is our industry-leading e-rental platform.  Today, nearly 50% of our customers are renting with us through the e-rental online lease. Year-to-date, nearly 500,000 customers have chosen e-rental to secure a unit. It's fast, intuitive, and self-directed, taking just a few minutes to complete a rental. An option many customers have been anxious to use. And the quality of this customer has been impressive. In early 2021, we also introduced the PS app, which nearly 1 million customers have now downloaded, allowing easy tools to manage your accounts and navigate our properties digitally and hands free. These are two great examples of how our investment in technology is transforming our operating model.  And it's a win-win for both customers and our operating efficiencies. Daily headlines across multiple industries, however, remind us there are challenging consequences impacting the economy in terms of labor pressure, and self-storage is not immune. We are actively investing in our team through increased wages and new, more specialized positions that are providing even greater upward mobility for our skilled property teammates. On the leadership front, we have also strengthened our ranks, and announced yesterday that David Lee has joined Public Storage as Chief Operating Officer. David previously served as Senior Vice President of Operations for the UPS Store. With responsibility for more than 5,200 retail locations the in the U.S. and Canada, we are excited to have him on board.  Now to another area, I'm pleased to share with you our external growth initiatives. Our 4-factor external growth platform is centered on acquisitions, development, redevelopment, and third-party management. All areas are seeing strong growth. Starting with acquisitions, in 2021, the self-storage industry will likely see approximately $18 billion or more of assets trade. This is a tremendous amount of volume and opportunity. Owners have been motivated to bring assets to market, to monetize their investments, while some also plan for potential tax changes. Year-to-date, we have acquired or under contract on $5.1 billion of acquisitions, or about 30% of the industry volume this year.  This has come -- this is comprised of 233 properties across 21.1 million square feet with average occupancy of 56%, which is providing a significant embedded growth opportunity once we place these assets onto the Public Storage Platform. The transaction spans a wide spectrum of geographies, portfolios, and one-off purchases, with both market and off-market deals. We continue to be looked at as a preferred buyer based on our knowledge, transaction efficiency, and ability to easily fund transactions. Of note, 65% of this quarter's volume is tied to the All-Storage Portfolio, which we are acquiring for $1.5 billion. All Storage is a high-quality Portfolio of 56 properties primarily located in Dallas, Fort Worth.  Dallas, Fort Worth has been one of the best storage -- cell storage markets over the past 15 years. With population growth nearly 2 times that of the national average. Our own Portfolio in Dallas, Fort Worth, produced annual NOI growth of a 150 Basis points higher, than our national average. The All-Storage properties also give us additional exposure to new, higher-growth submarkets, particularly in and around Fort Worth. Many of the properties were recently developed resulting in the current 75% occupancy level which provides significant upside as we move them onto our industry-leading platform. The transaction is immediately accretive to FFO and accretion will accelerate through to stabilization at nearly 6% direct NOI yield.  And combined with owned and other assets under contract, we are expanding our already significant platform in this vibrant market to approximately 200 assets, or by 64%. The remaining 35%, or $1.1 billion of the acquisitions closed or under contract will provide significant growth as well. These assets are geographically diversified across the country, comprised of single acquisitions, to smaller portfolios, ranging in size from $40 million to $200 million dollars totaling 3.9 million square feet, with average occupancy of 50% at a $179 per square foot. Now to development and redevelopment, where our pipeline has grown by $70 million to $731 million this quarter.  We're seeing good opportunity to build new properties from the ground up in addition to expanding our existing assets. Nationally, our development team is underwriting well-located land sites as we continue to leverage our expertise, as the largest developer in the self-storage industry. This quarter, we also added 28 properties to our third-party management platform, increasing properties under management to 145. We plan to reach 500 assets by 2025. Of note, we have also acquired 14 assets from our third-party management platform as well. In summary, since the beginning of 2019, we have expanded our portfolio square footage by 22% with a total investment of approximately $7 billion, equaling 36 million square feet, for an average of $193 per square foot, which has clearly produced strong growth and value creation that we expect will continue. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Boyle: Thanks, Joe. Our financial performance accelerated into the third quarter. Our same-store revenue increased 14% compared to the third quarter of 2020. That performance represented a sequential improvement in growth of 3.2% from the second quarter, driven by rate. 2 factors led to the acceleration in realized rent per foot. 1. Strong demand and limited inventory, which allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 24% versus 2020, at 33% versus 2019, 2. Existing tenant rate increases contributed, comparing to a period in 2020 and we were significantly impacted by rental rate regulation in many markets. Now on to expenses. The team did a great job executing in this environment once again.  Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing, and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property payroll, as Joe discussed, on October 1st, we increased Property Manager wages, which will lead to higher expenses going forward, but will be partially offset by efficiencies in labor hours tied to the operating model transformation we discussed at our Investor Day in May. On property tax, we will expense our annual estimate [indiscernible] through the year, leading to an approximately $0.13 benefit year-to-date and reversing to a $0.13 headwind in the fourth quarter. This will lead to a more stable quarter-over-quarter expenses in the future. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 21.7% in the quarter.  In addition to the same-store, the lease up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities, was also a standout in the quarter, adding $53 million in NOI in the quarter, or $0.30 in FFO. As we sit here today, coming off the peak part of the leasing season, existing customer behavior is solid, with move-outs down year-over-year in the quarter, and new customer demand remaining robust. So with that let's shift to the outlook. We raised our core FFO guidance by $0.55 at the midpoint, or 4.5%.  Looking at the drivers, we increased our outlook for same-store revenue, to grow from 9.5% to 10.5% in 2021, that outlook implies a modest deceleration in revenue growth in the fourth quarter, against very tough comps. Our current expectations are for occupancy to moderate from here by about a 150 basis points to the end of the year. That would land occupancy at the healthy 2020 levels at the end of the year. But big picture, the baton has clearly been passed to rate growth where we continue to see strength. Our expectations are for 0 to 0.5% same-store expense growth.  As a reminder, that implies an increase of circa 30% in the fourth quarter driven by the property tax timing I discussed. We also increased our guidance for non-same-store performance given the acceleration of acquisitions and strong lease up of our own stabilized facilities. Now, on the balance sheet, we have one of the industry's leading balance sheet s set up well to finance the transaction volumes we've seen this year. We plan on funding the all-storage acquisitions with unsecured debt, and we remain poised to grow with capacity to fund the continued activity that Joe has discussed. With that, turn it back to you, Joe.\nJoseph Russell: Thanks, Tom. We are optimistic about our business and for good reason. As always, the commanding capabilities tied to the Public Storage brand, a high quality, and well-located portfolio, the industry-leading operating platform, and most important of all, our people, have us well-positioned for sustainable growth and value creation. Now we'll open the call up for questions.\nOperator: At this time, if you would like to ask a question, [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeffrey Spector: Great. Good afternoon. Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I'm not sure if there's -- if we're allowed 2 questions, so I guess my first would be on the new hire, David Lee. Very interesting, I guess, if Joe you can provide a little bit more details on David 's role and what you see him bringing to Public Storage, please.\nJoseph Russell: Sure Jeff. First, we're excited about David joining the executive leadership team. We've built over a number of decades now, a great operations team. Today, the teams comprise of over 5,000 and over of our associates, who are committed to deliver exceptional customer service while clearly adapting to the many changes that we've been talking about. So David 's joining us at an exciting time. His role will be to continue leading what we call the customer journey, where we're unlocking and delivering new tools to our teams and offering different channels and experiences right at the front lines for our customers.  And with that, his engagement with the team as a whole will be very important as we move the entire team forward through a very dynamic time not only for the Company, but for the industry. Clearly, his skills were attractive, based on its 20 years or so with the UPS organization. The UPS Store platform more particularly, so we're very excited about his fresh perspective, as we continue the various changes to our overall operating model. And definitely look forward to the contributions he bit -- brings to the entire management team.\nJeffrey Spector: Great. That sounds great. And hopefully if I have a second, Joe, I always consider you to be conservative with your comments, so it's encouraging to hear the outlook for '22 and beyond looks favorable. We're getting a lot of questions on supply in '23, I guess. Can you elaborate? Not looking for guidance, but now what makes you feel comfortable to make that statement and then, I guess, in particular, supply?\nJoseph Russell: Yeah, Jeff. The thing that has been a nice window for us over the last year to 2, is the reduction in national deliveries of new storage products. We've talked about that for some time, where this year there's likely to be about $3.5 billion or so of new deliveries, put it on the markets nationally, compared to the peak that we saw in 2019 of about $5 billion. We're likely to see that number trend down again in 2022, particularly with some of the hurdles that are out there from a development standpoint that we clearly see day-in and day-out, that includes the time it takes to get a property entitled, many of the cities are clearly understaffed and we're seeing longer processes actually to get something as simple as a permit or a use or a occupancy use for -- meant for a property come through, to more commanding issues that we're seeing even from the cost and availability of components of construction and then labor itself.  So there's some different and I would say commanding issues that any developer today has to go through to operate in this kind of an environment. So that's likely to produce, again, this down-drop draft that we're predicting for 2022. Now, having said all that, our industry has, you well know, is very fragmented. The development industry as a whole tied to self-storage is too very fragmented and it's hard to predict what level of activity might resurface in different markets based on, frankly, the continued very strong performance of the sector. So we're keeping a very close eye on that. As we've talked about, we've got a deep team across the entire national set of opportunities that we're working on. And we're also seeing activity that's coming through our third-party management platform\nJoseph Russell: as well, that is tied to future development. So it will be with us. The question is, how much more momentum comes out of the environment we're dealing with as we speak? Which is one of the long-term attributes of cell storage. It's great business. So we'll see and monitor the impact that's likely to have but we feel at this point we continue to have a very good run rate to go out and capture good land sites with the deep development team and the knowledge we've got across all of our markets.\nJeffrey Spector: Okay, thank you.\nJoseph Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Smedes Rose of Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just -- I wanted to ask a little bit more about the decision to load up more in Dallas. And maybe if you could just talk a little bit about the process, how competitive it was to get this portfolio. And then I -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I guess I think of Dallas as a fairly low barrier to entry market and I'm just wondering are there any risks to meeting these stabilized yields that you're targeting?\nJoseph Russell: Yes, sure. Smedes. First off, I mean, we have a longstanding commitment to Dallas. We've seen, as I mentioned in my opening comments, good growth that's come out of that market. You're right, it has been a market that's been prone to an outside level of development from time-to-time. But frankly, the embedded growth that we see that's tied to a very business-friendly, economy, low cost, including taxes, cost of housing etc., centrally located within the United States, great infrastructure. It's a huge draw for both business and overall population growth.  So what came with this portfolio was an opportunity to leapfrog our position, that was already a top position, that market, where we have had approximately 120 existing assets, as well as a dozen or so third-party management properties and leapfrogging it by another 52 to 53 properties. So huge opportunity to grow and actually put additional presence in parts of the Dallas, Fort Worth market, particularly Fort Worth, that we were lighter in. And Fort Worth for instance, like Dallas as a whole or the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, is growing dramatically. So we're really encouraged by that population growth.  It's very strong, good house hold income, and we really like the multiple attributes that we will see and continue to see with our industry-leading position in that particular market. Mike McGowan is with us; I'm going to hand the mic over to him. He can give you a little color on what came through with the process we went through to actually capture the portfolio.\nThomas Boyle: Thanks Joe. So it was a competitive process. It was quietly marketed with more or less a few select people that could take down a transaction of this size. In reference to your size -- your question about the location the new supply coming in, this developer really did a great job of putting a footprint of 50 properties in markets that were so far ahead of his time, out in areas that are having high barriers for new storage to come in. He built large properties in those marketplaces, kept a lot of competitors out at the same time. And really for us, we're starting to see the same type of issues with zoning, of getting new storage in a lot of these newer areas, in these high-growth areas, which are the better areas of the Dallas, Fort Worth market. So for us, it puts us in a great position to be in new markets we want to be in, and gives us a very strong presence in all those markets to do it that fills big gaps for us at the same time.\nJoseph Russell: And one other thing, Smedes, from integration and assimilation standpoint, we have as we did with ezStorage, a great opportunity to bring in the majority of their operations team. We're excited about adding those new members to the Public Storage team there on Dallas, Fort Worth. The opportunity for us to integrate these assets and put them under the Public Storage brand will be very efficient. Clearly, we're very skilled at that coming right off the experience we just had in Washington Metro with ezStorage. So we're very confident that in a very short period of time, we can transfer the 60 plus thousand customers that are coming with this portfolio into our own systems and our own opportunity to drive value based on the way that we're going to be able to run those properties as we do our entire portfolio.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We'll go next to Juan Sanabria with BMO.\nJuan Sanabria : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about on the acquisition side, the yields going in and target stabilized for the third quarter transactions as well as what's on the dock, including All Storage. You talked about -- a little bit about it on a stabilized basis, but curious on the going in yields from a modeling perspective.\nThomas Boyle: Sure. This is Tom. As Joe mentioned, a lot of the activity in the third quarter into the fourth quarter is unsterilized activity. And so what -- if you think about average occupancies in the 50% I would have that in your mindset. And then from a yield standpoint, we obviously gave you a sense for all storage, what those yields are. Call it 2.6% on their operating platform in the third quarter, so that gives you a starting point. And I would say across the other properties, probably similar type yields even with a little bit lower occupancy. So I think that gives you a starting point. Clearly, we have confidence in our ability to lease these properties up. One of the things that Joe mentioned earlier around our confidence in our operating platform in Dallas, Fort Worth, similar to Washington, DC.  If you look at our ez transaction from earlier in the year. when we acquired that at 86% occupied, we got it to 94% through the busy season. And really strong growth in a market where we're out of inventory, so to give you a sense, a few of those properties we took over in the 40% occupancies and got them up to 90% by the end of the busy season, which is clearly strong leasing activity. In Dallas, similarly, we're out of inventory. We've successfully leased up our activity that we've built and bought over the last several years, and are poised to take over these All-Storage properties here over the next several months.\nJoseph Russell: Yeah. Juan, I'd add, as again we've talked to, and Mike and his team have been very focused on for the last year-and-a-half, in particular, a lot of great assets have been built over the last 5 or 6 years. And we've really had the opportunity to capture very high-quality assets, mostly recently built in this cycle. And what we feel are good values, with good opportunities to grow performance. That's why we haven't been shy about taking on any level of un -stabilized occupancy and these assets. As Tom mentioned, we're very confident, particularly in its environment relative to our lease up capabilities, as well as taking on the stabilization in an era where we're seeing some very, very good consumer and business demand, frankly.\nJuan Sanabria : Great. And then just hoping you could speak to the latest data points, maybe through October, from an occupancy and a rate perspective. You noted the implied guidance for the fourth quarter is at 150 basis point occupancy moderation. Just curious on how we stand to-date on that?\nThomas Boyle: Yes. Sure. It's made -- to just give you a sense as to where October ended, the year-over-year gap and occupancy, we were at 1.2% at the end of September. That has fallen a touch to around positive 75 basis point gap at this point. So we are seeing that modest moderation in occupancy as we move into the fourth quarter here, but continued strength on rate. And so we continue to see good Growth there. Some of the markets that we're seeing, the most strength, the Southeast Miami, Atlanta, the Sunbelt in aggregate, continuing to see a greater than 50% move in rate growth at this time of year compared to 2019. So, really strong pricing momentum here despite a modest declines in Year-over-year occupancy.\nJuan Sanabria : Thank you.\nThomas Boyle: Sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nThomas Boyle: Hey, Michael. Are you on mute?\nOperator: We will go next to Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning out there. First question I wanted to circle back to investments for Joe or Tom. With All Storage, now you've disclosed, you're taking up leverage to 4.3 times on a pro forma basis. And there are a couple of other larger scale portfolios, reportedly on the market, and a lot more product besides those portfolios that you discussed. You still have room to take leverage up obviously, you have a lot of access to capital as well. But your dry powder's decreasing a bit if you're looking to stay in that 4 to 5 times range that you discussed at the Investor Day earlier in the year. So I'm curious what the appetite is like for additional larger scale deals, And then we saw that you're issuing $80 million of units for the deals under contract. Should we assume that PSA is open to issuing more equity today as part of the funding plans going forward?\nJoseph Russell: So, first of all, I'll address the environment holistically, Todd, then Tom can give you a little bit more color around what I would call the tools in our toolkit. But the environment continues to be very vibrant. We're seeing a vast array of different types of sellers coming to market. And we feel well poised with the capacity of our balance sheet to continue to be a very efficient acquirer. And we want to maintain that because we think it's highly advantageous, even in a market like this, where it's quite competitive depending on the type of asset and the location, etc., that might come through. We feel we're very well poised.  Our balance sheet has been and will continue to be a great competitive advantage for us, and we'll continue to, as I mentioned, look at many of the tools in our toolkit. Tom, can give you a little more color on that, but we're very confident we will continue to be able to embrace this environment with a whole range of different opportunities that may come through.\nThomas Boyle: Yes, thanks, Joe. And as you mentioned, Todd, we do have strong access to capital with our balance sheet position the way it is. And we're confident in our ability to continue to fund acquisition activity with a broad set of tools. So we spoke about using unsecured debt. And we've used unsecured debt, really over the last several years to fund activity. That doesn't mean that we're not open to other alternatives, including common equity or JV equity as we discussed at our Investor Day, to the extent that volumes are both high-quality, attractive financial return, we would certainly be open, and welcome the opportunity to use a broad variety of tools in the toolkit over time. But for All Storage in particular, we plan to fund it with unsecured debt and we feel good about the leverage level where it is today.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then if I could ask one more, just about the existing customer rent increases. And Tom, when you look at the 14% of revenue growth in the quarter, you talked about there was a small portion that was related to occupancy. When you look at the balance of the revenue growth in the period, how should we think about the contribution between the higher move-in rates that you described and the impact from ECRIs?\nThomas Boyle: Yeah that's a good question. So really on a year-to-date basis, we've seen a pretty balanced contribution between the move-in, move-out dynamics on one side, and then the existing tenant rate increases, both contributing meaningfully. I would put them roughly on par with each other in terms of the contribution. I do think going forward, one of the things we disclosed is our move-out activity and the move-out rates. So, move-out rates are starting to catch up with move-in rates. They have not caught up yet, but they're starting to catch up. And that will start to be a headwind on the contribution from the move-in to move-outside. but we will still have existing tenant rent increases as a tailwind from here, given the market rent increases that we've seen across the country.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And with the ECRI program would you expect to see that moderate at all as the -- as move out rates catch up a bit there, or you have to -- do you have to just to take your foot off the gas a little bit as that happens on the existing customer rent increases or is that not the case?\nThomas Boyle: Well, I would say that existing tenant rent increases is something that's managed very dynamically across the country, and really across the tenant base. And I think that the way to think about that is, one of the benefits of the current environment is higher market rents and that lowers the cost to replace that tenant if they elect to leave. That kind of base continues to be quite sticky, which gives us confidence to continue to send increases out to the tenant base. As we think about where we're going forward, in fact, one of the contributors to higher move-out rates is actually the fact that we're being successful in increasing rental rates on that existing tenant base. So I would say almost the reverse, which is as we're successful on existing tenant rate increases, I'd anticipate that that move-out rate will move higher. Move-out rate meaning the rent that the people are paying, that do a lot to leave us.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nJoseph Russell: Thanks, Todd.\nOperator: We'll go next to Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi there. Maybe one on development. This can definitely be a great opportunity, but one of the hurdles is that ability to continue getting land in attractive areas. Just wondering if you could go through how this process is going now and any difficulties that you're running into to continue it,\nJoseph Russell: Well that goes right down to the knowledge and the focus you have to have, relative to what's transpiring in any given submarket, so as I've spoken to, we've got a very deep-seated team across the entire portfolio that we operate today. And in markets that we continue to look for additional growth as well. The opportunity to acquire land over the last year-and-a-half or so has been somewhat elevated because we've seen that tapering down of delivery. So not quite as much as a ground-up development momentum, again, coming from a very fragmented set of developers out there. But lands still very competitive.  There's a lot of knowledge you need to have to find and locate the exact right location that's complementary to future growth of the particular asset, the kind of dynamics that come from competition, as well as population growth, etc. A lot of different factors come into the way that we are able to select land sites very differently than most, because of the amount of data that we have day-in and day-out, relative to our presence already across 39 states, and being a top owner in nearly every one of those submarkets. The business though it's very entrepreneurial from an overall self-storage standpoint. So there's competition that can come through. And as I mentioned, in some cases that may become more elevated than we've seen over the last year and a half.  Keeping a very close eye on it, but we feel like we've got very good tools to not only find great land sites to actually execute, even in an environment where it's tough to get either entitlements and/or justify the cost that are tied, particularly from component costs and labor costs that are playing through to actually develop facilities in an environment where we're seeing a high degree of inflation at the moment.\nCaitlin Burrows: And actually on the inflation point, I was wondering, just given, obviously revenues are up a lot, the business is really strong [Indiscernible] down. Can you go through what impact do you think inflation is having or will have on your business both from a revenue or expense side.\nJoseph Russell: Well, one thing that's advantageous to self-storage in general, is the fact that we have a month-to-month lease business. So it's a huge opportunity to actually react to the cost pressures that may play through from inflationary pressures. So, that's an advantage -- the product itself affords us to actually monitor and react to any of those inflationary pressures. We're confident that we can maneuver through those pressures, but it's something we have to keep very close to. And that's why we -- in every part of our business, we constantly look for efficiencies and the ways that we can continue to look at operating and running our business as cost effectively as possible.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Thanks.\nJoseph Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ki Bin Kim, Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks, and good morning out there. So a simple question on same-store revenue. If market rents don't increase in 2022, how much built-in upside is there already in same-store revenue?\nThomas Boyle: Looking for 2022 guidance already, Ki Bin?\nKi Bin Kim: Not guidance. This is inside the -- below the low point. So even if market rents don't grow, how much is the starting point, do you think?\nThomas Boyle: Yeah. Well, I think there's a few things there. One is, we continue to see strength in market rents. And so I understand the question you're suggesting, but I think that we continue to see strong demand for self-storage across the country. But if you look at the markets with the strongest growth, really driven by macroeconomic demographic, and population shifts that we think are poised to continue here, which is helpful. So clearly, there has been a move in market rents higher and existing tenant rate increases have been moving the current tenant base higher alongside that.  Now, over the course of last year, and really the -- through a good portion of this year, and in some markets continuing today, we have had pricing regulations on us because of state of emergencies and the impact of the healthcare environment. And that's definitely been a headwind as it relates to the existing tenant base and moving them. in the same manner that market rents are going. So, I think another way to say that is there is some embedded rate growth that's available to the extent that we will continue to see normalization from a healthcare standpoint, and the state of emergencies continue to expire. The most notable of which is in Los Angeles County not related to pandemic, but related to fire several years ago that we continue to monitor.\nKi Bin Kim: And how impact full was that? I guess said another way, how much money was up from the people as it compares to portfolio? Just to get -- just for us to get a sense of how meaningful that could be.\nThomas Boyle: Yeah. So one of the things that we've -- that we look at is, what the impact of those pricing restrictions have been on us versus what our models would have otherwise suggested that we send the increases out at. And I ran these numbers for last quarter, so I'll give you precisely what it was for last quarter. I don't have it for this quarter, but through the first part of the year, first-half of the year, it was about a 300 basis point negative impact to same-store revenue growth in the first-half of the year. So anticipate that that's largely remained pretty consistent through the third quarter. But that gives you a sense of the magnitude.\nKi Bin Kim: Got it. Alright, thank you.\nThomas Boyle: Sure.\nOperator: Well, go next to Rob Simone with Hedgeye Risk Management.\nRob Simone: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Hope all is well. I have a longer-term question on third-party management. You guys are somewhat unique in that unlike some of your peers, and it's a credit to you, you actually attribute expenses to that platform specifically, which is really helpful. Between now and the 500\nRob Simone: stores. What is the crossover point for you guys? Or could you talk a little bit about the crossover point when you get firmly into the green in that business. And then from a margin perspective, what do you think that could potentially scale to? And I ask that because we're used to looking at property management fees as a singular line item with a lot of the costs kind of buried in other segments or in G&A. So just trying to pick your brains on how you think about that.\nJoseph Russell: Yeah, sure. So, there's a couple of components in there. One is obviously, we've been ramping the size of that business, and one of the most vibrant areas of demand from our customer base for that business line is from folks that have developed new properties. And so as we take on those properties, the profitability of a new property is less than one of one that has stabilized obviously, given the revenue nature of the fees. And so as we ramp that program, similar to our development business almost, there's a ramping of the profitability of each individual store. So set another way, it's going to take several years before the volumes that we're anticipating really start to produce the P&L impact that you might anticipate.  The second piece of your question relates to what are the margins of that business? And there's a couple of factors there. So one is clearly the geographic mix of the properties themselves, what the operating costs are that they're tied to them, but if you just look at them overall and you say, okay, where can we get different margin basis versus the fees we're charging? And I think, a reasonable margin is probably in the 20s to 30%. But again, a lot of variability as we add a significant number of properties to that's store base over the next several years.\nRob Simone: Got it. And would you guys ever consider -- I mean, I know obviously you're deploying a lot of capital right now and there's still some capacity, but would you ever consider a JV Program with maybe a capital partner? I know Joe mentioned in his remarks that a lot of folks out there are rethinking about their timing to an exit. Are there opportunities to do a JV program where you also participate in the third-party management? And it just -- it grows the pie so to speak.\nJoseph Russell: There will likely be opportunities just like that, Rob. So I would tell you that we're open to a variety of different scenarios as we're engaging in different ownership groups, whether they are currently or anxious to get into self-storage. So that's definitely something that we'll continue to evaluate. And as those opportunities arise, we'll certainly be able to give you more color on those.\nRob Simone: Yep. Understood. Okay. Just thinking about the strategic thinking. All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Be well.\nThomas Boyle: Okay. Thank you.\nJoseph Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: Hey, good morning on the West Coast. Just a continuation from Todd 's question earlier on using equity financing for acquisitions. Did those sellers ask for the 80 million of units to avoid triggering tax events or did you offer those as a sweetener to get a deal done? We just haven't seen, I think, shares or units offered since Shurgard 15 years ago.\nThomas Boyle: Yeah. It's a good question. And it really is driven by the fact that there are sellers out there that are interested in accepting our shares as currency, and that's something we're open to. You're right, it\u2019s the first time we've done it in a number of years. But we're open to it, and it can be an attractive way to transact with the sellers that are interested there.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay. And as perhaps the share price moves a little higher, cost of equity gets a little more attractive, you would be open to using those shares or units for large portfolio deals, say like another several billion-dollar acquisition, that fair?\nThomas Boyle: Sure. I think the way we think about the return profile of our deals is typically on a non-levered basis. And so we're evaluating what the return profile is, either on a leverage neutral basis or unlevered basis. And so as we look at ultimately the financing of these transactions, we've had the opportunity to continue to use unsecured debt and preferred as the core piece of the capital structure, but as volumes grow, it will make good financial sense to continue to broaden the sources of capital, and the benefits of that growth will continue even with using maybe higher costs equity or JV equity, potentially.\nJonathan Hughes: Yeah. Okay. And then I just have one more, if I may. One of your peers said they expect a greater than inflation level of on-site labor cost increases next year. It's fair to say we'll see that maybe even slightly a higher level from your portfolio since you did just stomp wages, 7.5% a month ago.\nJoseph Russell: So as I mentioned, Jonathan, yeah, the labor market is highly competitive. It's definitely somewhat unpredictable as well. But I'll tell you it's a difficult time to attract and retain personnel at any level of skill across the entire organization. So we're going to continue to look at the benefits of making either changes to wage rates and or balancing that with a variety of different efficiencies we're seeing with the transition of our operating model as well. So we're going to continue to monitor that and likely see, again a very competitive environment going into next year.\nJonathan Hughes: Alright, that's it for me, thanks for the time.\nJoseph Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instruction] We'll take the next question from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, thanks so much for the time. When you talk about -- I think you made a comment about the expansion of the portfolio, 19% spent 2020. Clearly you're in a very strong market, strong demand, and so forth. But over the next 2 to 3 to 4 years, does that lend itself the opportunities to think about what markets you really want to own long term, and potentially sell some assets? Probably not today given how strong the markets are but just how are you thinking about the portfolio long term. Thanks.\nJoseph Russell: Yes, Ron, that's definitely something that we have a, I would call it a fluid analytical approach too. Meaning that we're always looking to and understanding the impact in value of assets across multiple markets, evaluating the benefit of either continuing owning and/or at whatever point thinking about recycling any level of capital tied to existing assets. So that's an ongoing process that we'll continue to look to and its definitely part of the internal process that we use relative to the way that we're seeing value creation from existing assets. And then the opportunity potentially to recycle.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then my second question was just asking the COO appointment question a different way. I know you mentioned opportunities, maybe introduced new products to the operations team. But should we think about this as incremental change? Or is this a revolutionary new ways of doing business and operating? Just trying to get a little bit more color how we should think about the impact of this new COO role.\nJoseph Russell: Well, I'd go back to the things that we described in our Investor Day, where we gave a fair amount of detail on the variety of ways that we're enhancing our operating model, through investments in technology and then different channels and different opportunities we're giving customers, to engage with us, across a whole spectrum. As well as the things that we continue to be focused on relative to people development and the types of opportunities internally that we think are very well suited to continue to grow the quality of our workforce. So the role that David 's coming into, isn't new to the Company in the context of our goals and the strategies that we have.  It's just an added level of leadership that we think is prudent as we move the business forward. And we're accelerating the pace of change that ties to the amount of investment that we're making in our people directly, as well as the technological platforms, particularly as it relates to the digitization of the business. So it's one added layer of leadership that we think is well timed and we really look forward to continuing to optimize the way that we're running the Portfolio as a whole, including the way that we're also engaging and giving a variety of different opportunities to our existing employee base. So really good time for him to come into the business, and as I mentioned, we're excited about the fresh perspective he is going to have as well.\nRonald Kamdem: Helpful. Thank you.\nJoseph Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Spencer Hallway [indiscernible]\nSpencer Hallway: Thank you. With this widespread supply chain issues, we've been seeing an increasing number of companies keeping what's being called just-in-case Inventory. Have you guys noted any incremental business-related demand in recent months?\nJoseph Russell: Do you mean from just core customers coming to us the -- differently or trying to use space because of maybe keeping goods at more immediate availability?\nSpencer Hallway: Yeah. Exactly.\nJoseph Russell: Yeah, I couldn't point to, Spencer, an exact lift in demand based on that, but it wouldn't surprise me based on the variety of different business customers that do use self-storage in a way that's more spot oriented where they may have an elevated level of demand that they need to cater to, and by virtue of that, storage can fit that need quite easily. So there's likely some benefit that we're seeing from that in many markets.\nSpencer Hallway: Okay. And then just on the expense side, where would occupancy need [Indiscernible] for us to begin to see marketing costs creep back up in a material manner?\nThomas Boyle: Spencer, I would say that that's a pretty dynamic and local decision that we manage. And I wouldn't necessarily say it's an occupancy-based item. It relates to what we're seeing in the customer funnels. So advertising has a benefit to increase top of funnel, the number of people that are say, searching for Public Storage or are finding Public Storage when they go to search for self-storage. And so, that is helpful in markets where we're seeing top of funnel demand erode. But we have other tools as we're managing revenue. Be it, pricing, promotion etc. that will impact conversion, within that funnel.  And so I would say we're watching the different components of the funnel and what the returns are associated with pulling those different levers. To-date, we continue to see strong top of funnel demand across the board. Web visits, for instance, in the quarter were up North of 20% across the system, calls into our call center were roughly flat. So overall, still very solid, top of funnel demand, which led to the decision-making around marketing in the quarter. As we've demonstrated in the past, if we start to see those dynamics change, we typically do see pretty good returns on our advertising spend and we'll pull that lever as well.\nSpencer Hallway: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nThomas Boyle: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan Morgan.\nMike Mueller: Hi. Just wondering, for All Storage, what did you assume for rate growth through 2025 to get to your 6% stabilized yield expectations?\nThomas Boyle: Yeah. One of the things that we looked at within the portfolio is obviously there's a pool of properties that have recently been delivered that we have the opportunity to lease up, and then ultimately stabilize on a rate basis until we go through our underwriting process of seeing what our stores in the area and what competition is, and ultimately what we think we can squeeze from a revenue standpoint within our own revenue management platform, and we'll underwrite those there. And then on the stabilized stores, we call them stabilized, but the reality is, they're not in our platform. And like we're seeing in acquisitions to date, really, through last year we have an opportunity to put our operating platform and systems in place and drive further improvements.  So you can see for instance, where our overall Dallas portfolio rental rates are. And obviously, these properties have their own submarkets and underwritten rates. But it gives you a sense as to the upside in rental rates that we think we can achieve in the portfolio over time.\nMike Mueller: Were you embedding additional rate growth beyond current market or just pulling them up to current market and assuming that it's capped out there?\nThomas Boyle: Yes, it's a combination of where we think rates are today, so spot rates. And then, ultimately, that the runway we see for rental rate activity counterbalanced with one of the questions earlier around rental rate risk due to new development within that market in those submarkets, which is a consideration as we think about forward rents, as well. So, a combination of a number of those things. But I would point you to the presentation where you can see our same-store rents in Dallas punching at $15 per foot versus the in-place rents there in the third quarter at about $11. So there's definitely occupancy and rental rate upside.\nMike Mueller: Okay. Thank you.\nThomas Boyle: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Smedes Rose with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: Hi, it's Michael Bilerman here with Smedes. Joe, we're going to go back to go back to the hiring of a new COO because I think you've gone down, not you, but the Company has gone down this path previously and every time that COO came on there wasn't -- it never stuck. And so I'm just curious at the start to, as you've now rehired for the COO position, what's different this go around versus other initiatives in the past on this topic?\nJoseph Russell: Well, yeah. Part of the history, Michael, I don't know if I agree it never stuck. I mean, we've had in our history obviously predating my tenure here, periods of time where you had multiple year COO positions in place and then by virtue of the dynamics of the business, we've made different changes. For instance, taking some senior leaders, for instance, on sabbatical to go over to Shurgard for 1 or 2 years at a time, etc. So it's been somewhat of -- I would agree, somewhat of a fluid position by name, but by responsibility and focus, it's been with us consistently. One of the things that is different relative to the opportunity that we see at this point to bring in as I characterize even more fresh perspective and more additive leadership capability to that overall role as the dramatic growth and change in our business.  As I've noted, we've acquired a sizable amount of assets over the last couple of years, literally the size of some of our competitors. And it's been a great opportunity for us to continue to think about how the business is changing, the different tools that we're putting in place, the investments that we're making, and as importantly, the skills and the development of our employee base tied operations. So it's a great time for us to put even that much more emphasis on the role, and we're excited about what we can continue to do with David's leadership coming in, and the things that we're very focused on relative to the overall effectiveness of our operations team has as a whole.\nMichael Bilerman: What are those top three priorities for him in the next call it 90 to a 180 days. And can you talk about any restructuring underneath him in terms of the team, or how you're going about -- as you've talked about the business set is changing. You didn't have 50% doing online, contactless a few years ago. So you talked a little bit about what the priorities are and things like that.\nJoseph Russell: Well, here's a number priorities that's coming in one of the business. I mean, that's the way we've all come into the business. Being as focused on the front lines as possible and that's definitely a top priority and it's not to come in and make massive change or retool something that's broke. It's an opportunity to enhance and optimize many of the great foundational investments that we've made that frankly, are statistically, in a whole differently than what you're seeing with other operational platforms. As I mentioned, e-rental, 50% of our customers use e-rental.  That's amazing, where plus or minus 40,000 to 50,000 customers a month are using that channel that did not exist less than 8 or more than 18 months ago. So we're confident that we have a foundation that continues to unlock really good opportunities the way we're running the entire operational team. And we're excited about what we can do with David coming on the team as well.\nMichael Bilerman: Can you give us some insights on what David did at UPS in terms of the changes that he initiated, at the store level which my local UBS Store it has gotten a lot better over the years, so hopefully you will driver of that, but talk a little bit about, sort of the characteristics and what drew you to him, about what he's been able to accomplish in this prior rule?\nJoseph Russell: Well, there's no question that that platform is very transaction-oriented, it's very customer - centric, it's tied to again, advancement in their own operating model. And we really liked many of the skills and the attributes of that kind of a transactional. environment, and how it relates to what we see in self-storage. So a lot of very good things that we can learn from that environment, and then, he'll be learning from our environment as well, and we can create the best of both worlds.\nMichael Bilerman: Great. And just last question on this topic. You don't have a lot of -- I think it's only in the Hawaii asset in terms of having store front retail at the self-storage facility. Is that an opportunity that you're thinking about? And I think someone mentioned revolutionary. Are you thinking differently about the store front real estate that you have? And given the fact you mentioned 60% of people are doing it online, how much is that store differentiation or additive things that you can bring into that real estate to drive incremental cash flow. Could you be an Amazon pickup and delivery service type of thing, it's like -- is that part of the focus at all for the Company?\nJoseph Russell: It's a good question, and I will tell you there's all variety of strategic opportunities that we'll be more than happy to share as they evolve. There's a lot of creativity that continues to surround the customer-driven demands that we're seeing as customers continue to shift the way they want to interact with any type of business, particularly ours. And we think they are very vibrant opportunities going forward. And as those arise, we'll be sharing those with you.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. Thanks, Joe.\nJoseph Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon, Joe and Tom. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. How do you think about the risks associated with doing several large acquisitions at a time, when yields are as low as they've been? And, can you talk about how Public Storage can maximize the growth of these acquisitions on your platforms?\nJoseph Russell: Yes, sure Michael. I mentioned we've had obviously a fair amount of volume over the last couple of years, but it ties to the scale and the ability on our part to integrate assets, whether on a one-off basis, smaller, even large portfolio. even when it's highly concentrated, as of what you saw with ezStorage, and now again, with the All-Storage Portfolio in two big metropolitan markets. But it points to the ability that we have from a structure and a scale and operating prowess standpoint. So we're deep in these markets. We've got very strong teams that run these assets day in and day out. Our systems allow very efficient integration. And we've been doing this for many, many years.  And with the investment we've made with our technological platform, we certainly can do it in higher degrees of volume and higher degrees of concentration. The yields that we'll likely see. from this integration are, as we've mentioned, compelling. Again, it ties to the fact that we have the inherent skill and benefit from the investments that we've made in to do just this. So our capital structure as well, due to the continue to fund the kind of growth that we've seen and there's no question the team as a whole, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is continuing to do a great job with the integration and the ability for us to actually improve pretty dramatically the performance on most of the assets we continue to buy.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's helpful. And the second year in a row where teams -- the occupancy moderation from the summer to the end of the year is less than in the past, so do we think this is new norm, or is this kind of just kind of a unique circumstances surrounding the last couple years, and we should return to the more seasonal decline in future years. How are you thinking about that?\nThomas Boyle: Yes. So last year was certainly a unique year, where we saw different seasonal patterns because of the nature of the healthcare environment last year. And we didn't see much if any of an occupancy decline as we moved through the year. This year, we did see a more seasonal pattern and frankly had the benefit of some of the seasonal demand driver's, things like home sales and DIY projects over the summer, for instance, college students, etc., that will add to demand in the Summer, but then we'll then move out as we move into the Fall. So there was that additive demand this year, but we are seeing a little bit more moderation. One of the reasons why we're seeing that moderation is the continued stickiness of the tenant base.  And so we've had fewer move-ins this year. And so recent move-ins are the most likely to move out. And so we've had a contribution of that benefit and a little bit more seasonality this year. I do think that the seasonal demand drivers that have been driving self-storage demand for years will continue to play out over the next several years, and so we operate a seasonal business and it will be going forward. The degree of it, we'll need to see year-in and year-out, but we are seeing a little bit more this year, but still really encouraging overall customer behavior.\nMichael Goldsmith: Just one last one for me. You mentioned the change in tax laws as a catalyst for the elevated transaction volumes this year. Do you expect the transaction volume to dry up next year, or continue throughout an elevated pace? Thanks.\nJoseph Russell: Well the amount of motivation seems to be strong. Just put it that way, relative to existing owners wanting to bring more product to market. So Mike and his team continued to be very busy as we transition into things we're working on going into 2022. So always tough to predict, but at the moment it looks like 2022 could be [Indiscernible]\nOperator: I will now hand the call back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thanks Emma. On behalf of the entire team on our side, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I look forward to speak with many of you next week and in the coming weeks and take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joseph Russell",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin with the obvious. Overall, business is excellent. I do want to thank the entire team at Public Storage for their efforts. Our team members from our properties, to the corporate office and back, are focused on driving this level of performance. Across our industry and consistently throughout our markets, more customers than ever before have been drawn to the benefits of using self-storage. We have often characterized additive demand coming from life events, which we've referred to as the 4 Ds; divorce, death, dislocation and disasters. For the last several quarters a 5th D has emerged; Decluttering.  Customers need more space at home due to the shifts in working and living environments across all markets. Unfortunately, the customers that have come to us during the pandemic are now behaving more like traditional customers, meaning they are staying in place as they have come to appreciate the convenience and cost benefit of using cell storage, particularly as residential and commercial spaces become more expensive. With that said, demand remains historically strong. In the third quarter, our revenue, NOI, and cash flow per share foot, reached record levels once again. As we wrap up 2021, the outlook for 2022 and beyond is favorable as well.  The utilization rate of self-storage continues to climb, as it has for decades, which is now at 11% of the US population. Millennials and Gen Zs, two big user groups, are aging into our core customer life-stage, driven once again, by the 5Ds. And Public Storage is leading the self-storage industry's transformation, towards a customer experience, that provides digital, as well as traditional options, across the entire customer journey. We have a deep-seated commitment to listen to what our customers want and they are giving us vibrant input that directs our priorities. This has led to some exciting changes in our customer offerings. One example we have spoken to is our industry-leading e-rental platform.  Today, nearly 50% of our customers are renting with us through the e-rental online lease. Year-to-date, nearly 500,000 customers have chosen e-rental to secure a unit. It's fast, intuitive, and self-directed, taking just a few minutes to complete a rental. An option many customers have been anxious to use. And the quality of this customer has been impressive. In early 2021, we also introduced the PS app, which nearly 1 million customers have now downloaded, allowing easy tools to manage your accounts and navigate our properties digitally and hands free. These are two great examples of how our investment in technology is transforming our operating model.  And it's a win-win for both customers and our operating efficiencies. Daily headlines across multiple industries, however, remind us there are challenging consequences impacting the economy in terms of labor pressure, and self-storage is not immune. We are actively investing in our team through increased wages and new, more specialized positions that are providing even greater upward mobility for our skilled property teammates. On the leadership front, we have also strengthened our ranks, and announced yesterday that David Lee has joined Public Storage as Chief Operating Officer. David previously served as Senior Vice President of Operations for the UPS Store. With responsibility for more than 5,200 retail locations the in the U.S. and Canada, we are excited to have him on board.  Now to another area, I'm pleased to share with you our external growth initiatives. Our 4-factor external growth platform is centered on acquisitions, development, redevelopment, and third-party management. All areas are seeing strong growth. Starting with acquisitions, in 2021, the self-storage industry will likely see approximately $18 billion or more of assets trade. This is a tremendous amount of volume and opportunity. Owners have been motivated to bring assets to market, to monetize their investments, while some also plan for potential tax changes. Year-to-date, we have acquired or under contract on $5.1 billion of acquisitions, or about 30% of the industry volume this year.  This has come -- this is comprised of 233 properties across 21.1 million square feet with average occupancy of 56%, which is providing a significant embedded growth opportunity once we place these assets onto the Public Storage Platform. The transaction spans a wide spectrum of geographies, portfolios, and one-off purchases, with both market and off-market deals. We continue to be looked at as a preferred buyer based on our knowledge, transaction efficiency, and ability to easily fund transactions. Of note, 65% of this quarter's volume is tied to the All-Storage Portfolio, which we are acquiring for $1.5 billion. All Storage is a high-quality Portfolio of 56 properties primarily located in Dallas, Fort Worth.  Dallas, Fort Worth has been one of the best storage -- cell storage markets over the past 15 years. With population growth nearly 2 times that of the national average. Our own Portfolio in Dallas, Fort Worth, produced annual NOI growth of a 150 Basis points higher, than our national average. The All-Storage properties also give us additional exposure to new, higher-growth submarkets, particularly in and around Fort Worth. Many of the properties were recently developed resulting in the current 75% occupancy level which provides significant upside as we move them onto our industry-leading platform. The transaction is immediately accretive to FFO and accretion will accelerate through to stabilization at nearly 6% direct NOI yield.  And combined with owned and other assets under contract, we are expanding our already significant platform in this vibrant market to approximately 200 assets, or by 64%. The remaining 35%, or $1.1 billion of the acquisitions closed or under contract will provide significant growth as well. These assets are geographically diversified across the country, comprised of single acquisitions, to smaller portfolios, ranging in size from $40 million to $200 million dollars totaling 3.9 million square feet, with average occupancy of 50% at a $179 per square foot. Now to development and redevelopment, where our pipeline has grown by $70 million to $731 million this quarter.  We're seeing good opportunity to build new properties from the ground up in addition to expanding our existing assets. Nationally, our development team is underwriting well-located land sites as we continue to leverage our expertise, as the largest developer in the self-storage industry. This quarter, we also added 28 properties to our third-party management platform, increasing properties under management to 145. We plan to reach 500 assets by 2025. Of note, we have also acquired 14 assets from our third-party management platform as well. In summary, since the beginning of 2019, we have expanded our portfolio square footage by 22% with a total investment of approximately $7 billion, equaling 36 million square feet, for an average of $193 per square foot, which has clearly produced strong growth and value creation that we expect will continue. Now I will turn the call over to Tom. Thanks, Tom. We are optimistic about our business and for good reason. As always, the commanding capabilities tied to the Public Storage brand, a high quality, and well-located portfolio, the industry-leading operating platform, and most important of all, our people, have us well-positioned for sustainable growth and value creation. Now we'll open the call up for questions. Sure Jeff. First, we're excited about David joining the executive leadership team. We've built over a number of decades now, a great operations team. Today, the teams comprise of over 5,000 and over of our associates, who are committed to deliver exceptional customer service while clearly adapting to the many changes that we've been talking about. So David 's joining us at an exciting time. His role will be to continue leading what we call the customer journey, where we're unlocking and delivering new tools to our teams and offering different channels and experiences right at the front lines for our customers.  And with that, his engagement with the team as a whole will be very important as we move the entire team forward through a very dynamic time not only for the Company, but for the industry. Clearly, his skills were attractive, based on its 20 years or so with the UPS organization. The UPS Store platform more particularly, so we're very excited about his fresh perspective, as we continue the various changes to our overall operating model. And definitely look forward to the contributions he bit -- brings to the entire management team. Yeah, Jeff. The thing that has been a nice window for us over the last year to 2, is the reduction in national deliveries of new storage products. We've talked about that for some time, where this year there's likely to be about $3.5 billion or so of new deliveries, put it on the markets nationally, compared to the peak that we saw in 2019 of about $5 billion. We're likely to see that number trend down again in 2022, particularly with some of the hurdles that are out there from a development standpoint that we clearly see day-in and day-out, that includes the time it takes to get a property entitled, many of the cities are clearly understaffed and we're seeing longer processes actually to get something as simple as a permit or a use or a occupancy use for -- meant for a property come through, to more commanding issues that we're seeing even from the cost and availability of components of construction and then labor itself.  So there's some different and I would say commanding issues that any developer today has to go through to operate in this kind of an environment. So that's likely to produce, again, this down-drop draft that we're predicting for 2022. Now, having said all that, our industry has, you well know, is very fragmented. The development industry as a whole tied to self-storage is too very fragmented and it's hard to predict what level of activity might resurface in different markets based on, frankly, the continued very strong performance of the sector. So we're keeping a very close eye on that. As we've talked about, we've got a deep team across the entire national set of opportunities that we're working on. And we're also seeing activity that's coming through our third-party management platform as well, that is tied to future development. So it will be with us. The question is, how much more momentum comes out of the environment we're dealing with as we speak? Which is one of the long-term attributes of cell storage. It's great business. So we'll see and monitor the impact that's likely to have but we feel at this point we continue to have a very good run rate to go out and capture good land sites with the deep development team and the knowledge we've got across all of our markets. Thank you. Yes, sure. Smedes. First off, I mean, we have a longstanding commitment to Dallas. We've seen, as I mentioned in my opening comments, good growth that's come out of that market. You're right, it has been a market that's been prone to an outside level of development from time-to-time. But frankly, the embedded growth that we see that's tied to a very business-friendly, economy, low cost, including taxes, cost of housing etc., centrally located within the United States, great infrastructure. It's a huge draw for both business and overall population growth.  So what came with this portfolio was an opportunity to leapfrog our position, that was already a top position, that market, where we have had approximately 120 existing assets, as well as a dozen or so third-party management properties and leapfrogging it by another 52 to 53 properties. So huge opportunity to grow and actually put additional presence in parts of the Dallas, Fort Worth market, particularly Fort Worth, that we were lighter in. And Fort Worth for instance, like Dallas as a whole or the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, is growing dramatically. So we're really encouraged by that population growth.  It's very strong, good house hold income, and we really like the multiple attributes that we will see and continue to see with our industry-leading position in that particular market. Mike McGowan is with us; I'm going to hand the mic over to him. He can give you a little color on what came through with the process we went through to actually capture the portfolio. And one other thing, Smedes, from integration and assimilation standpoint, we have as we did with ezStorage, a great opportunity to bring in the majority of their operations team. We're excited about adding those new members to the Public Storage team there on Dallas, Fort Worth. The opportunity for us to integrate these assets and put them under the Public Storage brand will be very efficient. Clearly, we're very skilled at that coming right off the experience we just had in Washington Metro with ezStorage. So we're very confident that in a very short period of time, we can transfer the 60 plus thousand customers that are coming with this portfolio into our own systems and our own opportunity to drive value based on the way that we're going to be able to run those properties as we do our entire portfolio. Yeah. Juan, I'd add, as again we've talked to, and Mike and his team have been very focused on for the last year-and-a-half, in particular, a lot of great assets have been built over the last 5 or 6 years. And we've really had the opportunity to capture very high-quality assets, mostly recently built in this cycle. And what we feel are good values, with good opportunities to grow performance. That's why we haven't been shy about taking on any level of un -stabilized occupancy and these assets. As Tom mentioned, we're very confident, particularly in its environment relative to our lease up capabilities, as well as taking on the stabilization in an era where we're seeing some very, very good consumer and business demand, frankly. So, first of all, I'll address the environment holistically, Todd, then Tom can give you a little bit more color around what I would call the tools in our toolkit. But the environment continues to be very vibrant. We're seeing a vast array of different types of sellers coming to market. And we feel well poised with the capacity of our balance sheet to continue to be a very efficient acquirer. And we want to maintain that because we think it's highly advantageous, even in a market like this, where it's quite competitive depending on the type of asset and the location, etc., that might come through. We feel we're very well poised.  Our balance sheet has been and will continue to be a great competitive advantage for us, and we'll continue to, as I mentioned, look at many of the tools in our toolkit. Tom, can give you a little more color on that, but we're very confident we will continue to be able to embrace this environment with a whole range of different opportunities that may come through. Thanks, Todd. Well that goes right down to the knowledge and the focus you have to have, relative to what's transpiring in any given submarket, so as I've spoken to, we've got a very deep-seated team across the entire portfolio that we operate today. And in markets that we continue to look for additional growth as well. The opportunity to acquire land over the last year-and-a-half or so has been somewhat elevated because we've seen that tapering down of delivery. So not quite as much as a ground-up development momentum, again, coming from a very fragmented set of developers out there. But lands still very competitive.  There's a lot of knowledge you need to have to find and locate the exact right location that's complementary to future growth of the particular asset, the kind of dynamics that come from competition, as well as population growth, etc. A lot of different factors come into the way that we are able to select land sites very differently than most, because of the amount of data that we have day-in and day-out, relative to our presence already across 39 states, and being a top owner in nearly every one of those submarkets. The business though it's very entrepreneurial from an overall self-storage standpoint. So there's competition that can come through. And as I mentioned, in some cases that may become more elevated than we've seen over the last year and a half.  Keeping a very close eye on it, but we feel like we've got very good tools to not only find great land sites to actually execute, even in an environment where it's tough to get either entitlements and/or justify the cost that are tied, particularly from component costs and labor costs that are playing through to actually develop facilities in an environment where we're seeing a high degree of inflation at the moment. Well, one thing that's advantageous to self-storage in general, is the fact that we have a month-to-month lease business. So it's a huge opportunity to actually react to the cost pressures that may play through from inflationary pressures. So, that's an advantage -- the product itself affords us to actually monitor and react to any of those inflationary pressures. We're confident that we can maneuver through those pressures, but it's something we have to keep very close to. And that's why we -- in every part of our business, we constantly look for efficiencies and the ways that we can continue to look at operating and running our business as cost effectively as possible. Thank you. Yeah, sure. So, there's a couple of components in there. One is obviously, we've been ramping the size of that business, and one of the most vibrant areas of demand from our customer base for that business line is from folks that have developed new properties. And so as we take on those properties, the profitability of a new property is less than one of one that has stabilized obviously, given the revenue nature of the fees. And so as we ramp that program, similar to our development business almost, there's a ramping of the profitability of each individual store. So set another way, it's going to take several years before the volumes that we're anticipating really start to produce the P&L impact that you might anticipate.  The second piece of your question relates to what are the margins of that business? And there's a couple of factors there. So one is clearly the geographic mix of the properties themselves, what the operating costs are that they're tied to them, but if you just look at them overall and you say, okay, where can we get different margin basis versus the fees we're charging? And I think, a reasonable margin is probably in the 20s to 30%. But again, a lot of variability as we add a significant number of properties to that's store base over the next several years. There will likely be opportunities just like that, Rob. So I would tell you that we're open to a variety of different scenarios as we're engaging in different ownership groups, whether they are currently or anxious to get into self-storage. So that's definitely something that we'll continue to evaluate. And as those opportunities arise, we'll certainly be able to give you more color on those. Thank you. So as I mentioned, Jonathan, yeah, the labor market is highly competitive. It's definitely somewhat unpredictable as well. But I'll tell you it's a difficult time to attract and retain personnel at any level of skill across the entire organization. So we're going to continue to look at the benefits of making either changes to wage rates and or balancing that with a variety of different efficiencies we're seeing with the transition of our operating model as well. So we're going to continue to monitor that and likely see, again a very competitive environment going into next year. Thank you. Yes, Ron, that's definitely something that we have a, I would call it a fluid analytical approach too. Meaning that we're always looking to and understanding the impact in value of assets across multiple markets, evaluating the benefit of either continuing owning and/or at whatever point thinking about recycling any level of capital tied to existing assets. So that's an ongoing process that we'll continue to look to and its definitely part of the internal process that we use relative to the way that we're seeing value creation from existing assets. And then the opportunity potentially to recycle. Well, I'd go back to the things that we described in our Investor Day, where we gave a fair amount of detail on the variety of ways that we're enhancing our operating model, through investments in technology and then different channels and different opportunities we're giving customers, to engage with us, across a whole spectrum. As well as the things that we continue to be focused on relative to people development and the types of opportunities internally that we think are very well suited to continue to grow the quality of our workforce. So the role that David 's coming into, isn't new to the Company in the context of our goals and the strategies that we have.  It's just an added level of leadership that we think is prudent as we move the business forward. And we're accelerating the pace of change that ties to the amount of investment that we're making in our people directly, as well as the technological platforms, particularly as it relates to the digitization of the business. So it's one added layer of leadership that we think is well timed and we really look forward to continuing to optimize the way that we're running the Portfolio as a whole, including the way that we're also engaging and giving a variety of different opportunities to our existing employee base. So really good time for him to come into the business, and as I mentioned, we're excited about the fresh perspective he is going to have as well. Thank you. Do you mean from just core customers coming to us the -- differently or trying to use space because of maybe keeping goods at more immediate availability? Yeah, I couldn't point to, Spencer, an exact lift in demand based on that, but it wouldn't surprise me based on the variety of different business customers that do use self-storage in a way that's more spot oriented where they may have an elevated level of demand that they need to cater to, and by virtue of that, storage can fit that need quite easily. So there's likely some benefit that we're seeing from that in many markets. Well, yeah. Part of the history, Michael, I don't know if I agree it never stuck. I mean, we've had in our history obviously predating my tenure here, periods of time where you had multiple year COO positions in place and then by virtue of the dynamics of the business, we've made different changes. For instance, taking some senior leaders, for instance, on sabbatical to go over to Shurgard for 1 or 2 years at a time, etc. So it's been somewhat of -- I would agree, somewhat of a fluid position by name, but by responsibility and focus, it's been with us consistently. One of the things that is different relative to the opportunity that we see at this point to bring in as I characterize even more fresh perspective and more additive leadership capability to that overall role as the dramatic growth and change in our business.  As I've noted, we've acquired a sizable amount of assets over the last couple of years, literally the size of some of our competitors. And it's been a great opportunity for us to continue to think about how the business is changing, the different tools that we're putting in place, the investments that we're making, and as importantly, the skills and the development of our employee base tied operations. So it's a great time for us to put even that much more emphasis on the role, and we're excited about what we can continue to do with David's leadership coming in, and the things that we're very focused on relative to the overall effectiveness of our operations team has as a whole. Well, here's a number priorities that's coming in one of the business. I mean, that's the way we've all come into the business. Being as focused on the front lines as possible and that's definitely a top priority and it's not to come in and make massive change or retool something that's broke. It's an opportunity to enhance and optimize many of the great foundational investments that we've made that frankly, are statistically, in a whole differently than what you're seeing with other operational platforms. As I mentioned, e-rental, 50% of our customers use e-rental.  That's amazing, where plus or minus 40,000 to 50,000 customers a month are using that channel that did not exist less than 8 or more than 18 months ago. So we're confident that we have a foundation that continues to unlock really good opportunities the way we're running the entire operational team. And we're excited about what we can do with David coming on the team as well. Well, there's no question that that platform is very transaction-oriented, it's very customer - centric, it's tied to again, advancement in their own operating model. And we really liked many of the skills and the attributes of that kind of a transactional. environment, and how it relates to what we see in self-storage. So a lot of very good things that we can learn from that environment, and then, he'll be learning from our environment as well, and we can create the best of both worlds. It's a good question, and I will tell you there's all variety of strategic opportunities that we'll be more than happy to share as they evolve. There's a lot of creativity that continues to surround the customer-driven demands that we're seeing as customers continue to shift the way they want to interact with any type of business, particularly ours. And we think they are very vibrant opportunities going forward. And as those arise, we'll be sharing those with you. Thank you. Yes, sure Michael. I mentioned we've had obviously a fair amount of volume over the last couple of years, but it ties to the scale and the ability on our part to integrate assets, whether on a one-off basis, smaller, even large portfolio. even when it's highly concentrated, as of what you saw with ezStorage, and now again, with the All-Storage Portfolio in two big metropolitan markets. But it points to the ability that we have from a structure and a scale and operating prowess standpoint. So we're deep in these markets. We've got very strong teams that run these assets day in and day out. Our systems allow very efficient integration. And we've been doing this for many, many years.  And with the investment we've made with our technological platform, we certainly can do it in higher degrees of volume and higher degrees of concentration. The yields that we'll likely see. from this integration are, as we've mentioned, compelling. Again, it ties to the fact that we have the inherent skill and benefit from the investments that we've made in to do just this. So our capital structure as well, due to the continue to fund the kind of growth that we've seen and there's no question the team as a whole, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is continuing to do a great job with the integration and the ability for us to actually improve pretty dramatically the performance on most of the assets we continue to buy. Well the amount of motivation seems to be strong. Just put it that way, relative to existing owners wanting to bring more product to market. So Mike and his team continued to be very busy as we transition into things we're working on going into 2022. So always tough to predict, but at the moment it looks like 2022 could be [Indiscernible]"

            "name": "Thomas Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Our financial performance accelerated into the third quarter. Our same-store revenue increased 14% compared to the third quarter of 2020. That performance represented a sequential improvement in growth of 3.2% from the second quarter, driven by rate. 2 factors led to the acceleration in realized rent per foot. 1. Strong demand and limited inventory, which allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 24% versus 2020, at 33% versus 2019, 2. Existing tenant rate increases contributed, comparing to a period in 2020 and we were significantly impacted by rental rate regulation in many markets. Now on to expenses. The team did a great job executing in this environment once again.  Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing, and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property payroll, as Joe discussed, on October 1st, we increased Property Manager wages, which will lead to higher expenses going forward, but will be partially offset by efficiencies in labor hours tied to the operating model transformation we discussed at our Investor Day in May. On property tax, we will expense our annual estimate [indiscernible] through the year, leading to an approximately $0.13 benefit year-to-date and reversing to a $0.13 headwind in the fourth quarter. This will lead to a more stable quarter-over-quarter expenses in the future. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 21.7% in the quarter.  In addition to the same-store, the lease up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities, was also a standout in the quarter, adding $53 million in NOI in the quarter, or $0.30 in FFO. As we sit here today, coming off the peak part of the leasing season, existing customer behavior is solid, with move-outs down year-over-year in the quarter, and new customer demand remaining robust. So with that let's shift to the outlook. We raised our core FFO guidance by $0.55 at the midpoint, or 4.5%.  Looking at the drivers, we increased our outlook for same-store revenue, to grow from 9.5% to 10.5% in 2021, that outlook implies a modest deceleration in revenue growth in the fourth quarter, against very tough comps. Our current expectations are for occupancy to moderate from here by about a 150 basis points to the end of the year. That would land occupancy at the healthy 2020 levels at the end of the year. But big picture, the baton has clearly been passed to rate growth where we continue to see strength. Our expectations are for 0 to 0.5% same-store expense growth.  As a reminder, that implies an increase of circa 30% in the fourth quarter driven by the property tax timing I discussed. We also increased our guidance for non-same-store performance given the acceleration of acquisitions and strong lease up of our own stabilized facilities. Now, on the balance sheet, we have one of the industry's leading balance sheet s set up well to finance the transaction volumes we've seen this year. We plan on funding the all-storage acquisitions with unsecured debt, and we remain poised to grow with capacity to fund the continued activity that Joe has discussed. With that, turn it back to you, Joe. Thanks Joe. So it was a competitive process. It was quietly marketed with more or less a few select people that could take down a transaction of this size. In reference to your size -- your question about the location the new supply coming in, this developer really did a great job of putting a footprint of 50 properties in markets that were so far ahead of his time, out in areas that are having high barriers for new storage to come in. He built large properties in those marketplaces, kept a lot of competitors out at the same time. And really for us, we're starting to see the same type of issues with zoning, of getting new storage in a lot of these newer areas, in these high-growth areas, which are the better areas of the Dallas, Fort Worth market. So for us, it puts us in a great position to be in new markets we want to be in, and gives us a very strong presence in all those markets to do it that fills big gaps for us at the same time. Sure. This is Tom. As Joe mentioned, a lot of the activity in the third quarter into the fourth quarter is unsterilized activity. And so what -- if you think about average occupancies in the 50% I would have that in your mindset. And then from a yield standpoint, we obviously gave you a sense for all storage, what those yields are. Call it 2.6% on their operating platform in the third quarter, so that gives you a starting point. And I would say across the other properties, probably similar type yields even with a little bit lower occupancy. So I think that gives you a starting point. Clearly, we have confidence in our ability to lease these properties up. One of the things that Joe mentioned earlier around our confidence in our operating platform in Dallas, Fort Worth, similar to Washington, DC.  If you look at our ez transaction from earlier in the year. when we acquired that at 86% occupied, we got it to 94% through the busy season. And really strong growth in a market where we're out of inventory, so to give you a sense, a few of those properties we took over in the 40% occupancies and got them up to 90% by the end of the busy season, which is clearly strong leasing activity. In Dallas, similarly, we're out of inventory. We've successfully leased up our activity that we've built and bought over the last several years, and are poised to take over these All-Storage properties here over the next several months. Yes. Sure. It's made -- to just give you a sense as to where October ended, the year-over-year gap and occupancy, we were at 1.2% at the end of September. That has fallen a touch to around positive 75 basis point gap at this point. So we are seeing that modest moderation in occupancy as we move into the fourth quarter here, but continued strength on rate. And so we continue to see good Growth there. Some of the markets that we're seeing, the most strength, the Southeast Miami, Atlanta, the Sunbelt in aggregate, continuing to see a greater than 50% move in rate growth at this time of year compared to 2019. So, really strong pricing momentum here despite a modest declines in Year-over-year occupancy. Sure. Hey, Michael. Are you on mute? Yes, thanks, Joe. And as you mentioned, Todd, we do have strong access to capital with our balance sheet position the way it is. And we're confident in our ability to continue to fund acquisition activity with a broad set of tools. So we spoke about using unsecured debt. And we've used unsecured debt, really over the last several years to fund activity. That doesn't mean that we're not open to other alternatives, including common equity or JV equity as we discussed at our Investor Day, to the extent that volumes are both high-quality, attractive financial return, we would certainly be open, and welcome the opportunity to use a broad variety of tools in the toolkit over time. But for All Storage in particular, we plan to fund it with unsecured debt and we feel good about the leverage level where it is today. Yeah that's a good question. So really on a year-to-date basis, we've seen a pretty balanced contribution between the move-in, move-out dynamics on one side, and then the existing tenant rate increases, both contributing meaningfully. I would put them roughly on par with each other in terms of the contribution. I do think going forward, one of the things we disclosed is our move-out activity and the move-out rates. So, move-out rates are starting to catch up with move-in rates. They have not caught up yet, but they're starting to catch up. And that will start to be a headwind on the contribution from the move-in to move-outside. but we will still have existing tenant rent increases as a tailwind from here, given the market rent increases that we've seen across the country. Well, I would say that existing tenant rent increases is something that's managed very dynamically across the country, and really across the tenant base. And I think that the way to think about that is, one of the benefits of the current environment is higher market rents and that lowers the cost to replace that tenant if they elect to leave. That kind of base continues to be quite sticky, which gives us confidence to continue to send increases out to the tenant base. As we think about where we're going forward, in fact, one of the contributors to higher move-out rates is actually the fact that we're being successful in increasing rental rates on that existing tenant base. So I would say almost the reverse, which is as we're successful on existing tenant rate increases, I'd anticipate that that move-out rate will move higher. Move-out rate meaning the rent that the people are paying, that do a lot to leave us. Looking for 2022 guidance already, Ki Bin? Yeah. Well, I think there's a few things there. One is, we continue to see strength in market rents. And so I understand the question you're suggesting, but I think that we continue to see strong demand for self-storage across the country. But if you look at the markets with the strongest growth, really driven by macroeconomic demographic, and population shifts that we think are poised to continue here, which is helpful. So clearly, there has been a move in market rents higher and existing tenant rate increases have been moving the current tenant base higher alongside that.  Now, over the course of last year, and really the -- through a good portion of this year, and in some markets continuing today, we have had pricing regulations on us because of state of emergencies and the impact of the healthcare environment. And that's definitely been a headwind as it relates to the existing tenant base and moving them. in the same manner that market rents are going. So, I think another way to say that is there is some embedded rate growth that's available to the extent that we will continue to see normalization from a healthcare standpoint, and the state of emergencies continue to expire. The most notable of which is in Los Angeles County not related to pandemic, but related to fire several years ago that we continue to monitor. Yeah. So one of the things that we've -- that we look at is, what the impact of those pricing restrictions have been on us versus what our models would have otherwise suggested that we send the increases out at. And I ran these numbers for last quarter, so I'll give you precisely what it was for last quarter. I don't have it for this quarter, but through the first part of the year, first-half of the year, it was about a 300 basis point negative impact to same-store revenue growth in the first-half of the year. So anticipate that that's largely remained pretty consistent through the third quarter. But that gives you a sense of the magnitude. Sure. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. It's a good question. And it really is driven by the fact that there are sellers out there that are interested in accepting our shares as currency, and that's something we're open to. You're right, it's the first time we've done it in a number of years. But we're open to it, and it can be an attractive way to transact with the sellers that are interested there. Sure. I think the way we think about the return profile of our deals is typically on a non-levered basis. And so we're evaluating what the return profile is, either on a leverage neutral basis or unlevered basis. And so as we look at ultimately the financing of these transactions, we've had the opportunity to continue to use unsecured debt and preferred as the core piece of the capital structure, but as volumes grow, it will make good financial sense to continue to broaden the sources of capital, and the benefits of that growth will continue even with using maybe higher costs equity or JV equity, potentially. Spencer, I would say that that's a pretty dynamic and local decision that we manage. And I wouldn't necessarily say it's an occupancy-based item. It relates to what we're seeing in the customer funnels. So advertising has a benefit to increase top of funnel, the number of people that are say, searching for Public Storage or are finding Public Storage when they go to search for self-storage. And so, that is helpful in markets where we're seeing top of funnel demand erode. But we have other tools as we're managing revenue. Be it, pricing, promotion etc. that will impact conversion, within that funnel.  And so I would say we're watching the different components of the funnel and what the returns are associated with pulling those different levers. To-date, we continue to see strong top of funnel demand across the board. Web visits, for instance, in the quarter were up North of 20% across the system, calls into our call center were roughly flat. So overall, still very solid, top of funnel demand, which led to the decision-making around marketing in the quarter. As we've demonstrated in the past, if we start to see those dynamics change, we typically do see pretty good returns on our advertising spend and we'll pull that lever as well. Thanks. Yeah. One of the things that we looked at within the portfolio is obviously there's a pool of properties that have recently been delivered that we have the opportunity to lease up, and then ultimately stabilize on a rate basis until we go through our underwriting process of seeing what our stores in the area and what competition is, and ultimately what we think we can squeeze from a revenue standpoint within our own revenue management platform, and we'll underwrite those there. And then on the stabilized stores, we call them stabilized, but the reality is, they're not in our platform. And like we're seeing in acquisitions to date, really, through last year we have an opportunity to put our operating platform and systems in place and drive further improvements.  So you can see for instance, where our overall Dallas portfolio rental rates are. And obviously, these properties have their own submarkets and underwritten rates. But it gives you a sense as to the upside in rental rates that we think we can achieve in the portfolio over time. Yes, it's a combination of where we think rates are today, so spot rates. And then, ultimately, that the runway we see for rental rate activity counterbalanced with one of the questions earlier around rental rate risk due to new development within that market in those submarkets, which is a consideration as we think about forward rents, as well. So, a combination of a number of those things. But I would point you to the presentation where you can see our same-store rents in Dallas punching at $15 per foot versus the in-place rents there in the third quarter at about $11. So there's definitely occupancy and rental rate upside. Thanks. Yes. So last year was certainly a unique year, where we saw different seasonal patterns because of the nature of the healthcare environment last year. And we didn't see much if any of an occupancy decline as we moved through the year. This year, we did see a more seasonal pattern and frankly had the benefit of some of the seasonal demand driver's, things like home sales and DIY projects over the summer, for instance, college students, etc., that will add to demand in the Summer, but then we'll then move out as we move into the Fall. So there was that additive demand this year, but we are seeing a little bit more moderation. One of the reasons why we're seeing that moderation is the continued stickiness of the tenant base.  And so we've had fewer move-ins this year. And so recent move-ins are the most likely to move out. And so we've had a contribution of that benefit and a little bit more seasonality this year. I do think that the seasonal demand drivers that have been driving self-storage demand for years will continue to play out over the next several years, and so we operate a seasonal business and it will be going forward. The degree of it, we'll need to see year-in and year-out, but we are seeing a little bit more this year, but still really encouraging overall customer behavior."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle.  Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, August 4, 2021, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement these statements they become untrue because of subsequent of this. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to 2 questions. Of course, after two, if you have further questions, please feel free to jump back in the queue. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Russell: Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Tom and I will walk you through some highlights from Q2, as well as our perspective on the second half of the year. And then we will open up the call for questions. I'd like to start by stating the obvious business is excellent. Moving rates are up 27% from where they were in 2019 and there is little evidence that pricing strength is abating. A meaningful wave of new first time customers are using storage based on a combination of traditional and non-traditional reasons. In 2021, we have welcomed nearly 700,000 new customers to our platform many having never used Self Storage before. Demand has been strong for several quarters, with upward pressure tied to vibrant home sales, up 34% year-over-year. In addition, a hybrid work home environment is being planned by 68% of companies according to a recent Deloitte survey. This certainly gives us confidence that overall adoption of Self Storage will continue to grow, and is looked upon favorably by consumers and businesses as a cost efficient alternative to storing goods in residential or commercial space. I'd like to step back for a moment and reflect on our May 3 investor day. The Public Storage leadership team took you behind the orange door and outlined several strategic initiatives. I am pleased to say many of these strategies are taking hold in 2021 and I'd like to highlight three areas that were particularly evident in our Q2 results. First, organic growth powered by innovation. Our multi-year and continued investment in technology has allowed us to give customers what they want and efficient and more consistent leasing experience with the support of a knowledgeable and helpful property manager when needed. Our industry leading online e-rental platform opened up an entirely new channel for customers to rent a Self Storage unit and adoption has been impressive. Nearly 50% of our customers now select this option. It's fast, intuitive, and simple. What's even better, the quality of the customers using this option has been excellent and our employees have embraced it as well. We are already seeing the impact this new channel will have on labor utilization, while improving customer satisfaction. This has clearly been a win-win for customers and our operations team. In 2021, we also launched the PS Storage app giving customers a new tool to access their property via smartphone along with the ability to manage their account, including automatic payment of rent. Second, our four factor growth platform; Public Storage is uniquely positioned to drive growth through acquisitions, development, redevelopment, and third party management. All areas took steps forward in Q2. Acquisition volume is robust. Year-to-date, we have closed or are under contract on nearly $3 billion of assets. The $1.8 billion easy storage portfolio closed 90 days ago, and the integration and performance of those assets has exceeded expectations. Our development and redevelopment pipeline continues to grow by $150 million this quarter as we are seeing good opportunities to expand the largest development program in the industry. And third party management is growing with assets under management to 131 properties along with a deepening pipeline of assets under review. Our goal is to reach 500 assets by 2025. Overall, our non-same-store assets at a $0.20 of FFO this quarter, with NOI of 138% driven by improving yields on both development, redevelopment and acquisitions. This 34 million square foot base of assets is now 86% occupied compared to the same-store portfolio had 96.5% with strong momentum to drive additional shareholder value. And third, the utilization of our exceptional balance sheet. This quarter we funded 2.3 billion in transactions through bond issuances driving down are blended cost of leverage to 3.1%. Public Storage has the longest duration balance sheet in the _ industry, with one of the lowest cost profiles with room to fund significant additional growth. Overall, we remain optimistic about the core drivers in our business along with the commanding capabilities tied to the Public Storage brand. Our industry leading ownership position and core national markets, all led by a talented and committed team of professionals in every part of our business. Now, I will hand the call over to Tom. \nThomas Boyle: Thanks, Joe. Our financial performance accelerated into the second quarter driven by both strong demand from customers and execution from the team. Our same store revenue increased 10.8% compared to the second quarter of 2020. That performance represented the sequential improvement and growth of 7.4% from the first quarter driven by rate. Two factors led to the acceleration in realize rate per foot. First, about half came from strong demand and limited inventory which allowed us to achieve moving rates that were up 48% versus 2020. And as Joe mentioned 27% versus pre-pandemic 2019. Secondly, existing tenant rate increases also made up about half of the improvement, comparing against the period when we did not send increases at the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Now onto expenses. The team did a great job executing in this environment. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property payroll, we discussed at our investor day, the operating model transformation underway. About half of the year-over-year decline in payroll expense was attributable to those initiatives that use technology and roll specialization to drive improvements in customer experience, employee experience, and our expense levels. And the other half of the payroll decline is comparing against the onset of the pandemic last year when we put in place a program that we call the PS Cares program to provide additional support to our operations team including a $3 per hour incentive for property managers. On property tax, we will expense our annual estimate ratably through the year, leading to an approximately $0.05 benefit in each of the first three quarters of the year and reversing to a $0.15 headwind in the fourth quarter. This will lead to a more stable quarter-over-quarter expense profile in the future. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool stabilized properties was up 21.7% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, as Joe mentioned, the lease up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities was also a standout in the quarter adding 35 million in NOI or $0.20 of FFO. As we sit here today at the peak of the leasing season, customer demand remains robust and business is good. So let's shift to the outlook. We raised our core FFO guidance by $0.55 at the midpoint or 4.8%. Looking at the drivers, we increased our outlook for same store revenue to grow from 7% to 8.5% in 2021. That outlook implies a faster rate of growth in the second half compared to our 7.1% growth in the first half. Our current expectations are for occupancy to moderate from here by about 300 basis points from peak now to trough at the end of the year. This would generally reflect a return to typical seasonality of the business, albeit at higher occupancies than historically achieved. But big picture, the baton has clearly been passed to rate growth in the second quarter which will be the driver of performance in the second half. We also expect continued strong expense control throughout 2021. Our expectations are for 0% to 1% same-store expense growth. And we also increased our guidance for non-same-store performance given the acceleration of acquisitions in the strong lease up of our own stabilized facilities. The balance sheet, as Joe mentioned, is poised for incremental activity in the second half of this year. To wrap up, business is good in the strategies we discussed at our investor day in May are evident in this quarter. With that I'll turn it over for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America. \nJeffrey Spector: Great, good afternoon. My first question, I guess I'm trying to tie a couple of the comments you made. I think, Joe I know that you've been positive of course in the sector, but your opening remarks about the vibrant hope sales, hybrid work environment steadiness and overall adoption of the business to continue verse the guidance of occupancy dropping through in your bits and in the slower months ahead. How do we tie those two comments together?\nJoseph Russell: Yes Jeff. The business itself is, as we noted quite strong. We're seeing additive momentum from different drivers and traditional drivers as I mentioned. The thing that's questionable, but could play through is a reversion to some degree of what we would say normal seasonality and some of the metrics that we've seen historically which have gone into our guidance for the second half of the year. Now clearly if the momentum that we've seen for the last several quarters continues to be as strong as it has that could soften or not be as typical as what we see from a seasonality standpoint. But that's to be determined. We were very pleased by the continued level of demand that we're seeing from customers and our pricing abilities based on that demand clearly across all markets. To some degree, we're seeing a little bit of shifting in markets that may not have quite as pronounced in migration or overall movement but still on a relative basis very healthy demand.\nJeffrey Spector: Thank you. And then my follow up question is again, on the opening remarks. Joe, you commented on adaption of business customers. And I guess, can you talk about that a little bit more? Are you starting any new initiatives to grab that customer? I'm sorry, I'm not as aware of that initiative at PSA. Is something changing here to try to do more with that business customer.\nJoseph Russell: So Jeff, we've always had a blended focus on both consumers and business customers. Property to property we will see a varying degree of demand that comes from either cohort. Our business customers, too, are very active as you can imagine, with the economy starting to percolate in many different ways. Many businesses are coming back to properties that may have not used the space one or two years ago with different economic drivers. But with the resurgence and the opening up of many economies, we're just seeing, again, an elevated level of both consumer and business activity. Our spaces cater to both. We have good activity and we continue to cater to each type of customer whether again, it's a consumer or a business.\nJeffrey Spector: Okay, sorry, if I could just clarify. So I knew that I'm sorry, I should have been more clear like you are not, you don't have initiatives, like one of your peers has micro fulfillment initiatives. You're not. Are you moving in that direction?\nJoseph Russell: Well, I'm not speaking to that I'm speaking more to the holistic activity levels we're seeing from both types of customers. Both types of customer demand has been strong, and we continue to see good activity. And as I mentioned, in some cases, depending on the location of a property, you might have a higher degree of business oriented customers compared to another, but very good activity from both types of customer base. \nJeffrey Spector: Okay, thank you. Congrats on the quarter. \nJoseph Russell: Great. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the rate commentary about half of the increase you said came from rate increases to existing customers. I'm sorry, same store revenue, sorry. And that was helped out by the easy comps with no real bumps being passed through the customers last year due to COVID. So how should we think about that, I guess in the second half of the year? At what point where I guess, rate bumps reinstituted last year, if you could remind us and does that mean that rate growth then decelerates? Is that easy comp goes away or not necessarily, because you're still having strong kind of equals to new customers you sit here nearly 30% of 2019 levels. So if you could just help us think about those two components relative to your experience this year, and how that plays out in the second half?\nJoseph Russell: Yes that's a good question Juan. So last year, we did send those increases that we didn't send in the second quarter. We sent them in the third quarter. But I wouldn't highlight that as a headwind in the second half of this year. And the primary reason is, it is driven by the fact that the match magnitude of the increases that we can send this year are more elevated versus previous year. And that goes back to really two factors, one moving rents being up as significantly as they are, which gives us pricing power with existing tenants as well. And then secondly, last year, we were under pricing regulations in many, many of our markets. With this year, the majority of those having been expired. So those are both tailwinds to existing tenant rate magnitude as we move to the second half. So we don't anticipate a big give back on existing tenants in the third quarter.\nJuan Sanabria: And just on the occupancy piece of the same store revenue guide, the 300 bips that you're assuming comes off of I'm assuming the 630 number in sequential deceleration. Could you just give us a sense of how that compares to the historical trend? Is that more or less than your experiences in the past?\nThomas Boyle: Yes. Juan it's right in the ballpark of the historical and generally speaking, actually, the middle of July is our peak occupancy. We actually had occupancy of north of 97%, in the middle of July. So there's a little bit of incremental peeks there to be had from June 30 numbers, but overall, generally in line. The real story in the second half is you highlighted this rate, though, and I think we can talk about occupancy a little bit here or there. But the driver will be how can we keep the pricing strength in play through the second half, both for new customers and existing customers, and that will drive performance more meaningfully through the second half?\nJuan Sanabria: Just to clarify, you said typically, your occupancy peaks mid July, but that hasn't necessarily come off this year. That's pretty sticky, at least to date to early August. \nJoseph Russell: No it has started to come off a little bit.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. \nJoseph Russell: Very modestly. I mean, we're still at the peak of the season here. \nJuan Sanabria: Got you. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Your next question is from a line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. I guess first on just kind of the acquisition pipeline, you guys have obviously been extremely busy this year. I'm just curious what the kind of the forward pipeline looks like. And how are kind of pricing expectations changing for sellers today just given the amount of capital kind of chasing deals? \nJoseph Russell: Sure, Steve. No question. As I noted, yes, we've been busy. We expect to continue to be busy. There is a fair amount of product that's in the market. If you step back and think about how much new products been delivered to the sector over the last four or five years with peak deliveries hitting in 2019 plus or minus 500 new assets being delivered to the market in 2019. And then tapering down a bit 10% to 15% in 2020. And again, another similar tapering down this year. But again, you take that whole pool of assets, year-by-year that was has been ranging over the last, say, five or six years, from 300 to 500 properties per year. There is a fair amount of very attractive, good quality assets that we've been very pleased to go out and capture at what we feel are good values, many of which has been asset quality that we build to as well. So from a value standpoint, and a capital allocation standpoint, we've been very pleased with the pool of candidates that we've been able to acquire. Much of this has also been predicated on some of the unique tools that we have some of which we talked about in our investor day relative to the amount of data that we have market to market that guides us to the targeted parts of markets or new markets that we're entering that may be underserved from a storage standpoint. So that too is a different way in which that we're underwriting and choosing to acquire assets. Valuations are competitive. There is no doubt about it. As to your point, we were seeing a fair amount of capital is still anxious to get into Self Storage. One of the ways that we've been able to maneuver around that is buying assets that are not as stabilized. More stabilized assets can typically attract far greater levels of competition, tighter yields. If on average, you look at the pool of assets that we bought this year outside of easy storage average occupancies plus or minus 50% to 60%. And those have been great assets for us to put right into our platform, lease them up, see good revenue growth and very good returns by virtue of that. So going forward, there is continued activity and many sellers are looking at this environments a good time to bring product to market whether it's on a one off basis, or there is a few larger portfolios likely to hit in the second half of 2021. Our capital is well primed. As I mentioned, we've been able to optimize the cost and efficiency of our own leverage. And we see very good opportunities to continue to allocate capital and we're continuing to underwrite a fair amount of assets.\nSteve Sakwa: You sort of touched on capital structure, which kind of leads to my second question. You guys have clearly been willing to deploy leverage and take up and use the balance sheet capacity as pricing is rising and deals are offering lower yields. I mean, how are you sort of balancing the use of the balance sheet today against lower returns and maybe that means more development? But how are you sort of weighing the point of capital and using the balance sheet with rising pricing?\nThomas Boyle: Yes. well, maybe comment on a few of your questions embedded there. One, we do view development as continued good allocation of capital. Joe mentioned that the pipeline increased by about 150 million this quarter and we obviously outline in the investor day in May, plans to increase it a good bit further from there. In addition to that, though, we are finding good deals that will meet not just a marginal debt cost of capital, but ultimately our overall cost of capital and provide good returns based on our ability to take properties as Joe mentioned, lease them up and earn a good return to stabilization and then rent growth from there. So overall we're still finding good high quality deals that will exceed our cost of capital across the board and we have the balance sheet flexibility to use attractively priced unsecured debt to fund that.\nSteve Sakwa: Great, thanks. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. \nMichael Goldsmith: Hey guys thanks a lot for taking my question. Occupancies elevated that 97% average for the quarter. Obviously, the math suggests that some are above the average some are below. So can you help frame how much your same store pool is, like 98% - 99% occupied or completely below? How are you operating the stores differently than those where there's more upside? And then as we think forward should we expect them all to experience seasonality the same or do you anticipate some differences between them? Thanks.\nJoseph Russell: Sure. So maybe looking at market by market performance, there's clear differentiation in the market dynamics across the country. We do have many markets, if you look in the supplemental, that highlight 96% to 98% occupancies, that are really strong versus historical. And that's really being driven by the ability of us to attract new customers, but also the fact that our existing tenants are performing quite well. And that's something we spent a lot of time talking about last year that has persisted into 2021. So it's allowed occupancies to creep higher. But at this point, with 97% occupancy or even falling modestly from there, it's about driving rate. And as I mentioned, that was really the story in the second quarter and through the second half, versus trying to drive incremental occupancy here. We're trying to balance that occupancy versus inventory but clearly looking to drive rate. In terms of strength within the markets there are some standouts. If you look at what's going on, for instance, in the state of Florida, we have particular strengths there. Population growth housing activity, as Joe discussed, we're seeing really strong activity there. And really across the economy there. We view that as encouraging as we think about those strong procyclical demand drivers driving our business, which is a counter to last year when we did see some more counter cyclical drivers that were driving the business at this point in time. So we're encouraged by that and we will see some variation there by market. In terms of your question on occupancy which markets will fall which, which will stay there's definitely trends in different markets that will influence that, for instance, our colder markets tend to see a bigger seasonal swing and occupancy than our warmer markets. But it'll vary.\nThomas Boyle: Yes, and Michael, just to add our west coast markets from Seattle, all the way down to San Diego are dealing with extremely high occupancy levels. The amount of new supply coming in those markets for the most part is limited. But on the other side of the barbell which is really tight right now, Houston, which has been a poster child for lower occupancy, high supply, I mean, Houston is at 95%. That speaks to what Tom just talked about which is another added driver that we're seeing in different parts of the country primarily Texas and the southeast is amplified levels of activity because of migration and we're even looking for signals can some of that taper down, and it's not at all and even as many of those markets actually returned to some level of normal, again, activity from opening up businesses, etc, we really see no degradation in demand and/or occupancy levels. So we continue to fill up even higher supply markets has been quite pronounced and we're pleased to see that and we're continuing to look for any signals if there's any reversion. But as we speak, that band a very tight occupancy market to market is quite strong.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's helpful. And can you talk about the performance of the easy storage portfolio, since you acquired it? they at an 86% occupancy rate, and are you or can you share where it is now maybe talk about how some of the lease up properties within it are performing? And then if you can break out kind of how much of any growth is reflective of the market versus what you've been able to do with it, and what sort of initiative you've got been able to put in to generate additional growth? Thanks.\nJoseph Russell: Sure. I mentioned we're 90 days into the ownership of that portfolio. So we had about 115 properties in the metro D.C. area and with the easy portfolio now we're north of 160. So very good activity from elevated occupancy growth. The portfolio today is at about 94% occupied. If you remember, one of the things that we had talked about is, the prior owner was very good operator, but also didn't have some of the sophisticated tools that we've been able to apply into that portfolio in relation to existing cuts, customer tactics or strategies. We're starting to deploy those, seeing a very good level of transition and integration, we inherited about 43,000 customers. We're seeing good continued tenancy, good integration with our own existing portfolio and we've just begun the expansion process about 10% expansions possible by again magnifying in some cases the size of properties in certain markets that had already been pre-entitled. So that too is taking place. the properties for the most part, gone through the first wave of rebranding. They look great in orange and we've also seen a very good integration from hiring a number of very strong property managers and district managers that have come into our portfolio as well. So overall, very pleased with what we've seen. And we, as I mentioned, have a very strong presence in that market far beyond any other operator and the quality of these assets is very additive to what we've continued to do and see from a benefit standpoint in the Washington metro market.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you a little more about the third party management platform and the path to get to 500 by I think year end 24 you said. Is that mostly driven by new properties that are on deck to come online? Or are you also adding just converting independent properties? Or maybe from other brands in the space? \nJoseph Russell: Yes. Smedes the goal it's 2025. So we're definitely on the path to continue driving the size of that program. To your point, it is a process where there is a high level of activity tied to new development. I mentioned that our backlog continues to grow and we've seen a number of one off developers and some with multiple properties come to our platform that are in various stages of development. It's a different lens, clearly that points to the fact that the development, part of our industries, still active. And we're seeing the opportunity to grow the platform through that. Now having said that we are also finding some good opportunities to bring existing assets into the program as well. Many of the owners have started off with say one or two assets and are now starting to give us multiple assets. So that's I think indicative of the performance that we continue to show to the owners that have come into the platform and the benefit they're seeing by being within the public storage brand. The other thing I pointed out is we've now actually acquired 10 assets that have come into the program as well. So it's another avenue or channel for us to get closer to many owners who actually are coming back to us and saying would we have interest in actually acquiring these assets. So there's multiple drivers that we're going to continue to focus on as we build the program. We've got a team that's focused nationally. The assets that we've added, and having our backlog are literally widespread across the 39 states that we operate in. So we're pleased by that as well, and look forward to continue to grow the program.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask you last, on your last call, you talked a little bit about the supply outlook with I think 2021, you're looking for kind of a 10% to 15% leg down in the pace of deliveries relative to 20. It just, I, just over the past few months, have you seen any change in that or kind of any updated sort of thoughts on what the supply picture might look like going forward? \nJoseph Russell: Yes. I mean the added color give you and you are right, that's the view that we've had, looking at the amount of volume that is likely to come into 2021. One thing that we're seeing is low approval processes at multiple cities. And that coupled with the fact that component costs are elevated, whether it's steel, labor, concrete, etc. So that's, I think stalling some of the development starts that might have been predicted either for 2021 and going into 2022. So we're keeping a close eye on it. We're clearly very deep into the development cycle in our own portfolio and understand and see the various headwinds that are playing through right now. Fortunately, we've got different ways to combat some of the cost pressures that are coming through that one off developer might not have the advantage to do so whether it's bulk buying or knowing and understanding how to pre-bid certain assets or components of assets. But with that we're likely to see, again, that laid down you talk to you and 2021. 2022, I would be surprised if it accelerates. It could take either a moderate step down or could be flatline based on the amount of activity that we're seeing in 2021 and then what's more unclear is what could happen in 2023 and beyond. So we'll see.\nSmedes Rose:  Okay. fine. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning. So you already touched on some of this. But when you look at the market by market performance, obviously you're proposing well, but some markets it seems to revenues up a lot more than LA, San Francisco or New York. Is it really just some markets are positive net migration market and that's driving the relative performance? Or are there other elements that you're noticing in between these markets?\nJoseph Russell: I'd say overall Ki Bin no question we're seeing broad based strength. I mean, you look at all of our markets in the second quarter really strong growth and acceleration from the first quarter. I think what you're highlighting is there is some variation, which is something we see with a strong nationally diversified portfolio. What I highlighted earlier was a shift that I think I'll reiterate because we view it as pretty meaningfully internally where last year at this time, some of our absolute strongest markets we are experiencing some what I would consider a pandemic related dislocation and you can put the New York's or San Francisco's into that bucket and so they weren't our strongest markets. And you fast forward a year and our strongest markets now, as Joe and I mentioned earlier on the call Florida, Texas, Sunbelt markets, as well as some others, Chicago I would put in there as well. But there is some clear relationship between some of the macro drivers in Florida and Texas and Sunbelt markets for instance, that are driving demand. Housing clearly being one of them population inflows. And we're seeing real strength to highlight one market as an example, Miami which is our fifth largest market. We have about 90 stores, there in the same-store pool. Moving rents up 43% versus 2019. So a big market being fueled by macro drivers and real strength. In terms of what we're seeing in some of the bigger coastal markets we're seeing good demand there and still really strong occupancies and the ability to push rate. Year-over-year comps, frankly, are tougher in those markets right now as we sit compared to say, Miami, for instance. But if you look at performance versus 2019, still quite good. And we were encouraged by the demand trends there. I mean, what we're seeing in Los Angeles is really strong. North of 98% occupancy here in Los Angeles and strong demand drivers across the board. So generally pretty encouraged. But there are some factors that are causing some differentiation and I would add that we're going to continue to see new supply come into some of these markets and impact performance from here just like we have over the last five years.\nKi Bin Kim: Got it. And the second question, it's been a little bit over a year now since COVID. Are you noticing any difference in the lifetime value of a customer that customers that have moved in over the past year or length of stay versus what a typical customer profile would look like pre-COVID.\nJoseph Russell: We spent a good bit of time talking about this through last year. We did see a shift towards longer length of stay and really strong existing tenant performance through the year last year. That's persisted. So tenants that were in house or moved in last year have continued perform really-really well and ahead of pre-pandemic expectations. Customers that have moved in this year have behaved more like our typical storage customers from 2019 for instance. Still performing really well. But not at that market improvement that we saw last year. The one thing I'd highlight from a lifetime value is clearly the rate portion of the equation. So if we're seeing good length of stays, and significantly higher rates that clearly leads to higher lifetime values.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, a couple quick questions. Congrats on the quarter. The first is just talk about potential restrictions in the portfolio on rent increases. Is there a way to sort of quantify that the magnitude of that is at 5% or the 10%? just big ballpark numbers. And was curious as well what if there's still any sort of restrictions or on the late charges and administrative fees? Is there still some, are you guys back to normal? Or is it still sort of hampered? Thanks.\nJoseph Russell: Sure. So the first question around rent regulations. For the most part those have expired and there was a big push through the first half of this year in many local governments to move past those state of emergency and pricing restrictions. And so for the most part they're no longer in place. the one I would highlight that is meaningful for us is the pricing restrictions from the state of emergency tied to wildfires here in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is our number one market with about 15% of our revenue and we continue to be a constraint here on rental activity. So that's when I highlight. The others have largely expired. There are a few here and there. That fact is a tailwind as we move to the second half where last year we were restricted on rent in many-many markets across the country. But it will take time to move existing tenants back up to where they would have otherwise been. And then your second question was on late fees. We did see some local jurisdictions put those in place. Some of the restrictions as it relates to our delinquent tenant processes remain in place but similar to rent regulations. Those are expiring and governments are looking to get back to regular business. Nothing material, I'd highlight there from a financial impact in the quarter. And I would I Ki Bin we've talked about this throughout last year fees, Ron, sorry, the fees were a big drag last year and we saw it now for the first time we've lapped that fee drag and don't anticipate that to continue to be a negative driver as we move through the second half. So that was a big shift in the second quarter.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. Helpful. And the second question was just going to be just the taking in all the expenses a little bit. Obviously, the marketing makes a lot of sense, but can you just provide a little bit more color on you know whether it's the on-site property manager payroll, sort of the 34% decline there? What's driving that? Is that e-rentals? Is it less man hours? Just a little bit more color on that big drop?\nJoseph Russell: Sure Ron. It's a number of things that you just spoke to it points to the variety of things that we're doing from the infusion and the digitization of the business. We have a lot of analytics that help us look to the optimized level of labor. e-rental as I mentioned is having a pronounced effect if you kind of step back and think about the traditional operating model for the entire self storage industry. Historically it's always been centered on an interaction necessary at the counter with a property manager and in our case if 50% or so of our customers are choosing to do this electronically and self-directed that typical 30 to 45 minute transaction process that would happen at a counter is no longer necessary for again about half the customers that are at their own election choosing that option. So it's giving us the opportunity to retool and re-prioritize levels of labor utilization while also not preserving but actually enhancing customer satisfaction. So as I mentioned we think that that's working well both from a customer's perspective and from an operations perspective. We continue to look at a variety of different tools through the amount of data that we collect at properties relative to activity levels whether it's time of the week, time of the month and again using those again analytics to put people in the right places at the right times. So good things to come from that and we're continuing to see different levels of optimization as this again plays out from a customer standpoint in a much more optimized way.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. Helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. \nMike Mueller: Yes. Hi. I'm curious what do you see as the longer term margin on the third party management business and it what sort of property count do you have to scale up to hit that?\nJoseph Russell: Sure. So that margin will vary based on geographic concentration and the like but there is certainly a path for us to get that margin up to 25% - 30%. I think at this point one of the drags to that margin as we look at our own performance is the fact that many of the properties that we've taken to manage are in lease up and that's going to continue as we look to grow this business. So I would anticipate that our margins are a good bit below that for the next several years as we look to increase the size and scope and in particular with properties and lease up.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. that was it. Thank you. \nOperator: At this time there are no further questions. I will now hand the call over to Mr. Burke for any closing remarks. \nRyan Burke: Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to interacting through the third quarter and enjoy the rest of your summers.",

            "name": "Joseph Russell",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Tom and I will walk you through some highlights from Q2, as well as our perspective on the second half of the year. And then we will open up the call for questions. I'd like to start by stating the obvious business is excellent. Moving rates are up 27% from where they were in 2019 and there is little evidence that pricing strength is abating. A meaningful wave of new first time customers are using storage based on a combination of traditional and non-traditional reasons. In 2021, we have welcomed nearly 700,000 new customers to our platform many having never used Self Storage before. Demand has been strong for several quarters, with upward pressure tied to vibrant home sales, up 34% year-over-year. In addition, a hybrid work home environment is being planned by 68% of companies according to a recent Deloitte survey. This certainly gives us confidence that overall adoption of Self Storage will continue to grow, and is looked upon favorably by consumers and businesses as a cost efficient alternative to storing goods in residential or commercial space. I'd like to step back for a moment and reflect on our May 3 investor day. The Public Storage leadership team took you behind the orange door and outlined several strategic initiatives. I am pleased to say many of these strategies are taking hold in 2021 and I'd like to highlight three areas that were particularly evident in our Q2 results. First, organic growth powered by innovation. Our multi-year and continued investment in technology has allowed us to give customers what they want and efficient and more consistent leasing experience with the support of a knowledgeable and helpful property manager when needed. Our industry leading online e-rental platform opened up an entirely new channel for customers to rent a Self Storage unit and adoption has been impressive. Nearly 50% of our customers now select this option. It's fast, intuitive, and simple. What's even better, the quality of the customers using this option has been excellent and our employees have embraced it as well. We are already seeing the impact this new channel will have on labor utilization, while improving customer satisfaction. This has clearly been a win-win for customers and our operations team. In 2021, we also launched the PS Storage app giving customers a new tool to access their property via smartphone along with the ability to manage their account, including automatic payment of rent. Second, our four factor growth platform; Public Storage is uniquely positioned to drive growth through acquisitions, development, redevelopment, and third party management. All areas took steps forward in Q2. Acquisition volume is robust. Year-to-date, we have closed or are under contract on nearly $3 billion of assets. The $1.8 billion easy storage portfolio closed 90 days ago, and the integration and performance of those assets has exceeded expectations. Our development and redevelopment pipeline continues to grow by $150 million this quarter as we are seeing good opportunities to expand the largest development program in the industry. And third party management is growing with assets under management to 131 properties along with a deepening pipeline of assets under review. Our goal is to reach 500 assets by 2025. Overall, our non-same-store assets at a $0.20 of FFO this quarter, with NOI of 138% driven by improving yields on both development, redevelopment and acquisitions. This 34 million square foot base of assets is now 86% occupied compared to the same-store portfolio had 96.5% with strong momentum to drive additional shareholder value. And third, the utilization of our exceptional balance sheet. This quarter we funded 2.3 billion in transactions through bond issuances driving down are blended cost of leverage to 3.1%. Public Storage has the longest duration balance sheet in the _ industry, with one of the lowest cost profiles with room to fund significant additional growth. Overall, we remain optimistic about the core drivers in our business along with the commanding capabilities tied to the Public Storage brand. Our industry leading ownership position and core national markets, all led by a talented and committed team of professionals in every part of our business. Now, I will hand the call over to Tom. Yes Jeff. The business itself is, as we noted quite strong. We're seeing additive momentum from different drivers and traditional drivers as I mentioned. The thing that's questionable, but could play through is a reversion to some degree of what we would say normal seasonality and some of the metrics that we've seen historically which have gone into our guidance for the second half of the year. Now clearly if the momentum that we've seen for the last several quarters continues to be as strong as it has that could soften or not be as typical as what we see from a seasonality standpoint. But that's to be determined. We were very pleased by the continued level of demand that we're seeing from customers and our pricing abilities based on that demand clearly across all markets. To some degree, we're seeing a little bit of shifting in markets that may not have quite as pronounced in migration or overall movement but still on a relative basis very healthy demand. So Jeff, we've always had a blended focus on both consumers and business customers. Property to property we will see a varying degree of demand that comes from either cohort. Our business customers, too, are very active as you can imagine, with the economy starting to percolate in many different ways. Many businesses are coming back to properties that may have not used the space one or two years ago with different economic drivers. But with the resurgence and the opening up of many economies, we're just seeing, again, an elevated level of both consumer and business activity. Our spaces cater to both. We have good activity and we continue to cater to each type of customer whether again, it's a consumer or a business. Well, I'm not speaking to that I'm speaking more to the holistic activity levels we're seeing from both types of customers. Both types of customer demand has been strong, and we continue to see good activity. And as I mentioned, in some cases, depending on the location of a property, you might have a higher degree of business oriented customers compared to another, but very good activity from both types of customer base. Great. Thanks, Jeff. Yes that's a good question Juan. So last year, we did send those increases that we didn't send in the second quarter. We sent them in the third quarter. But I wouldn't highlight that as a headwind in the second half of this year. And the primary reason is, it is driven by the fact that the match magnitude of the increases that we can send this year are more elevated versus previous year. And that goes back to really two factors, one moving rents being up as significantly as they are, which gives us pricing power with existing tenants as well. And then secondly, last year, we were under pricing regulations in many, many of our markets. With this year, the majority of those having been expired. So those are both tailwinds to existing tenant rate magnitude as we move to the second half. So we don't anticipate a big give back on existing tenants in the third quarter. No it has started to come off a little bit. Very modestly. I mean, we're still at the peak of the season here. Sure, Steve. No question. As I noted, yes, we've been busy. We expect to continue to be busy. There is a fair amount of product that's in the market. If you step back and think about how much new products been delivered to the sector over the last four or five years with peak deliveries hitting in 2019 plus or minus 500 new assets being delivered to the market in 2019. And then tapering down a bit 10% to 15% in 2020. And again, another similar tapering down this year. But again, you take that whole pool of assets, year-by-year that was has been ranging over the last, say, five or six years, from 300 to 500 properties per year. There is a fair amount of very attractive, good quality assets that we've been very pleased to go out and capture at what we feel are good values, many of which has been asset quality that we build to as well. So from a value standpoint, and a capital allocation standpoint, we've been very pleased with the pool of candidates that we've been able to acquire. Much of this has also been predicated on some of the unique tools that we have some of which we talked about in our investor day relative to the amount of data that we have market to market that guides us to the targeted parts of markets or new markets that we're entering that may be underserved from a storage standpoint. So that too is a different way in which that we're underwriting and choosing to acquire assets. Valuations are competitive. There is no doubt about it. As to your point, we were seeing a fair amount of capital is still anxious to get into Self Storage. One of the ways that we've been able to maneuver around that is buying assets that are not as stabilized. More stabilized assets can typically attract far greater levels of competition, tighter yields. If on average, you look at the pool of assets that we bought this year outside of easy storage average occupancies plus or minus 50% to 60%. And those have been great assets for us to put right into our platform, lease them up, see good revenue growth and very good returns by virtue of that. So going forward, there is continued activity and many sellers are looking at this environments a good time to bring product to market whether it's on a one off basis, or there is a few larger portfolios likely to hit in the second half of 2021. Our capital is well primed. As I mentioned, we've been able to optimize the cost and efficiency of our own leverage. And we see very good opportunities to continue to allocate capital and we're continuing to underwrite a fair amount of assets. Sure. So maybe looking at market by market performance, there's clear differentiation in the market dynamics across the country. We do have many markets, if you look in the supplemental, that highlight 96% to 98% occupancies, that are really strong versus historical. And that's really being driven by the ability of us to attract new customers, but also the fact that our existing tenants are performing quite well. And that's something we spent a lot of time talking about last year that has persisted into 2021. So it's allowed occupancies to creep higher. But at this point, with 97% occupancy or even falling modestly from there, it's about driving rate. And as I mentioned, that was really the story in the second quarter and through the second half, versus trying to drive incremental occupancy here. We're trying to balance that occupancy versus inventory but clearly looking to drive rate. In terms of strength within the markets there are some standouts. If you look at what's going on, for instance, in the state of Florida, we have particular strengths there. Population growth housing activity, as Joe discussed, we're seeing really strong activity there. And really across the economy there. We view that as encouraging as we think about those strong procyclical demand drivers driving our business, which is a counter to last year when we did see some more counter cyclical drivers that were driving the business at this point in time. So we're encouraged by that and we will see some variation there by market. In terms of your question on occupancy which markets will fall which, which will stay there's definitely trends in different markets that will influence that, for instance, our colder markets tend to see a bigger seasonal swing and occupancy than our warmer markets. But it'll vary. Sure. I mentioned we're 90 days into the ownership of that portfolio. So we had about 115 properties in the metro D.C. area and with the easy portfolio now we're north of 160. So very good activity from elevated occupancy growth. The portfolio today is at about 94% occupied. If you remember, one of the things that we had talked about is, the prior owner was very good operator, but also didn't have some of the sophisticated tools that we've been able to apply into that portfolio in relation to existing cuts, customer tactics or strategies. We're starting to deploy those, seeing a very good level of transition and integration, we inherited about 43,000 customers. We're seeing good continued tenancy, good integration with our own existing portfolio and we've just begun the expansion process about 10% expansions possible by again magnifying in some cases the size of properties in certain markets that had already been pre-entitled. So that too is taking place. the properties for the most part, gone through the first wave of rebranding. They look great in orange and we've also seen a very good integration from hiring a number of very strong property managers and district managers that have come into our portfolio as well. So overall, very pleased with what we've seen. And we, as I mentioned, have a very strong presence in that market far beyond any other operator and the quality of these assets is very additive to what we've continued to do and see from a benefit standpoint in the Washington metro market. Yes. Smedes the goal it's 2025. So we're definitely on the path to continue driving the size of that program. To your point, it is a process where there is a high level of activity tied to new development. I mentioned that our backlog continues to grow and we've seen a number of one off developers and some with multiple properties come to our platform that are in various stages of development. It's a different lens, clearly that points to the fact that the development, part of our industries, still active. And we're seeing the opportunity to grow the platform through that. Now having said that we are also finding some good opportunities to bring existing assets into the program as well. Many of the owners have started off with say one or two assets and are now starting to give us multiple assets. So that's I think indicative of the performance that we continue to show to the owners that have come into the platform and the benefit they're seeing by being within the public storage brand. The other thing I pointed out is we've now actually acquired 10 assets that have come into the program as well. So it's another avenue or channel for us to get closer to many owners who actually are coming back to us and saying would we have interest in actually acquiring these assets. So there's multiple drivers that we're going to continue to focus on as we build the program. We've got a team that's focused nationally. The assets that we've added, and having our backlog are literally widespread across the 39 states that we operate in. So we're pleased by that as well, and look forward to continue to grow the program. Yes. I mean the added color give you and you are right, that's the view that we've had, looking at the amount of volume that is likely to come into 2021. One thing that we're seeing is low approval processes at multiple cities. And that coupled with the fact that component costs are elevated, whether it's steel, labor, concrete, etc. So that's, I think stalling some of the development starts that might have been predicted either for 2021 and going into 2022. So we're keeping a close eye on it. We're clearly very deep into the development cycle in our own portfolio and understand and see the various headwinds that are playing through right now. Fortunately, we've got different ways to combat some of the cost pressures that are coming through that one off developer might not have the advantage to do so whether it's bulk buying or knowing and understanding how to pre-bid certain assets or components of assets. But with that we're likely to see, again, that laid down you talk to you and 2021. 2022, I would be surprised if it accelerates. It could take either a moderate step down or could be flatline based on the amount of activity that we're seeing in 2021 and then what's more unclear is what could happen in 2023 and beyond. So we'll see. I'd say overall Ki Bin no question we're seeing broad based strength. I mean, you look at all of our markets in the second quarter really strong growth and acceleration from the first quarter. I think what you're highlighting is there is some variation, which is something we see with a strong nationally diversified portfolio. What I highlighted earlier was a shift that I think I'll reiterate because we view it as pretty meaningfully internally where last year at this time, some of our absolute strongest markets we are experiencing some what I would consider a pandemic related dislocation and you can put the New York's or San Francisco's into that bucket and so they weren't our strongest markets. And you fast forward a year and our strongest markets now, as Joe and I mentioned earlier on the call Florida, Texas, Sunbelt markets, as well as some others, Chicago I would put in there as well. But there is some clear relationship between some of the macro drivers in Florida and Texas and Sunbelt markets for instance, that are driving demand. Housing clearly being one of them population inflows. And we're seeing real strength to highlight one market as an example, Miami which is our fifth largest market. We have about 90 stores, there in the same-store pool. Moving rents up 43% versus 2019. So a big market being fueled by macro drivers and real strength. In terms of what we're seeing in some of the bigger coastal markets we're seeing good demand there and still really strong occupancies and the ability to push rate. Year-over-year comps, frankly, are tougher in those markets right now as we sit compared to say, Miami, for instance. But if you look at performance versus 2019, still quite good. And we were encouraged by the demand trends there. I mean, what we're seeing in Los Angeles is really strong. North of 98% occupancy here in Los Angeles and strong demand drivers across the board. So generally pretty encouraged. But there are some factors that are causing some differentiation and I would add that we're going to continue to see new supply come into some of these markets and impact performance from here just like we have over the last five years. We spent a good bit of time talking about this through last year. We did see a shift towards longer length of stay and really strong existing tenant performance through the year last year. That's persisted. So tenants that were in house or moved in last year have continued perform really-really well and ahead of pre-pandemic expectations. Customers that have moved in this year have behaved more like our typical storage customers from 2019 for instance. Still performing really well. But not at that market improvement that we saw last year. The one thing I'd highlight from a lifetime value is clearly the rate portion of the equation. So if we're seeing good length of stays, and significantly higher rates that clearly leads to higher lifetime values. Sure. So the first question around rent regulations. For the most part those have expired and there was a big push through the first half of this year in many local governments to move past those state of emergency and pricing restrictions. And so for the most part they're no longer in place. the one I would highlight that is meaningful for us is the pricing restrictions from the state of emergency tied to wildfires here in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is our number one market with about 15% of our revenue and we continue to be a constraint here on rental activity. So that's when I highlight. The others have largely expired. There are a few here and there. That fact is a tailwind as we move to the second half where last year we were restricted on rent in many-many markets across the country. But it will take time to move existing tenants back up to where they would have otherwise been. And then your second question was on late fees. We did see some local jurisdictions put those in place. Some of the restrictions as it relates to our delinquent tenant processes remain in place but similar to rent regulations. Those are expiring and governments are looking to get back to regular business. Nothing material, I'd highlight there from a financial impact in the quarter. And I would I Ki Bin we've talked about this throughout last year fees, Ron, sorry, the fees were a big drag last year and we saw it now for the first time we've lapped that fee drag and don't anticipate that to continue to be a negative driver as we move through the second half. So that was a big shift in the second quarter. Sure Ron. It's a number of things that you just spoke to it points to the variety of things that we're doing from the infusion and the digitization of the business. We have a lot of analytics that help us look to the optimized level of labor. e-rental as I mentioned is having a pronounced effect if you kind of step back and think about the traditional operating model for the entire self storage industry. Historically it's always been centered on an interaction necessary at the counter with a property manager and in our case if 50% or so of our customers are choosing to do this electronically and self-directed that typical 30 to 45 minute transaction process that would happen at a counter is no longer necessary for again about half the customers that are at their own election choosing that option.

So I would anticipate that our margins are a good bit below that for the next several years as we look to increase the size and scope and in particular with properties and lease up."

            "name": "Thomas Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Our financial performance accelerated into the second quarter driven by both strong demand from customers and execution from the team. Our same store revenue increased 10.8% compared to the second quarter of 2020. That performance represented the sequential improvement and growth of 7.4% from the first quarter driven by rate. Two factors led to the acceleration in realize rate per foot. First, about half came from strong demand and limited inventory which allowed us to achieve moving rates that were up 48% versus 2020. And as Joe mentioned 27% versus pre-pandemic 2019. Secondly, existing tenant rate increases also made up about half of the improvement, comparing against the period when we did not send increases at the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Now onto expenses. The team did a great job executing in this environment. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property payroll, we discussed at our investor day, the operating model transformation underway. About half of the year-over-year decline in payroll expense was attributable to those initiatives that use technology and roll specialization to drive improvements in customer experience, employee experience, and our expense levels. And the other half of the payroll decline is comparing against the onset of the pandemic last year when we put in place a program that we call the PS Cares program to provide additional support to our operations team including a $3 per hour incentive for property managers. On property tax, we will expense our annual estimate ratably through the year, leading to an approximately $0.05 benefit in each of the first three quarters of the year and reversing to a $0.15 headwind in the fourth quarter. This will lead to a more stable quarter-over-quarter expense profile in the future. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool stabilized properties was up 21.7% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, as Joe mentioned, the lease up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities was also a standout in the quarter adding 35 million in NOI or $0.20 of FFO. As we sit here today at the peak of the leasing season, customer demand remains robust and business is good. So let's shift to the outlook. We raised our core FFO guidance by $0.55 at the midpoint or 4.8%. Looking at the drivers, we increased our outlook for same store revenue to grow from 7% to 8.5% in 2021. That outlook implies a faster rate of growth in the second half compared to our 7.1% growth in the first half. Our current expectations are for occupancy to moderate from here by about 300 basis points from peak now to trough at the end of the year. This would generally reflect a return to typical seasonality of the business, albeit at higher occupancies than historically achieved. But big picture, the baton has clearly been passed to rate growth in the second quarter which will be the driver of performance in the second half. We also expect continued strong expense control throughout 2021. Our expectations are for 0% to 1% same-store expense growth. And we also increased our guidance for non-same-store performance given the acceleration of acquisitions in the strong lease up of our own stabilized facilities. The balance sheet, as Joe mentioned, is poised for incremental activity in the second half of this year. To wrap up, business is good in the strategies we discussed at our investor day in May are evident in this quarter. With that I'll turn it over for questions. Yes. Juan it's right in the ballpark of the historical and generally speaking, actually, the middle of July is our peak occupancy. We actually had occupancy of north of 97%, in the middle of July. So there's a little bit of incremental peeks there to be had from June 30 numbers, but overall, generally in line. The real story in the second half is you highlighted this rate, though, and I think we can talk about occupancy a little bit here or there. But the driver will be how can we keep the pricing strength in play through the second half, both for new customers and existing customers, and that will drive performance more meaningfully through the second half? Yes. well, maybe comment on a few of your questions embedded there. One, we do view development as continued good allocation of capital. Joe mentioned that the pipeline increased by about 150 million this quarter and we obviously outline in the investor day in May, plans to increase it a good bit further from there. In addition to that, though, we are finding good deals that will meet not just a marginal debt cost of capital, but ultimately our overall cost of capital and provide good returns based on our ability to take properties as Joe mentioned, lease them up and earn a good return to stabilization and then rent growth from there. So overall we're still finding good high quality deals that will exceed our cost of capital across the board and we have the balance sheet flexibility to use attractively priced unsecured debt to fund that. Yes, and Michael, just to add our west coast markets from Seattle, all the way down to San Diego are dealing with extremely high occupancy levels. The amount of new supply coming in those markets for the most part is limited. But on the other side of the barbell which is really tight right now, Houston, which has been a poster child for lower occupancy, high supply, I mean, Houston is at 95%. That speaks to what Tom just talked about which is another added driver that we're seeing in different parts of the country primarily Texas and the southeast is amplified levels of activity because of migration and we're even looking for signals can some of that taper down, and it's not at all and even as many of those markets actually returned to some level of normal, again, activity from opening up businesses, etc, we really see no degradation in demand and/or occupancy levels. So we continue to fill up even higher supply markets has been quite pronounced and we're pleased to see that and we're continuing to look for any signals if there's any reversion. But as we speak, that band a very tight occupancy market to market is quite strong."

Before we begin, we continue to wish everyone good health as we all face the many impacts from the pandemic.  This morning, Tom and I will begin the call by covering a few areas tied to Q1 performance, along with our inaugural guidance for 2021. As you know, on May 3, we are hosting an Investor Day virtually and hope you can join us. We will share our key strategies and introduce you to the executive leadership team that will drive our growth in the coming years.  Looking at Q1, a number of historic metrics play through. Customer demand for self-storage has remained elevated. We continue to see consistent customer behavior across all markets with increased move-in rates, extended customer length of stay and more latitude to resume traditional rate increases to existing customers.  Demand has been tied to both historic drivers coupled with the longer-lasting impacts from more consumers needing storage. This includes work-from-home, study-from-home, elevated home sales and remodeling and the migration in and out of metropolitan markets.  With the economy improving and additional government stimulus, consumer balance sheets are healthy and our customers' payment patterns remain strong. Both same-store and non-same-store assets are performing well. With lease ups, particularly in non-same-store assets outpacing our projections as NOI grew by 46%.  To investments, 2021 is shaping up to be a robust year of acquisition activity. With the addition of the recently announced ezStorage portfolio, our year-to-date 2020 acquisition activity either closed or under contract is $2.5 billion. Of note, since 2019, we have acquired, developed and redeveloped approximately 22 million square feet and have expanded our portfolio by 13%, having invested $4.3 billion.  In regard to the ezStorage acquisition, I would like to mention a few highlights of this significant transaction and how it matched 4 specific areas tied to our unique capabilities. First, the integration of the assets into the Public Storage brand and operating platform will be seamless as we already had a broad presence in these markets with 115 assets. We now enjoy even stronger presence with now 163 assets with unmatched brand presence across the mid-Atlantic region.  Second, 8 of the ezStorage assets are poised for expansion, along with 1 that has begun ground-up development. The Public Storage development team has taken lead on these opportunities and is ready to execute on each one of them, allowing us to expand the portfolio by approximately 10% over the next 24 months.  As you know, Public Storage has the only development team among the self-storage REITs and is well poised to unlock more value from this portfolio by virtue of our unique development capabilities. Third, our ability to fund a large acquisition and close in a very short time line, in this case, 6 weeks from selection to close was due to our efficient and primed capital structure.  This transaction is immediately accretive to FFO and NOI. And fourth, our well-earned reputation of being a buyer of choice in the investment community. I want to thank the Manganaro family and the ezStorage team for choosing Public Storage and the great work they put into this outstanding portfolio over the last 2-plus decades.  We appreciate their assistance in integrating this outstanding portfolio into our platform and welcome many of their employees and customers to Public Storage. Looking to full 2021, we are encouraged by core customer demand, our well-located portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the quality and dedication of the 5,000-plus team members at Public Storage, all of whom are committed to enhancing the leading brand in the self-storage industry.  With that, let me hand the call over to Tom.\nThomas Boyle: Thanks, Joe. I'll start with financial performance. Our financial performance has improved steadily through the second half of 2020 into the first quarter of 2021. In the same-store, our revenue increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020, which represents a sequential improvement in growth of 2.6% from the fourth quarter.  There were two primary factors contributing to that improvement. First and foremost, move-in rates were up double digits, while move-out rates were roughly flat year-over-year, leading to improving in-place rents. Secondly, occupancy also increased through the quarter with move-in volume down but move-out volume also lower. Now on to expenses. The team did a great job driving same-store cost of operations down in the first quarter. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property tax specifically, we will expense our estimate ratably through the year, leading to a benefit in the first 3 quarters and reversing to a headwind in the fourth quarter.  This will lead to more stable quarter-over-quarter property tax in the future. The benefit this quarter was worth $0.05 of FFO. Some of the technology and operating model evolution we'll discuss on Monday at our Investor Day, showed up in our first quarter numbers, with property payroll down 13% in the quarter, given efficiency improvements. We look forward to sharing more on Monday.  For the first time, we included 2021 core FFO guidance in our earnings release and supplement. In conjunction with the line-by-line commentary in our supplemental, it's a guide to our outlook and the key drivers of our business. And as we started 2021, we've seen continued strength, as Joe mentioned, in customer demand, with occupancies up 260 basis points and in-place contract rent per occupied square foot turning into positive year-over-year territory in January.  We anticipate same-store revenue to grow from 4% to 5.5% in 2021. That outlook is supported by good customer demand and moderating supply. That said, we do see risk to move-outs going higher as we move through the year comping against what was really extraordinary existing tenant performance in 2020.  Our current expectations are for occupancy to be down 100 basis points plus in the fourth quarter compared to 2020. We expect continued strong expense control in the same-store in 2021. Our expectations are for 1% to 2% same-store expense growth. Property tax expense growth will pick up this year with our expectations around a 5% increase for the year, again, recognized ratably through the year.  Our guidance includes the acceleration of our external growth initiatives with ezStorage and will add to FFO growth through our non same-store portfolio this year and next. In total, our outlook is for core FFO per share of $11.35 to $11.75 for 2021.  I'll now shift gears to the balance sheet. As Joe mentioned, we used our growth-oriented balance sheet to fund the purchase of ezStorage entering the bond market the day after announcement and having fully funded the transaction within 2 days. The offering comprised of 3, 7 and 10 year tranches with a weighted average cost of about 1.6%.  After effect of the transaction, we have the longest duration balance sheet in the REIT industry with 1 of the lowest cost profiles. And we remain in a great position to continue to use the balance sheet to fund our growth initiatives, and we'll share more at our Investor Day on Monday. With that, I'll turn it over to Angela to open the line up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJeffrey Spector: First question is just really the main incoming investor question we get, and it's around the customers, demand drivers, and Joe, you discussed this, I guess, in your opening remarks a bit. But -- and then again, you talked about a decrease in occupancy in the fourth quarter.  Can you just, I guess, dig in a little bit more on why you feel the customer -- some of the drivers we saw last year may fade? And can you confirm the 100 bps drops in the fourth quarter, is that just normal seasonality? How does that compare to normally what you see in the fourth quarter?\nJoseph Russell: Yes, Jeff. One of the things that is hard to predict, even going out another couple of quarters is what could revert to some degree to what you would call normal seasonality. So to Tom's point, we're looking at that as a potential event, but still to be determined. As we've seen now for the last several quarters, the sustainability of consumer and business demand for that matter has been quite elevated.  As I noted, there are consistent market trends, literally in every area that we operate in the business right now. And consumers continue to look for and need storage for a whole host of both traditional and, I would say, new and different reasons. We're encouraged by the fact that there's even generationally entirely new pool of customers coming to storage for the first time. We think that can be additive as well. And as we've seen with home sales, as I mentioned, the additional pickup of the economy, overall demand has been quite healthy, and we feel it's sustainable, but could be impacted for more seasonality reasons, closer to the end of the year, but to be determined.\nJeffrey Spector: And then my second question just on acquisitions and new facilities. How should we think about, I guess, specific target markets for you and how that fits in with your current portfolio plus the ezStorage portfolio?\nJoseph Russell: Well, one of the benefits that we clearly have had over time and this isn't new to the way that we're uniquely positioned nationally is we have deep presence literally in every major metropolitan market across the United States. We're on the ground. We're dealing with a lot of very vibrant data relative to knowledge of other owners, the traction that we're seeing in markets, the way that we balance, the focus that we've got on going deeper in any particular market.  And looking at the ezStorage acquisition, as I noted, we already had a top ownership position in that market by quite a large margin. The ezStorage portfolio was highly regarded and was known nationally as a very top-tier national operator, by virtue of pulling those 48 assets on top of what we already had, which was a very strong presence in that market. We were able to magnify our presence there quite dramatically.  And that could play through in many other markets nationally, whether it's on something as sizable as ezStorage or something more limited from a specific asset base, whether it's a single or a smaller portfolio or one that could be more widespread. Give you another example in the fourth quarter of 2020, we bought the Beyond Storage portfolio, unlike the ezStorage portfolio, the Beyond Storage portfolio was in multiple markets, but again, very easy for us to integrate, very easy for us to underwrite. And we had very good ability to move quickly which leads to the fact that we are, without question, a preferred buyer.  And with that, the team continues to see a very strong collection of different opportunities nationally. We're seeing good quality of assets come into the markets. I would say about half of them come to us privately off-market and the other half, more through traditional means, but we've got very good relationships, deep seated, by virtue of the fact that we've been and operate in these markets and have a very strong reputation as a preferred buyer.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the same-store revenue growth. And maybe if you could just give us any more context with regards to the cadence as you built in through the year, your assumptions for the full year. Maybe if you can provide some color on the low versus high end and what's assumed at those 2 extremes? And what the benefit is from easier comps on the fee business, which has been a drag for the last few quarters?\nThomas Boyle: Yes, sure, Juan. There's a lot there to unpack. So let me pace through that. Starting with the last one first, which is fees. So that has been a drag in each of the quarters since the onset of the pandemic. And so you started to see that really take hold in the second quarter of last year. And so we will have lapped that comp.  We do anticipate, as Joe mentioned, continued strong payment activity. So we don't think that those fee collections will -- those fees will be charged or collected for the remainder of the year, but we won't be comping against the previous year where we had been collecting them.  So that should go away from a comp standpoint in the next 3 quarters. In terms of cadence through the year, I mentioned the occupancy point in the fourth quarter in our base case. And I think that, that is really driven, as Joe mentioned, by typical seasonality as we get into the second part of the year. We'd anticipate that as the economy starts to open up, we see more governors talking about getting back to normal through the summer period and employers encouraging folks to get back into the office as we move through the summer and into the fall. We would anticipate a more seasonal pattern to reemerge and occupancies to fall like they do in any typical year as we move into the third and fourth quarter. In terms of any other items I'd highlight as we talked about last year, one of the drivers of the drop in in-place rents last second quarter, in particular, was the fact that we had paused on our existing tenant rate increase program. And as Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are executing on that plan throughout the year this year. So we will have easy comps from an existing tenant rate increase program standpoint in the second quarter. But then we did resume those last year in the third and fourth.\nJuan Sanabria: Great. And then I was just hoping if you could provide any color on what you're seeing on street rates for new customers in terms of net effective and how that's trended through April, just to give us a sense of how seasonality is trending to date?\nThomas Boyle: Yes. Well, we continue to see very strong demand trends, as Joe mentioned earlier. The move-in rates in the first quarter were up nearly 16% year-over-year, and those were comping pre pandemic 2020. As we moved into April, we obviously are now comping the onset of the pandemic last year where we did see reduced customer demand and lower move-in rates. So move-in rates year-over-year through April are up 40% plus. And I think the most encouraging thing is we start to look at a typical seasonal pattern. We're looking at 2019 as a benchmark, and our April move-in rents are up double digits versus April 2019 as well, indicating that continued positive trajectory of rents and good performance there. So we continue to be encouraged by customer demand. And frankly, we have limited inventory within the same-store pool. So rates are going higher.\nJuan Sanabria: 40% sounds pretty good to me.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc.\nTodd Thomas: First question, just circling back to investments. I'm just trying to tease through some of the comments that you've made, Joe, and the $200 million of incremental acquisitions that are embedded in the guidance. It seems a little bit light relative to the pace you're on, even excluding the ezStorage deal.  Are you expecting a slowdown in the near-term because you have to hit the pause button to digest a little bit? Or is there just a lack of visibility at this time based on what's in the market with maybe last coming to market after a flurry of activity here. Can you comment on that?\nJoseph Russell: Yes, Todd, there -- it's a little more related to the latter. No, we're well primed and continue to add assets to the platform very easily. And the acquisition team seeing good opportunities, as I talked about a few minutes ago. So it's just, again, a hard metric to look at from a continued elevated level of activity, but we're seeing good quality assets. We've got a lot of activity going on. It's competitive. We're still focusing on quality assets, quality markets and properties that we know that can be accretive and additive to the overall platform, but we're confident that we're going to continue to see good activity there. It's just the predictability, and from a competitive standpoint, what we're going to face as we go deeper into the year.  As Tom has noted, what the balance sheet is more than well primed to continue to support our acquisition and development activity. And with that, we'll continue to seek out and find and pursue many different types of opportunities, whether they're portfolio related or on a one-off basis.  If you look at the $500-or-so million that we've got in our acquisition pipeline. As we speak, it's more oriented toward either one-off or smaller concentrations of assets. That's the consistent playbook that is always in our mix. And then what can be more unpredictable is just what can come through in the larger portfolios.  So we still think we're in very good shape to continue to pursue opportunities, but we'll see how that plays through as the year goes on. But very pleased by the amount of volume, certainly, that we've been able to capture not only in Q1, but going through 2020 as a whole and then, as I mentioned, off to a very good start this year.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then just thinking geographically, obviously, the ezStorage deal was a little bit more concentrated. Is there a focus looking out on adding exposure in certain markets or regions, whether because of maybe certain demographic changes or accelerated -- accelerating trends in certain markets? Or is it more based on quality of asset and what's generally available for transaction purposes?\nJoseph Russell: Yes. Obviously, you can't manufacture sales opportunities in and of itself. But we are very intentional on where we're putting priorities, where we're looking to either expand each area of the business based on the trends that we see, where we continue to see very strong advantage by enhanced scale. Looking at the ezStorage portfolio, as I mentioned, we already had a commanding size portfolio there. This made it even more attractive from a scale and presence standpoint. But we're also out looking to increase our presence in other markets as well. We recently went into Boise, Idaho. We've never been in Boise before.  We were able to capture a very nice 6-asset portfolio in that market. So we're looking deep in the markets that we've been in traditionally, and we're looking at markets that we see good growth opportunities as well.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And just a quick last question. You haven't sold in saying really previously or really at all over the course of the last decade or 2 or 3. And I normally -- it's around dispositions, but some strategic changes around certain parts of the business and capital allocation strategy in recent years. And I'm just curious if -- just given the demand for assets, if you're contemplating any asset sales or dispositions in order to either sort of call or prune the portfolio at all?\nJoseph Russell: That's an ongoing evaluation that we do, Todd. I wouldn't point you to any specific area and/or type of asset or portfolio that we own, I would say, is a candidate to look for disposition at the -- at this point, but it's something that we continue to evaluate. And if circumstances and our own perspective has changed, we think that's beneficial. We'll certainly execute on that for it, too. But nothing to speak to on that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I wanted to ask you just a little bit on AutoPay, which I think you've said is 1 reason why you've seen this decline in late fees, and it sounds like that's kind of structurally lower going forward. But do people who go on AutoPay tend to stay longer? And is that kind of an opportunity across your portfolio? I don't know what percentage is already on AutoPay.\nJoseph Russell: Sure. Thanks, Smedes. The ONE thing I'd highlight is we think it was above and beyond AutoPay change as we moved into April. Our AutoPay was pretty consistent through the months of February, March, April, May last year, but we saw a significant acceleration in payment patterns at the onset of the pandemic. So I wouldn't point to AutoPay specifically.  That said, AutoPay has been trending higher over the last several years, and we expect it to continue to, given our e-rental platform, which now comprises about half of our move-in volumes today and that auto enrolls folks into AutoPay if they elect that move-in method.  And so we do anticipate that AutoPay will increase. But it's not really the main driver of what we've seen on customer payment patterns. I think that's more consumer balance sheets being excellent and some of the operational processes we put around and at the time of the pandemic.\nSmedes Rose: And have you seen any differences though between folks who are on AutoPay, who aren't in terms of how long they stay? Or is it not meaningful?\nJoseph Russell: AutoPay is certainly one of the things we look at from a customer composition standpoint. People that select AutoPay have a certain characteristic associated with them, both demographics and psychographics and the like. And so it's not necessarily selecting AutoPay that makes them be a customer of a certain type. It's the folks that generally select AutoPay tend to have certain characteristics, but that's something we watch very closely as we look to understand our customer.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then I just want to ask you, you mentioned price restrictions that's still in place in some regions. Does that meaningfully restrict in your ability to really pass along price increases? Or are the upper limits kind of above where you would normally be anyway? I'm just trying to think about -- around your guidance like if some of those got listed, is there upside there? Or is it not all that impactful right now?\nJoseph Russell: Yes. Thanks, Smedes. That's a great question. We've been talking about pricing restrictions through the pandemic, but many of those restrictions have started to fade away which is encouraging. So as we think about it on a year-over-year basis, 2021 is a better pricing regulatory environment than 2020 was. The one big notable state of emergency pricing restriction that's in place, and it has been for the last several years now is in Los Angeles County and several other counties here in California related to fires that have taken place over the last several years.  So Los Angeles is our largest market. And we've been restricted on pricing because of Section 396 in California since the fall of 2018. So that remains in place. It's not scheduled to expire until December 31. So it doesn't factor into our guidance per se, but it remains a headwind in Los Angeles. And you can see Los Angeles is doing quite well, but it's certainly not seeing the same level of revenue growth that we are in some of our other markets, given some of the pricing restrictions there.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of with Samir Khanal with ISI.\nSamir Khanal: Joe, just one more on the acquisition front. I know we talked about sort of the U.S. and domestically. But I guess, internationally, just curious what does that opportunity set look like for you guys as well?\nJoseph Russell: Well, we have certainly the bandwidth and the knowledge of thinking outside borders. We've talked about this historically relative to our very strong and, I would say, deep knowledge base that came from the platform in Europe. Obviously, that's Shurgard and the things that we've taken away and learned from portfolio like that and how it's grown over time and how it's been able to do quite well throughout the Western European markets. So the skill set is resident here in the company. We continue to track a number of different markets outside U.S. borders and when certain opportunities present themselves and/or we think it's an appropriate opportunity for us to expand outside, we're well suited to do so.\nSamir Khanal: And I guess my second question is just shifting over to the supply picture over the next 12 to 18 months. When considering how strong fundamentals are, I mean, developers are not slowing down. How do you think about supply picture, let's say, 12, 18 months down the road?\nJoseph Russell: That's something that we're watching closely. Development nationally peaked in 2019 were plus or minus about $5 billion of new assets were developed and delivered. It tapered down in 2020 by about 15% or so. In 2021, we're predicting another leg down in that 10% to 15% range again. Going into 2022, it's always a little bit more cloudy to figure out what could play through. We do think that this, however, has been a very good cycle for us to continue to find and source land sites with less competitive activity out there. Our development team is very busy sourcing those kinds of opportunities.  So it's been a good window for us actually to jump in and look for land sites, either that have or have not been through different levels of entitlements. And we're going to continue to look for and extract very good value from our development activities, where we typically are able to drive the highest return on invested capital through the investment that we put into development and/or redevelopment.  So we're uniquely positioned to do so. As I mentioned, we have the only development platform in the public arena, and by far, we have the biggest development team in the self-storage industry. It's national. We're deep, great relationships, just like we're able to tap into on the acquisition front. And we'll continue to monitor and see what kind of continued activity play through from the development activity that's going on right down to individual submarkets and then nationally as well.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRichard Hill: I'm on for Ron Kamdem today. I think you're painting a pretty good picture about growth over the medium term, maybe even long term. So I wanted to maybe take a step back and unpack internal versus external growth. As you think about internal growth, can you maybe talk through about the demand drivers that's coming from a millennial and Z generation that's just now entering to the household formation years and sort of how that plays into how you think about your ability to continue to push rent growth off record levels?  And then more importantly, I shouldn't say more importantly, but similarly, could you maybe talk about the external growth? And if there's other opportunities to acquire big portfolios like you've done over the past several years?\nJoseph Russell: So yes, Tom and I can kind of toggle and answer your questions. But I would say internally, we definitely do see the opportunity around maturing generational demand. There's been a consistent and confidently, we're optimistic about the type of demand factors that are now playing through in, again, the newer generation users, many of whom are actually coming to use storage for the exact same reasons, their predecessors did. So life events in general, needing more space, cost of housing, working from home in this particular environment, all the things that play through relative to changes in family dynamics, et cetera, are very powerful to the use case and continued adoption and absorption of self-storage nationally.  The Self Storage Association tracks this on an annual basis, and it has continued to grow over time, and we're confident it will do just that. And then on the external side, there's a good population of quality assets, many of which have been delivered, say, over the last 4 or 5 years, in particular, by individual developers that we've been able to tap.  We haven't been shy about buying assets that are less than stabilized. Our average occupancy of the assets that we have under contract, for instance, right now is about 50%. So there's a good pool of assets out there that are far from stabilization that have been good opportunities for us to go out and acquire.  We're still buying stabilized assets as well. But there's a healthy amount of inventory from a group of developers that have come into the self-storage sector for the first time weren't intending necessarily to be here for the long haul. And that has elevated our opportunity set to go out and acquire and be confident about our external growth, knowing that, that inventory level is quite strong, and the quality is quite good, too, in many cases.  Tom, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?\nThomas Boyle: No, no. I think you covered it well. And I'd highlight we'll be spending more time on these topics on Monday for our Investor Day in some more detail.\nRichard Hill: Yes. That's helpful, guys. And ultimately -- what I'm ultimately getting at is we see a really favorable backdrop for the housing market. Certainly don't see any signs of a bubble despite some of the media narrative. So if HPA is going to remain, call it, in the mid-high single digits, what does that mean for your rent growth? And certainly, there's probably going to be some normalization from the record levels that you've seen. But it would seem to indicate that there's no reason you can't continue to capitalize at an above-inflation rate over the medium term. Is that a right characterization?\nJoseph Russell: If your predictions for home price appreciation and rent growth play out, storage is definitely linked to that as a space substitute for consumers. So all nice contributors to potential rent growth over time.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: So when you look across the portfolio, there's probably a good mix of markets that never really shut down, some of that shutdown, but opened quickly and some are just kind of opening now. So would have kind of called that reopening cohorts. When you look at those mix of cities, is there any lessons to be learned that might confirm or give you confidence that occupancy could decline? Or maybe is that just being conservative?\nJoseph Russell: It's definitely something we're watching, Ki Bin. It's something, however, that hasn't, in any way, elevated to a noted change or a reversion to what may have been more normal in prior periods. If you look at Florida or Texas, for instance, I would say, two markets that have been on the early side of \"opening back up,\" we're actually seeing some of our healthiest demand drivers in those 2 states as we speak.  So even as either consumers or businesses are coming back into some level of normality, demand is still very good. In fact, if anything, it's percolating higher than it was on the early side of the pandemic. So it's a validation that there are other additive drivers that are going on, whether it's with the economy at large, home sales, in migration, all the other factors that can drive overall demand for storage.  And we've really seen no evidence yet that there's any change that would point to the fact that there's something reversing or that we're going to see any near-term anyway, something that would shift strongly that has, on the opposite side, been very additive to overall business metrics.  So we're watching closely right down to a submarket basis. But if you even take a look at Texas as a whole, whether it's Houston, Austin, Dallas, San Antonio, very good activity in all 4 cities. And we've got big presence in each and every 1 of them, going to South Florida, for instance, whether it's Miami or Tampa, again, very, very strong drivers there, too.  So we're tracking and keeping an eye on it, but it's a validation that the business is not only quite resilient, but it's -- from a product standpoint, consumers and businesses are looking for storage very actively right now.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. That's pretty encouraging to hear. The second question, you guys provided CapEx guidance, a bit higher than what we've been used to on a recurring CapEx. I'm not sure if I'm looking at this apples-to-apples, but wondering if you can provide any commentary around that?\nJoseph Russell: Sure. Happy to, Ki Bin. And we'll go into some of our CapEx plans on Monday as well. But I think if taking a step back the $250 million to $300 million that we disclosed for the year, it's higher than it has been in previous years, and it's really been driven by incremental activity tied to our Property of Tomorrow program and the acceleration of that program after we had slowed it down through the pandemic.  So if you think about the $250 million to $300 million, the building blocks there, about $75 million or so of regular maintenance CapEx, an additional, call it, $50 million to $60 million in solar and LED investments and then, call it, $120 million plus in Property of Tomorrow as we seek to accelerate that program and run it through our portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of David Balaguer with Green Street.\nDavid Balaguer: Sticking to development, just wanted to focus on construction costs a little bit as looking across property sectors, that's been a topic that seems to have hit most property sectors quite a bit. With your development platform, how much have you seen construction costs increase? And to what extent could that have an impact on supply moving forward?\nJoseph Russell: The one component that we're watching closely is steel cost, for instance. So there's been some volatility there and some price increases that we're keeping track of. Market to market, there could be some impacts from a labor standpoint.  So it's fluid. It can be erratic in some cases and unpredictable as well. So it's definitely something that we're keeping a close eye on. I wouldn't say it's become some kind of an overarching headwind for somebody to either stop a potential development project or actually delay 1 indefinitely, but we'll see how those costs trend over time. But the 1 area that we're looking at more specifically right now is just steel costs.\nDavid Balaguer: Got it. And just a second follow-up question. For the acquisition subsequent to quarter end besides the EV storage acquisition, can you give us an idea on occupancy there and general lease-up time line compared to recent acquisition activity over the last couple of quarters?\nJoseph Russell: Yes. Again, the amount of occupancy roughly in the $500 million or so that's in our unclosed pipeline of acquisitions hovers around 50% or so. So it's a combination of assets, some of which are just coming to the market. So a few assets that we're going to take very low levels of occupancy to others that are much higher and I would call them more stabilized. But it's a range. As I noted, we have not been shy about bringing those kinds of assets into the portfolio. Frankly, we need more space to lease-up. So it's been a good opportunity for us to pull those assets into the portfolio, put them into our operating platform, and we're seeing very good and, I would say, better-than-expected performance based on the environment that we're dealing with.  So we're looking for and finding good quality there and aren't hesitant to buy assets that have the lease-up that maybe others are not as comfortable with. So we're seeing good opportunity set there, and we'll continue to hunt for those kinds of assets.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.\nTodd Stender: Probably for Tom, with the $2 billion in bonds, you used to fund the $1.8 billion for ezStorage, just seeing where you sit right now as far as sources and uses and what you're budgeting for the remainder of the year as far as external capital?\nThomas Boyle: Yes, sure. So we weren't able to get into the bond market pretty quickly post the ezStorage transaction for the $2 billion. And as Joe mentioned, we continue to see good opportunities for acquisition volumes. And as you're highlighting with sources and uses, if those volumes continue to percolate, we'd anticipate we'll likely access the bond market in the second half of the year, and that's embedded into the interest expense guidance that we released yesterday afternoon.\nTodd Stender: Got it. And then when we look at these coupons for the debt across those 3 tranches, does that start to make the cost of preferreds not competitive right now? Is that fair to say?\nThomas Boyle: Well, the duration of those and the features of them are quite different. And so as we look at preferred costs around 4%, certainly, the 3-year bond that we did about 0.75%, very different in cost, but also very different in profile. And so we'll talk more about balance sheet strategy on Monday, but we continue to like preferred stock as a cornerstone of the capital structure, but we've been adding lower cost and shorter-dated duration to spread the maturity profile out over time and diversify our sources of financing.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: Just two quick ones here. One, Tom, appreciate the CapEx breakdown. Can you talk about like which are the extra components about the non -- the normal core stuff, the solar, the Property of Tomorrow. Like how many years do you see that stuff recurring?\nThomas Boyle: Sure. So Property of Tomorrow, and we'll go into some detail on this on Monday. We see continuing over the next several years as we roll that through the rest of the portfolio. And then we have a good runway, particularly on solar. LED, we're moving through the portfolio pretty quickly through last year and this year on an interior basis. In the prior 3 years, we were doing exterior LED. So we've got some more LED activity maybe for the next year or 2, but then that will really subside. But solar we see the opportunity to put that on half or more of our portfolio over time, and we're just scratching the surface there.\nMichael Mueller: Got it. Okay. And then just in terms of looking at land sites, I mean, how are you thinking about infill urban as opposed to more of the first ring suburbs, just given the dynamics that have evolved over COVID?\nJoseph Russell: Yes, Mike, we're vetting both. We're not seeing really any material degradation in urban versus suburban demand factors. So the team is out hunting for sites that have the right dynamics from a competitive standpoint, meaning finding land sites that were much more benefited by having less competition.  The amount of demographic analysis that we do, overall ability to predict and see good demand factors over time based on any particular new development. So it hasn't really turned anything, I would call, from a segmentation standpoint that we would be hesitant to go into urban versus suburban or prioritize 1 over the other.  Frankly, we have a good and healthy mix of both as it stands. And based on -- even in this environment, the kind of trends and the overall demand factors, we're confident that both types of environments are very good for our business, so long as we understand the ultimate dynamics that go right down to that specific trade area. We've got great data. We've got the ability to vet those sites very quickly. And as I mentioned, we're seeing some pretty interesting opportunities around land sites with less competition.\nOperator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back to Ryan Burke for additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Angela, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We very much look forward to seeing you virtually again on Monday at the Investor Day. Have a good weekend.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joseph Russell",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, we continue to wish everyone good health as we all face the many impacts from the pandemic.  This morning, Tom and I will begin the call by covering a few areas tied to Q1 performance, along with our inaugural guidance for 2021. As you know, on May 3, we are hosting an Investor Day virtually and hope you can join us. We will share our key strategies and introduce you to the executive leadership team that will drive our growth in the coming years.  Looking at Q1, a number of historic metrics play through. Customer demand for self-storage has remained elevated. We continue to see consistent customer behavior across all markets with increased move-in rates, extended customer length of stay and more latitude to resume traditional rate increases to existing customers.  Demand has been tied to both historic drivers coupled with the longer-lasting impacts from more consumers needing storage. This includes work-from-home, study-from-home, elevated home sales and remodeling and the migration in and out of metropolitan markets.  With the economy improving and additional government stimulus, consumer balance sheets are healthy and our customers' payment patterns remain strong. Both same-store and non-same-store assets are performing well. With lease ups, particularly in non-same-store assets outpacing our projections as NOI grew by 46%.  To investments, 2021 is shaping up to be a robust year of acquisition activity. With the addition of the recently announced ezStorage portfolio, our year-to-date 2020 acquisition activity either closed or under contract is $2.5 billion. Of note, since 2019, we have acquired, developed and redeveloped approximately 22 million square feet and have expanded our portfolio by 13%, having invested $4.3 billion.  In regard to the ezStorage acquisition, I would like to mention a few highlights of this significant transaction and how it matched 4 specific areas tied to our unique capabilities. First, the integration of the assets into the Public Storage brand and operating platform will be seamless as we already had a broad presence in these markets with 115 assets. We now enjoy even stronger presence with now 163 assets with unmatched brand presence across the mid-Atlantic region.  Second, 8 of the ezStorage assets are poised for expansion, along with 1 that has begun ground-up development. The Public Storage development team has taken lead on these opportunities and is ready to execute on each one of them, allowing us to expand the portfolio by approximately 10% over the next 24 months.  As you know, Public Storage has the only development team among the self-storage REITs and is well poised to unlock more value from this portfolio by virtue of our unique development capabilities. Third, our ability to fund a large acquisition and close in a very short time line, in this case, 6 weeks from selection to close was due to our efficient and primed capital structure.  This transaction is immediately accretive to FFO and NOI. And fourth, our well-earned reputation of being a buyer of choice in the investment community. I want to thank the Manganaro family and the ezStorage team for choosing Public Storage and the great work they put into this outstanding portfolio over the last 2-plus decades.  We appreciate their assistance in integrating this outstanding portfolio into our platform and welcome many of their employees and customers to Public Storage. Looking to full 2021, we are encouraged by core customer demand, our well-located portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the quality and dedication of the 5,000-plus team members at Public Storage, all of whom are committed to enhancing the leading brand in the self-storage industry.  With that, let me hand the call over to Tom. Yes, Jeff. One of the things that is hard to predict, even going out another couple of quarters is what could revert to some degree to what you would call normal seasonality. So to Tom's point, we're looking at that as a potential event, but still to be determined. As we've seen now for the last several quarters, the sustainability of consumer and business demand for that matter has been quite elevated.  As I noted, there are consistent market trends, literally in every area that we operate in the business right now. And consumers continue to look for and need storage for a whole host of both traditional and, I would say, new and different reasons. We're encouraged by the fact that there's even generationally entirely new pool of customers coming to storage for the first time. We think that can be additive as well. And as we've seen with home sales, as I mentioned, the additional pickup of the economy, overall demand has been quite healthy, and we feel it's sustainable, but could be impacted for more seasonality reasons, closer to the end of the year, but to be determined. Well, one of the benefits that we clearly have had over time and this isn't new to the way that we're uniquely positioned nationally is we have deep presence literally in every major metropolitan market across the United States. We're on the ground. We're dealing with a lot of very vibrant data relative to knowledge of other owners, the traction that we're seeing in markets, the way that we balance, the focus that we've got on going deeper in any particular market.  And looking at the ezStorage acquisition, as I noted, we already had a top ownership position in that market by quite a large margin. The ezStorage portfolio was highly regarded and was known nationally as a very top-tier national operator, by virtue of pulling those 48 assets on top of what we already had, which was a very strong presence in that market. We were able to magnify our presence there quite dramatically.  And that could play through in many other markets nationally, whether it's on something as sizable as ezStorage or something more limited from a specific asset base, whether it's a single or a smaller portfolio or one that could be more widespread. Give you another example in the fourth quarter of 2020, we bought the Beyond Storage portfolio, unlike the ezStorage portfolio, the Beyond Storage portfolio was in multiple markets, but again, very easy for us to integrate, very easy for us to underwrite. And we had very good ability to move quickly which leads to the fact that we are, without question, a preferred buyer.  And with that, the team continues to see a very strong collection of different opportunities nationally. We're seeing good quality of assets come into the markets. I would say about half of them come to us privately off-market and the other half, more through traditional means, but we've got very good relationships, deep seated, by virtue of the fact that we've been and operate in these markets and have a very strong reputation as a preferred buyer. Yes, Todd, there -- it's a little more related to the latter. No, we're well primed and continue to add assets to the platform very easily. And the acquisition team seeing good opportunities, as I talked about a few minutes ago. So it's just, again, a hard metric to look at from a continued elevated level of activity, but we're seeing good quality assets. We've got a lot of activity going on. It's competitive. We're still focusing on quality assets, quality markets and properties that we know that can be accretive and additive to the overall platform, but we're confident that we're going to continue to see good activity there. It's just the predictability, and from a competitive standpoint, what we're going to face as we go deeper into the year.  As Tom has noted, what the balance sheet is more than well primed to continue to support our acquisition and development activity. And with that, we'll continue to seek out and find and pursue many different types of opportunities, whether they're portfolio related or on a one-off basis.  If you look at the $500-or-so million that we've got in our acquisition pipeline. As we speak, it's more oriented toward either one-off or smaller concentrations of assets. That's the consistent playbook that is always in our mix. And then what can be more unpredictable is just what can come through in the larger portfolios.  So we still think we're in very good shape to continue to pursue opportunities, but we'll see how that plays through as the year goes on. But very pleased by the amount of volume, certainly, that we've been able to capture not only in Q1, but going through 2020 as a whole and then, as I mentioned, off to a very good start this year. Yes. Obviously, you can't manufacture sales opportunities in and of itself. But we are very intentional on where we're putting priorities, where we're looking to either expand each area of the business based on the trends that we see, where we continue to see very strong advantage by enhanced scale. Looking at the ezStorage portfolio, as I mentioned, we already had a commanding size portfolio there. This made it even more attractive from a scale and presence standpoint. But we're also out looking to increase our presence in other markets as well. We recently went into Boise, Idaho. We've never been in Boise before.  We were able to capture a very nice 6-asset portfolio in that market. So we're looking deep in the markets that we've been in traditionally, and we're looking at markets that we see good growth opportunities as well. That's an ongoing evaluation that we do, Todd. I wouldn't point you to any specific area and/or type of asset or portfolio that we own, I would say, is a candidate to look for disposition at the -- at this point, but it's something that we continue to evaluate. And if circumstances and our own perspective has changed, we think that's beneficial. We'll certainly execute on that for it, too. But nothing to speak to on that. Sure. Thanks, Smedes. The ONE thing I'd highlight is we think it was above and beyond AutoPay change as we moved into April. Our AutoPay was pretty consistent through the months of February, March, April, May last year, but we saw a significant acceleration in payment patterns at the onset of the pandemic. So I wouldn't point to AutoPay specifically.  That said, AutoPay has been trending higher over the last several years, and we expect it to continue to, given our e-rental platform, which now comprises about half of our move-in volumes today and that auto enrolls folks into AutoPay if they elect that move-in method.  And so we do anticipate that AutoPay will increase. But it's not really the main driver of what we've seen on customer payment patterns. I think that's more consumer balance sheets being excellent and some of the operational processes we put around and at the time of the pandemic. AutoPay is certainly one of the things we look at from a customer composition standpoint. People that select AutoPay have a certain characteristic associated with them, both demographics and psychographics and the like. And so it's not necessarily selecting AutoPay that makes them be a customer of a certain type. It's the folks that generally select AutoPay tend to have certain characteristics, but that's something we watch very closely as we look to understand our customer. Yes. Thanks, Smedes. That's a great question. We've been talking about pricing restrictions through the pandemic, but many of those restrictions have started to fade away which is encouraging. So as we think about it on a year-over-year basis, 2021 is a better pricing regulatory environment than 2020 was. The one big notable state of emergency pricing restriction that's in place, and it has been for the last several years now is in Los Angeles County and several other counties here in California related to fires that have taken place over the last several years.  So Los Angeles is our largest market. And we've been restricted on pricing because of Section 396 in California since the fall of 2018. So that remains in place. It's not scheduled to expire until December 31. So it doesn't factor into our guidance per se, but it remains a headwind in Los Angeles. And you can see Los Angeles is doing quite well, but it's certainly not seeing the same level of revenue growth that we are in some of our other markets, given some of the pricing restrictions there. Well, we have certainly the bandwidth and the knowledge of thinking outside borders. We've talked about this historically relative to our very strong and, I would say, deep knowledge base that came from the platform in Europe. Obviously, that's Shurgard and the things that we've taken away and learned from portfolio like that and how it's grown over time and how it's been able to do quite well throughout the Western European markets. So the skill set is resident here in the company. We continue to track a number of different markets outside U.S. borders and when certain opportunities present themselves and/or we think it's an appropriate opportunity for us to expand outside, we're well suited to do so. That's something that we're watching closely. Development nationally peaked in 2019 were plus or minus about $5 billion of new assets were developed and delivered. It tapered down in 2020 by about 15% or so. In 2021, we're predicting another leg down in that 10% to 15% range again. Going into 2022, it's always a little bit more cloudy to figure out what could play through. We do think that this, however, has been a very good cycle for us to continue to find and source land sites with less competitive activity out there. Our development team is very busy sourcing those kinds of opportunities.  So it's been a good window for us actually to jump in and look for land sites, either that have or have not been through different levels of entitlements. And we're going to continue to look for and extract very good value from our development activities, where we typically are able to drive the highest return on invested capital through the investment that we put into development and/or redevelopment.  So we're uniquely positioned to do so. As I mentioned, we have the only development platform in the public arena, and by far, we have the biggest development team in the self-storage industry. It's national. We're deep, great relationships, just like we're able to tap into on the acquisition front. And we'll continue to monitor and see what kind of continued activity play through from the development activity that's going on right down to individual submarkets and then nationally as well. So yes, Tom and I can kind of toggle and answer your questions. But I would say internally, we definitely do see the opportunity around maturing generational demand. There's been a consistent and confidently, we're optimistic about the type of demand factors that are now playing through in, again, the newer generation users, many of whom are actually coming to use storage for the exact same reasons, their predecessors did. So life events in general, needing more space, cost of housing, working from home in this particular environment, all the things that play through relative to changes in family dynamics, et cetera, are very powerful to the use case and continued adoption and absorption of self-storage nationally.  The Self Storage Association tracks this on an annual basis, and it has continued to grow over time, and we're confident it will do just that. And then on the external side, there's a good population of quality assets, many of which have been delivered, say, over the last 4 or 5 years, in particular, by individual developers that we've been able to tap.  We haven't been shy about buying assets that are less than stabilized. Our average occupancy of the assets that we have under contract, for instance, right now is about 50%. So there's a good pool of assets out there that are far from stabilization that have been good opportunities for us to go out and acquire.  We're still buying stabilized assets as well. But there's a healthy amount of inventory from a group of developers that have come into the self-storage sector for the first time weren't intending necessarily to be here for the long haul. And that has elevated our opportunity set to go out and acquire and be confident about our external growth, knowing that, that inventory level is quite strong, and the quality is quite good, too, in many cases.  Tom, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? If your predictions for home price appreciation and rent growth play out, storage is definitely linked to that as a space substitute for consumers. So all nice contributors to potential rent growth over time. It's definitely something we're watching, Ki Bin. It's something, however, that hasn't, in any way, elevated to a noted change or a reversion to what may have been more normal in prior periods. If you look at Florida or Texas, for instance, I would say, two markets that have been on the early side of \"opening back up,\" we're actually seeing some of our healthiest demand drivers in those 2 states as we speak.  So even as either consumers or businesses are coming back into some level of normality, demand is still very good. In fact, if anything, it's percolating higher than it was on the early side of the pandemic. So it's a validation that there are other additive drivers that are going on, whether it's with the economy at large, home sales, in migration, all the other factors that can drive overall demand for storage.  And we've really seen no evidence yet that there's any change that would point to the fact that there's something reversing or that we're going to see any near-term anyway, something that would shift strongly that has, on the opposite side, been very additive to overall business metrics.  So we're watching closely right down to a submarket basis. But if you even take a look at Texas as a whole, whether it's Houston, Austin, Dallas, San Antonio, very good activity in all 4 cities. And we've got big presence in each and every 1 of them, going to South Florida, for instance, whether it's Miami or Tampa, again, very, very strong drivers there, too.  So we're tracking and keeping an eye on it, but it's a validation that the business is not only quite resilient, but it's -- from a product standpoint, consumers and businesses are looking for storage very actively right now. Sure. Happy to, Ki Bin. And we'll go into some of our CapEx plans on Monday as well. But I think if taking a step back the $250 million to $300 million that we disclosed for the year, it's higher than it has been in previous years, and it's really been driven by incremental activity tied to our Property of Tomorrow program and the acceleration of that program after we had slowed it down through the pandemic.  So if you think about the $250 million to $300 million, the building blocks there, about $75 million or so of regular maintenance CapEx, an additional, call it, $50 million to $60 million in solar and LED investments and then, call it, $120 million plus in Property of Tomorrow as we seek to accelerate that program and run it through our portfolio. The one component that we're watching closely is steel cost, for instance. So there's been some volatility there and some price increases that we're keeping track of. Market to market, there could be some impacts from a labor standpoint.  So it's fluid. It can be erratic in some cases and unpredictable as well. So it's definitely something that we're keeping a close eye on. I wouldn't say it's become some kind of an overarching headwind for somebody to either stop a potential development project or actually delay 1 indefinitely, but we'll see how those costs trend over time. But the 1 area that we're looking at more specifically right now is just steel costs. Yes. Again, the amount of occupancy roughly in the $500 million or so that's in our unclosed pipeline of acquisitions hovers around 50% or so. So it's a combination of assets, some of which are just coming to the market. So a few assets that we're going to take very low levels of occupancy to others that are much higher and I would call them more stabilized. But it's a range. As I noted, we have not been shy about bringing those kinds of assets into the portfolio. Frankly, we need more space to lease-up. So it's been a good opportunity for us to pull those assets into the portfolio, put them into our operating platform, and we're seeing very good and, I would say, better-than-expected performance based on the environment that we're dealing with.  So we're looking for and finding good quality there and aren't hesitant to buy assets that have the lease-up that maybe others are not as comfortable with. So we're seeing good opportunity set there, and we'll continue to hunt for those kinds of assets. Yes, Mike, we're vetting both. We're not seeing really any material degradation in urban versus suburban demand factors. So the team is out hunting for sites that have the right dynamics from a competitive standpoint, meaning finding land sites that were much more benefited by having less competition.  The amount of demographic analysis that we do, overall ability to predict and see good demand factors over time based on any particular new development. So it hasn't really turned anything, I would call, from a segmentation standpoint that we would be hesitant to go into urban versus suburban or prioritize 1 over the other.  Frankly, we have a good and healthy mix of both as it stands. And based on -- even in this environment, the kind of trends and the overall demand factors, we're confident that both types of environments are very good for our business, so long as we understand the ultimate dynamics that go right down to that specific trade area. We've got great data. We've got the ability to vet those sites very quickly. And as I mentioned, we're seeing some pretty interesting opportunities around land sites with less competition."

            "name": "Thomas Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. I'll start with financial performance. Our financial performance has improved steadily through the second half of 2020 into the first quarter of 2021. In the same-store, our revenue increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020, which represents a sequential improvement in growth of 2.6% from the fourth quarter.  There were two primary factors contributing to that improvement. First and foremost, move-in rates were up double digits, while move-out rates were roughly flat year-over-year, leading to improving in-place rents. Secondly, occupancy also increased through the quarter with move-in volume down but move-out volume also lower. Now on to expenses. The team did a great job driving same-store cost of operations down in the first quarter. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property tax specifically, we will expense our estimate ratably through the year, leading to a benefit in the first 3 quarters and reversing to a headwind in the fourth quarter.  This will lead to more stable quarter-over-quarter property tax in the future. The benefit this quarter was worth $0.05 of FFO. Some of the technology and operating model evolution we'll discuss on Monday at our Investor Day, showed up in our first quarter numbers, with property payroll down 13% in the quarter, given efficiency improvements. We look forward to sharing more on Monday.  For the first time, we included 2021 core FFO guidance in our earnings release and supplement. In conjunction with the line-by-line commentary in our supplemental, it's a guide to our outlook and the key drivers of our business. And as we started 2021, we've seen continued strength, as Joe mentioned, in customer demand, with occupancies up 260 basis points and in-place contract rent per occupied square foot turning into positive year-over-year territory in January.  We anticipate same-store revenue to grow from 4% to 5.5% in 2021. That outlook is supported by good customer demand and moderating supply. That said, we do see risk to move-outs going higher as we move through the year comping against what was really extraordinary existing tenant performance in 2020.  Our current expectations are for occupancy to be down 100 basis points plus in the fourth quarter compared to 2020. We expect continued strong expense control in the same-store in 2021. Our expectations are for 1% to 2% same-store expense growth. Property tax expense growth will pick up this year with our expectations around a 5% increase for the year, again, recognized ratably through the year.  Our guidance includes the acceleration of our external growth initiatives with ezStorage and will add to FFO growth through our non same-store portfolio this year and next. In total, our outlook is for core FFO per share of $11.35 to $11.75 for 2021.  I'll now shift gears to the balance sheet. As Joe mentioned, we used our growth-oriented balance sheet to fund the purchase of ezStorage entering the bond market the day after announcement and having fully funded the transaction within 2 days. The offering comprised of 3, 7 and 10 year tranches with a weighted average cost of about 1.6%.  After effect of the transaction, we have the longest duration balance sheet in the REIT industry with 1 of the lowest cost profiles. And we remain in a great position to continue to use the balance sheet to fund our growth initiatives, and we'll share more at our Investor Day on Monday. With that, I'll turn it over to Angela to open the line up for questions. Yes, sure, Juan. There's a lot there to unpack. So let me pace through that. Starting with the last one first, which is fees. So that has been a drag in each of the quarters since the onset of the pandemic. And so you started to see that really take hold in the second quarter of last year. And so we will have lapped that comp.  We do anticipate, as Joe mentioned, continued strong payment activity. So we don't think that those fee collections will -- those fees will be charged or collected for the remainder of the year, but we won't be comping against the previous year where we had been collecting them.  So that should go away from a comp standpoint in the next 3 quarters. In terms of cadence through the year, I mentioned the occupancy point in the fourth quarter in our base case. And I think that, that is really driven, as Joe mentioned, by typical seasonality as we get into the second part of the year. We'd anticipate that as the economy starts to open up, we see more governors talking about getting back to normal through the summer period and employers encouraging folks to get back into the office as we move through the summer and into the fall. We would anticipate a more seasonal pattern to reemerge and occupancies to fall like they do in any typical year as we move into the third and fourth quarter. In terms of any other items I'd highlight as we talked about last year, one of the drivers of the drop in in-place rents last second quarter, in particular, was the fact that we had paused on our existing tenant rate increase program. And as Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are executing on that plan throughout the year this year. So we will have easy comps from an existing tenant rate increase program standpoint in the second quarter. But then we did resume those last year in the third and fourth. Yes. Well, we continue to see very strong demand trends, as Joe mentioned earlier. The move-in rates in the first quarter were up nearly 16% year-over-year, and those were comping pre pandemic 2020. As we moved into April, we obviously are now comping the onset of the pandemic last year where we did see reduced customer demand and lower move-in rates. So move-in rates year-over-year through April are up 40% plus. And I think the most encouraging thing is we start to look at a typical seasonal pattern. We're looking at 2019 as a benchmark, and our April move-in rents are up double digits versus April 2019 as well, indicating that continued positive trajectory of rents and good performance there. So we continue to be encouraged by customer demand. And frankly, we have limited inventory within the same-store pool. So rates are going higher. No, no. I think you covered it well. And I'd highlight we'll be spending more time on these topics on Monday for our Investor Day in some more detail. Yes, sure. So we weren't able to get into the bond market pretty quickly post the ezStorage transaction for the $2 billion. And as Joe mentioned, we continue to see good opportunities for acquisition volumes. And as you're highlighting with sources and uses, if those volumes continue to percolate, we'd anticipate we'll likely access the bond market in the second half of the year, and that's embedded into the interest expense guidance that we released yesterday afternoon. Well, the duration of those and the features of them are quite different. And so as we look at preferred costs around 4%, certainly, the 3-year bond that we did about 0.75%, very different in cost, but also very different in profile. And so we'll talk more about balance sheet strategy on Monday, but we continue to like preferred stock as a cornerstone of the capital structure, but we've been adding lower cost and shorter-dated duration to spread the maturity profile out over time and diversify our sources of financing. Sure. So Property of Tomorrow, and we'll go into some detail on this on Monday. We see continuing over the next several years as we roll that through the rest of the portfolio. And then we have a good runway, particularly on solar. LED, we're moving through the portfolio pretty quickly through last year and this year on an interior basis. In the prior 3 years, we were doing exterior LED. So we've got some more LED activity maybe for the next year or 2, but then that will really subside. But solar we see the opportunity to put that on half or more of our portfolio over time, and we're just scratching the surface there."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Chelsea. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. I\u2019m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, February 22, 2022 (sic) [2023], and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that may become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, subsequent reports, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, after that, feel free to jump back in queue with additional questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m going to begin by providing color on two recent announcements. We\u2019ll then move on to our performance in 2022 and outlook for 2023. First, on February 5th, we announced a 50% increase to our quarterly common dividend, a raise from $8 to $12 per share on an annualized basis. It is a result of a great effort by the team that has produced record performance over the last few years and a validation of our ongoing confidence in the strength of our platform. Second, as announced separately, we made a proposal to acquire Life Storage at a substantial premium after several attempts to engage in negotiations privately. I\u2019d like to highlight a few important reasons why we think this combination is poised to unlock superior growth and value creation for shareholders. First, there is significant opportunity to accelerate growth and profitability as Life Storage\u2019s portfolio benefits from Public Storage\u2019s industry-leading brand. Our platform achieves approximately 80% same-store operating margins compared to Life Storage\u2019s margins at approximately 73%. And we see an opportunity to narrow that gap with their real estate assets as part of our industry-leading platform. Second, we believe there is significant upside to grow revenues and earnings in our respective ancillary business lines, including storage insurance, third-party property management, business customer offerings and lending. Third, we see expanded portfolio growth opportunities as we leverage Public Storage\u2019s fully integrated in-house development team, the only one of its kind in the industry, to capitalize on additional development and redevelopment opportunities to enhance Life Storage\u2019s existing portfolio. And finally, all of this will be supported by an industry-leading balance sheet with low pro forma leverage, an advantaged cost of capital and significant capacity to fund future growth in conjunction with retained cash flow. Since announcing the proposal, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both companies\u2019 shareholders who clearly recognize the significant benefits uniquely achievable through a combination with Public Storage. As you likely saw, on February 16th, Life Storage issued its own press release rejecting our proposal. Nothing in that response changed our thinking. We have a high level of conviction in the strategic and financial merits, and we are committed to pursuing a potential combination. We are encouraged, in that February 16th release, Life Storage indicated openness to opportunities to enhance shareholder value. We look forward to engaging in good faith discussions regarding a mutually agreeable combination. While we appreciate that analysts and shareholders have ongoing questions with respect to our proposal, the purposes of today\u2019s call is to discuss our fourth quarter earnings and our outlook for 2023. As such, we will not be addressing questions related to the proposal at this time. Now, turning to our performance and outlook. 2022 was a year of milestones for Public Storage, including celebrating our 50th anniversary. The team and platform achieved record results in our same-store and non-same-store portfolios, elevating the customer experience through technology and operating model transformation, enhancing our properties through the Property of Tomorrow program and growing the portfolio through acquisitions, development and redevelopment and third-party management. We did all of this while maintaining the industry\u2019s best balance sheet, which is poised to fund growth moving forward in conjunction with significant retained cash flow. To name just a few of our collective accomplishments, we achieved an 80% stabilized direct NOI margin through the combination of revenue generation and expense efficiency that only Public Storage is capable of. We grew beyond 200 million owned square feet and $4 billion in total revenues. We built our property development pipeline to approximately $1 billion. We received the prestigious Great Place to Work award based on feedback provided directly by our employees. And we achieved top-scoring U.S. self-storage REITs across the leading sustainability benchmarks. We are firing on all cylinders while strengthening the already formidable competitive advantages we have across our business. And those competitive advantages are heightened in the type of macro environment we are in today on top of two consecutive years of record 20%-plus core FFO growth. Simply put, we have the people, technologies, platforms and brand which lead us to a position of strength in 2023. Demand for self-storage remains strong, as you see with our move-in volume up more than 11% during the quarter. The aspects of the business that have historically made it resilient are on display. This is a needs-based business with demand drivers that are multidimensional and fluid throughout economic cycles. We also continue to benefit from a newer driver in the form of people spending more time at home, which has increasing permanence with remote and hybrid work here to stay. Our customer lengths of stay are at record levels, a positive trend, given rent increases to existing customers are a key driver to our revenue growth. The outlook for new competitive supply is also in our favor. We are seeing less new property development nationally due to higher interest rates, cost pressures, difficult municipal processes and concern over the macro landscape. With continuing strong demand, less pressure from new supply and our numerous competitive advantages, we are very well positioned in 2023. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. I\u2019ll start with a review of capital allocation for the year. We invested $1 billion between acquisitions and developments in 2022, including the $190 million Neighborhood Florida portfolio in the fourth quarter. That portfolio added to our over 400 properties that we\u2019re operating with our remote property management platforms. Overall, the 2022 acquisition environment was impacted by a shift of cost of capital with transaction volumes down and driven by smaller deals compared to 2021. We expect that trend to continue this year with our forecast for $750 million of transaction volume for Public Storage consistent with last year. We are well positioned as an acquirer today, given our industry-leading balance sheet and cost of capital. And adding to acquisitions, our development pipeline stands at approximately $1 billion as we seek to expand the portfolio with our in-house team. The development environment is challenging today across the industry, as Joe highlighted. Against that backdrop, Public Storage is planning on delivering $375 million of new generation 5 properties in 2023 and more in 2024, as we lean on our development competitive advantages. And we look forward to putting these new properties on our national platform to drive outperformance. Now, on the financial performance. We finished the year strong, reporting core FFO of $4.16 for the quarter and $15.92 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range and representing 22.4% growth over the fourth quarter of 2021, excluding the contribution of PS Business Parks. Let\u2019s look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 13% compared to the fourth quarter of \u201821. That performance represents a moderation from last quarter\u2019s 14.7% growth and a return to seasonality and tough comps comparing to 2021. Now on expenses, same-store direct costs of operations were up 5.3%. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 15.8% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout, growing 51% compared to last year. Now, I\u2019ll shift to the outlook. We introduced 2023 core FFO guidance with a $16.45 midpoint, representing 5.5% growth from 2022, again excluding the contribution of PS Business Parks. As we enter the year, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s a wide range of potential macroeconomic pathways that will influence customer demand and behavior. The consumer has held up well to this point in the year, but the Fed is certainly signaling they\u2019re not finished. If we look at the same-store revenue outlook, I\u2019d characterize the low end of the range of the outlook as a recessionary pathway and the higher end as a softer landing for the economy. We anticipate occupancy will be lower throughout the year and follow a typical seasonal pattern. Rate will be the driver of revenue growth with the moderation through the year based on lower move-in rents and tougher existing tenant rate increase comps. That moderation results in a trending towards longer-term averages of growth. Our expectations are for 5.75% same-store expense growth, driven primarily by property tax and marketing expense. That leads to same-store NOI growth at the midpoint of 3.2%. Our non-same-store acquisition and development properties are again poised to be a strong contributor, growing from $448 million of NOI contribution in 2022 to $520 million at the midpoint. And looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, the incremental non-same-store NOI to stabilization from those properties acquired or completed at December 31st is an additional $80 million of NOI. This pool of lease-up assets will continue to be a powerful growth engine over the next several years. Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remain rock solid. We have a well-laddered long-term debt profile with limited floating rate exposure and over $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions. Our leverage of 3.4 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA combined with nearly $800 million of cash on hand at quarter end puts us in a very strong position, heading into 2023. So with that, I\u2019d like to open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning, out there. I guess maybe, Tom, for you, as you thought about setting guidance for this year, I can appreciate a number of the different components that you laid out, and there\u2019s kind of a wide range there. But I guess which components do you feel like have the most potential upside and downside risk, I guess, both on the revenue side and on the expense side where you could come back and be positively surprised or negatively surprised?\nTom Boyle: Sure. That\u2019s a good question, Steve. So, I want to make a couple of comments here. One, I\u2019d like to comment a little bit around how the year has started, which is pretty consistent trends with what we saw through the fourth quarter. So move-in, move-out trends pretty consistent. We\u2019ve seen move-in volumes up circa 10%, move-in rates that have been down mid-single digits. So consistent with that, we call it, 5% plus or minus that we saw in the fourth quarter. So, we\u2019re seeing continued good demand for storage through the first part of the year. But I do think in response to your question, I\u2019d like to break the year of 2023 into two halves. The first half, as we think about it, consistent trends as we\u2019ve seen through the fourth quarter into the first but facing really tough comps as we move through the first part of the year. And that\u2019s going to lead to some of the moderation I spoke to. The second -- but ultimately, with higher levels of absolute revenue growth, given we\u2019re starting the year from a position of strength. But if you think about the second part of the year, there\u2019s a couple of things to highlight. One, the comps will be easier in the second half of the year, given we\u2019ll be comping against a more seasonal end of 2021 -- or 2022, rather. But the flip side is the macro uncertainty is significantly higher. And so, as you think about the pathways that I described for the outlook, at the lower end, a recessionary pathway that we highlighted in some of our disclosures, that recessionary pathway likely leads to negative year-over-year revenue growth as you would be typical to see in a recession. But towards the higher end, certainly, that would lead to positive growth and easier comps and could result in better revenue growth performance as we move through the second half. And I\u2019d say, as we think about the year, the second half has much more uncertainty towards it than the first half does.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then second question, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s for you or for Joe, but just as you think about capital deployment, you still have $1 billion of development but you mentioned that doing new deals is challenging. Just help us understand kind of where you think acquisition yields are in relation to new development yields. Kind of where does that spread stand today? And how do you think that might trend over the next kind of one to two years?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Steve. There certainly is a continuing trend that played through in 2022 that we think still applies to 2023. First of all, on the acquisition side, likely to be lower volumes of transaction activity. Certainly, we\u2019re seeing that by virtue of how the year started off. It\u2019s not a typical year in and year out where the first quarter or so might be on the light side. That\u2019s definitely the case as we speak. So, we\u2019re looking for and evaluating the trends tied to impacts from higher cost of capital, limited availability of capital, again, how sellers are looking at this environment to transact assets. Typically, more stabilized assets are going to command stronger cap rates. I\u2019d tell you today compared to maybe where we were a year ago, cap rates are still up in that 100, 125 basis-point range where stabilized assets might have a 5 handle on them, whether it\u2019s low, mid or high-5, cap rate\u2019s going to depend on location, quality of the asset, et cetera. And then, depending on this stabilized level of the asset, there\u2019s going to be more flexibility in the cap rate. And you\u2019re going to see different pricing mechanisms tied to those types of assets. Our focus, as it has been to actually look for those kinds of assets because that\u2019s where we see the higher value creation. That certainly played through the acquisition volume that we captured that Tom talked about, in 2022. So we\u2019re still out hunting for good quality assets. Our backlog right now between closed and under contract\u2019s approximately $70 million. But frankly, the market is a little slow right now, so we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s not unusual for though the market to start picking up toward the summer months so we\u2019ll see again how that plays through on that set of opportunities. Now, on the flip side, from a development standpoint, as you mentioned, yes, our pipeline continues to be quite robust. It\u2019s more difficult to do development not any different than what we\u2019ve been talking about for the last year or two. Our team is working hard to extract prime land sites. We\u2019re actually finding some very good opportunities there. But frankly, we\u2019ve got skills and abilities that our competitors in the private world particularly do not have. And with that, we\u2019ve been able to extract prime sites, good opportunities to actually get the types of returns that we\u2019ve been speaking to for the last couple of years, where we\u2019re expecting plus or minus 8% or north cash-on-cash yields on these investments. So, we\u2019re very encouraged by our own pipeline. We\u2019re encouraged, as Tom mentioned, relative to the lease-up and the contribution those types of assets have to our overall revenue and NOI performance. And our non-same-store portfolio continues to be very vibrant. So, we\u2019re very encouraged that we\u2019ve got the right skills and the fortitude and the ability to look long term through what could be still a very challenging development cycle, which frankly, is a good thing. It gives us more ability to actually go out and capture, as I mentioned, those great land sites, put our Gen 5 properties into a variety of different markets. And nationally, we\u2019ve got good opportunities across the spectrum, so we\u2019re going to continue to focus on that as we speak.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: On the guidance, you said the low end of the range is for a recession scenario while the high end\u2019s a soft landing. Do you see a 50% probability of a soft landing, you end up at the high end, and a 50% probability of a recession, you end up at the low end, or is it more 75-25 or another combination? I\u2019m trying to understand the likelihood of where you see yourself ending up within that range at this time.\nTom Boyle: Sure. Good question, Michael. So, I think there\u2019s a couple of things there. The first is we wanted to provide a range that encapsulated multiple pathways because we know everyone on this call probably has their own point of view as to what percentage probability a recessionary pathway is or a soft landing is. And so, we thought it was appropriate to provide that wide range, and obviously, investors can make their own perspective. As we look at it, we look at the potential outcomes as relatively balanced within that range, but we don\u2019t obviously know what the Fed is going to do and how the consumer is going to react. 3 or 4 weeks ago, interest rates were lower. There was talk of a no landing over those 3 weeks. We\u2019ve gone back to the fact that maybe that no landing is off the table. So, I think that\u2019s going to ebb and flow as we go through the year. And our objective was to provide investors and analysts a framework to understand what could play out through the year according to those macro pathways.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And then, on ECRIs this year, pre-pandemic, you were sending increases of 8% to 10%, let\u2019s say, every 12 months. And over the past 1.5-year, you\u2019ve been sending maybe mid-teens, high teens increases every 9 months or so. So for the upcoming year -- and included in your guidance, can you help quantify the expected rate and frequency of ECRIs over the year? Obviously, it\u2019s going to change depending on the different scenarios. But maybe if you can talk about what the plan is and just kind of maybe how the top-of-funnel traffic looks right now because this is going to play a role in your ability to pass along the ECRIs this year? Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Sure. Thanks, Michael. So, to talk specifically about the existing tenant rate increase program, and then I\u2019ll hit around the top-of-funnel demand as well. We\u2019ve consistently spoken about our existing tenant rate increase program is really two components. The first is how is the consumer reacting to increases? How are they performing and behaving? And we\u2019ve noted in the past and I would reiterate today that the consumer continues to perform at expectations and the sensitivity is largely in line with expectations. And so, there\u2019s no real change to the thought process around that program on that side. But the second component is the cost to replace that tenant when they leave. And there\u2019s no question that that\u2019s changed quite a bit over the last several years. You had markets like Miami where rents were up 25%, 30% and there was no cost to replace. There was, in fact, a benefit to replace a potentially in-place tenant. And so that started to shift as we moved through \u201822 and into \u201823. And that impact will result in lower magnitude and lower frequency increases but still to optimize revenue from that pool of existing tenants and new tenants that come in. Then the second part of your question around how is top-of-funnel demand performing, I think, is an important one, because as Joe mentioned, move-in volumes through the fourth quarter were up nearly 12%. Move-in volumes through the part of this year are up double digits as well. And so, we\u2019re seeing good demand from new customers coming into the system. Now, we\u2019re spending a little bit more on advertising. Our rates are a little bit lower. There\u2019s a little bit more promotional discounts in order to achieve that. But ultimately, the customers are very willing and looking forward to storage spaces to move into. And that\u2019s enabling us to capture those tenants, which I think is where you were going with the question. Those tenants will be good long-term tenants or a portion of them will as they move through 2023 as well.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in 2023.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: I guess I\u2019d like to -- I\u2019m going to push a little bit on the guidance here. I totally understand, given the macro picture here and lack of clarity, first half, second half. Let\u2019s focus on, I guess, peak leasing season. When does that really start? And what -- if we\u2019re through, let\u2019s just say, June, July, like is that the bulk of it? Because again, my understanding is that I think there\u2019s even a lag to any recession where it hits storage. So I\u2019m just trying to get a picture of like how this could shake out, play out through the most important months, your peak leasing season.\nTom Boyle: Yes. I think to answer the question directly, we typically see the peak leasing season really start in April, pick up in May in a really big way and then, then into June and July. So to your point, it\u2019s not very far away. And we\u2019re already seeing some of the seasonal patterns that you would anticipate in some of our markets, right? The more seasonal markets are already starting to see a pickup in our occupancy as we sit here in February compared to the end of the year, for instance. And so that typical seasonal pattern is starting to play out, which is encouraging. And I think where you may be going is, there\u2019s certainly a chance that if there is a recession that comes, it\u2019s later in the year and not earlier in the year. And that certainly would impact the financial performance of the sector through the year. And obviously, if it\u2019s a good busy season, that has a very positive impact on overall financial performance and operational performance of the business.\nJeff Spector: Thanks Tom. Does that then, I mean, change or alter any strategy during the peak leasing months to grab more customers? Like, how do you operate, given this uncertainty? Again, things seem rock solid right now but preparing potentially for, let\u2019s say, a weaker fall or winter months or potentially into \u201824.\nTom Boyle: Yes. I\u2019d say, we\u2019re constantly looking to dynamically manage the current environment. And as we just noted, it\u2019s hard to know exactly where we\u2019ll be sitting next year at this time. But we\u2019ll be planning week by week and day by day through our operational team to react to what we\u2019re seeing and ultimately maximizing our own performance and serving our customers well through a busy time period in the summer when there\u2019s typically strong demand for our storage space.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO.\nJuan Sanabria: Just looking to further the discussions on the same-store revenue guidance. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you expect within the range the fourth quarter exit run rate to be. And if I think about last year, you guys really called it like you saw it. You were well ahead of the peers in the initial guidance set. And relative to some of the maybe more tried and true, kind of being a little bit more conservative and planning to be in raise game. Are you guys changing it up, or are you really trying to call it like you see at this time with the full acknowledgment that the uncertainty is much greater this year?\nTom Boyle: Well, there\u2019s a whole host of questions in there, Juan. So, let me try to take a few of them at a time here. So I think the first part of the question is around the second half and talking a little bit more about the second half and maybe even, you\u2019re trying to tease out from me 2024 guidance. But I think the -- I do think the characterization...\nJuan Sanabria: Just fourth quarter.\nTom Boyle: Yes, just fourth quarter, right. So, I\u2019ll go back to the first half, second half comment, which is the first half and the tougher comps that we\u2019re going to experience is going to lead to some moderation as we face those comps through the first half, which will lower the absolute level of growth as we go through the first half. And then, the second half, to the points I made earlier, really will depend on the busy season performance, like Jeff was just speaking to, and the macroeconomic environment and how the consumer is impacted by what the Fed is likely to do and the excess savings that the consumers have for a period of time and how quickly they burn through that excess savings, et cetera. And I think as we looked at that and modeled different consumer behavior through the year, there\u2019s a number of different moving pieces there, right? One is new storage demand, the other is existing tenant performance, rate sensitivity, delinquency, all of those things. And if you look at a typical recessionary environment, what you\u2019d find is weakness really across the board in those metrics, which is what\u2019s led to negative year-over-year revenue performance and recessions in the past. So, in that recessionary pathway we\u2019ve spoken to, we would expect that there is negative year-over-year revenue declines, like we\u2019ve seen in prior recessions. But you will have the benefit of easier comps in the second half, which will help offset some of that potential weakness. On the flip side, right, we\u2019re just talking about, well, is the recession, when does it come? How deep is it? All those sorts of things, which we can sit here and prognosticate on, but ultimately, we\u2019re going to find out over the next 6 to 12 months. If the consumer is stronger, if the labor market holds up more effectively, if the Fed doesn\u2019t push the labor market as tough, there could certainly be a situation where there\u2019s pretty healthy positive growth in the second half because of that strength of the U.S. consumer and the fact that we\u2019ll be having easier comps in the second half. And so, I think that\u2019s our sense of the range of potential outcomes, and I hope that\u2019s responsive to your question. And then, as it relates to exactly how we\u2019ll exit, I think it will depend on how that second half moves forward.\nJuan Sanabria: That\u2019s right. And then, just on expenses, curious if you could just give a little bit more color or numbers around the major food group\u2019s property taxes, marketing, et cetera, that I know you called out a little bit in your prepared remarks but hoping to flesh that a little bit more.\nTom Boyle: Yes, sure. So specifically within the same-store operating expenses, our largest operating expense line item is property taxes. We ended the year 2022 with property taxes with a 4-handle percent growth on them. We continue to expect that that\u2019s likely to be a higher growth rate as we move into the coming years, given the NOI growth that we\u2019ve seen in the sector over the past several years. So, we\u2019re expecting something like 5% to 6% growth there, and obviously, we\u2019ll update as we move through the year. That\u2019s certainly the biggest driver of operating expense growth. The others are smaller. The second one I highlighted in my prepared remarks was marketing. So, you saw, in the fourth quarter, we increased marketing expense. That was to drive further top-of-funnel demand into the system, and we saw very good returns associated with that, really comping against a period in 2021 when there was very little spending in most of our markets. So, the percentage growth looks elevated against really low comps. So marketing expense is likely to be another one, because in the first part of this year, we\u2019re facing those similar really low comps. Some of the other line items that are facing inflationary pressures, again, the strength of the labor market today continues. There\u2019s wage pressure. But you could see even in the fourth quarter, we were able to mitigate some of those wage pressures, given the digital transformation and operating model transformation that we\u2019ve been working through over the past several years, which has led to efficiencies in staffing. So that will help mitigate. And then utilities is another one that we\u2019ve seen utility rates move higher, but we\u2019re looking to combat that with our investments in energy efficiency, be it our solar programs, which we\u2019re seeking to add about 300 properties with solar by the end of the year to bring our aggregate total to about 500 properties and with more room to go there in future years as well as our LED conversion helping to mitigate that. So, that\u2019s a high-level landscape of a number of the line items. Happy to go into any further detail if helpful.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: Tom, first question, I guess, back to the guidance. You mentioned that occupancy will likely be lower throughout the year. Was wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit more detail there around what you might expect at sort of the low and high end of the range relative to where you ended the year, so call it, down 250 basis points. Do you see that year-over-year spread widening or narrowing as you move throughout the year?\nTom Boyle: Well, let me talk about the first half first and then we can talk about the second half, which obviously, we\u2019ve spoken about, there\u2019s macro uncertainty that will influence that. But as you think about the first half, we\u2019re starting the year with occupancy down about 2.4%. And we do think the occupancy decline that we experienced in the back half of 2022 was a seasonal occupancy decline. In fact, the decline from June to December was a touch better than a typical seasonal decline. But inherent in that is that what we\u2019re seeing today is a pickup in occupancy in some of our seasonal markets. So, I would anticipate there\u2019s certainly the opportunity for that spread to narrow as we get into the busy season as we\u2019ve spoken to, but then would follow a typical seasonal pattern from there in the back half.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And when you talk about the seasonal markets where you\u2019re already starting to see some occupancy build, which markets are those?\nTom Boyle: Well, they typically tend to be colder weather markets, so your Miamis and your Los Angeles and San Diegos, you don\u2019t see that same seasonal pattern. But if you look at a Minneapolis or Chicago or the Northeast, you start to see that seasonal pattern be more pronounced.\nTodd Thomas: Okay, got it. And then just circling back to capital deployment and some of the comments that you made earlier around investments. When making acquisitions and some larger deals like you did in 2021, you\u2019ve talked about upside to the initial yields through margin improvements, the Company\u2019s scale and so forth. And I think sort of an extreme example, maybe not extreme, but I think one example during 2021 was the $1.5 billion All Storage deal, which I think was sort of a 2%, mid-2% cap rate going in with an expectation to substantially increase that at stabilization. I realize the environment is different today and all deals have different characteristics. But as you look at the current landscape and think about acquisitions, would you still be willing to tolerate initial dilution relative to your cost of capital early on, like you have in \u201821 or in prior cycles, or does the greater uncertainty today give you a little bit of pause around how you think about future growth and the spread to your cost of capital that you would be willing to invest at?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Todd. I mentioned what we\u2019ve been doing strategically now for the last three years or more is looking for opportunities with assets that do have that upside that you\u2019re speaking to. So, whether it\u2019s through some of the larger portfolios, All Storage included, we bought that portfolio at about 74% occupancy, had a nice lift really in a very short period of time relative to continued lease-up and stabilization of the revenue metrics, et cetera. And we\u2019ve done the exact same thing with one-off deals as well. So, that\u2019s something we\u2019re not going to be shy about doing, and it continues to be a very good playbook for us. When we\u2019ve got deep-seated knowledge market to market, which we do on the vast majority of deals that we acquire, we have an elevated level of confidence that once we put these assets into our own platform, you can see that extracted opportunity literally right out of the gate. You see the benefits as we\u2019ve been speaking to relative to our brand, our platform, our efficiencies that assist higher-margin, opportunities, et cetera. So, we\u2019re definitely looking for those kinds of assets and have not backed away from them at all. So, that has and will continue to be a very vibrant part of our capital allocation process.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Can you provide an update on the rent freeze that was put in place related to the California storms early in the year? Has this been lifted? And if not, is there any type of NOI headwinds contemplated in guidance?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So I think, Spenser, you\u2019re speaking to the storms that took place in early January out here in California. There was a state of emergency that was put in place that is expiring here in February. So, I think, as anticipated, there\u2019s going to continue to be one-off events like storms and rain in California, believe it or not that can lead to state of emergency and pricing restrictions. And we\u2019ll navigate those. As it relates to what\u2019s embedded into our guidance expectations, there\u2019s things like that that come in and come out of different markets. And so, we\u2019ll try to take a reasonable estimate as to what those could be through the year. But we\u2019re not underwriting any significant rental rate restrictions as we move through the year embedded in our outlook.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. And then you -- go ahead.\nTom Boyle: No, go ahead.\nSpenser Allaway: I was going to say, you guys have provided a lot of great commentary on guidance in general and specifically on move-in rates and volumes and how those are trending thus far in \u201823. But, are you guys able to comment on the recent magnitude of ECRI activity? And then, without providing specific line item guidance, is there any color you can provide on what\u2019s being contemplated in terms of ECRIs at both, the high and low end of guidance?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So, I\u2019d go back to my response around existing tenant rate increases earlier, which is that there\u2019s no question that in certain markets, we have a moderation in the magnitude and frequency that we\u2019ve sent them. And I highlighted Miami as an example where rents in Miami for new customers were up 25%, 30% each year for the past several years, and that\u2019s started to slow down as we anticipated. That market and others can\u2019t grow like that in perpetuity. But because of that, the magnitude and frequency of rental rate increases to existing customers is likely to moderate this year, and we\u2019ve already seen that at the start of the year. In terms of a band, I\u2019m not going to get into specifics around numbers or averages or whatnot, but there\u2019s a wide range of increases that we send to the tenant based on what we understand their sensitivity and the value they place in the unit as well as the cost to replace that tenant if they do choose to move out. And as we move through the year, that cost to replace a tenant could take different pathways along with the rest of the outlook. And so, in the stronger outlook, it\u2019s going to result in a stronger existing tenant rate increase, magnitude and frequency, and the weaker outlook for the tenants is going to have the opposite effect.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. A quick one first. Implicit in your 2023 guidance, what are you thinking for move-in rates?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Good question, Ki Bin. So certainly, we started the year, as I\u2019ve highlighted, with move-in rents that are below prior year, and we finished the fourth quarter in a similar territory. We are anticipating that we see rents lift as we move through the busy season months. As you\u2019d anticipate, as customer demand increases, inventory gets tighter as you get to that point in the year and that will lead to higher absolute rents. But as I noted, earlier around the comments around the second half, there\u2019s a lot of variability on what could play out. Obviously, if we\u2019re in a recessionary environment, we\u2019d anticipate that move-in rental rates are lower as we\u2019re looking to capture demand. In an environment where consumer demand remains strong, that\u2019s going to result in higher rental rates as we move through the year. And as I noted earlier, part of the story in the second half compared to the first is comps. Right? The comps are definitely tougher in the first half than they are in the second.\nKi Bin Kim: So maybe I should have rephrased it. So your move-in rents are down 5% as of 4Q. So, on a year-over-year basis, that\u2019s the way I\u2019m trying to understand the trend...\nTom Boyle: And that\u2019s what they are right now, too, Ki Bin. That\u2019s what they are right now as well.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And on your CapEx guidance of $450 million, obviously, this line item has grown over the past three years, and you do a great job of breaking out between maintenance CapEx, Property of Tomorrow and the solar LED. I\u2019m just curious if some components of this CapEx might have a return associated with it and if you can provide some color around that.\nJoe Russell: The energy efficiency investment definitely leads to good returns. And as Tom mentioned, we\u2019re combing the portfolio as we speak for solar opportunities in particular. We\u2019ve basically re-lit the entire portfolio to LED. We had good, again, returns from that investment. And as the additional stimulus has come through with recent legislation, there\u2019s even more motivation on our part to continue to look at multiple markets. Likely, we\u2019ll get into a very sizable percentage of the entire portfolio that will help solar, I think, over the next, say, three to five years. But at the onset here, as Tom mentioned, we\u2019ve got 300 to 400 properties that are near term, likely very good candidates for good, strong returns. Property of Tomorrow, we\u2019re lifting the aesthetics and the curb appeal and some of the functionality of the properties. It\u2019s a little harder to measure specific returns on that type of investment. We do see a higher elevated level of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, et cetera. And then clearly, the enhancement market to market we\u2019re seeing from just the brand awareness, now that we\u2019re at a point of over 55% to 60% of the portfolio has been rebranded to the Property of Tomorrow standard market by market, and we\u2019re seeing very good receptivity to that as well. So, a little harder to measure just on a pure economic basis but continue to see good results from that investment as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey. Just going back to the guidance. Maybe any more color on sort of the bad debt assumption for the same-store revenue at the middle and at the upper and lower end of the range? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: Ron, you\u2019re coming through kind of quiet, but I think what I heard was bad debt expectations that are embedded in the guidance outlook. Is that -- okay, good. So, I\u2019d characterize bad debt overall as being -- continue to be a good performance through the first part of this year and the back half of last year. We spoke a lot at the onset of the pandemic around how delinquency and bad debt really declined pretty dramatically. We\u2019re off those lows, but consumers continue to pay their bills and our delinquency remains a good bit below pre-pandemic levels. And so to speak to specifically the question on guidance and the ranges, in the recessionary pathway that we\u2019ve spent a good bit of time talking about this morning, we did increase the bad debt assumption associated with that as we would anticipate that we\u2019re likely to see bad debt increase through that pathway and the reversal towards the higher end.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then, my second one, you talked about sort of the macro assumptions in the guidance, which was super helpful. Just wondering, you guys are operating the business. Are there sort of any leading indicators that you would see in, first, maybe before sort of the macro turns, whether it\u2019s move-in volumes or whatever? Are there sort of leading indicators that you guys are tracking to sort of get a handle on this from the ground?\nJoe Russell: Yes. I mean, obviously, we\u2019re running a month-to-month lease business. We move in 80-plus-thousand customers on a monthly basis and we have a healthy amount of move-outs as well. So with that continuous flow of activity, we\u2019re constantly monitoring things like payment patterns to the degree of either change or what might be happening market to market relative to other macro events, et cetera. But, one of the more obvious metrics that we look at relative to just the stress of maybe the evolving nature of the economy at large is payment patterns. And as Tom just mentioned, those continue to be actually quite good. There\u2019s some elevated level of stress but it\u2019s, on a relative basis, still below what we saw pre pandemic. We\u2019re keeping a very close eye on it. We\u2019ve got new and different ways to actually track this now that so much of our business is tied to digital interaction with customers, et cetera. So, we\u2019ve got good tools to stay ahead of that and to guide us relative to whatever stress points might be evolving.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I just wanted to ask you if you have -- if you\u2019ve seen any changes kind of in the supply outlook and if you maybe just have any insight into kind of developers\u2019 ability to access capital these days.\nJoe Russell: Yes. Smedes, I mentioned that in my opening remarks. We\u2019ve had the benefit nationally where deliveries have been somewhat static for the last two years, and we\u2019re looking at 2023 in very similar fashion relative to likely not an elevated uptick in overall deliveries. That ties to the amount of complication from a cost standpoint. There\u2019s more risk with many of the unknowns coming into the economy. And the complication is tied to just getting approvals as you go through step-by-step development processes. So, the overall supply picture is actually very good, meaning we\u2019re not seeing a rush to new development. Our lens through our third-party development platform gives us a little bit more validation of that as well where the majority of those opportunities are tied to development. And we\u2019re keeping even a closer eye on that beyond what our day-to-day development team and our real estate team is seeing as we\u2019re out either acquiring or looking for development opportunities. So hopefully, fingers crossed, we\u2019re going to continue to see that amount of deliveries through 2023 and going forward, again either in the same range or it could actually be a slightly downtick, but we\u2019ll continue to track that.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then I\u2019m just wondering sort of big picture, when you just look back over your long history at other periods of economic weakness and recessions, so maybe as we potentially head into one now, are there like kind of two or three things that you would -- you might do differently from a strategic perspective of what you had done in prior recessions, like either on the occupancy or the pricing front, or are there maybe more people on AutoPay now than there were then, which I would think kind of helps. But I\u2019m just kind of interested in any kind of color you have, given the Company has been around 50 years now, I guess.\nJoe Russell: Well again, cycle to cycle, we continue to take away best practices, different strategies, different ways to buffer and build upon not only our strengths, but it goes to the core of our platform and the resiliency that we see relative to those types of ebbs and flows of overall economic stress, et cetera. So, the things that we\u2019re constantly doing is running the business on a very fluid basis. We\u2019ve got more data now than clearly we\u2019ve ever had. I mentioned our move-in and move-out volume for instance. And then the amount of, again, testing that we do relative to pricing, whether it\u2019s marketing, whether it\u2019s promotions, all the tools that we have that are far more tied to analytical processes that can again guide us to optimization. So, we\u2019ve got great tools. We\u2019ve got great reconnaissance, and we think that we\u2019ve got even deeper technologies that we continue to make very strong investments into it, have served us well. We\u2019ve actually, in a whole variety of different ways, been able to test those in and out of, again, economic cycles, so we\u2019re going to continue to do just that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research.\nKeegan Carl: Yes. So maybe starting off with a bigger picture question here. When we think back to your May 2021 investor deck, you guys forecasted a long-term growth range of 6.7% to 9.2% on FFO. Just kind of curious, is that still in play going forward or do you anticipate growth to continue to moderate?\nTom Boyle: Yes. So, looking back at that investor presentation, we broke out the different engines of growth, as I recall. And there\u2019s a number of them that I\u2019ll talk through here and it\u2019s worth. And I appreciate the question. I mean, the first one around longer term storage growth rates and the building blocks. Certainly, we\u2019ve had a couple of years of really incredible strong growth. We\u2019re talking about a year now where we\u2019re getting back towards -- trending towards those longer term averages. But one of the components of that engines of growth formula was the operational improvements and enhancements that we walked through. So, I spoke earlier around operating model transformation and the energy efficiency things that we\u2019re doing today that are benefiting our same-store NOI growth. The investor community got to hear from our revenue management and data science team, which to Joe\u2019s point just a moment ago, we continue to test and implement new systems and new approaches. And we have over 1 million move-ins and over 1 million rental rate increases a year. That is an ability to continue to fine-tune those processes. So, we think that\u2019s certainly intact. I think going through the other ones, the portfolio growth, there\u2019s no question that cost of capital has changed from the time when we walked through that deck. And so, I think that there\u2019s certainly some components of that that are going to change from one year to another. Certainly, we\u2019ve allocated a significant amount of capital over the last several years. Last year was more in line with our expectations that were set out at Investor Day. Complementary growth and leverage and other were the other components that led to that FFO growth outlook, and I think those are still absolutely intact as we continue to grow our tenant reinsurance platform, the third-party management business that Joe spoke to, our investment in Shurgard and the benefit that we received from that on down the list. So in summary, many of those factors are very much still in play and continue to push on our competitive advantages to drive that growth. I think the portfolio growth is the one that\u2019s going to ebb and flow more from one year to another.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And I\u2019ll throw another tough one out here. But if we just think through the pandemic and the subsequent demand tailwind, how many first-time users do you think utilize self-storage? And how sticky do you guys expect these customers ultimately to be? I\u2019m just trying to sit here and reconcile where demand could level out, given your prior commentary where you don\u2019t necessarily anticipate any meaningful occupancy gain.\nTom Boyle: Yes. So, the first part of the question around new first-time users. No question, there was a significant influx of new storage users through the pandemic. And we\u2019ve spoken a lot around different use cases as well, right? The combination of surge in home sale activity during a part of the last several years, now a decline in home sale activity, a change to hybrid work and a big pickup in home improvement activity that drove new first-time users of storage and, frankly, the fact that people are spending a lot more time in their homes. And we do think that\u2019s a tailwind as we move forward over time. And so, as you think about the adoption of storage has continued to grow from a smaller base in the 1970s to where it is today. And we\u2019re encouraged by those first-time users, the younger users that continue to seek storage as a good value to store their goods and do think that that is a tailwind for the industry moving forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan.\nMichael Mueller: Yes. Hi. I think you mentioned the record length of stay. And I was wondering, first, can you just throw out the stats in terms of the percentage of customers there over a year and over two years?\nTom Boyle: Sure. First, I\u2019ll mention the metric that we like to communicate, which is the average tenure of the in-place tenants. That\u2019s sitting right around 37 months today. And we\u2019ve spoken in the past around how that\u2019s up from, call it, 32, 33 months going back several years. And so, no question, a continued benefit of the longer length of stay as we sit here today, and Joe highlighted that in his prepared remarks. And then specifically to your question around, well, segmenting the different tenure bands, we still, today, have over 60% -- I think it\u2019s 61%, 62% of the customers are over -- have been with us for longer than a year. And longer than two years is a very healthy, call it, 43%, 44% as we sit here today. So, we continue to see pretty healthy trends there from the sticky existing tenant customer base. And that\u2019s something we\u2019re obviously watching closely and continue to be encouraged by.\nMichael Mueller: Got it. Okay. And then I guess going to not drilling down on the same-store guidance but you talked about the recession scenario versus soft landing. If you do head down that recession scenario, would you envision taking the foot off of the gas on development starts at all or probably not?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Mike, the development cycle is long. And I mentioned you\u2019ve got to have the fortitude, particularly in environments or macroeconomic cycles that would and are actually persuading others to not pursue development. We still think that that\u2019s a very good opportunity for us, as I mentioned, to go out and capture even better land sites in some cases, or with our own view and financial capabilities and basically, view of the longer-term value creation we can see through cycles like this. And in many cases, it actually can lead us to opportunities we might not otherwise see. So, that\u2019s the benefit of, again, having our deep-seated knowledge, our very entrenched development and real estate teams nationally out looking for sites and then getting into all of the complications of getting entitlements, approvals, et cetera, and then going through construction processes. Now, there\u2019s been, and we don\u2019t see any immediate relief to the amount of inflationary pressures that have come through just component costs, whether it\u2019s steel or lumber or anything tied to oil, et cetera. So, there\u2019s a lot of risk that continues to evolve into the development business. But we think that we have uniquely the ability to see through cycles, and we look and make sure that we\u2019ve got enough bandwidth and even in our own underwriting to give us very good capability of not only hitting our expected returns but hopefully exceeding them, particularly if market corrections happen through, again, these ebbs and flows of market cycles. So, we\u2019re always looking and trying to assess what the near- and longer-term market dynamics are but we\u2019ve got the fortitude to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer portion of our call. And I would now like to turn the call back to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Chelsea, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the Public Storage fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. We appreciate your participation. And you may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. I'll start with a review of capital allocation for the year. We invested $1 billion between acquisitions and developments in 2022, including the $190 million Neighborhood Florida portfolio in the fourth quarter. That portfolio added to our over 400 properties that we're operating with our remote property management platforms. Overall, the 2022 acquisition environment was impacted by a shift of cost of capital with transaction volumes down and driven by smaller deals compared to 2021. We expect that trend to continue this year with our forecast for $750 million of transaction volume for Public Storage consistent with last year. We are well positioned as an acquirer today, given our industry-leading balance sheet and cost of capital. And adding to acquisitions, our development pipeline stands at approximately $1 billion as we seek to expand the portfolio with our in-house team. The development environment is challenging today across the industry, as Joe highlighted. Against that backdrop, Public Storage is planning on delivering $375 million of new generation 5 properties in 2023 and more in 2024, as we lean on our development competitive advantages. And we look forward to putting these new properties on our national platform to drive outperformance. Now, on the financial performance. We finished the year strong, reporting core FFO of $4.16 for the quarter and $15.92 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range and representing 22.4% growth over the fourth quarter of 2021, excluding the contribution of PS Business Parks. Let's look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 13% compared to the fourth quarter of \u201821. That performance represents a moderation from last quarter's 14.7% growth and a return to seasonality and tough comps comparing to 2021. Now on expenses, same-store direct costs of operations were up 5.3%. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 15.8% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout, growing 51% compared to last year. Now, I'll shift to the outlook. We introduced 2023 core FFO guidance with a $16.45 midpoint, representing 5.5% growth from 2022, again excluding the contribution of PS Business Parks. As we enter the year, there's no question there's a wide range of potential macroeconomic pathways that will influence customer demand and behavior. The consumer has held up well to this point in the year, but the Fed is certainly signaling they're not finished. If we look at the same-store revenue outlook, I'd characterize the low end of the range of the outlook as a recessionary pathway and the higher end as a softer landing for the economy. We anticipate occupancy will be lower throughout the year and follow a typical seasonal pattern. Rate will be the driver of revenue growth with the moderation through the year based on lower move-in rents and tougher existing tenant rate increase comps. That moderation results in a trending towards longer-term averages of growth. Our expectations are for 5.75% same-store expense growth, driven primarily by property tax and marketing expense. That leads to same-store NOI growth at the midpoint of 3.2%. Our non-same-store acquisition and development properties are again poised to be a strong contributor, growing from $448 million of NOI contribution in 2022 to $520 million at the midpoint. And looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, the incremental non-same-store NOI to stabilization from those properties acquired or completed at December 31st is an additional $80 million of NOI. This pool of lease-up assets will continue to be a powerful growth engine over the next several years. Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remain rock solid. We have a well-laddered long-term debt profile with limited floating rate exposure and over $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions. Our leverage of 3.4 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA combined with nearly $800 million of cash on hand at quarter end puts us in a very strong position, heading into 2023. So with that, I'd like to open the call up for questions. Sure. That's a good question, Steve. So, I want to make a couple of comments here. One, I'd like to comment a little bit around how the year has started, which is pretty consistent trends with what we saw through the fourth quarter. So move-in, move-out trends pretty consistent. We've seen move-in volumes up circa 10%, move-in rates that have been down mid-single digits. So consistent with that, we call it, 5% plus or minus that we saw in the fourth quarter. So, we're seeing continued good demand for storage through the first part of the year. But I do think in response to your question, I'd like to break the year of 2023 into two halves. The first half, as we think about it, consistent trends as we've seen through the fourth quarter into the first but facing really tough comps as we move through the first part of the year. And that's going to lead to some of the moderation I spoke to. The second -- but ultimately, with higher levels of absolute revenue growth, given we're starting the year from a position of strength. But if you think about the second part of the year, there's a couple of things to highlight. One, the comps will be easier in the second half of the year, given we'll be comping against a more seasonal end of 2021 -- or 2022, rather. But the flip side is the macro uncertainty is significantly higher. And so, as you think about the pathways that I described for the outlook, at the lower end, a recessionary pathway that we highlighted in some of our disclosures, that recessionary pathway likely leads to negative year-over-year revenue growth as you would be typical to see in a recession. But towards the higher end, certainly, that would lead to positive growth and easier comps and could result in better revenue growth performance as we move through the second half. And I'd say, as we think about the year, the second half has much more uncertainty towards it than the first half does. Sure. Good question, Michael. So, I think there's a couple of things there. The first is we wanted to provide a range that encapsulated multiple pathways because we know everyone on this call probably has their own point of view as to what percentage probability a recessionary pathway is or a soft landing is. And so, we thought it was appropriate to provide that wide range, and obviously, investors can make their own perspective. As we look at it, we look at the potential outcomes as relatively balanced within that range, but we don't obviously know what the Fed is going to do and how the consumer is going to react. 3 or 4 weeks ago, interest rates were lower. There was talk of a no landing over those 3 weeks. We've gone back to the fact that maybe that no landing is off the table. So, I think that's going to ebb and flow as we go through the year. And our objective was to provide investors and analysts a framework to understand what could play out through the year according to those macro pathways. Sure. Thanks, Michael. So, to talk specifically about the existing tenant rate increase program, and then I'll hit around the top-of-funnel demand as well. We've consistently spoken about our existing tenant rate increase program is really two components. The first is how is the consumer reacting to increases? How are they performing and behaving? And we've noted in the past and I would reiterate today that the consumer continues to perform at expectations and the sensitivity is largely in line with expectations. And so, there's no real change to the thought process around that program on that side. But the second component is the cost to replace that tenant when they leave. And there's no question that that's changed quite a bit over the last several years. You had markets like Miami where rents were up 25%, 30% and there was no cost to replace. There was, in fact, a benefit to replace a potentially in-place tenant. And so that started to shift as we moved through \u201822 and into \u201823. And that impact will result in lower magnitude and lower frequency increases but still to optimize revenue from that pool of existing tenants and new tenants that come in. Then the second part of your question around how is top-of-funnel demand performing, I think, is an important one, because as Joe mentioned, move-in volumes through the fourth quarter were up nearly 12%. Move-in volumes through the part of this year are up double digits as well. And so, we're seeing good demand from new customers coming into the system. Now, we're spending a little bit more on advertising. Our rates are a little bit lower. There's a little bit more promotional discounts in order to achieve that. But ultimately, the customers are very willing and looking forward to storage spaces to move into. And that's enabling us to capture those tenants, which I think is where you were going with the question. Those tenants will be good long-term tenants or a portion of them will as they move through 2023 as well. Thanks, Michael. Yes. I think to answer the question directly, we typically see the peak leasing season really start in April, pick up in May in a really big way and then, then into June and July. So to your point, it's not very far away. And we're already seeing some of the seasonal patterns that you would anticipate in some of our markets, right? The more seasonal markets are already starting to see a pickup in our occupancy as we sit here in February compared to the end of the year, for instance. And so that typical seasonal pattern is starting to play out, which is encouraging. And I think where you may be going is, there's certainly a chance that if there is a recession that comes, it's later in the year and not earlier in the year. And that certainly would impact the financial performance of the sector through the year. And obviously, if it's a good busy season, that has a very positive impact on overall financial performance and operational performance of the business. Yes. I'd say, we're constantly looking to dynamically manage the current environment. And as we just noted, it's hard to know exactly where we'll be sitting next year at this time. But we'll be planning week by week and day by day through our operational team to react to what we're seeing and ultimately maximizing our own performance and serving our customers well through a busy time period in the summer when there's typically strong demand for our storage space. Well, there's a whole host of questions in there, Juan. So, let me try to take a few of them at a time here. So I think the first part of the question is around the second half and talking a little bit more about the second half and maybe even, you're trying to tease out from me 2024 guidance. But I think the -- I do think the characterization... Yes, just fourth quarter, right. So, I'll go back to the first half, second half comment, which is the first half and the tougher comps that we're going to experience is going to lead to some moderation as we face those comps through the first half, which will lower the absolute level of growth as we go through the first half. And then, the second half, to the points I made earlier, really will depend on the busy season performance, like Jeff was just speaking to, and the macroeconomic environment and how the consumer is impacted by what the Fed is likely to do and the excess savings that the consumers have for a period of time and how quickly they burn through that excess savings, et cetera. And I think as we looked at that and modeled different consumer behavior through the year, there's a number of different moving pieces there, right? One is new storage demand, the other is existing tenant performance, rate sensitivity, delinquency, all of those things. And if you look at a typical recessionary environment, what you'd find is weakness really across the board in those metrics, which is what's led to negative year-over-year revenue performance and recessions in the past. So, in that recessionary pathway we've spoken to, we would expect that there is negative year-over-year revenue declines, like we've seen in prior recessions. But you will have the benefit of easier comps in the second half, which will help offset some of that potential weakness. On the flip side, right, we're just talking about, well, is the recession, when does it come? How deep is it? All those sorts of things, which we can sit here and prognosticate on, but ultimately, we're going to find out over the next 6 to 12 months. If the consumer is stronger, if the labor market holds up more effectively, if the Fed doesn't push the labor market as tough, there could certainly be a situation where there's pretty healthy positive growth in the second half because of that strength of the U.S. consumer and the fact that we'll be having easier comps in the second half. And so, I think that's our sense of the range of potential outcomes, and I hope that's responsive to your question. And then, as it relates to exactly how we'll exit, I think it will depend on how that second half moves forward. Yes, sure. So specifically within the same-store operating expenses, our largest operating expense line item is property taxes. We ended the year 2022 with property taxes with a 4-handle percent growth on them. We continue to expect that that's likely to be a higher growth rate as we move into the coming years, given the NOI growth that we've seen in the sector over the past several years. So, we're expecting something like 5% to 6% growth there, and obviously, we'll update as we move through the year. That's certainly the biggest driver of operating expense growth. The others are smaller. The second one I highlighted in my prepared remarks was marketing. So, you saw, in the fourth quarter, we increased marketing expense. That was to drive further top-of-funnel demand into the system, and we saw very good returns associated with that, really comping against a period in 2021 when there was very little spending in most of our markets. So, the percentage growth looks elevated against really low comps. So marketing expense is likely to be another one, because in the first part of this year, we're facing those similar really low comps. Some of the other line items that are facing inflationary pressures, again, the strength of the labor market today continues. There's wage pressure. But you could see even in the fourth quarter, we were able to mitigate some of those wage pressures, given the digital transformation and operating model transformation that we've been working through over the past several years, which has led to efficiencies in staffing. So that will help mitigate. And then utilities is another one that we've seen utility rates move higher, but we're looking to combat that with our investments in energy efficiency, be it our solar programs, which we're seeking to add about 300 properties with solar by the end of the year to bring our aggregate total to about 500 properties and with more room to go there in future years as well as our LED conversion helping to mitigate that. So, that's a high-level landscape of a number of the line items. Happy to go into any further detail if helpful. Well, let me talk about the first half first and then we can talk about the second half, which obviously, we've spoken about, there's macro uncertainty that will influence that. But as you think about the first half, we're starting the year with occupancy down about 2.4%. And we do think the occupancy decline that we experienced in the back half of 2022 was a seasonal occupancy decline. In fact, the decline from June to December was a touch better than a typical seasonal decline. But inherent in that is that what we're seeing today is a pickup in occupancy in some of our seasonal markets. So, I would anticipate there's certainly the opportunity for that spread to narrow as we get into the busy season as we've spoken to, but then would follow a typical seasonal pattern from there in the back half. Well, they typically tend to be colder weather markets, so your Miamis and your Los Angeles and San Diegos, you don't see that same seasonal pattern. But if you look at a Minneapolis or Chicago or the Northeast, you start to see that seasonal pattern be more pronounced. Sure. So I think, Spenser, you're speaking to the storms that took place in early January out here in California. There was a state of emergency that was put in place that is expiring here in February. So, I think, as anticipated, there's going to continue to be one-off events like storms and rain in California, believe it or not that can lead to state of emergency and pricing restrictions. And we'll navigate those. As it relates to what's embedded into our guidance expectations, there's things like that that come in and come out of different markets. And so, we'll try to take a reasonable estimate as to what those could be through the year. But we're not underwriting any significant rental rate restrictions as we move through the year embedded in our outlook. No, go ahead. Sure. So, I'd go back to my response around existing tenant rate increases earlier, which is that there's no question that in certain markets, we have a moderation in the magnitude and frequency that we've sent them. And I highlighted Miami as an example where rents in Miami for new customers were up 25%, 30% each year for the past several years, and that's started to slow down as we anticipated. That market and others can't grow like that in perpetuity. But because of that, the magnitude and frequency of rental rate increases to existing customers is likely to moderate this year, and we've already seen that at the start of the year. In terms of a band, I'm not going to get into specifics around numbers or averages or whatnot, but there's a wide range of increases that we send to the tenant based on what we understand their sensitivity and the value they place in the unit as well as the cost to replace that tenant if they do choose to move out. And as we move through the year, that cost to replace a tenant could take different pathways along with the rest of the outlook. And so, in the stronger outlook, it's going to result in a stronger existing tenant rate increase, magnitude and frequency, and the weaker outlook for the tenants is going to have the opposite effect. Yes. Good question, Ki Bin. So certainly, we started the year, as I've highlighted, with move-in rents that are below prior year, and we finished the fourth quarter in a similar territory. We are anticipating that we see rents lift as we move through the busy season months. As you'd anticipate, as customer demand increases, inventory gets tighter as you get to that point in the year and that will lead to higher absolute rents. But as I noted, earlier around the comments around the second half, there's a lot of variability on what could play out. Obviously, if we're in a recessionary environment, we'd anticipate that move-in rental rates are lower as we're looking to capture demand. In an environment where consumer demand remains strong, that's going to result in higher rental rates as we move through the year. And as I noted earlier, part of the story in the second half compared to the first is comps. Right? The comps are definitely tougher in the first half than they are in the second. And that's what they are right now, too, Ki Bin. That's what they are right now as well. Ron, you're coming through kind of quiet, but I think what I heard was bad debt expectations that are embedded in the guidance outlook. Is that -- okay, good. So, I'd characterize bad debt overall as being -- continue to be a good performance through the first part of this year and the back half of last year. We spoke a lot at the onset of the pandemic around how delinquency and bad debt really declined pretty dramatically. We're off those lows, but consumers continue to pay their bills and our delinquency remains a good bit below pre-pandemic levels. And so to speak to specifically the question on guidance and the ranges, in the recessionary pathway that we've spent a good bit of time talking about this morning, we did increase the bad debt assumption associated with that as we would anticipate that we're likely to see bad debt increase through that pathway and the reversal towards the higher end. Yes. So, looking back at that investor presentation, we broke out the different engines of growth, as I recall. And there's a number of them that I'll talk through here and it's worth. And I appreciate the question. I mean, the first one around longer term storage growth rates and the building blocks. Certainly, we've had a couple of years of really incredible strong growth. We're talking about a year now where we're getting back towards -- trending towards those longer term averages. But one of the components of that engines of growth formula was the operational improvements and enhancements that we walked through. So, I spoke earlier around operating model transformation and the energy efficiency things that we're doing today that are benefiting our same-store NOI growth. The investor community got to hear from our revenue management and data science team, which to Joe's point just a moment ago, we continue to test and implement new systems and new approaches. And we have over 1 million move-ins and over 1 million rental rate increases a year. That is an ability to continue to fine-tune those processes. So, we think that's certainly intact. I think going through the other ones, the portfolio growth, there's no question that cost of capital has changed from the time when we walked through that deck. And so, I think that there's certainly some components of that that are going to change from one year to another. Certainly, we've allocated a significant amount of capital over the last several years. Last year was more in line with our expectations that were set out at Investor Day. Complementary growth and leverage and other were the other components that led to that FFO growth outlook, and I think those are still absolutely intact as we continue to grow our tenant reinsurance platform, the third-party management business that Joe spoke to, our investment in Shurgard and the benefit that we received from that on down the list. So in summary, many of those factors are very much still in play and continue to push on our competitive advantages to drive that growth. I think the portfolio growth is the one that's going to ebb and flow more from one year to another. Yes. So, the first part of the question around new first-time users. No question, there was a significant influx of new storage users through the pandemic. And we've spoken a lot around different use cases as well, right? The combination of surge in home sale activity during a part of the last several years, now a decline in home sale activity, a change to hybrid work and a big pickup in home improvement activity that drove new first-time users of storage and, frankly, the fact that people are spending a lot more time in their homes. And we do think that's a tailwind as we move forward over time. And so, as you think about the adoption of storage has continued to grow from a smaller base in the 1970s to where it is today. And we're encouraged by those first-time users, the younger users that continue to seek storage as a good value to store their goods and do think that that is a tailwind for the industry moving forward. Sure. First, I'll mention the metric that we like to communicate, which is the average tenure of the in-place tenants. That's sitting right around 37 months today. And we've spoken in the past around how that's up from, call it, 32, 33 months going back several years. And so, no question, a continued benefit of the longer length of stay as we sit here today, and Joe highlighted that in his prepared remarks. And then specifically to your question around, well, segmenting the different tenure bands, we still, today, have over 60% -- I think it's 61%, 62% of the customers are over -- have been with us for longer than a year. And longer than two years is a very healthy, call it, 43%, 44% as we sit here today. So, we continue to see pretty healthy trends there from the sticky existing tenant customer base. And that's something we're obviously watching closely and continue to be encouraged by."

            "name": "Joe Russell",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us. I'm going to begin by providing color on two recent announcements. We'll then move on to our performance in 2022 and outlook for 2023. First, on February 5th, we announced a 50% increase to our quarterly common dividend, a raise from $8 to $12 per share on an annualized basis. It is a result of a great effort by the team that has produced record performance over the last few years and a validation of our ongoing confidence in the strength of our platform. Second, as announced separately, we made a proposal to acquire Life Storage at a substantial premium after several attempts to engage in negotiations privately. I'd like to highlight a few important reasons why we think this combination is poised to unlock superior growth and value creation for shareholders. First, there is significant opportunity to accelerate growth and profitability as Life Storage's portfolio benefits from Public Storage's industry-leading brand. Our platform achieves approximately 80% same-store operating margins compared to Life Storage's margins at approximately 73%. And we see an opportunity to narrow that gap with their real estate assets as part of our industry-leading platform. Second, we believe there is significant upside to grow revenues and earnings in our respective ancillary business lines, including storage insurance, third-party property management, business customer offerings and lending. Third, we see expanded portfolio growth opportunities as we leverage Public Storage's fully integrated in-house development team, the only one of its kind in the industry, to capitalize on additional development and redevelopment opportunities to enhance Life Storage's existing portfolio. And finally, all of this will be supported by an industry-leading balance sheet with low pro forma leverage, an advantaged cost of capital and significant capacity to fund future growth in conjunction with retained cash flow. Since announcing the proposal, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both companies' shareholders who clearly recognize the significant benefits uniquely achievable through a combination with Public Storage. As you likely saw, on February 16th, Life Storage issued its own press release rejecting our proposal. Nothing in that response changed our thinking. We have a high level of conviction in the strategic and financial merits, and we are committed to pursuing a potential combination. We are encouraged, in that February 16th release, Life Storage indicated openness to opportunities to enhance shareholder value. We look forward to engaging in good faith discussions regarding a mutually agreeable combination. While we appreciate that analysts and shareholders have ongoing questions with respect to our proposal, the purposes of today's call is to discuss our fourth quarter earnings and our outlook for 2023. As such, we will not be addressing questions related to the proposal at this time. Now, turning to our performance and outlook. 2022 was a year of milestones for Public Storage, including celebrating our 50th anniversary. The team and platform achieved record results in our same-store and non-same-store portfolios, elevating the customer experience through technology and operating model transformation, enhancing our properties through the Property of Tomorrow program and growing the portfolio through acquisitions, development and redevelopment and third-party management. We did all of this while maintaining the industry's best balance sheet, which is poised to fund growth moving forward in conjunction with significant retained cash flow. To name just a few of our collective accomplishments, we achieved an 80% stabilized direct NOI margin through the combination of revenue generation and expense efficiency that only Public Storage is capable of. We grew beyond 200 million owned square feet and $4 billion in total revenues. We built our property development pipeline to approximately $1 billion. We received the prestigious Great Place to Work award based on feedback provided directly by our employees. And we achieved top-scoring U.S. self-storage REITs across the leading sustainability benchmarks. We are firing on all cylinders while strengthening the already formidable competitive advantages we have across our business. And those competitive advantages are heightened in the type of macro environment we are in today on top of two consecutive years of record 20%-plus core FFO growth. Simply put, we have the people, technologies, platforms and brand which lead us to a position of strength in 2023. Demand for self-storage remains strong, as you see with our move-in volume up more than 11% during the quarter. The aspects of the business that have historically made it resilient are on display. This is a needs-based business with demand drivers that are multidimensional and fluid throughout economic cycles. We also continue to benefit from a newer driver in the form of people spending more time at home, which has increasing permanence with remote and hybrid work here to stay. Our customer lengths of stay are at record levels, a positive trend, given rent increases to existing customers are a key driver to our revenue growth. The outlook for new competitive supply is also in our favor. We are seeing less new property development nationally due to higher interest rates, cost pressures, difficult municipal processes and concern over the macro landscape. With continuing strong demand, less pressure from new supply and our numerous competitive advantages, we are very well positioned in 2023. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Yes, Steve. There certainly is a continuing trend that played through in 2022 that we think still applies to 2023. First of all, on the acquisition side, likely to be lower volumes of transaction activity. Certainly, we're seeing that by virtue of how the year started off. It's not a typical year in and year out where the first quarter or so might be on the light side. That's definitely the case as we speak. So, we're looking for and evaluating the trends tied to impacts from higher cost of capital, limited availability of capital, again, how sellers are looking at this environment to transact assets. Typically, more stabilized assets are going to command stronger cap rates. I'd tell you today compared to maybe where we were a year ago, cap rates are still up in that 100, 125 basis-point range where stabilized assets might have a 5 handle on them, whether it's low, mid or high-5, cap rate's going to depend on location, quality of the asset, et cetera. And then, depending on this stabilized level of the asset, there's going to be more flexibility in the cap rate. And you're going to see different pricing mechanisms tied to those types of assets. Our focus, as it has been to actually look for those kinds of assets because that's where we see the higher value creation. That certainly played through the acquisition volume that we captured that Tom talked about, in 2022. So we're still out hunting for good quality assets. Our backlog right now between closed and under contract's approximately $70 million. But frankly, the market is a little slow right now, so we'll see. It's not unusual for though the market to start picking up toward the summer months so we'll see again how that plays through on that set of opportunities. Now, on the flip side, from a development standpoint, as you mentioned, yes, our pipeline continues to be quite robust. It's more difficult to do development not any different than what we've been talking about for the last year or two. Our team is working hard to extract prime land sites. We're actually finding some very good opportunities there. But frankly, we've got skills and abilities that our competitors in the private world particularly do not have. And with that, we've been able to extract prime sites, good opportunities to actually get the types of returns that we've been speaking to for the last couple of years, where we're expecting plus or minus 8% or north cash-on-cash yields on these investments. So, we're very encouraged by our own pipeline. We're encouraged, as Tom mentioned, relative to the lease-up and the contribution those types of assets have to our overall revenue and NOI performance. And our non-same-store portfolio continues to be very vibrant. So, we're very encouraged that we've got the right skills and the fortitude and the ability to look long term through what could be still a very challenging development cycle, which frankly, is a good thing. It gives us more ability to actually go out and capture, as I mentioned, those great land sites, put our Gen 5 properties into a variety of different markets. And nationally, we've got good opportunities across the spectrum, so we're going to continue to focus on that as we speak. Yes, Todd. I mentioned what we've been doing strategically now for the last three years or more is looking for opportunities with assets that do have that upside that you're speaking to. So, whether it's through some of the larger portfolios, All Storage included, we bought that portfolio at about 74% occupancy, had a nice lift really in a very short period of time relative to continued lease-up and stabilization of the revenue metrics, et cetera. And we've done the exact same thing with one-off deals as well. So, that's something we're not going to be shy about doing, and it continues to be a very good playbook for us. When we've got deep-seated knowledge market to market, which we do on the vast majority of deals that we acquire, we have an elevated level of confidence that once we put these assets into our own platform, you can see that extracted opportunity literally right out of the gate. You see the benefits as we've been speaking to relative to our brand, our platform, our efficiencies that assist higher-margin, opportunities, et cetera. So, we're definitely looking for those kinds of assets and have not backed away from them at all. So, that has and will continue to be a very vibrant part of our capital allocation process. The energy efficiency investment definitely leads to good returns. And as Tom mentioned, we're combing the portfolio as we speak for solar opportunities in particular. We've basically re-lit the entire portfolio to LED. We had good, again, returns from that investment. And as the additional stimulus has come through with recent legislation, there's even more motivation on our part to continue to look at multiple markets. Likely, we'll get into a very sizable percentage of the entire portfolio that will help solar, I think, over the next, say, three to five years. But at the onset here, as Tom mentioned, we've got 300 to 400 properties that are near term, likely very good candidates for good, strong returns. Property of Tomorrow, we're lifting the aesthetics and the curb appeal and some of the functionality of the properties. It's a little harder to measure specific returns on that type of investment. We do see a higher elevated level of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, et cetera. And then clearly, the enhancement market to market we're seeing from just the brand awareness, now that we're at a point of over 55% to 60% of the portfolio has been rebranded to the Property of Tomorrow standard market by market, and we're seeing very good receptivity to that as well. So, a little harder to measure just on a pure economic basis but continue to see good results from that investment as well. Yes. I mean, obviously, we're running a month-to-month lease business. We move in 80-plus-thousand customers on a monthly basis and we have a healthy amount of move-outs as well. So with that continuous flow of activity, we're constantly monitoring things like payment patterns to the degree of either change or what might be happening market to market relative to other macro events, et cetera. But, one of the more obvious metrics that we look at relative to just the stress of maybe the evolving nature of the economy at large is payment patterns. And as Tom just mentioned, those continue to be actually quite good. There's some elevated level of stress but it's, on a relative basis, still below what we saw pre pandemic. We're keeping a very close eye on it. We've got new and different ways to actually track this now that so much of our business is tied to digital interaction with customers, et cetera. So, we've got good tools to stay ahead of that and to guide us relative to whatever stress points might be evolving. Yes. Smedes, I mentioned that in my opening remarks. We've had the benefit nationally where deliveries have been somewhat static for the last two years, and we're looking at 2023 in very similar fashion relative to likely not an elevated uptick in overall deliveries. That ties to the amount of complication from a cost standpoint. There's more risk with many of the unknowns coming into the economy. And the complication is tied to just getting approvals as you go through step-by-step development processes. So, the overall supply picture is actually very good, meaning we're not seeing a rush to new development. Our lens through our third-party development platform gives us a little bit more validation of that as well where the majority of those opportunities are tied to development. And we're keeping even a closer eye on that beyond what our day-to-day development team and our real estate team is seeing as we're out either acquiring or looking for development opportunities. So hopefully, fingers crossed, we're going to continue to see that amount of deliveries through 2023 and going forward, again either in the same range or it could actually be a slightly downtick, but we'll continue to track that. Well again, cycle to cycle, we continue to take away best practices, different strategies, different ways to buffer and build upon not only our strengths, but it goes to the core of our platform and the resiliency that we see relative to those types of ebbs and flows of overall economic stress, et cetera. So, the things that we're constantly doing is running the business on a very fluid basis. We've got more data now than clearly we've ever had. I mentioned our move-in and move-out volume for instance. And then the amount of, again, testing that we do relative to pricing, whether it's marketing, whether it's promotions, all the tools that we have that are far more tied to analytical processes that can again guide us to optimization. So, we've got great tools. We've got great reconnaissance, and we think that we've got even deeper technologies that we continue to make very strong investments into it, have served us well. We've actually, in a whole variety of different ways, been able to test those in and out of, again, economic cycles, so we're going to continue to do just that. Yes. Mike, the development cycle is long. And I mentioned you've got to have the fortitude, particularly in environments or macroeconomic cycles that would and are actually persuading others to not pursue development. We still think that that's a very good opportunity for us, as I mentioned, to go out and capture even better land sites in some cases, or with our own view and financial capabilities and basically, view of the longer-term value creation we can see through cycles like this. And in many cases, it actually can lead us to opportunities we might not otherwise see. So, that's the benefit of, again, having our deep-seated knowledge, our very entrenched development and real estate teams nationally out looking for sites and then getting into all of the complications of getting entitlements, approvals, et cetera, and then going through construction processes. Now, there's been, and we don't see any immediate relief to the amount of inflationary pressures that have come through just component costs, whether it's steel or lumber or anything tied to oil, et cetera. So, there's a lot of risk that continues to evolve into the development business. But we think that we have uniquely the ability to see through cycles, and we look and make sure that we've got enough bandwidth and even in our own underwriting to give us very good capability of not only hitting our expected returns but hopefully exceeding them, particularly if market corrections happen through, again, these ebbs and flows of market cycles. So, we're always looking and trying to assess what the near- and longer-term market dynamics are but we've got the fortitude to do that."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thank you, Ryan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I will highlight our view of 2022 as we head into the last two months of the year, and then Tom will cover more specifics in the quarter. At the beginning of this year, our expectation was we were poised for exceptional earnings growth, which has clearly played through. With that, we raised our outlook on strong NOI performance in same-store and non-same-store assets, along with continued improvement in ancillary revenue. In total, core FFO is set to grow by over 20% for the second consecutive year. Looking back on both 2021 and now 2022, we have been particularly advantaged by a number of enduring demand factors that continue to drive historic performance. Customers are drawn to use self-storage even in an environment where some top line drivers are decelerating, such as home sales and market-to-market migration levels. The appeal and rationale to use storage is still tied to a sensible financial and need-based decision, where the cost of shelter, whether you own a rent, has increased dramatically. In addition, our customer survey data points to needing more space at home as the second and elevated driver to use storage. Hybrid work environments, for instance, are proving to be sustainable -- to be a sustainable reason for additional need for storage. For our business customers, renting a storage unit is a compelling alternative to taking down more expensive, less flexible industrial space. As demand has remained very good, existing customers, too, are staying longer, giving us the ability to optimize rate increases and occupancy. On a macro basis, new supply of competitive product has been flat to down from peak deliveries in 2019. Nationally, markets have been able to absorb the more subdued pace of new development. Our view is that new development will also be static for the near term as risk levels tied to development have increased, particularly due to city approval time frames, higher component costs and the dramatic increases in the cost of construction lending. With this said, it has become harder to predict the economic environment we are heading into with record inflation and consensus that the recession is imminent. We are, however, highly confident we have excellent tools to maneuver changing macro conditions. These include the industry-leading 200 million square foot portfolio of well-located assets in every large scale market nationally, the most recognized brand in the self-storage industry, cost-efficient online marketing prowess to guide new customers to our platform. A broad and growing base of digital channels to source new customers while improving customer and employee satisfaction, historically high operating margins now above 80% and operational efficiency, a massive non-same-store portfolio which continues to grow through acquisitions and development that is now 50 million square feet with excellent earnings power with over $150 million of additional NOI to come, a well-primed low leverage and low-risk balance sheet with $900 million of cash and no debt expirations through 2023, and finally the most experienced team in the self-storage sector. Now I'll hand the call over to Tom.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $4.13 for the quarter, representing 20.8% growth over the third quarter of 2021. Let's look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 14.7%. And breaking down the components, realized rents per occupied square foot were up a strong 17.2% matching last quarter's performance. Weighted average occupancy declined 2.4%. The moderation in occupancy from June to September represented a return to typical pre-pandemic seasonal occupancy decline of 150 basis points. The strong 14.7% growth moderated slightly from last quarter's 15.9% growth as expected. That said, Los Angeles was again a particularly strong contributor, accelerating from 17% same-store revenue growth in the second quarter to 20% in the third quarter. Now on to expenses. Same-store direct cost of operations were up 7.8% in the quarter. We increased our marketing spend in the quarter compared to last year when we were largely quiet in most of our markets, and we saw good returns on those ad dollar spend. Our strategic initiatives, including operating model transformation resulting from digital investments and LED and solar investments, helped offset a portion of the wage and utility inflation. And I note the recent Inflation Reduction Act added incentives for further solar investments as we ramp our own activity to reach over 1,000 properties with solar on our roots in the coming years. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool was up 17% for the quarter. In addition to the same store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired or developed facilities was once again strong, contributing $139 million in NOI for the quarter, up 68%. There is significant growth ahead from this pool of properties, as Joe noted, which is a good segue to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Joe mentioned, we raised our core FFO outlook for the year by $0.20 at the midpoint or 1.3% to $15.55 from our most recent outlook. The improved outlook is driven by better-than-expected performance in our same-store pool, continued strong growth from our non-same-store pool as well as our tenant insurance business. And shifting gears now to our balance sheet. Our capital and liquidity position remains rock solid. We have a well-laddered long-term debt profile with limited floating rate exposure and over $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions. Our leverage of 3.3x net debt and preferred to EBITDA, combined with $900 million of cash on hand at quarter end, puts us in a very strong position heading into 2023. It's our strategy to position ourselves for strong access and cost of capital to invest through cycles. Over the past couple of years, we've had the opportunity to use that balance sheet to grow, and we're ready to do it again. And with that, turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is now open.\nMichael Goldsmith: Last year, realized rent growth and same-store rent growth accelerated through the year and then heading into 2022. Perhaps the expectation is that it was going to decelerate similar to the acceleration. Instead, it's remained very strong. So given these moving pieces and what we're seeing is a start to return to normal seasonality, how do we -- how should we think about the cadence or trajectory of rent growth and same-store revenue growth going forward?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Good question, Michael. And I think you highlighted some of the moving pieces there well. As we came into the year, we were expecting continued strong rate momentum and have been pretty consistent around that, and we've seen that through the first part of the year paired with more typical seasonal behavior and the occupancy rises and falls that we in the industry see year in and year out with maybe the exception of the last couple. On the rate growth side, it's really been driven by two factors. One is really strong move-in rent growth over the last several years. And we've spoken in the past around some of our strongest markets like Miami and, now for us, Los Angeles as well with rent restrictions no longer in place. And that's been a really additive driver. Miami, quarter-to-date move-in rents were up 9%, again, on top of significant growth in prior years. The other side of that is then the existing tenant base, and Joe spoke earlier to the behavior of our existing tenants in the long length of stays that we've experienced over the last several years, and we're sitting now at record length of stays within the portfolio. And that's allowed us to send more rental rate increases because there's more long-term tenants and at higher magnitude because of the overall rent environment, which has led to increased realized rents. This quarter matched last quarter. We have been expecting a moderation through the back half of this year and would anticipate that, that plays through in the fourth quarter and is clearly embedded in our guidance, but year-to-date, we've been able to take advantage of that environment and have achieved strong rental rate growth throughout.\nMichael Goldsmith: I guess just as a follow-up to that is just given these factors that we have visibility into and combined with street rate growth, which is flattish to down, let's say, like how long do you have visibility into kind of continued elevated realized rent growth just based on these factors and not like some of the other things like with a worsening of or any potential worsening of street rates or any of that? Just like how long do you have visibility into elevated rent growth?\nTom Boyle: I get it. You're asking about 2023 now. So looking at what we're experiencing on moving rent growth, we have seen the moderation in moving rent growth as we move through the year that we've been anticipating and speaking to move-in rent growth. And frankly, move-ins were quite strong in the quarter. We had move-in volumes were up 9%, move-in rates were up 3%, but that 3% is clearly a moderation from where we were earlier in the year and would anticipate that to continue to moderate through the fourth quarter. But as we look forward from here, our guidance would imply that we will exit the year with revenue growing at, call it, 10%, plus or minus, which sets us up really well heading into 2023, recognizing it could be an uncertain environment into 2023, we'll be starting from a period of strength, and so that's what I'd point you to.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's helpful. And just expenses have been elevated. You have several initiatives to offset the pressure, such as technology to reduce store hours or solar, also utility costs. Still, the gap between the same-store revenue growth and same-store expense growth is narrowing. So how should we think about the gap here? And can they converge if revenue growth moderates and expense growth kind of remains elevated or even accelerate?\nTom Boyle: Yes. As revenue growth decelerates, we could see a narrowing of that. I'd say we have tools, and you highlighted some of them from an initiative standpoint that have been frankly underway for a number of years to help mitigate some of the pressures there. And heading into 2023, the team will be acutely focused on managing expenses in what's a tough environment. So I'm not sure I'd have much to add to that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Lizzy Doykan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nLizzy Doykan: I just wanted to ask about how that debt trended through the quarter, if, you could just give any color around the level of delinquent payments kind of if that picked up at all or just anything different from the prior quarter.\nJoe Russell: Sure. Lizzy, the behavior of our customer base even from a delinquency standpoint, I think, is a can to the elevated and consistent behavior we're seeing from a length of stay. And what I mean by that is the customer base as a whole continues to operate from a delinquency standpoint at nearly historically low levels. It's elevated up somewhat from where we were, say, a year ago, but nowhere close to what we saw pre-pandemic or what you would consider typical environment. Consumer balance sheets statistically appear to be in decent, if not surprisingly good shape going into 2023. We're seeing this in a number of different reports that we track relative to some of the banking platforms and other tracking mechanisms tied to the overall health of the consumer. And from an unemployment standpoint, we're clearly also seeing very little disruption, in fact, surprisingly good traction relative to overall employment levels. And then holistically, that still just ties back to one of my opening comments, which from a financial and need-based standpoint, storage continues to be a very necessary source of either relief or needing more space or other reasons that consumers continue to value and pay for on a much more consistent base, their storage storage units. So overall, a very close eye up, but nothing alarming by any means.\nLizzy Doykan: Okay. Helpful color. And for my second question, I wanted to get more commentary around market performance. So particularly with new move-in rate increases since we were seeing that growth moderate. Are there specific markets where you've had to back off on rate increases for new move-in more so than others? And if you could comment on why the acceleration we've seen in L.A.'s market and how that's expected to trend going forward, that would be helpful.\nJoe Russell: Yes, I'll start, and then Tom can give you a little bit more color on some of the specific markets. You mentioned L.A., for instance, very strong growth in that market, and we think that serves us well going into 2023. It's clearly our largest market, and we've been held back now for some period of time, i.e., over three years, but we see very good continued rate growth and momentum in that market as we speak. Florida as a whole continues to be still quite strong. We're seeing very good inherent drivers and good absorption of not only move-in rates, but existing customer rate increases as well. And then from an overall standpoint, as I mentioned, we're seeing pretty muted new deliveries. So that, too, has not been an overarching pain point literally in any of the markets that we operate in. That's a very good thing. It's been a good thing for the sector for the last couple of years, and we don't see that changing in any material fashion going into 2023, and frankly, keeping a close eye in 2024, but not an elevated concern there either. Tom, you can give a little bit more color on some of the trends, otherwise that we're seeing in specific markets.\nTom Boyle: Yes. And I'd say, overall, trends we're seeing in move-in rate generally link up to the markets that are performing the best overall from a revenue standpoint. So I already highlighted Miami, which continues to be a strong market. It's not seeing move-in rent growth of 25% or 30% a year, any longer but is up 9% in the quarter, one of our stronger markets. And as you'd anticipate, Los Angeles in a similar ZIP code there. In terms of markets that that have seen slower rent growth, again, very consistent with overall performance. I'd highlight San Francisco and New York that while positive on a move-in rent growth year-over-year is a more modest level of growth, call it, low single digits.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nSamir Khanal: Tom, you guys have done a great job on the expense side. Maybe help us understand how you've been able to sort of keep a lid on expense growth or better manage expenses when many companies are raising expense growth guidance probably across the REIT sector. I guess how much of this is sustainable into next year, your ability to sort of control expense or manage expense?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Samir. I'll give you a couple of general comments. And again, Tom can add more context. But it goes back to a number of very intentional investments that we've made year by year, many of which have been digitally-oriented. It's helped us optimize the amount of labor hours, for instance, our second highest expense costs in the P&L. And it's given us the ability to predict, optimize and rationalize the amount of labor that is necessary, which has been very positively impacted by another digital tool, which is our eRental platform. Now 55-plus percent of our customer base is choosing that to transact with us. It's a digital experience. Obviously, it doesn't require at-the-counter labor. So we can shift some of that traditional labor to other priorities' property to property. So that's been a very good optimization tool. It hasn't in any way relieved us of some of the pressure we're seeing from a hourly basis, but it's certainly been a very effective tool to minimize that impact. We're also making strong investments. Tom mentioned some of the things that we've started to do over the last couple of years with solar. Utilities are under a lot of pressure market to market. We've got a great opportunity and an accelerated investment going into our solar platform. We have, as I mentioned, 200 million square feet of assets. That equates to about 150 million square feet or more of rooftops that are wide open for investments. And then another thing that continues to change in the business that we continue to optimize is the amount of remote operations, property to property that makes sense. We've been testing this for the last three years. We've got a fleet of kiosks, for instance, in our portfolio that today is about 200. We're continuing to evaluate that property by property, and we're just looking for any and all tools to continue to rationalize the pressure you're speaking to. And we've been pleased. And it's certainly playing through in our margins, which this quarter, again, we're over 80%. So Tom, you can add any additional color to that.\nTom Boyle: Joe, I think you covered it well.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. And then I guess on my second question is, clearly, rate growth is still strong here. But tell me if I'm wrong. But when I look at occupancy, it looks like you're at a level, I mean, maybe even 30, 40 basis points above of '19 year when I look at 3Q. I guess how should we think about the trade-off? Or how are you managing between sort of rate growth and occupancy at this time and sort of into next year?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Sure, Samir. Happy to dig into that a little bit. As I highlighted earlier, we did see a typical seasonal decline in occupancy. And as we look at occupancy performance at the end of September, we're about 80, 90 basis points over 2019, also over '18, '17 performance. So this is an area of revenue maximization we're ultimately seeking to achieve and are comfortable in that a 92% to 95% occupancy level, which we spent the entire quarter in and feel like we have the tools to ultimately maximize and optimize revenue in that ZIP code. And so feel good about where occupancy is today and clearly have had the benefit of being able to push rent both for our new customers and existing within that occupancy ZIP Code.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is now open.\nSmedes Rose: I just kind of want to follow up on that last question as you look into 2023. And Joe, you mentioned, I think, a lot of people see recession is imminent at this point. Would you expect promotional and kind of marketing spend next year to get back towards kind of pre-pandemic levels? And just kind of interested in hearing more about your sort of willingness, I guess, to protect occupancy getting more aggressive potentially on the pricing side if the economy shows a significant sort of downshift.\nTom Boyle: Yes. I mean I'd say stepping back, we certainly have good tools to manage different types of operating environments, and I think it's too early to speculate exactly what 2023 will look like. But going back in time, we have used promotional discounts. We've used advertising in a more meaningful way. Throughout the pandemic and getting to 2020 and 2021, we really didn't need to use things like promotional discounts or advertising because demand was so strong. Clearly, we could be heading into an environment where that won't be the case. And even in the quarter, we used probably more typical levels of advertising and promotional even in a strong environment. So thinking about advertising spend in the quarter, we spend about 1.5% of revenue in the quarter. And that's towards the low end of our historical range of, call it, 1% to 3%, where in 2019, for instance, we were towards the higher end there. On a promotional basis, similarly, last year, we were hardly offering any promotions. This year, we had very modest promotional discounts in the quarter, about 38% of our customers that moved in, in the quarter, received promotions in a typical year. In the third quarter, that's more like 70%. And so we're still running it at levels that give us a lot of tools heading into next year to navigate what could be a recessionary environment, and we'll certainly use those to our advantage in that environment. And I'm not sure if that answers the question.\nSmedes Rose: Yes. No, that's helpful. The other thing I just wanted to ask you is. Did you see a significant uptick in tenant insurance claims in Florida and the aftermath of Hurricane Ian? Or is there something in your numbers that might be worth calling out around that? Or are you -- or does it not really show up in a meaningful way?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Smedes. First of all, fortunately, we did not see a heavy impact from the hurricane itself. Our team did an admirable job on a number of fronts. We closed plus or minus 100 properties or so for a period of a few days, first and foremost, to keep employees and customers in a very safe environment. We were very fortunate, as I mentioned, we only had 12 to 15 properties that had, I would call, any level of significant impact, mostly flooding-related. The property claims are roughly $2 million or so, and then the tenant insurance claims are at this point expected to be about $4 million. And statistically, we're dealing with, plus or minus, say, 3,000, 3,500 units. So very small and, as I mentioned, fortunate occurrence for us relative to where properties are located and the impact, we're clearly seeing obviously, a lot of retooling going on to those areas for overall recovery, but fortunately, not a lot of economic impact to us specifically.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Your line is now open.\nKi Bin Kim: Can you help describe what the ECRI program look like in 2022 in terms of level of increases or frequency? And how do you think this program might change moving forward in an environment where we're potentially going to see negative street rates and negative occupancy?\nTom Boyle: So sure, Ki Bin, I'll answer it, and Joe can chime in as well. So the way we think about existing tenant rate increases is really around breaking it into a couple of components. One is, understanding how our customers are behaving. And we have a wealth of information and testing data going back years, and it's a constant dynamic testing environment that we live through kind of month-to-month. And that gives us the ability to predict how customers will behave and how they'll react to different sorts of increases. And what we've experienced over the last couple of years, and Joe highlighted this earlier, is customers have found a lot of value in our storage units. And that's, frankly, increased through the pandemic. Length of stays are at record highs, and so the number of tenants eligible to receive an increase have moved higher over the last several years, and they've behaved really well. And so, we've experienced now 9 months or 10 months through 2022, that consumer base has remained remarkably consistent, i.e., the models are predicting what it is that the customers are going to react to and we're seeing very consistent performance. The second component is around when a customer does vacate, what's the cost to replace that tenant. And certainly, over the past couple of years, the cost of -- to replace that tenant has decreased as move-in demand has been strong, moving rates have been higher. And as we move through 2022, as anticipated, some of that is moderating. And I would note move-in demand continues to be very healthy. And as I noted earlier, we had a good move-in quarter with move-in volumes up 9% but moderating from earlier in the year. And so that component of the existing tenant rate increase program is likely to result in moderating overall activity as we move forward. But that's just one piece of it. And as consumers continue to behave well and length of stays are longer, that gives us incremental tools on the other side of the equation in effect.\nKi Bin Kim: And going to your comments about record lengths of stay, your move-out activity was up 12%. I'm just curious, is the group of customers that are moving out, is that at all different in terms of mix, meaning are customers that have been in there longer over a year moving out to a higher degree than before? Or is it pretty consistent?\nTom Boyle: It's pretty consistent. What we've seen is really across the board depending on you slice and dice the tenants by demographies, psychographics, et cetera, you'd see relatively broad-based increases in vacate levels up from the really lows that we experienced in 2020 and 2021. But move-out volumes remain attractive, frankly, versus pre-pandemic levels. And so again, both the mix of tenants has moved more favorably. And as you slice and dice that tenant base, they continue to perform well versus pre-pandemic levels, although off last year is really record highs or record lows. Thanks, Ki Bin.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJuan Sanabria: Just hoping to talk about the consumer a little bit. You kind of talked about how occupancy was above pre-COVID levels. So you're in a position of strength. But yet the new street rate growth is kind of low single digits, well below the headline inflation. So just curious on how we should really think about strong demand, limited vacates, higher length of stay, but the street rates being modest, still positive but modest despite having record occupancy. And it's just -- it's a little bit of a -- just why would that be the case that you're not able to extract more from street rates? Is there some sort of counterpoint to their ability to pay or price sensitivity that you guys are seeing in the revenue management that's causing that?\nTom Boyle: Yes. One maybe I'd highlight we have had an ability to increase move-in rents through most of the year, and we've had some moderation as expected as we move through the year. I think as we've moved into the fall and into a more seasonal decline in occupancy, we've seen the industry broadly away from us lowering their rental rates because they have more inventory, and I think that that's to be expected, and we certainly have seen that over the last couple of months, which is leading to a different environment than what we saw last year, right, which we didn't see a seasonal decline in occupancy. So as you think about the scarcity of inventory different year-over-year, you're going to see a different rental rate behavior across the industry, and we've seen that. And we're not -- we're seeing some moderation, and I think the rest of the industry looking at what streets that many of you report are showing some declines as well. The flip side is web visits continue to be strong. Our web visits, so you should think about having a little bit more inventory, maybe a little bit more of a seasonal decline in rental rates, the overall demand environment remains healthy. Web visits were flat, basically right on top of what was a record year last year through the third quarter. So speaking to the move-in environment and the move-in volumes certainly performing well through the third quarter is the counterbalance of that rate discussion.\nJuan Sanabria: Good. And then just for Los Angeles, how much more growth can you capture from bringing existing customers to street rates? I guess how much more juice do you have left for that to continue to accelerate sequentially? Or have you kind of gotten back to levels where you would have wanted if you had not been to around restrictions?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Juan, I mentioned Los Angeles, certainly one of our top-performing markets. And we've got more to go there, frankly. I mean you step back and you think about not only the fact that we've been handcuffed for three-plus years, it is a market where there's very little, new product coming into the market, very good dynamics relative to inherent deep-seated demand. We've seen a little bit of move-out volume, but it's come right back on the move-in side. Occupancies are still quite strong, and we think we've got good pricing opportunities even going into 2023. So this has not ended.\nJuan Sanabria: So just a quick last one. Can you give us any update on the October data, whether it's occupancy or street rates and how those trended at the end of the end of October?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Occupancy, as we look at the end of October, declined a little bit as we anticipate as we move through the fall. So I think occupancy ended up at or 92.8 rather at the end of October, down from the 93.3 at the end of September, again, generally in line with our expectations. Move-in rates for the quarter and move-in volumes, move-in volumes, again, quite strong. I mean move-in volumes up 10%-ish. Move-in rate did decline a couple of percent so that moderation in asking rent, given the seasonality has played through October as well. But overall, a good move-in month in October as well.\nJuan Sanabria: Great. So was it down 2%, negative 2% year-over-year?\nTom Boyle: Yes, yes, down a couple of questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Your line is now open.\nSpenser Allaway: Apologies if I missed this, but could you comment on cap rates and what you're seeing in terms of the breadth or volume of assets being marketed today?\nJoe Russell: Sure, Spenser. Predictably, this has been a far lighter year as far as sector trading. At the beginning of the year, we saw a little bit of carryover from the volume that played through in 2021, which obviously was historic. But quarter-by-quarter, we've seen the realization set in as interest rates continue to rise and cap rates have adjusted in lockstep, I would tell you that, as always, the more stabilized higher profile or more highly desirable, stabilized assets are likely going to trade at a lower cap rate than otherwise. But I would tell you, year-over-year, we're probably in a zone where cap rates have adjusted by 100 basis points or so. 2021 was an opportune time to be a seller to command, in many cases, historic valuations with a lot of bidding activity at the table. It's a very different environment today. It doesn't mean that trading has ended because we're still seeing some deals trade. There hasn't been anything close to $1 billion or more come into the market, and I doubt will between now and the end of the year. And what we've been able to do is find the same type of asset that we've been very successful integrating in our portfolio with what we feel is a more compelling investment opportunity, where we're inheriting or taking on lease-up opportunity. The $760 million or so that we've transacted on so far this year, average occupancies hovering around 60% or so, that gives us that upside. But the amount of volume needs to continue to grow to really lockstep with what really will basically settle out as a different cap rate environment, but it's -- cap rates are higher.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. That's really helpful. And just given all the commentary and the current economic landscape, I was just wondering if you could walk us through your capital allocation priority list. I mean you sort of just touched on that. But where do you see the most value creation today as you look across your various growth avenues?\nJoe Russell: Sure. It always starts with development. So our development pipeline is $1 billion now. And it has been, and we still see, the inherent opportunity to drive the highest level of value through our development activities, whether it's with ground-up or redevelopment assets. The team is working hard, finding very strong opportunities to either take down vacant land sites or retool existing properties, whether we own or go in and do a redevelopment on an existing asset of some form. So we're still seeing very good returns, and we're keeping the team very busy looking for, even in this environment, an opportunity to do what we can do very differently, which is source deals with fewer competitors at the table. I'll tell you there's been a growing population of owners that are coming to us. Speaking to the risk, I noted in my opening comments, it is far riskier to be a developer today than it was one, two or three years ago. Part of that's been driven by a very new dynamic, which is much higher construction cost lending and just the availability of it, frankly. And then on top of that, we've got inflation playing through. So if you don't have the mechanisms to back down some of the very intense component costs increases, you may find yourself in a very different environment relative to the ultimate return you're going to see on an asset. Land can be more or less expensive depending on the particular market, but there could be more competition there, too. So long story short, more risk of development. But for our own purposes, it's still the highest rate of return that we're seeing from a capital allocation standpoint. And we're very pleased by the deliveries that we put in the market and what we've got going into 2023. Now as far as acquisitions, again, going right back to my prior comments, we're definitely seeing a different environment relative to the cap rates that are playing through, but we are finding good assets still bringing into the portfolio, where we can more often than not by underperforming assets for a variety of reasons, pulling right in the portfolio and get good upside from that. So it's been a unique environment for us to go out and find something stabilized that we're just going to pay a top per square foot value for it because, frankly, we can do better things with our own capital by taking other assets that aren't either mature or have some level of additional upside. And that's been a really good investment opportunity for us, not only with the $5.1 billion that we acquired last year, but the $760 million that we acquired this year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nMike Mueller: I guess kind of as a follow-up to the prior question, what are you underwriting for time frames and returns on developments that you're starting today versus something you would have started a year ago?\nTom Boyle: Sure, Mike. We typically underwrite, and this hasn't changed over the last couple of years despite the fact that lease-up has been quite strong. We typically underwrite three to four years to get to stabilized NOI levels. And obviously, we're in an industry where you start a new property at 0% occupancy, and it takes some time to attract new tenants to that facility and stabilize that tenant base and the ultimate revenue there, so still looking at underwriting three to four years of stabilization.\nMike Mueller: Got it. And I guess on Joe's prior comments about cap rates being up 100 basis points. Is that applicable, too, for, I guess, the value-add acquisitions that you're buying, where you're going in at 60%, 70% leased at low yield? That exit, that ultimate stabilized cap rate, would you say that that's up about 100 as well for what you're looking at?\nJoe Russell: Yes. I think it applies to the overall spectrum of different assets, whether, again, they're in -- they're fully stabilized and/or they're in lease-up. I mean, frankly, it's just the, I think, pretty obvious impact from much higher interest rate levels.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.\nTodd Thomas: I just wanted to stick with investments. Tom, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you're ready to use the balance sheet to grow and that it's well positioned. And so just following up on sort of the line of questioning around investments, where it sounds like cap rates are moving higher. What would you look for in terms of acquisitions to become more aggressive and put the balance sheet to work a bit more? And what's the spread like today with the movement that you're seeing in cap rates between stabilized NOI yields on developments and stabilized acquisitions?\nJoe Russell: So yes, Todd, I'll talk to the first part of your question, and Tom can give you more color on the spreads. But the playbook that we have, I would say, is similar to what you've seen us do over the last two years or more, which is to find and unlock opportunities relative to -- on the acquisition side, the types of assets that we think we're going to be much more benefited by bringing in underperforming assets, putting them in our platform and getting actually very quick improvement. And you've seen that with big scale portfolios that we've taken down. Clearly, 2022 has not been an environment where we've seen the bigger legacy portfolios coming to the market, but the smaller opportunities are at the table. It takes a little bit more volume, obviously, to get to that level of investment that we saw in 2021. But the team is working really hard. We're open for business. We see compelling reasons to go into a variety of different markets where we can additively put assets into the platform, integrate them very quickly and see that upside. On development, again, it's as broad-based as acquisitions in, meaning that we've got 50-plus properties in our pipeline right now in all parts of the United States. We've got a deep seated team. We're looking for very good well-located sites, and we're going to continue to find good capital allocation opportunities through that platform as well. So the investment arena tied to acquisitions is far less predictable than -- because development is much more intentional, obviously. But we're ready. We've got the balance sheet well primed. We'll see how things change going into an environment where we may or may not be in this imminent recession. That, too, can present different opportunities that I think we're very well seated to go out and use our balance sheet to grow the portfolio, just as Tom indicated.\nTom Boyle: Yes. And then, Todd, your question around, clearly, the debt markets have been moving. I think taking a step back, we're looking at the real estate itself in underwriting the cash flow profile associated with that real estate. And we have more and more tools each year to do so, thinking about certainly what we think we can stabilize a property app, but then also thinking about what the growth profile is in submarkets. So it depends asset to asset, submarket to submarket. We use the tools that our data science team has developed around predictive analytics for rent growth, and that all factors into that cash flow profile. So on an unlevered basis, we will also look at replacement costs, and what's the basis that we're achieving with the asset as well. So, all those go into the mix and certainly a range there. On the cost of capital front, no question, debt costs have moved higher. But we do find ourselves in a place where we have on a relative basis versus the industry attractive, both cost and access to capital. And while the spreads have come down certainly on a levered basis, we're looking at the acquisitions that we're purchasing in the fourth quarter. We feel very good about the unlevered returns we're going to achieve and the FFO accretion that we'll achieve in the coming years.\nTodd Thomas: And how do those unlevered returns? Or what's the spread look like between the acquisitions today that you're seeing and what's in the market relative to what you're developing, right? I think your stabilized yield expectations, the NOI, the future NOI that you were discussing that you've outlined for us on developments relative to what market cap rates were -- was pretty wide over the last couple of years. My sense is that, that's narrowing right now, what's that spread look like today?\nTom Boyle: Yes. As you think about development, we do underwrite and seek to achieve a higher return on development because of the risk profile and the lease-up that we just spoke to. We're taking three to four years of lease up there. But ultimately, we're plugging those assets that we've designed the building. We designed the unit mix. We've picked the location and then we're plugging it into the largest and most efficient operating platform in the country. And so that gives us an ability to achieve strong yields on those development projects. Looking at the yields we've historically targeted, we're looking at 8% plus stabilized yields, and we feel good about those sorts of yields continuing moving forward and the unlevered returns associated with that profile.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on something that you mentioned related to occupancy earlier. I appreciate the color on -- that you provided on October. But can you talk about the range of occupancy loss that you might expect now throughout the balance of the off-peak rental season through the end of the year and really into '23? I think I heard you say 92% to 95% is kind of the right range to think about occupancy. Was that what you were referring to and sort of pointing to and what we should think about sort of trough to peak or peak to trough going forward at this point?\nTom Boyle: Yes. I mean, I think generally speaking, that range that I was speaking to is how the Company has operated and maximized revenue through the years. I would say there's definitely a difference by market. And so today, Los Angeles demand remains strong. We obviously haven't been able to move rental rate increases for some time. So occupancies are lower year-over-year in Los Angeles. You typically see higher occupancy in the Los Angeles or San Francisco, given the limited new inventory that's added to those markets on a year-over-year basis, year in and year out. And the flip side is some of the Texas markets where you do see more inventory each year, but at the same time, you're seeing very strong population growth to support that. You typically don't see those same levels of occupancy, and so you're not going to see that level in the Houston per se. And ultimately, the revenue team is looking to maximize the revenue of each individual unit no matter where it is across the country, and so that's going to lead to a different price volume discussion depending on where you are. So hopefully, that's some context. In terms of where we'd anticipate heading through the fourth quarter, we've been consistent that we were expecting more seasonal occupancy decline. We've seen that through the third quarter, and we expect that to continue through the fourth quarter, obviously, market by market, which would point you down towards that 92% sort of occupancy towards the end of the year. And again, from a year-over-year standpoint, that would be relatively consistent with where we are now and would track consistent to 2019-type levels.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ronald Kamden with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRonald Kamdem: Sorry, just going back to the marketing, sort of the marketing expenses and so forth. Maybe can you just a little bit more commentary on if its market specific, sort of what drove that year-over-year increases?\nTom Boyle: Sure. And you're commenting on the year-over-year increase. I'd say largely, we didn't spend in most markets last year. And so yes, there's some big increases on a year-over-year basis coming from zero or close to zero in many markets last year. Ultimately, the marketing spend is managed dynamically by the same team that prices our units. And so that's part of the ingredient on maximizing NOI and maximizing revenue, and so that's managed dynamically in the submarkets. No question. There are some markets that we've supported more than last this year, areas that have more inventory to lease. Typically, we'll receive more marketing support. I'd say Los Angeles is probably still our lowest marketing spend market per property, given the strong demand dynamics we've seen there in our largest market. But that stepping back, like I said earlier, our overall marketing spend for the quarter was about 1.5% of revenue, which is towards the lower end of historical ranges, which gives us tools heading into next year. But when you don't spend much in the prior year or at all in some markets, the year-over-year comparison can look like a big increase.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. That makes sense. And then just my last one would be on -- just on the ECRIs. And when you sort of take a step back and you look at the portfolio, right, record rents, look at the macro environment, inflation and potentially going into a recession, how do you think about sort of the pricing algorithms there? And is there anything that company would consider to think about maybe doing differently? I don't know if it's stress testing or just trying to figure out if the customer or the recommendations may be a little bit different this time versus previous cycles. Like how do you guys sort of square that circle as you go into next year?\nJoe Russell: That's a great -- It's a great question. And I think that what you just highlighted is core to how we price across for existing tenants as well as for new tenants, which is continuous testing. As I mentioned earlier, we have a wealth of information going back in time as well as in the current time period. We send over 1 million rental rate increases a year. That allows us the ability to do significant testing and holdouts to understand whether consumers are behaving as we anticipate and how that consumer would behave in a different level of increase, et cetera. So that's kind of core to the process and certainly will be heading into 2023 as well.\nOperator: It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the program back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Katie, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $4.13 for the quarter, representing 20.8% growth over the third quarter of 2021. Let's look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 14.7%. And breaking down the components, realized rents per occupied square foot were up a strong 17.2% matching last quarter's performance. Weighted average occupancy declined 2.4%. The moderation in occupancy from June to September represented a return to typical pre-pandemic seasonal occupancy decline of 150 basis points. The strong 14.7% growth moderated slightly from last quarter's 15.9% growth as expected. That said, Los Angeles was again a particularly strong contributor, accelerating from 17% same-store revenue growth in the second quarter to 20% in the third quarter. Now on to expenses. Same-store direct cost of operations were up 7.8% in the quarter. We increased our marketing spend in the quarter compared to last year when we were largely quiet in most of our markets, and we saw good returns on those ad dollar spend. Our strategic initiatives, including operating model transformation resulting from digital investments and LED and solar investments, helped offset a portion of the wage and utility inflation. And I note the recent Inflation Reduction Act added incentives for further solar investments as we ramp our own activity to reach over 1,000 properties with solar on our roots in the coming years. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool was up 17% for the quarter. In addition to the same store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired or developed facilities was once again strong, contributing $139 million in NOI for the quarter, up 68%. There is significant growth ahead from this pool of properties, as Joe noted, which is a good segue to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Joe mentioned, we raised our core FFO outlook for the year by $0.20 at the midpoint or 1.3% to $15.55 from our most recent outlook. The improved outlook is driven by better-than-expected performance in our same-store pool, continued strong growth from our non-same-store pool as well as our tenant insurance business. And shifting gears now to our balance sheet. Our capital and liquidity position remains rock solid. We have a well-laddered long-term debt profile with limited floating rate exposure and over $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions. Our leverage of 3.3x net debt and preferred to EBITDA, combined with $900 million of cash on hand at quarter end, puts us in a very strong position heading into 2023. It's our strategy to position ourselves for strong access and cost of capital to invest through cycles. Over the past couple of years, we've had the opportunity to use that balance sheet to grow, and we're ready to do it again. And with that, turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions. Sure. Good question, Michael. And I think you highlighted some of the moving pieces there well. As we came into the year, we were expecting continued strong rate momentum and have been pretty consistent around that, and we've seen that through the first part of the year paired with more typical seasonal behavior and the occupancy rises and falls that we in the industry see year in and year out with maybe the exception of the last couple. On the rate growth side, it's really been driven by two factors. One is really strong move-in rent growth over the last several years. And we've spoken in the past around some of our strongest markets like Miami and, now for us, Los Angeles as well with rent restrictions no longer in place. And that's been a really additive driver. Miami, quarter-to-date move-in rents were up 9%, again, on top of significant growth in prior years. The other side of that is then the existing tenant base, and Joe spoke earlier to the behavior of our existing tenants in the long length of stays that we've experienced over the last several years, and we're sitting now at record length of stays within the portfolio. And that's allowed us to send more rental rate increases because there's more long-term tenants and at higher magnitude because of the overall rent environment, which has led to increased realized rents. This quarter matched last quarter. We have been expecting a moderation through the back half of this year and would anticipate that, that plays through in the fourth quarter and is clearly embedded in our guidance, but year-to-date, we've been able to take advantage of that environment and have achieved strong rental rate growth throughout. I get it. You're asking about 2023 now. So looking at what we're experiencing on moving rent growth, we have seen the moderation in moving rent growth as we move through the year that we've been anticipating and speaking to move-in rent growth. And frankly, move-ins were quite strong in the quarter. We had move-in volumes were up 9%, move-in rates were up 3%, but that 3% is clearly a moderation from where we were earlier in the year and would anticipate that to continue to moderate through the fourth quarter. But as we look forward from here, our guidance would imply that we will exit the year with revenue growing at, call it, 10%, plus or minus, which sets us up really well heading into 2023, recognizing it could be an uncertain environment into 2023, we'll be starting from a period of strength, and so that's what I'd point you to. Yes. As revenue growth decelerates, we could see a narrowing of that. I'd say we have tools, and you highlighted some of them from an initiative standpoint that have been frankly underway for a number of years to help mitigate some of the pressures there. And heading into 2023, the team will be acutely focused on managing expenses in what's a tough environment. So I'm not sure I'd have much to add to that. Yes. And I'd say, overall, trends we're seeing in move-in rate generally link up to the markets that are performing the best overall from a revenue standpoint. So I already highlighted Miami, which continues to be a strong market. It's not seeing move-in rent growth of 25% or 30% a year, any longer but is up 9% in the quarter, one of our stronger markets. And as you'd anticipate, Los Angeles in a similar ZIP code there. In terms of markets that that have seen slower rent growth, again, very consistent with overall performance. I'd highlight San Francisco and New York that while positive on a move-in rent growth year-over-year is a more modest level of growth, call it, low single digits. Joe, I think you covered it well. Yes. Sure, Samir. Happy to dig into that a little bit. As I highlighted earlier, we did see a typical seasonal decline in occupancy. And as we look at occupancy performance at the end of September, we're about 80, 90 basis points over 2019, also over '18, '17 performance. So this is an area of revenue maximization we're ultimately seeking to achieve and are comfortable in that a 92% to 95% occupancy level, which we spent the entire quarter in and feel like we have the tools to ultimately maximize and optimize revenue in that ZIP code. And so feel good about where occupancy is today and clearly have had the benefit of being able to push rent both for our new customers and existing within that occupancy ZIP Code. Yes. I mean I'd say stepping back, we certainly have good tools to manage different types of operating environments, and I think it's too early to speculate exactly what 2023 will look like. But going back in time, we have used promotional discounts. We've used advertising in a more meaningful way. Throughout the pandemic and getting to 2020 and 2021, we really didn't need to use things like promotional discounts or advertising because demand was so strong. Clearly, we could be heading into an environment where that won't be the case. And even in the quarter, we used probably more typical levels of advertising and promotional even in a strong environment. So thinking about advertising spend in the quarter, we spend about 1.5% of revenue in the quarter. And that's towards the low end of our historical range of, call it, 1% to 3%, where in 2019, for instance, we were towards the higher end there. On a promotional basis, similarly, last year, we were hardly offering any promotions. This year, we had very modest promotional discounts in the quarter, about 38% of our customers that moved in, in the quarter, received promotions in a typical year. In the third quarter, that's more like 70%. And so we're still running it at levels that give us a lot of tools heading into next year to navigate what could be a recessionary environment, and we'll certainly use those to our advantage in that environment. And I'm not sure if that answers the question. So sure, Ki Bin, I'll answer it, and Joe can chime in as well. So the way we think about existing tenant rate increases is really around breaking it into a couple of components. One is, understanding how our customers are behaving. And we have a wealth of information and testing data going back years, and it's a constant dynamic testing environment that we live through kind of month-to-month. And that gives us the ability to predict how customers will behave and how they'll react to different sorts of increases. And what we've experienced over the last couple of years, and Joe highlighted this earlier, is customers have found a lot of value in our storage units. And that's, frankly, increased through the pandemic. Length of stays are at record highs, and so the number of tenants eligible to receive an increase have moved higher over the last several years, and they've behaved really well. And so, we've experienced now 9 months or 10 months through 2022, that consumer base has remained remarkably consistent, i.e., the models are predicting what it is that the customers are going to react to and we're seeing very consistent performance. The second component is around when a customer does vacate, what's the cost to replace that tenant. And certainly, over the past couple of years, the cost of -- to replace that tenant has decreased as move-in demand has been strong, moving rates have been higher. And as we move through 2022, as anticipated, some of that is moderating. And I would note move-in demand continues to be very healthy. And as I noted earlier, we had a good move-in quarter with move-in volumes up 9% but moderating from earlier in the year. And so that component of the existing tenant rate increase program is likely to result in moderating overall activity as we move forward. But that's just one piece of it. And as consumers continue to behave well and length of stays are longer, that gives us incremental tools on the other side of the equation in effect. It's pretty consistent. What we've seen is really across the board depending on you slice and dice the tenants by demographies, psychographics, et cetera, you'd see relatively broad-based increases in vacate levels up from the really lows that we experienced in 2020 and 2021. But move-out volumes remain attractive, frankly, versus pre-pandemic levels. And so again, both the mix of tenants has moved more favorably. And as you slice and dice that tenant base, they continue to perform well versus pre-pandemic levels, although off last year is really record highs or record lows. Thanks, Ki Bin. Yes. One maybe I'd highlight we have had an ability to increase move-in rents through most of the year, and we've had some moderation as expected as we move through the year. I think as we've moved into the fall and into a more seasonal decline in occupancy, we've seen the industry broadly away from us lowering their rental rates because they have more inventory, and I think that that's to be expected, and we certainly have seen that over the last couple of months, which is leading to a different environment than what we saw last year, right, which we didn't see a seasonal decline in occupancy. So as you think about the scarcity of inventory different year-over-year, you're going to see a different rental rate behavior across the industry, and we've seen that. And we're not -- we're seeing some moderation, and I think the rest of the industry looking at what streets that many of you report are showing some declines as well. The flip side is web visits continue to be strong. Our web visits, so you should think about having a little bit more inventory, maybe a little bit more of a seasonal decline in rental rates, the overall demand environment remains healthy. Web visits were flat, basically right on top of what was a record year last year through the third quarter. So speaking to the move-in environment and the move-in volumes certainly performing well through the third quarter is the counterbalance of that rate discussion. Yes. Occupancy, as we look at the end of October, declined a little bit as we anticipate as we move through the fall. So I think occupancy ended up at or 92.8 rather at the end of October, down from the 93.3 at the end of September, again, generally in line with our expectations. Move-in rates for the quarter and move-in volumes, move-in volumes, again, quite strong. I mean move-in volumes up 10%-ish. Move-in rate did decline a couple of percent so that moderation in asking rent, given the seasonality has played through October as well. But overall, a good move-in month in October as well. Yes, yes, down a couple of questions. Sure, Mike. We typically underwrite, and this hasn't changed over the last couple of years despite the fact that lease-up has been quite strong. We typically underwrite three to four years to get to stabilized NOI levels. And obviously, we're in an industry where you start a new property at 0% occupancy, and it takes some time to attract new tenants to that facility and stabilize that tenant base and the ultimate revenue there, so still looking at underwriting three to four years of stabilization. Yes. And then, Todd, your question around, clearly, the debt markets have been moving. I think taking a step back, we're looking at the real estate itself in underwriting the cash flow profile associated with that real estate. And we have more and more tools each year to do so, thinking about certainly what we think we can stabilize a property app, but then also thinking about what the growth profile is in submarkets. So it depends asset to asset, submarket to submarket. We use the tools that our data science team has developed around predictive analytics for rent growth, and that all factors into that cash flow profile. So on an unlevered basis, we will also look at replacement costs, and what's the basis that we're achieving with the asset as well. So, all those go into the mix and certainly a range there. On the cost of capital front, no question, debt costs have moved higher. But we do find ourselves in a place where we have on a relative basis versus the industry attractive, both cost and access to capital. And while the spreads have come down certainly on a levered basis, we're looking at the acquisitions that we're purchasing in the fourth quarter. We feel very good about the unlevered returns we're going to achieve and the FFO accretion that we'll achieve in the coming years. Yes. As you think about development, we do underwrite and seek to achieve a higher return on development because of the risk profile and the lease-up that we just spoke to. We're taking three to four years of lease up there. But ultimately, we're plugging those assets that we've designed the building. We designed the unit mix. We've picked the location and then we're plugging it into the largest and most efficient operating platform in the country. And so that gives us an ability to achieve strong yields on those development projects. Looking at the yields we've historically targeted, we're looking at 8% plus stabilized yields, and we feel good about those sorts of yields continuing moving forward and the unlevered returns associated with that profile. Yes. I mean, I think generally speaking, that range that I was speaking to is how the Company has operated and maximized revenue through the years. I would say there's definitely a difference by market. And so today, Los Angeles demand remains strong. We obviously haven't been able to move rental rate increases for some time. So occupancies are lower year-over-year in Los Angeles. You typically see higher occupancy in the Los Angeles or San Francisco, given the limited new inventory that's added to those markets on a year-over-year basis, year in and year out. And the flip side is some of the Texas markets where you do see more inventory each year, but at the same time, you're seeing very strong population growth to support that. You typically don't see those same levels of occupancy, and so you're not going to see that level in the Houston per se. And ultimately, the revenue team is looking to maximize the revenue of each individual unit no matter where it is across the country, and so that's going to lead to a different price volume discussion depending on where you are. So hopefully, that's some context. In terms of where we'd anticipate heading through the fourth quarter, we've been consistent that we were expecting more seasonal occupancy decline. We've seen that through the third quarter, and we expect that to continue through the fourth quarter, obviously, market by market, which would point you down towards that 92% sort of occupancy towards the end of the year. And again, from a year-over-year standpoint, that would be relatively consistent with where we are now and would track consistent to 2019-type levels. Sure. And you're commenting on the year-over-year increase. I'd say largely, we didn't spend in most markets last year. And so yes, there's some big increases on a year-over-year basis coming from zero or close to zero in many markets last year. Ultimately, the marketing spend is managed dynamically by the same team that prices our units. And so that's part of the ingredient on maximizing NOI and maximizing revenue, and so that's managed dynamically in the submarkets. No question. There are some markets that we've supported more than last this year, areas that have more inventory to lease. Typically, we'll receive more marketing support. I'd say Los Angeles is probably still our lowest marketing spend market per property, given the strong demand dynamics we've seen there in our largest market. But that stepping back, like I said earlier, our overall marketing spend for the quarter was about 1.5% of revenue, which is towards the lower end of historical ranges, which gives us tools heading into next year. But when you don't spend much in the prior year or at all in some markets, the year-over-year comparison can look like a big increase."

            "name": "Joe Russell",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I will highlight our view of 2022 as we head into the last two months of the year, and then Tom will cover more specifics in the quarter. At the beginning of this year, our expectation was we were poised for exceptional earnings growth, which has clearly played through. With that, we raised our outlook on strong NOI performance in same-store and non-same-store assets, along with continued improvement in ancillary revenue. In total, core FFO is set to grow by over 20% for the second consecutive year. Looking back on both 2021 and now 2022, we have been particularly advantaged by a number of enduring demand factors that continue to drive historic performance. Customers are drawn to use self-storage even in an environment where some top line drivers are decelerating, such as home sales and market-to-market migration levels. The appeal and rationale to use storage is still tied to a sensible financial and need-based decision, where the cost of shelter, whether you own a rent, has increased dramatically. In addition, our customer survey data points to needing more space at home as the second and elevated driver to use storage. Hybrid work environments, for instance, are proving to be sustainable -- to be a sustainable reason for additional need for storage. For our business customers, renting a storage unit is a compelling alternative to taking down more expensive, less flexible industrial space. As demand has remained very good, existing customers, too, are staying longer, giving us the ability to optimize rate increases and occupancy. On a macro basis, new supply of competitive product has been flat to down from peak deliveries in 2019. Nationally, markets have been able to absorb the more subdued pace of new development. Our view is that new development will also be static for the near term as risk levels tied to development have increased, particularly due to city approval time frames, higher component costs and the dramatic increases in the cost of construction lending. With this said, it has become harder to predict the economic environment we are heading into with record inflation and consensus that the recession is imminent. We are, however, highly confident we have excellent tools to maneuver changing macro conditions. These include the industry-leading 200 million square foot portfolio of well-located assets in every large scale market nationally, the most recognized brand in the self-storage industry, cost-efficient online marketing prowess to guide new customers to our platform. A broad and growing base of digital channels to source new customers while improving customer and employee satisfaction, historically high operating margins now above 80% and operational efficiency, a massive non-same-store portfolio which continues to grow through acquisitions and development that is now 50 million square feet with excellent earnings power with over $150 million of additional NOI to come, a well-primed low leverage and low-risk balance sheet with $900 million of cash and no debt expirations through 2023, and finally the most experienced team in the self-storage sector. Now I'll hand the call over to Tom. Sure. Lizzy, the behavior of our customer base even from a delinquency standpoint, I think, is a can to the elevated and consistent behavior we're seeing from a length of stay. And what I mean by that is the customer base as a whole continues to operate from a delinquency standpoint at nearly historically low levels. It's elevated up somewhat from where we were, say, a year ago, but nowhere close to what we saw pre-pandemic or what you would consider typical environment. Consumer balance sheets statistically appear to be in decent, if not surprisingly good shape going into 2023. We're seeing this in a number of different reports that we track relative to some of the banking platforms and other tracking mechanisms tied to the overall health of the consumer. And from an unemployment standpoint, we're clearly also seeing very little disruption, in fact, surprisingly good traction relative to overall employment levels. And then holistically, that still just ties back to one of my opening comments, which from a financial and need-based standpoint, storage continues to be a very necessary source of either relief or needing more space or other reasons that consumers continue to value and pay for on a much more consistent base, their storage storage units. So overall, a very close eye up, but nothing alarming by any means. Yes, I'll start, and then Tom can give you a little bit more color on some of the specific markets. You mentioned L.A., for instance, very strong growth in that market, and we think that serves us well going into 2023. It's clearly our largest market, and we've been held back now for some period of time, i.e., over three years, but we see very good continued rate growth and momentum in that market as we speak. Florida as a whole continues to be still quite strong. We're seeing very good inherent drivers and good absorption of not only move-in rates, but existing customer rate increases as well. And then from an overall standpoint, as I mentioned, we're seeing pretty muted new deliveries. So that, too, has not been an overarching pain point literally in any of the markets that we operate in. That's a very good thing. It's been a good thing for the sector for the last couple of years, and we don't see that changing in any material fashion going into 2023, and frankly, keeping a close eye in 2024, but not an elevated concern there either. Tom, you can give a little bit more color on some of the trends, otherwise that we're seeing in specific markets. Yes, Samir. I'll give you a couple of general comments. And again, Tom can add more context. But it goes back to a number of very intentional investments that we've made year by year, many of which have been digitally-oriented. It's helped us optimize the amount of labor hours, for instance, our second highest expense costs in the P&L. And it's given us the ability to predict, optimize and rationalize the amount of labor that is necessary, which has been very positively impacted by another digital tool, which is our eRental platform. Now 55-plus percent of our customer base is choosing that to transact with us. It's a digital experience. Obviously, it doesn't require at-the-counter labor. So we can shift some of that traditional labor to other priorities' property to property. So that's been a very good optimization tool. It hasn't in any way relieved us of some of the pressure we're seeing from a hourly basis, but it's certainly been a very effective tool to minimize that impact. We're also making strong investments. Tom mentioned some of the things that we've started to do over the last couple of years with solar. Utilities are under a lot of pressure market to market. We've got a great opportunity and an accelerated investment going into our solar platform. We have, as I mentioned, 200 million square feet of assets. That equates to about 150 million square feet or more of rooftops that are wide open for investments. And then another thing that continues to change in the business that we continue to optimize is the amount of remote operations, property to property that makes sense. We've been testing this for the last three years. We've got a fleet of kiosks, for instance, in our portfolio that today is about 200. We're continuing to evaluate that property by property, and we're just looking for any and all tools to continue to rationalize the pressure you're speaking to. And we've been pleased. And it's certainly playing through in our margins, which this quarter, again, we're over 80%. So Tom, you can add any additional color to that. Yes, Smedes. First of all, fortunately, we did not see a heavy impact from the hurricane itself. Our team did an admirable job on a number of fronts. We closed plus or minus 100 properties or so for a period of a few days, first and foremost, to keep employees and customers in a very safe environment. We were very fortunate, as I mentioned, we only had 12 to 15 properties that had, I would call, any level of significant impact, mostly flooding-related. The property claims are roughly $2 million or so, and then the tenant insurance claims are at this point expected to be about $4 million. And statistically, we're dealing with, plus or minus, say, 3,000, 3,500 units. So very small and, as I mentioned, fortunate occurrence for us relative to where properties are located and the impact, we're clearly seeing obviously, a lot of retooling going on to those areas for overall recovery, but fortunately, not a lot of economic impact to us specifically. Yes. Juan, I mentioned Los Angeles, certainly one of our top-performing markets. And we've got more to go there, frankly. I mean you step back and you think about not only the fact that we've been handcuffed for three-plus years, it is a market where there's very little, new product coming into the market, very good dynamics relative to inherent deep-seated demand. We've seen a little bit of move-out volume, but it's come right back on the move-in side. Occupancies are still quite strong, and we think we've got good pricing opportunities even going into 2023. So this has not ended. Sure, Spenser. Predictably, this has been a far lighter year as far as sector trading. At the beginning of the year, we saw a little bit of carryover from the volume that played through in 2021, which obviously was historic. But quarter-by-quarter, we've seen the realization set in as interest rates continue to rise and cap rates have adjusted in lockstep, I would tell you that, as always, the more stabilized higher profile or more highly desirable, stabilized assets are likely going to trade at a lower cap rate than otherwise. But I would tell you, year-over-year, we're probably in a zone where cap rates have adjusted by 100 basis points or so. 2021 was an opportune time to be a seller to command, in many cases, historic valuations with a lot of bidding activity at the table. It's a very different environment today. It doesn't mean that trading has ended because we're still seeing some deals trade. There hasn't been anything close to $1 billion or more come into the market, and I doubt will between now and the end of the year. And what we've been able to do is find the same type of asset that we've been very successful integrating in our portfolio with what we feel is a more compelling investment opportunity, where we're inheriting or taking on lease-up opportunity. The $760 million or so that we've transacted on so far this year, average occupancies hovering around 60% or so, that gives us that upside. But the amount of volume needs to continue to grow to really lockstep with what really will basically settle out as a different cap rate environment, but it's -- cap rates are higher. Sure. It always starts with development. So our development pipeline is $1 billion now. And it has been, and we still see, the inherent opportunity to drive the highest level of value through our development activities, whether it's with ground-up or redevelopment assets. The team is working hard, finding very strong opportunities to either take down vacant land sites or retool existing properties, whether we own or go in and do a redevelopment on an existing asset of some form. So we're still seeing very good returns, and we're keeping the team very busy looking for, even in this environment, an opportunity to do what we can do very differently, which is source deals with fewer competitors at the table. I'll tell you there's been a growing population of owners that are coming to us. Speaking to the risk, I noted in my opening comments, it is far riskier to be a developer today than it was one, two or three years ago. Part of that's been driven by a very new dynamic, which is much higher construction cost lending and just the availability of it, frankly. And then on top of that, we've got inflation playing through. So if you don't have the mechanisms to back down some of the very intense component costs increases, you may find yourself in a very different environment relative to the ultimate return you're going to see on an asset. Land can be more or less expensive depending on the particular market, but there could be more competition there, too. So long story short, more risk of development. But for our own purposes, it's still the highest rate of return that we're seeing from a capital allocation standpoint. And we're very pleased by the deliveries that we put in the market and what we've got going into 2023. Now as far as acquisitions, again, going right back to my prior comments, we're definitely seeing a different environment relative to the cap rates that are playing through, but we are finding good assets still bringing into the portfolio, where we can more often than not by underperforming assets for a variety of reasons, pulling right in the portfolio and get good upside from that. So it's been a unique environment for us to go out and find something stabilized that we're just going to pay a top per square foot value for it because, frankly, we can do better things with our own capital by taking other assets that aren't either mature or have some level of additional upside. And that's been a really good investment opportunity for us, not only with the $5.1 billion that we acquired last year, but the $760 million that we acquired this year. Yes. I think it applies to the overall spectrum of different assets, whether, again, they're in -- they're fully stabilized and/or they're in lease-up. I mean, frankly, it's just the, I think, pretty obvious impact from much higher interest rate levels. So yes, Todd, I'll talk to the first part of your question, and Tom can give you more color on the spreads. But the playbook that we have, I would say, is similar to what you've seen us do over the last two years or more, which is to find and unlock opportunities relative to -- on the acquisition side, the types of assets that we think we're going to be much more benefited by bringing in underperforming assets, putting them in our platform and getting actually very quick improvement. And you've seen that with big scale portfolios that we've taken down. Clearly, 2022 has not been an environment where we've seen the bigger legacy portfolios coming to the market, but the smaller opportunities are at the table. It takes a little bit more volume, obviously, to get to that level of investment that we saw in 2021. But the team is working really hard. We're open for business. We see compelling reasons to go into a variety of different markets where we can additively put assets into the platform, integrate them very quickly and see that upside. On development, again, it's as broad-based as acquisitions in, meaning that we've got 50-plus properties in our pipeline right now in all parts of the United States. We've got a deep seated team. We're looking for very good well-located sites, and we're going to continue to find good capital allocation opportunities through that platform as well. So the investment arena tied to acquisitions is far less predictable than -- because development is much more intentional, obviously. But we're ready. We've got the balance sheet well primed. We'll see how things change going into an environment where we may or may not be in this imminent recession. That, too, can present different opportunities that I think we're very well seated to go out and use our balance sheet to grow the portfolio, just as Tom indicated. That's a great -- It's a great question. And I think that what you just highlighted is core to how we price across for existing tenants as well as for new tenants, which is continuous testing. As I mentioned earlier, we have a wealth of information going back in time as well as in the current time period. We send over 1 million rental rate increases a year. That allows us the ability to do significant testing and holdouts to understand whether consumers are behaving as we anticipate and how that consumer would behave in a different level of increase, et cetera. So that's kind of core to the process and certainly will be heading into 2023 as well."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Chelsea. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings call. I\u2019m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today, August 5, 2022, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release.

We do ask that you initially limit yourselves to two questions. Of course, if you have an additional question, feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thank you, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Tom and I will cover second quarter highlights as we achieved a number of record performance metrics and milestones. Now that we are past the midpoint of the year, we are happy to share our view of the next six months, which has resulted in our guidance raise. Before I go to those details, I would like to take a brief moment and acknowledge a significant milestone for Public Storage that takes place this month. On August 14, 1972, Public Storage was launched by two creative and determined entrepreneurs, Wayne Hughes and Ken Volk, opening the first Public Storage facility in El Cajon, California. The concept of paying to store stuff was new. But the simple name, a great location and roll up doors painted the color of orange created a powerful formula to grow the Company, so much so that our brand quickly became synonymous with the self-storage industry. Now five decades later, the Public Storage team and I are inspired to stay just as focused on entrepreneurial pursuits, expanding the iconic Public Storage brand and empowering the 5,500-plus dedicated employees that cater to our 1.7 million customers on a daily basis. We are appreciative of our shareholders, particularly those that have continued their commitment to Public Storage over our history, while knowing we have the right culture to ensure an equally bright future. Now to Q2 results. Business year-to-date remains quite good, with robust performance in both, our same-store and non-same-store portfolios. New customer demand through the typical summer leasing season has been exceptional as well as growing length of stay with existing customers. This, against the backdrop of muted new property deliveries in most markets. We have good pricing dynamics on both, move-ins and with existing customer rate increases, leading to the highest rent levels we have seen historically. Arguably, a number of the pandemic-related drivers to our business are receding, but we are pleased to see elevated levels of demand, new customer adoption and longevity of use. Customers, consumers and businesses alike are still in need of more space for a variety of reasons that include decreasing affordability of renting or owning a home, tight inventories of commercial space, hybrid work environments and the typical movement that takes place nationally this time of year. I would like to highlight a handful of particularly significant milestones or first in the quarter. We achieved $1 billion in revenue. Our average length of stay is now 39 months. Operating margins exceeded 80%. Our development pipeline has reached $1 billion and being named by Forbes as Best Place to Work by our employees. Now to acquisitions. By all accounts, 2021 was a historic year, and we were pleased to capture approximately 30% of the total sector volume. These 230 assets are performing well, in fact, above expectation with more growth ahead for the entire 525 properties in the non-same-store portfolio that is now over 50 million square feet. As we anticipated, 2022 acquisition volume has shifted down with fewer large portfolios entering the market. We are also getting more last calls from sellers and brokers with fewer buyers in the market. Cap rates have adjusted up and could move further. It\u2019s a different playing field, and we anticipate some interesting opportunities with over $1 billion in cash, a balance sheet prime for growth and a reputation as a preferred buyer. The self-storage sector and our own history point of resilience in times of economic change, including recessions of varying degrees. We too are looking for all ways to interpret any shift in customer demand and behavior. We are well positioned to compete for customers across all of our markets with the exceptional scale and product offerings in the 39 states we operate in. Our same-store and non-same-store assets are poised to deliver strong results through the second half of 2022, positioning us well for whatever may play through as we enter 2023. Our leadership team is well equipped to grow and deliver exceptional shareholder returns. Now Tom will share some financial highlights with you as well. Tom?\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $3.99 for the quarter, representing 26.7% growth over the second quarter of 2021. Our first half results represent a strong start to the year and an acceleration from 2021. Let\u2019s look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 15.9% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Growth was driven by rate once again with two factors leading to the continued strength: first, strong move-in rates that were up 12% versus 2021; and secondly, existing tenant rate increases contributing with a lengthening customer stay. Los Angeles was a particularly strong contributor accelerating from 12% same-store revenue growth in the first quarter to 17% in the second quarter and will continue to accelerate into the third. Moving down the P&L. Same-store cost of operations were up 7.6%, driven by growth in property payroll, utilities and marketing. Our strategic initiatives, including operating model efficiencies and LED and solar investments helped offset a portion of the wage and utility inflation. In total, net operating income with the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 18.7% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter. There is significant growth ahead from this pool of properties as well, which is a good segue to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Joe mentioned, we raised our outlook for the second half. In April, we provided our core FFO outlook with a $15.20 midpoint. The PSA business outlook improved by $0.37 or 2.4%. The improved outlook is driven by strong performance from our non-same-store pool of assets and to a lesser extent, ancillary growth and a reduction in interest expense. On net, our year-to-date performance has been in line with our expectations, but our outlook for the second half is improving. We did reflect the impact of the sale of PS Business Parks and a corresponding $0.22 impact resulting in a new midpoint of $15.35 per share of core FFO. And associated with the PSB sale, yesterday, we paid a $13.15 special dividend, returning capital to our shareholders. Overall, our capital and liquidity position remain strong, as Joe mentioned. We have a well laddered long-term debt profile and $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions. With $1 billion of cash on hand at quarter end and 3.7 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA we\u2019re well positioned to finance the growth initiatives ahead. With that, we\u2019d like to open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. Good morning. I guess, my first question, could we maybe discuss a little bit more, flesh out your comment on the outlook for the second half is improving, please? And how does that -- I guess, your thoughts then how -- heading into \u201823, how that impacts the setup into \u201823?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Jeff, Good morning. As Tom and I highlighted, we continue to be encouraged by the health of the business. You start with customer demand. Quite good. We\u2019re seeing top of the funnel demand that continues to encourage us that the adoption of self-storage is quite robust across our markets. The existing customer behavior has been consistent, and if anything, continues to encourage us relative to customers needing and using their space for longer periods of time. Our average length of stay now is 39 months. Compare that to about a year ago, and it was around 34 months, very encouraging. The things that I spoke to relative to muted deliveries across, again, the national market as a whole are also quite healthy, meaning that we\u2019re not seeing any particular market getting burdened by an unusual or heavy level of new supply. That\u2019s always a good thing for the business. And we\u2019re, again, measuring the changing dynamics that go with the 1.7 million customer base that we have. And we\u2019re really not seeing from a cohort standpoint, any change in behavior or elevated levels of stress by cohort. So that too is very encouraging. So, with all that said, coupled with the fact our same-store continues to perform quite well. And on an exceptional basis, our non-same store, as I mentioned, is very well poised to continue to deliver good results, not only through this second half of the year, but going into 2023. With all that said, Tom can give you a little bit of perspective on what we\u2019re thinking through the end of the year and what that positions us to do going into 2023?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Thanks, Joe. So, in particular, I\u2019ll highlight two elements as we think about where we\u2019ll play out through the second half and then go into 2023 and I\u2019ll hit on both the same-store as well as the non-same-store because I think they\u2019re both important. So, as we look at the same store, as you recall, we initiated a strong outlook for same-store illustrating or demonstrating acceleration from 2021 at the start of the year. And frankly, we\u2019re executing right along that path. So, the assumptions as we move into the second half on the same-store are pretty consistent and quite strong with modest deceleration into the second half given the tough comps that we have, particularly on rates, but also the typical seasonal occupancy pattern that we\u2019re expecting this year more so than we\u2019ve seen in the last couple. So, call it a 250 basis-point occupancy decline. So strong trends within the same store. And if you just look at what the first half performance is and the implied outlook for the second half, it implies an outlook or an exit level of revenue growth with low double digits on it, which is frankly not too dissimilar to where we started this year. So, a good outlook through the same-store in the second half and then I\u2019m expecting your question is leading to the 2023, which is also a good setup for 2023. On the non-same-store, as we\u2019ve highlighted now a number of times in our prepared remarks, continues to exceed our expectations. And so we did lift our outlook for the year in the non-same-store by $40 million. But importantly, that wasn\u2019t just a pull forward of stabilization activity. We actually raised our outlook of what those assets will stabilize with. And so there continues to be a strong outlook for growth in 2023 and beyond from that level of capital that we deployed to date. So, all encouraging trends as we look forward to 2023.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thanks. Very helpful. And then my one follow-up. Joe, you commented on cap rates are up and we saw you at NAREIT, I think there\u2019s still somewhat limited information, but I\u2019d say this earnings season is still a key debate really across all sectors. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about your comment on cap rates? But I guess, most important on maybe asset values, like do you think -- where do you think storage asset values are today versus, let\u2019s say, six months ago?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Jeff, there\u2019s a few elements that go into that. So, as I mentioned, trading volumes definitely at a different place year-to-date than we were in 2021 at this time. As I mentioned, far fewer, if any of the big jumbo size hovering $1 billion or more portfolios, either come to the market or traded. So, the level of information that we\u2019re tracking relative to cap rate impact goes to the segment of the market that is much smaller, whether they\u2019re individual assets, smaller portfolios, and there\u2019s a range playing through depending on the asset quality, the stabilization of a particular asset, et cetera. But there\u2019s no question, as you would expect, as interest rates are behaving the way they are i.e., they\u2019re increasing and depending on what the Fed continues to do downstream, we\u2019ll see what additional impact we have relative to just interest rate levels themselves. Bidding activity plays through, meaning how aggressive or less aggressive our buyer is going to be for certain types of assets. So, we\u2019ll see how cap rates continue to trend, but our view is they\u2019ve elevated plus or minus, say, 50 basis points. They could trend a little bit higher. But again, it\u2019s going to be subject to the amount of capital that\u2019s still anxious to come into the sector. I mentioned our team is seeing what I would call more last calls. We think that\u2019s a good thing, meaning that -- at the end of the day, maybe some of the feverish buying activity that was in part of the market in 2021 is softened. That always gives us a different opportunity to engage with certain sellers relative to their need to actually do a transaction. As I mentioned, we are clearly looked upon as a very preferred buyer. We know typically the asset at hand quite well in many cases, maybe even better than the owner, may know either the submarket or the opportunity that might be tied to an asset. So, a lot of things that come into the mix that can affect cap rates. But as I mentioned, I think that too can be very healthy and particularly for a well-heeled and deep-seated buyer and knowledge a buyer like we are, that can be a very compelling time to engage with an owner. And we\u2019re seeing activity to that degree. So, we\u2019ll continue to pace and see what change plays through. But as you would expect with the change in interest rates alone, there\u2019s going to be some movement in cap rates.\nOperator: Our next questions will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: I wanted to dig into a comment that was made earlier about some of the properties in the non-same-store pool that are expecting to stabilize at a higher level. Can you provide a little bit more information on that? And then, I guess, related to that, how does that change your process of underwriting or acquiring your portfolio as your properties start to move higher, stabilize and stabilize at a higher level?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Mike, I\u2019ll start with a few things. First, if you think about the strategy that we\u2019ve deployed now for the last two years plus, we\u2019ve entered transactions with a priority around finding additional upside in any asset acquisition that we\u2019re either entertaining or bringing into the portfolio. So, of the $5.1 billion of asset acquisitions that we did in 2021, average occupancy hovered around 60% to 65%. So, by design, we\u2019ve been very focused on finding and taking assets that may be either at a state of fill-up or a state of optimization that clearly hasn\u2019t met either the owner\u2019s expectation or an optimization level that we feel that we can clearly achieve, once we own the asset. So, that has given us a very compelling opportunity to drive the types of returns that Tom spoke about that, in many cases, are even more elevated than we expected when we bought the assets. A couple of very simple examples, that\u2019s definitely playing through with the two bigger portfolios that we bought in 2021, the easy storage portfolio that we took down in April of last year, a $1.8 billion transaction, seeing very good lift relative to not only the results we expected in the first year, but we\u2019re even doing better than expectation. And then, the same thing is playing through with All Storage, the transaction that we did in the fourth quarter, again, another large portfolio. But the same type of trajectory is honestly playing through with the one-off and the much smaller portfolios as well. And part of that, again, by strategy and design, we\u2019ve been very focused on identifying assets that we can bring into the portfolio and drive much further optimization through not only fill-up of maturation of the existing revenue base, the customer base, et cetera. Tom, you can give a little bit of color, if you like to relative to some specifics.\nTom Boyle: Yes. Thanks, Joe. So Michael, I\u2019ll give you some of the financial components that we included in guidance that we\u2019re providing to in order to be able to model this a little bit easier. So, for the year, as part of our core FFO outlook, we\u2019re providing a non-same-store NOI contribution number. And in addition to that, there\u2019s a line item below core FFO that is the non-same-store NOI to stabilization, which will occur after 2022. And so you can think about adding those two numbers together to reach our view of stabilized NOI of that pool. And so, if you look back in April, our non-same-store NOI contribution for 2022 in our guidance was a midpoint of $450 million, and we included at the bottom of the page $180 million of incremental NOI to stabilization. So, if you add those two numbers together, you\u2019re going to get your $630 million of stabilized NOI. If you compare that to this quarter, we lifted our non-same-store outlook by $40 million at the midpoint. So, you\u2019re looking at a $490 million NOI contribution from the non-same-store pool in the calendar year 2022. But then we also retained that line item below at $172 million of incremental NOI to stabilization. So, if you add those two numbers together, the $490 million and the $172 million, you get to $662 million. So, in effect, we raised our outlook for ultimate stabilization by $32 million to $662 million. So, again, an improving outlook. The performance we\u2019re seeing this year is not just a pull forward of stabilization. It\u2019s also outperformance and outperformance versus expectations.\nJoe Russell: And Mike, one other thing I\u2019d add, we haven\u2019t spoken to the performance of our development assets. And those two not only continue to drive very good returns, but are beating expectations relative to, again, level of lease-up, the performance of the asset. We clearly have very unique advantage being the only public developer of the product in the space and by far, the largest developer in the sector. The team is doing a very nice job identifying prime land sites, using many of the data elements that we uniquely have to find pockets of opportunities, whether they\u2019re markets that are more mature and/or growing markets, and those assets to continue to drive very good returns. As I noted, our development pipeline for the first time hit $1 billion. We\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019ve got a nice window to continue to find compelling opportunities, and we\u2019ll continue to allocate capital in that arena as well, which has been very fruitful.\nMichael Goldsmith: That\u2019s very helpful. And then, as a follow-up, the non-same-store pool outperformed the expectations. The same-store pool has been in line with your expectations. As we look ahead, how much of a non-same-store portfolio is -- through the same store pool in 2023 as we think of kind of the maturation of these stabilized assets?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Thanks, Michael. So, the first thing I\u2019d highlight is, as we think about adding properties to our same-store pool, we\u2019re focused on adding them when they\u2019re stabilized. And so, as I just walked through, there\u2019s meaningful NOI contribution to come from those assets before they reach stabilization in the coming years. And so, we won\u2019t add those into the same-store pool until they\u2019ve reached that stabilized level. And so, there will be some properties added. But as we just demonstrated, there\u2019s significant growth ahead that will sit in the non-same-store versus the same-store pool as we move into 2023. And we\u2019ll continue to provide the level of disclosure that we do today by acquisition and development vintage, so that you can see and track that performance over time.\nOperator: Our next questions will come from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Just going back to your comments about any kind of consumer trends that you might be seeing. Are there any discernible trends between maybe weaker demographic type of customers when they get a rent increase letter versus higher income customers, or are they all kind of responding in a similar fashion?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So specifically around rent increases, I\u2019ll hit that and then maybe I\u2019ll take a step back as well and talk about overall customer trends as I think that may be instructive. The existing tenant rate increase program is something that obviously has been running for a very long time, but it\u2019s an area we continue to make investments in and it\u2019s really driven by extensive testing. Joe mentioned we have over 1.7 million customers today. We send over 1 million rent increases a year, and that gives us the ability to dynamically manage that program and frankly, use data science today in a way that we couldn\u2019t use in years past. And so that program continues to improve, and ultimately, we continue to see the benefit of that program in our realized rents. In terms of customer reaction, that\u2019s a really important part of the program is to understand what we predict the customer behavior to be, and we\u2019re constantly tuning and understanding if there\u2019s any shifts in ultimate behavior. And I\u2019d say year-to-date is, in fact, customers are behaving as good or better, frankly, than what our models have been predicting for them as we move through the year. So continue to see good behavior from our customers. And as Joe mentioned, the length of stay continues to extend, which is a really favorable trend for that program as there are more customers to send increases too. So, that all played out well. And then, I think your second question around or the second component that I want to focus on is around demographics. And are we seeing any shifts in customer behavior by demographics, even away from that data-driven existing tenant approach? And the short answer is we\u2019re not really seeing anything across the customer base and continue to see broad-based strength. There are a few operating metrics that if you look at them versus last year, they\u2019re deteriorating. So, things like move-outs, right, that move-outs are higher for us and I think across the sector, but they\u2019re off incredibly low bases and still well below pre-pandemic levels. You could say the same thing around delinquency, et cetera. But as you slice and dice that by demography or other customer segments, nothing there that\u2019s percolating that we\u2019d highlight as being concerning, frankly, overall continued broad-based strength around the customer base.\nKi Bin Kim: And on the same topic on ECRI, can you just describe high level, what types of increases you\u2019re pushing out there? And maybe the frequency?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So, what we\u2019ve highlighted in the past is the magnitude and frequency of our increases are really driven by two components. One is what do we anticipate the reaction to be to the increase. And as I just spoke to, that performance has been as good or better than our expectations and, frankly, better than history. And the second component is an optimization based on if the customer moves out, what\u2019s the cost to replace that tenant. And in both instances versus pre-pandemic levels, they\u2019re both pointing to higher magnitude and frequency of increase. And so, if in the past, we were sending 8% to 10% increases to our longer term tenants, we\u2019re sending higher increases today and higher frequency.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald, your line is now open. Ronald, are you by chance muted?\nTom Boyle: Why don\u2019t we go to the next question, and we can let Ron jump back in queue.\nOperator: All right. Next, we\u2019ll take Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: I guess I just wanted to circle up. Your first half results were obviously very strong, up 19.5%. I know you didn\u2019t change guidance, but I guess, to hit the low end of the range on NOI, you need to be like at 7% in the back half of the year. And just given the commentary that you\u2019ve talked about, it seems highly unlikely even with tough comps. So I guess what are we missing at the low end or is it just pretty clear that you\u2019re sort of at the midpoint, the high end at this point, but you\u2019re still sort of in that range? And just sort of the low end just seems very unfavorable.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the question. I guess, what I\u2019d characterize is obviously, we\u2019re not going to change the outlook here on the call. But what I\u2019d say is when we set the outlook at the beginning of the year and we continue to reaffirm it is we wanted to set a wider range to encapsulate a broader range of outcomes. That\u2019s both on the high end as well as the low end, given the uncertainty of a month-to-month lease business and frankly, how dynamic the industry has performed over the last several years. And so, we did set a broad range. And as we move through the second half, there\u2019s still a reasonable range of outcomes that could play out in the environment. And so, we didn\u2019t touch the range. But to your point, the first half has been strong and frankly, right on our expectations. And so -- and to all the points around customer demand trends and the like, things are set up well as we head into the second half, but we do face some pretty tough comps, both on rents as well as occupancies moving into the second half. And I\u2019d say similarly on expenses, right? We saw expense growth accelerating into the second quarter. We left our same-store expense positioned at the same level as the start of the year. And we are seeing inflationary pressures. We have multiple initiatives to mitigate the impact of some of the inflationary pressure. But there\u2019s no question the labor market is tight and you don\u2019t have to look any further than the jobs number that came out this morning to indicate how tight the labor market is in this environment. And so we want to make sure we\u2019re encapsulating the outcomes there on expenses as well.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. And then, a follow-up, Joe, you guys left the acquisition guidance unchanged at $1 billion. If you include sort of -- you closed or going to close to quarter end, you\u2019re about $0.5 billion. So, maybe just talk a little bit about the pipeline. I know you\u2019re certainly seeing more opportunities and given your balance sheet, I\u2019m just wondering, given that you can be an all-cash buyer, do you actually expect volumes to accelerate even if there\u2019s less product on the market?\nJoe Russell: Yes. That\u2019s going to be subject, Steve, on a number of factors. As far as the $1 billion target or guidance for 2022, to your point, we\u2019re tracking well to that level of volume. What\u2019s typical is this time of year, you\u2019re going to see even an unpredictable amount of potential volume coming to the market, knowing that the market is different from a predictability standpoint this year than last year because of the range of big portfolio opportunities being quite limited if in fact at all. Very, very different outlook, as I mentioned. We\u2019re going to continue to look for a whole range of opportunities. As I mentioned, we\u2019re very confident. We\u2019re very well set to engage and unlock anything that would be particularly compelling. It will just depend on, again, what\u2019s going to play through, particularly in the next, say, 3 to 4 months. And with that, we\u2019ll see what kind of opportunities arise. The things that we continue to look for, as I mentioned, are assets that we are clearly seeing upside opportunity from a value creation standpoint. That\u2019s clearly part of the set of asset acquisitions that have been completed or that are pending as we guided to, and we\u2019ll continue to look for those and other types of opportunities as well. So, this -- as Tom mentioned, there\u2019s some shifting things out there relative to different pressure points that could play through with different owners and that could be an interesting opportunity for us as well. So, very excited about that. And the team is working hard. We\u2019re highly engaged across multiple markets, and we\u2019ll continue to see what additional volumes play through by virtue of that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go back now to Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. All right. We\u2019ll move on to Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller: Can you talk a little bit about the potential for a dividend increase? It looks like it hasn\u2019t been raised since about the fourth quarter of 2016. The growth has been good. It looks like you\u2019re looking at fewer big deals where you can accelerate expenses. And now you have the PSB dilution on it. It just feels like you have to be getting pretty darn close to being forced to raise it.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Mike. So, the first thing I\u2019d highlight is we did just send a big distribution out to our shareholders yesterday, $13.15. But as it relates to the regular dividend, to your point, the dividend has been relatively consistent for some time or has been consistent since the fourth quarter of 2016. And one of the drivers of that, and we\u2019ve talked about this in the past is some tax law changes in 2017 that introduced bonus depreciation in effect lowering our taxable income for that intervening period. And to your point, cash flow growth and taxable income growth has been strong, which has been increasing taxable income. As we move into 2023, though, the notable element is that bonus depreciation will begin to phase out. And that benefit that we\u2019ve received over the last several years in terms of lowering our taxable income will go away, and that will allow us to increase our dividend and ultimately return more capital to shareholders in the coming years as we go, while at the same time, retaining a significant amount of retained cash flow to reinvest in the business. And so, to your point around, it\u2019s been some time and growth has been strong. It\u2019s that as well as taxable income increasing that is likely to increase our dividend over time here as we move forward. And that\u2019s something that we highlighted at Investor Day as well as taxable income increases. We\u2019ll be poised to increase the current return to our shareholders. And that is, as we move forward into 2023, something that will begin to be more of a topic.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Appreciate it. And then just a quick follow-up. With the development pipeline now at $1 billion, what\u2019s your average annual development spend run rate at that level?\nTom Boyle: Well, right now, obviously, we\u2019re increasing the level of the development pipeline. So, that\u2019s going to come with it increased annual spend. But as you think about like the cadence this year, for instance, we\u2019re going to deliver about $250 million of developments this year, but we probably spend $400 million or so, which implies increased deliveries for next year, and that\u2019s going to continue to move higher. So, the spend next year is probably $450 million to $500 million, which will lead to increased deliveries then as we get into 2024. All on pace to reach the objective that we outlined at Investor Day of $700 million in annual deliveries and annual spend by 2026.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Maybe just stepping back from operations. I just had a question on the CapEx front. So, I understand that the commodity like sector CapEx isn\u2019t as crucial as in other sectors. But just wanted to get your thoughts on how important it is to reinvest in the properties just to preserve competitive positioning, given the inevitability of supply ways in the space?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Sure, Spenser. Clearly, that\u2019s one of the compelling parts of the whole self-storage model is, frankly, if you design an asset and locate it well, the enduring and lack of obsolescence tied to the product is quite significant. So, we have assets now in our 50 years of history in many markets that were developed 40-plus years ago that are just as functional and desirable to users today as they were when they were initially built and have not required much annual and/or consistent level of additional capital. It ties to the simplicity of the product. One of the things that we\u2019ve been speaking to strategically over the last couple of years is holistically, we are stepping back in putting many of the attributes of our latest generation development products into our existing assets. That\u2019s called the Property of Tomorrow program. So this year, we will spend about $300 million or so into that program. We\u2019re about halfway through the portfolio. We\u2019ve got another three-plus years to finish that up. The thing that that\u2019s resetting is lifting again, not only brand, but by necessity property, property, any additional functionality or attributes that we feel are even that much more compelling to add to a particular asset. So, that too is something that we\u2019re intentionally doing and getting a nice set of reactions from existing new customers or employees, et cetera. So, that continues to be an ongoing investment that you\u2019ll see us make again in the coming years. Another component that we\u2019re early into is our adoption of solar across hundreds of properties as we speak. The goal is to at least put solar on half of the portfolio or more in the next two to three years. So that, too, is a very intentional and efficiency-related, environmentally-related investment that is playing well. We\u2019re just finishing up LED lighting. That\u2019s a project that started actually five-plus years ago. As you can imagine, a lot of real estate to touch, but we\u2019ve now relet to LED, the entire exterior of all of our assets and are just finishing up interior LED as well, good efficiency, energy conservation. And again, another nice attribute adding to the properties themselves. So, it\u2019s more akin to that. And again, if you step back and think about great location, functional design and the enduring value of the asset itself, it can play through very, very effectively with little, again, traditional CapEx spend compared to any type of other sector.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just wanted to ask about California and New Jersey, the two markets that have had rent restrictions that have fairly recently come off and how you are in those two markets relative to the current market with your existing portfolio, and how much have you been able to drive rate and close that gap to the current market rate? And if you could just remind us on the contributions to same-store revenue growth as a result of those restrictions lifting?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So, the first thing I\u2019d say is I\u2019d segment the two markets you just spoke to. So, I\u2019m going to go into a little bit more detail around California. New Jersey does have pricing restrictions upon state of emergency similar to California and a similar price cap. But that state of emergency was in place for a much shorter duration time period. So, it was in place for a little over a year or so, which certainly has an impact on revenues but nowhere near the multiyear impact that we experienced in Los Angeles County, in particular. So, the overall impact to our properties in New Jersey was more modest. So, shifting gears to Los Angeles County, in particular, I\u2019d say the same story is in place as it relates to the difference between San Francisco and Los Angeles. San Francisco had some state of emergencies that were declared particularly around COVID that again, were in place for a little over a year, but nowhere near the impact to Los Angeles County. So getting to Los Angeles, the state of emergency was in place from the fall of 2018 through the very beginning of this year. And so, that 10% price limitation was more significant to our overall revenues and it will take a little bit longer to recoup that. But as I noted earlier, we are seeing strong acceleration within Los Angeles. And if you look at the differential, for instance, between how Los Angeles County has performed compared to Orange County or San Bernardino or Riverside counties all in the same, obviously, metropolitan area. I\u2019d say we\u2019re just getting to a point where Los Angeles County is on par on a revenue growth basis with those markets, which indicates that we have still a good bit of revenue growth to go and recapture. And obviously, the team is executing on that to date. This year, we compartmentalize the Los Angeles County contribution to same-store revenue growth is being an incremental 1.5% to 2% of same-store revenue growth. And I\u2019d say, as we get into 2023, you\u2019re going to hear us talk about this again because there will be incremental benefit still as we move into to 2023, given the accelerating performance there.\nJuan Sanabria: Great. And could you just talk a little bit about, given your history and how much data you have about how you would expect the portfolio to perform maybe on a same-store revenue or NOI perspective, if we do get in fact, a recession, assuming it\u2019s not as bad as the financial crisis, but more of a \u201crun-of-the-mill recession\u201d. What would you expect the business to be able to do in the face of that kind of external pressure?\nTom Boyle: Well, I think one of the key clarification points, Juan, is no recession is the same as another. So, I\u2019m not sure we can categorize what a typical recession would look like. But just looking back over time, what we\u2019ve seen is same-store revenues that dip into negative growth territory and same-store NOIs that dip into the kind of the mid to high single digits depending on the severity of the recession. But ultimately, it\u2019s going to depend on the nature and what the drivers are of that recession. Certainly, we\u2019re going into what could be a recession here. There\u2019s lots of headlines around potential recessions, but we haven\u2019t seen any impact to our business to date that would indicate that there\u2019s been a sharp move or otherwise, as we\u2019ve spoken to. So, hypothesizing what could play out, I think looking back at previous recessions and those kind of low to mid-single-digit same-store revenue impacts and mid to high-single-digit NOI impact is probably the best guide. But again, we\u2019ll see as we get there.\nJoe Russell: Yes. And I think just to put a little bit more color on some of the dynamics and the multi dimensions, which frankly makes storage that much more compelling, even in a recessionary environment, there\u2019s definitely history that points to storage continues to be an extension of home. As I mentioned, if home affordability is a pressure point, storage benefits by that. Supply has been very muted. So, if there were recessionary pressures out there, but we\u2019re not dealing with the same level of supply that may have coming on in certain other recessionary environments that could be a very different dynamic. The employment picture is very fluid as we speak, as Tom mentioned, very strong numbers came out today. So even with some commentary that how could we be going into a recession with such strong employment data. So, a lot of different crosscurrents. We have a month-to-month business. We have a very nimble business. We can calibrate around demand and pricing factors that will serve us well. And we\u2019re continuing to operate the business at very high efficiency from a cost standpoint. As I mentioned, our margins are now over 80%. So again, very good components for us to continue to maneuver whatever could play through recessionary or otherwise.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Keegan Carl with Berenberg.\nKeegan Carl: Just a little bit more color on your third-party management platform. Maybe how is demand shaping up? And regarding a potential slowdown in construction and new supply, I mean, how do you tend to think of the long-term growth prospects?\nJoe Russell: Yes, sure. Third-party management pipeline continues to build. We added 12 assets to the platform this last quarter, our backlog continues to build as it has and has -- and as the third-party management as a whole has grown through additional development. So, some of this is time-oriented. So, we\u2019ll continue to build the size of the platform as some of these newer assets are actually delivered. We\u2019re building also on top of that some different and new relationships. It has been and will continue to be an opportunity for us to source likely acquisitions through those relationships. So, we\u2019re pleased by the trajectory and the growth that continues to come through our third-party management platform. Getting very good feedback from existing customers, many of whom are actually bringing us additional properties as we speak. As far as supply, again, there\u2019s a number of factors that have been I would call it beneficial and have put somewhat of a lid on supply accelerating. That includes more complications tied to just approvals themselves. I\u2019ve talked about this for the last few quarters. We\u2019re nationally building in many markets, and I can\u2019t name one that it\u2019s easier and more efficient today than it was either pre-pandemic or even historically. So very complicated sets of hurdles that you go through, unexpected time delays, et cetera. Then on top of that, clearly, in an inflationary time frame, we\u2019re looking at more pressure on that front. Many of the developers that are out in the market may not have the financial wherewithal to actually absorb some of those type of cost increases that may either delay or actually decide not to build. And then, on top of it, interest rate levels. Construction loans are more expensive, access to lending may be more complicated. So, all those things are actually putting through more discipline and keeping somewhat of a lid on the amount of additional development coming through. So, we see that, as I mentioned, as a very healthy thing. And it\u2019s a good window for us to come in and compete very differently. More often than not, we\u2019re not seeing as many bids on certain land sites, and we\u2019re also seeing some land owners come to us that have either taken a site through percentage of its entitlement process or maybe holistically and still want to actually do a land trade instead of actually doing the development themselves.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And apologies if I missed this earlier, but did you guys disclose what percentage of your portfolio is currently\u2026\nTom Boyle: Keegan, that\u2019s not something that we disclose. We do disclose a healthy amount of information around move-in and move-out trends as well as the rates compared to in-place levels. What I would characterize, and I think what you\u2019re getting to is what could be the rent roll-up opportunity or otherwise? And maybe take a step back and self-storage is a little bit different than other property types in terms of how we manage revenue and how leases operate. So, as you think about managing revenue across the tenant base, one of the great aspects of self-storage is month-to-month leases. So, the team is focused not only on moving and signing new leases, but also managing the revenue on the entire existing population as well. And so, what you see historically, and you saw it again in this quarter, is that you can see a rent rolled out, which may sound a little bit odd for other property types, but to reiterate for self-storage that is -- that\u2019s a sign that we\u2019re successfully managing the existing tenants that are in-house. And as we spoke earlier, length of stays have been growing, which gives us more ability to do that and to send increases to our existing customers and ultimately tune that based on a data-driven approach. So again, this quarter and as we sit here today, our in-place rents are a good bit above where our move-in rents are and our move-out rents are also above where our move-in rents are, but that\u2019s healthy. And we anticipate that to continue through the rest of the year.\nOperator: Next, we have Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey. Hopefully, you can hear me. Third time\u2019s a charm.\nRyan Burke: Yes. Third time\u2019s a charm.\nRonald Kamdem: Quick one. It\u2019s definitely user error. So, two quick ones on my end. One is just when you\u2019re taking a step back sort of big picture, the portfolio is at record rents, sort of record pricing power, just this cycle operationally, is there anything you sort of try to do differently to try to measure the customer\u2019s pricing power, whether it\u2019s look at rent-to-income ratios or other than just move-out activity, which you monitor, is there any sort of different way to leverage all the data that you have to get at sort of the pricing power at the sort of unprecedented levels.\nTom Boyle: Sure. So, I think there\u2019s a couple of things here. One is, as you think about rent-to-income levels or otherwise, those are kind of macro trends that we do look at periodically, we look and see what housing affordability is by different markets as we look forward. But frankly, that\u2019s not how we manage the business on a day-to-day basis. And the way we manage it day-to-day is much more driven on testing. And we have the ability to segment our customers and conduct continuous price testing, both for new customers as well as existing customers in terms of what we expect that elasticity to be. And overall, we\u2019re just speaking about with Keegan, price elasticity is more acute for new tenants than it is for existing tenants, which is ultimately why existing tenants will pay a higher price than new tenants moving in. And that\u2019s continuous testing across the platform for both sets of tenants to understand that elasticity by market, by unit type and that\u2019s managed dynamically. So, in terms of what we\u2019re seeing today compared to what we\u2019ve seen in the past, is continued -- or a continuation of that, which is, yes, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s price sensitivity for new customers today, and that\u2019s built in how we price our units on a day-to-day basis. That said, our move-in rents in the quarter were up 12%. And so, we continue to have an ability to increase rent in the face of that elasticity. And in July, move-in rents were up 8%. So, we are seeing moderation but continued strength in move-in rents. So nothing that I\u2019d highlight that is overly concerning from the micro. And I think from the macro standpoint, one of the key elements in self-storage is it\u2019s a nominal spend versus a consumer\u2019s income. And I think that continues to benefit the sector as we see rents resetting at all-time highs.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then, just following up on the questions on sort of the second half growth, the implied guidance on same-store revenue is 11.1%. And if we think about that as sort of a good run rate for the end of this year going into next year, is there anything, we\u2019re trying to figure out what the potential deceleration is going to be? Is there anything in terms of comp, customer behavior as we\u2019re -- again, as we\u2019re rolling into next year to think about sort of that growth function?\nTom Boyle: Yes. I think, we\u2019ll give you a view on how 2023 is going to play out as we move into next year. But, I think you hit it right, which is a strong second half setting us up well for 2023. But in terms of the cadence of 2023, we\u2019ll maybe save that in terms of when we have more visibility.\nOperator: I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thanks, Chelsea, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Have a great weekend.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. And we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $3.99 for the quarter, representing 26.7% growth over the second quarter of 2021. Our first half results represent a strong start to the year and an acceleration from 2021. Let's look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 15.9% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Growth was driven by rate once again with two factors leading to the continued strength: first, strong move-in rates that were up 12% versus 2021; and secondly, existing tenant rate increases contributing with a lengthening customer stay. Los Angeles was a particularly strong contributor accelerating from 12% same-store revenue growth in the first quarter to 17% in the second quarter and will continue to accelerate into the third. Moving down the P&L. Same-store cost of operations were up 7.6%, driven by growth in property payroll, utilities and marketing. Our strategic initiatives, including operating model efficiencies and LED and solar investments helped offset a portion of the wage and utility inflation. In total, net operating income with the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 18.7% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter. There is significant growth ahead from this pool of properties as well, which is a good segue to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Joe mentioned, we raised our outlook for the second half. In April, we provided our core FFO outlook with a $15.20 midpoint. The PSA business outlook improved by $0.37 or 2.4%. The improved outlook is driven by strong performance from our non-same-store pool of assets and to a lesser extent, ancillary growth and a reduction in interest expense. On net, our year-to-date performance has been in line with our expectations, but our outlook for the second half is improving. We did reflect the impact of the sale of PS Business Parks and a corresponding $0.22 impact resulting in a new midpoint of $15.35 per share of core FFO. And associated with the PSB sale, yesterday, we paid a $13.15 special dividend, returning capital to our shareholders. Overall, our capital and liquidity position remain strong, as Joe mentioned. We have a well laddered long-term debt profile and $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions. With $1 billion of cash on hand at quarter end and 3.7 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA we're well positioned to finance the growth initiatives ahead. With that, we'd like to open it up for questions. Sure. Thanks, Joe. So, in particular, I'll highlight two elements as we think about where we'll play out through the second half and then go into 2023 and I'll hit on both the same-store as well as the non-same-store because I think they're both important. So, as we look at the same store, as you recall, we initiated a strong outlook for same-store illustrating or demonstrating acceleration from 2021 at the start of the year. And frankly, we're executing right along that path. So, the assumptions as we move into the second half on the same-store are pretty consistent and quite strong with modest deceleration into the second half given the tough comps that we have, particularly on rates, but also the typical seasonal occupancy pattern that we're expecting this year more so than we've seen in the last couple. So, call it a 250 basis-point occupancy decline. So strong trends within the same store. And if you just look at what the first half performance is and the implied outlook for the second half, it implies an outlook or an exit level of revenue growth with low double digits on it, which is frankly not too dissimilar to where we started this year. So, a good outlook through the same-store in the second half and then I'm expecting your question is leading to the 2023, which is also a good setup for 2023. On the non-same-store, as we've highlighted now a number of times in our prepared remarks, continues to exceed our expectations. And so we did lift our outlook for the year in the non-same-store by $40 million. But importantly, that wasn't just a pull forward of stabilization activity. We actually raised our outlook of what those assets will stabilize with. And so there continues to be a strong outlook for growth in 2023 and beyond from that level of capital that we deployed to date. So, all encouraging trends as we look forward to 2023. Yes. Thanks, Joe. So Michael, I'll give you some of the financial components that we included in guidance that we're providing to in order to be able to model this a little bit easier. So, for the year, as part of our core FFO outlook, we're providing a non-same-store NOI contribution number. And in addition to that, there's a line item below core FFO that is the non-same-store NOI to stabilization, which will occur after 2022. And so you can think about adding those two numbers together to reach our view of stabilized NOI of that pool. And so, if you look back in April, our non-same-store NOI contribution for 2022 in our guidance was a midpoint of $450 million, and we included at the bottom of the page $180 million of incremental NOI to stabilization. So, if you add those two numbers together, you're going to get your $630 million of stabilized NOI. If you compare that to this quarter, we lifted our non-same-store outlook by $40 million at the midpoint. So, you're looking at a $490 million NOI contribution from the non-same-store pool in the calendar year 2022. But then we also retained that line item below at $172 million of incremental NOI to stabilization. So, if you add those two numbers together, the $490 million and the $172 million, you get to $662 million. So, in effect, we raised our outlook for ultimate stabilization by $32 million to $662 million. So, again, an improving outlook. The performance we're seeing this year is not just a pull forward of stabilization. It's also outperformance and outperformance versus expectations. Yes. Thanks, Michael. So, the first thing I'd highlight is, as we think about adding properties to our same-store pool, we're focused on adding them when they're stabilized. And so, as I just walked through, there's meaningful NOI contribution to come from those assets before they reach stabilization in the coming years. And so, we won't add those into the same-store pool until they've reached that stabilized level. And so, there will be some properties added. But as we just demonstrated, there's significant growth ahead that will sit in the non-same-store versus the same-store pool as we move into 2023. And we'll continue to provide the level of disclosure that we do today by acquisition and development vintage, so that you can see and track that performance over time. Sure. So specifically around rent increases, I'll hit that and then maybe I'll take a step back as well and talk about overall customer trends as I think that may be instructive. The existing tenant rate increase program is something that obviously has been running for a very long time, but it's an area we continue to make investments in and it's really driven by extensive testing. Joe mentioned we have over 1.7 million customers today. We send over 1 million rent increases a year, and that gives us the ability to dynamically manage that program and frankly, use data science today in a way that we couldn't use in years past. And so that program continues to improve, and ultimately, we continue to see the benefit of that program in our realized rents. In terms of customer reaction, that's a really important part of the program is to understand what we predict the customer behavior to be, and we're constantly tuning and understanding if there's any shifts in ultimate behavior. And I'd say year-to-date is, in fact, customers are behaving as good or better, frankly, than what our models have been predicting for them as we move through the year. So continue to see good behavior from our customers. And as Joe mentioned, the length of stay continues to extend, which is a really favorable trend for that program as there are more customers to send increases too. So, that all played out well. And then, I think your second question around or the second component that I want to focus on is around demographics. And are we seeing any shifts in customer behavior by demographics, even away from that data-driven existing tenant approach? And the short answer is we're not really seeing anything across the customer base and continue to see broad-based strength. There are a few operating metrics that if you look at them versus last year, they're deteriorating. So, things like move-outs, right, that move-outs are higher for us and I think across the sector, but they're off incredibly low bases and still well below pre-pandemic levels. You could say the same thing around delinquency, et cetera. But as you slice and dice that by demography or other customer segments, nothing there that's percolating that we'd highlight as being concerning, frankly, overall continued broad-based strength around the customer base. Sure. So, what we've highlighted in the past is the magnitude and frequency of our increases are really driven by two components. One is what do we anticipate the reaction to be to the increase. And as I just spoke to, that performance has been as good or better than our expectations and, frankly, better than history. And the second component is an optimization based on if the customer moves out, what's the cost to replace that tenant. And in both instances versus pre-pandemic levels, they're both pointing to higher magnitude and frequency of increase. And so, if in the past, we were sending 8% to 10% increases to our longer term tenants, we're sending higher increases today and higher frequency. Why don't we go to the next question, and we can let Ron jump back in queue. Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the question. I guess, what I'd characterize is obviously, we're not going to change the outlook here on the call. But what I'd say is when we set the outlook at the beginning of the year and we continue to reaffirm it is we wanted to set a wider range to encapsulate a broader range of outcomes. That's both on the high end as well as the low end, given the uncertainty of a month-to-month lease business and frankly, how dynamic the industry has performed over the last several years. And so, we did set a broad range. And as we move through the second half, there's still a reasonable range of outcomes that could play out in the environment. And so, we didn't touch the range. But to your point, the first half has been strong and frankly, right on our expectations. And so -- and to all the points around customer demand trends and the like, things are set up well as we head into the second half, but we do face some pretty tough comps, both on rents as well as occupancies moving into the second half. And I'd say similarly on expenses, right? We saw expense growth accelerating into the second quarter. We left our same-store expense positioned at the same level as the start of the year. And we are seeing inflationary pressures. We have multiple initiatives to mitigate the impact of some of the inflationary pressure. But there's no question the labor market is tight and you don't have to look any further than the jobs number that came out this morning to indicate how tight the labor market is in this environment. And so we want to make sure we're encapsulating the outcomes there on expenses as well. Thanks, Mike. So, the first thing I'd highlight is we did just send a big distribution out to our shareholders yesterday, $13.15. But as it relates to the regular dividend, to your point, the dividend has been relatively consistent for some time or has been consistent since the fourth quarter of 2016. And one of the drivers of that, and we've talked about this in the past is some tax law changes in 2017 that introduced bonus depreciation in effect lowering our taxable income for that intervening period. And to your point, cash flow growth and taxable income growth has been strong, which has been increasing taxable income. As we move into 2023, though, the notable element is that bonus depreciation will begin to phase out. And that benefit that we've received over the last several years in terms of lowering our taxable income will go away, and that will allow us to increase our dividend and ultimately return more capital to shareholders in the coming years as we go, while at the same time, retaining a significant amount of retained cash flow to reinvest in the business. And so, to your point around, it's been some time and growth has been strong. It's that as well as taxable income increasing that is likely to increase our dividend over time here as we move forward. And that's something that we highlighted at Investor Day as well as taxable income increases. We'll be poised to increase the current return to our shareholders. And that is, as we move forward into 2023, something that will begin to be more of a topic. Well, right now, obviously, we're increasing the level of the development pipeline. So, that's going to come with it increased annual spend. But as you think about like the cadence this year, for instance, we're going to deliver about $250 million of developments this year, but we probably spend $400 million or so, which implies increased deliveries for next year, and that's going to continue to move higher. So, the spend next year is probably $450 million to $500 million, which will lead to increased deliveries then as we get into 2024. All on pace to reach the objective that we outlined at Investor Day of $700 million in annual deliveries and annual spend by 2026. Sure. So, the first thing I'd say is I'd segment the two markets you just spoke to. So, I'm going to go into a little bit more detail around California. New Jersey does have pricing restrictions upon state of emergency similar to California and a similar price cap. But that state of emergency was in place for a much shorter duration time period. So, it was in place for a little over a year or so, which certainly has an impact on revenues but nowhere near the multiyear impact that we experienced in Los Angeles County, in particular. So, the overall impact to our properties in New Jersey was more modest. So, shifting gears to Los Angeles County, in particular, I'd say the same story is in place as it relates to the difference between San Francisco and Los Angeles. San Francisco had some state of emergencies that were declared particularly around COVID that again, were in place for a little over a year, but nowhere near the impact to Los Angeles County. So getting to Los Angeles, the state of emergency was in place from the fall of 2018 through the very beginning of this year. And so, that 10% price limitation was more significant to our overall revenues and it will take a little bit longer to recoup that. But as I noted earlier, we are seeing strong acceleration within Los Angeles. And if you look at the differential, for instance, between how Los Angeles County has performed compared to Orange County or San Bernardino or Riverside counties all in the same, obviously, metropolitan area. I'd say we're just getting to a point where Los Angeles County is on par on a revenue growth basis with those markets, which indicates that we have still a good bit of revenue growth to go and recapture. And obviously, the team is executing on that to date. This year, we compartmentalize the Los Angeles County contribution to same-store revenue growth is being an incremental 1.5% to 2% of same-store revenue growth. And I'd say, as we get into 2023, you're going to hear us talk about this again because there will be incremental benefit still as we move into to 2023, given the accelerating performance there. Well, I think one of the key clarification points, Juan, is no recession is the same as another. So, I'm not sure we can categorize what a typical recession would look like. But just looking back over time, what we've seen is same-store revenues that dip into negative growth territory and same-store NOIs that dip into the kind of the mid to high single digits depending on the severity of the recession. But ultimately, it's going to depend on the nature and what the drivers are of that recession. Certainly, we're going into what could be a recession here. There's lots of headlines around potential recessions, but we haven't seen any impact to our business to date that would indicate that there's been a sharp move or otherwise, as we've spoken to. So, hypothesizing what could play out, I think looking back at previous recessions and those kind of low to mid-single-digit same-store revenue impacts and mid to high-single-digit NOI impact is probably the best guide. But again, we'll see as we get there. Keegan, that's not something that we disclose. We do disclose a healthy amount of information around move-in and move-out trends as well as the rates compared to in-place levels. What I would characterize, and I think what you're getting to is what could be the rent roll-up opportunity or otherwise? And maybe take a step back and self-storage is a little bit different than other property types in terms of how we manage revenue and how leases operate. So, as you think about managing revenue across the tenant base, one of the great aspects of self-storage is month-to-month leases. So, the team is focused not only on moving and signing new leases, but also managing the revenue on the entire existing population as well. And so, what you see historically, and you saw it again in this quarter, is that you can see a rent rolled out, which may sound a little bit odd for other property types, but to reiterate for self-storage that is -- that's a sign that we're successfully managing the existing tenants that are in-house. And as we spoke earlier, length of stays have been growing, which gives us more ability to do that and to send increases to our existing customers and ultimately tune that based on a data-driven approach. So again, this quarter and as we sit here today, our in-place rents are a good bit above where our move-in rents are and our move-out rents are also above where our move-in rents are, but that's healthy. And we anticipate that to continue through the rest of the year. Sure. So, I think there's a couple of things here. One is, as you think about rent-to-income levels or otherwise, those are kind of macro trends that we do look at periodically, we look and see what housing affordability is by different markets as we look forward. But frankly, that's not how we manage the business on a day-to-day basis. And the way we manage it day-to-day is much more driven on testing. And we have the ability to segment our customers and conduct continuous price testing, both for new customers as well as existing customers in terms of what we expect that elasticity to be. And overall, we're just speaking about with Keegan, price elasticity is more acute for new tenants than it is for existing tenants, which is ultimately why existing tenants will pay a higher price than new tenants moving in. And that's continuous testing across the platform for both sets of tenants to understand that elasticity by market, by unit type and that's managed dynamically. So, in terms of what we're seeing today compared to what we've seen in the past, is continued -- or a continuation of that, which is, yes, there's no question there's price sensitivity for new customers today, and that's built in how we price our units on a day-to-day basis. That said, our move-in rents in the quarter were up 12%. And so, we continue to have an ability to increase rent in the face of that elasticity. And in July, move-in rents were up 8%. So, we are seeing moderation but continued strength in move-in rents. So nothing that I'd highlight that is overly concerning from the micro. And I think from the macro standpoint, one of the key elements in self-storage is it's a nominal spend versus a consumer's income. And I think that continues to benefit the sector as we see rents resetting at all-time highs. Yes. I think, we'll give you a view on how 2023 is going to play out as we move into next year. But, I think you hit it right, which is a strong second half setting us up well for 2023. But in terms of the cadence of 2023, we'll maybe save that in terms of when we have more visibility."

            "name": "Joe Russell",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Tom and I will cover second quarter highlights as we achieved a number of record performance metrics and milestones. Now that we are past the midpoint of the year, we are happy to share our view of the next six months, which has resulted in our guidance raise. Before I go to those details, I would like to take a brief moment and acknowledge a significant milestone for Public Storage that takes place this month. On August 14, 1972, Public Storage was launched by two creative and determined entrepreneurs, Wayne Hughes and Ken Volk, opening the first Public Storage facility in El Cajon, California. The concept of paying to store stuff was new. But the simple name, a great location and roll up doors painted the color of orange created a powerful formula to grow the Company, so much so that our brand quickly became synonymous with the self-storage industry. Now five decades later, the Public Storage team and I are inspired to stay just as focused on entrepreneurial pursuits, expanding the iconic Public Storage brand and empowering the 5,500-plus dedicated employees that cater to our 1.7 million customers on a daily basis. We are appreciative of our shareholders, particularly those that have continued their commitment to Public Storage over our history, while knowing we have the right culture to ensure an equally bright future. Now to Q2 results. Business year-to-date remains quite good, with robust performance in both, our same-store and non-same-store portfolios. New customer demand through the typical summer leasing season has been exceptional as well as growing length of stay with existing customers. This, against the backdrop of muted new property deliveries in most markets. We have good pricing dynamics on both, move-ins and with existing customer rate increases, leading to the highest rent levels we have seen historically. Arguably, a number of the pandemic-related drivers to our business are receding, but we are pleased to see elevated levels of demand, new customer adoption and longevity of use. Customers, consumers and businesses alike are still in need of more space for a variety of reasons that include decreasing affordability of renting or owning a home, tight inventories of commercial space, hybrid work environments and the typical movement that takes place nationally this time of year. I would like to highlight a handful of particularly significant milestones or first in the quarter. We achieved $1 billion in revenue. Our average length of stay is now 39 months. Operating margins exceeded 80%. Our development pipeline has reached $1 billion and being named by Forbes as Best Place to Work by our employees. Now to acquisitions. By all accounts, 2021 was a historic year, and we were pleased to capture approximately 30% of the total sector volume. These 230 assets are performing well, in fact, above expectation with more growth ahead for the entire 525 properties in the non-same-store portfolio that is now over 50 million square feet. As we anticipated, 2022 acquisition volume has shifted down with fewer large portfolios entering the market. We are also getting more last calls from sellers and brokers with fewer buyers in the market. Cap rates have adjusted up and could move further. It's a different playing field, and we anticipate some interesting opportunities with over $1 billion in cash, a balance sheet prime for growth and a reputation as a preferred buyer. The self-storage sector and our own history point of resilience in times of economic change, including recessions of varying degrees. We too are looking for all ways to interpret any shift in customer demand and behavior. We are well positioned to compete for customers across all of our markets with the exceptional scale and product offerings in the 39 states we operate in. Our same-store and non-same-store assets are poised to deliver strong results through the second half of 2022, positioning us well for whatever may play through as we enter 2023. Our leadership team is well equipped to grow and deliver exceptional shareholder returns. Now Tom will share some financial highlights with you as well. Tom? Yes. Jeff, Good morning. As Tom and I highlighted, we continue to be encouraged by the health of the business. You start with customer demand. Quite good. We're seeing top of the funnel demand that continues to encourage us that the adoption of self-storage is quite robust across our markets. The existing customer behavior has been consistent, and if anything, continues to encourage us relative to customers needing and using their space for longer periods of time. Our average length of stay now is 39 months. Compare that to about a year ago, and it was around 34 months, very encouraging. The things that I spoke to relative to muted deliveries across, again, the national market as a whole are also quite healthy, meaning that we're not seeing any particular market getting burdened by an unusual or heavy level of new supply. That's always a good thing for the business. And we're, again, measuring the changing dynamics that go with the 1.7 million customer base that we have. And we're really not seeing from a cohort standpoint, any change in behavior or elevated levels of stress by cohort. So that too is very encouraging. So, with all that said, coupled with the fact our same-store continues to perform quite well. And on an exceptional basis, our non-same store, as I mentioned, is very well poised to continue to deliver good results, not only through this second half of the year, but going into 2023. With all that said, Tom can give you a little bit of perspective on what we're thinking through the end of the year and what that positions us to do going into 2023? Yes. Jeff, there's a few elements that go into that. So, as I mentioned, trading volumes definitely at a different place year-to-date than we were in 2021 at this time. As I mentioned, far fewer, if any of the big jumbo size hovering $1 billion or more portfolios, either come to the market or traded. So, the level of information that we're tracking relative to cap rate impact goes to the segment of the market that is much smaller, whether they're individual assets, smaller portfolios, and there's a range playing through depending on the asset quality, the stabilization of a particular asset, et cetera. But there's no question, as you would expect, as interest rates are behaving the way they are i.e., they're increasing and depending on what the Fed continues to do downstream, we'll see what additional impact we have relative to just interest rate levels themselves. Bidding activity plays through, meaning how aggressive or less aggressive our buyer is going to be for certain types of assets. So, we'll see how cap rates continue to trend, but our view is they've elevated plus or minus, say, 50 basis points. They could trend a little bit higher. But again, it's going to be subject to the amount of capital that's still anxious to come into the sector. I mentioned our team is seeing what I would call more last calls. We think that's a good thing, meaning that -- at the end of the day, maybe some of the feverish buying activity that was in part of the market in 2021 is softened. That always gives us a different opportunity to engage with certain sellers relative to their need to actually do a transaction. As I mentioned, we are clearly looked upon as a very preferred buyer. We know typically the asset at hand quite well in many cases, maybe even better than the owner, may know either the submarket or the opportunity that might be tied to an asset. So, a lot of things that come into the mix that can affect cap rates. But as I mentioned, I think that too can be very healthy and particularly for a well-heeled and deep-seated buyer and knowledge a buyer like we are, that can be a very compelling time to engage with an owner. And we're seeing activity to that degree. So, we'll continue to pace and see what change plays through. But as you would expect with the change in interest rates alone, there's going to be some movement in cap rates. Yes. Mike, I'll start with a few things. First, if you think about the strategy that we've deployed now for the last two years plus, we've entered transactions with a priority around finding additional upside in any asset acquisition that we're either entertaining or bringing into the portfolio. So, of the $5.1 billion of asset acquisitions that we did in 2021, average occupancy hovered around 60% to 65%. So, by design, we've been very focused on finding and taking assets that may be either at a state of fill-up or a state of optimization that clearly hasn't met either the owner's expectation or an optimization level that we feel that we can clearly achieve, once we own the asset. So, that has given us a very compelling opportunity to drive the types of returns that Tom spoke about that, in many cases, are even more elevated than we expected when we bought the assets. A couple of very simple examples, that's definitely playing through with the two bigger portfolios that we bought in 2021, the easy storage portfolio that we took down in April of last year, a $1.8 billion transaction, seeing very good lift relative to not only the results we expected in the first year, but we're even doing better than expectation. And then, the same thing is playing through with All Storage, the transaction that we did in the fourth quarter, again, another large portfolio. But the same type of trajectory is honestly playing through with the one-off and the much smaller portfolios as well. And part of that, again, by strategy and design, we've been very focused on identifying assets that we can bring into the portfolio and drive much further optimization through not only fill-up of maturation of the existing revenue base, the customer base, et cetera. Tom, you can give a little bit of color, if you like to relative to some specifics. And Mike, one other thing I'd add, we haven't spoken to the performance of our development assets. And those two not only continue to drive very good returns, but are beating expectations relative to, again, level of lease-up, the performance of the asset. We clearly have very unique advantage being the only public developer of the product in the space and by far, the largest developer in the sector. The team is doing a very nice job identifying prime land sites, using many of the data elements that we uniquely have to find pockets of opportunities, whether they're markets that are more mature and/or growing markets, and those assets to continue to drive very good returns. As I noted, our development pipeline for the first time hit $1 billion. We're encouraged that we've got a nice window to continue to find compelling opportunities, and we'll continue to allocate capital in that arena as well, which has been very fruitful. Yes. That's going to be subject, Steve, on a number of factors. As far as the $1 billion target or guidance for 2022, to your point, we're tracking well to that level of volume. What's typical is this time of year, you're going to see even an unpredictable amount of potential volume coming to the market, knowing that the market is different from a predictability standpoint this year than last year because of the range of big portfolio opportunities being quite limited if in fact at all. Very, very different outlook, as I mentioned. We're going to continue to look for a whole range of opportunities. As I mentioned, we're very confident. We're very well set to engage and unlock anything that would be particularly compelling. It will just depend on, again, what's going to play through, particularly in the next, say, 3 to 4 months. And with that, we'll see what kind of opportunities arise. The things that we continue to look for, as I mentioned, are assets that we are clearly seeing upside opportunity from a value creation standpoint. That's clearly part of the set of asset acquisitions that have been completed or that are pending as we guided to, and we'll continue to look for those and other types of opportunities as well. So, this -- as Tom mentioned, there's some shifting things out there relative to different pressure points that could play through with different owners and that could be an interesting opportunity for us as well. So, very excited about that. And the team is working hard. We're highly engaged across multiple markets, and we'll continue to see what additional volumes play through by virtue of that. Yes. Sure, Spenser. Clearly, that's one of the compelling parts of the whole self-storage model is, frankly, if you design an asset and locate it well, the enduring and lack of obsolescence tied to the product is quite significant. So, we have assets now in our 50 years of history in many markets that were developed 40-plus years ago that are just as functional and desirable to users today as they were when they were initially built and have not required much annual and/or consistent level of additional capital. It ties to the simplicity of the product. One of the things that we've been speaking to strategically over the last couple of years is holistically, we are stepping back in putting many of the attributes of our latest generation development products into our existing assets. That's called the Property of Tomorrow program. So this year, we will spend about $300 million or so into that program. We're about halfway through the portfolio. We've got another three-plus years to finish that up. The thing that that's resetting is lifting again, not only brand, but by necessity property, property, any additional functionality or attributes that we feel are even that much more compelling to add to a particular asset. So, that too is something that we're intentionally doing and getting a nice set of reactions from existing new customers or employees, et cetera. So, that continues to be an ongoing investment that you'll see us make again in the coming years. Another component that we're early into is our adoption of solar across hundreds of properties as we speak. The goal is to at least put solar on half of the portfolio or more in the next two to three years. So that, too, is a very intentional and efficiency-related, environmentally-related investment that is playing well. We're just finishing up LED lighting. That's a project that started actually five-plus years ago. As you can imagine, a lot of real estate to touch, but we've now relet to LED, the entire exterior of all of our assets and are just finishing up interior LED as well, good efficiency, energy conservation. And again, another nice attribute adding to the properties themselves. So, it's more akin to that. And again, if you step back and think about great location, functional design and the enduring value of the asset itself, it can play through very, very effectively with little, again, traditional CapEx spend compared to any type of other sector. Yes. And I think just to put a little bit more color on some of the dynamics and the multi dimensions, which frankly makes storage that much more compelling, even in a recessionary environment, there's definitely history that points to storage continues to be an extension of home. As I mentioned, if home affordability is a pressure point, storage benefits by that. Supply has been very muted. So, if there were recessionary pressures out there, but we're not dealing with the same level of supply that may have coming on in certain other recessionary environments that could be a very different dynamic. The employment picture is very fluid as we speak, as Tom mentioned, very strong numbers came out today. So even with some commentary that how could we be going into a recession with such strong employment data. So, a lot of different crosscurrents. We have a month-to-month business. We have a very nimble business. We can calibrate around demand and pricing factors that will serve us well. And we're continuing to operate the business at very high efficiency from a cost standpoint. As I mentioned, our margins are now over 80%. So again, very good components for us to continue to maneuver whatever could play through recessionary or otherwise. Yes, sure. Third-party management pipeline continues to build. We added 12 assets to the platform this last quarter, our backlog continues to build as it has and has -- and as the third-party management as a whole has grown through additional development. So, some of this is time-oriented. So, we'll continue to build the size of the platform as some of these newer assets are actually delivered. We're building also on top of that some different and new relationships. It has been and will continue to be an opportunity for us to source likely acquisitions through those relationships. So, we're pleased by the trajectory and the growth that continues to come through our third-party management platform. Getting very good feedback from existing customers, many of whom are actually bringing us additional properties as we speak. As far as supply, again, there's a number of factors that have been I would call it beneficial and have put somewhat of a lid on supply accelerating. That includes more complications tied to just approvals themselves. I've talked about this for the last few quarters. We're nationally building in many markets, and I can't name one that it's easier and more efficient today than it was either pre-pandemic or even historically. So very complicated sets of hurdles that you go through, unexpected time delays, et cetera. Then on top of that, clearly, in an inflationary time frame, we're looking at more pressure on that front. Many of the developers that are out in the market may not have the financial wherewithal to actually absorb some of those type of cost increases that may either delay or actually decide not to build. And then, on top of it, interest rate levels. Construction loans are more expensive, access to lending may be more complicated. So, all those things are actually putting through more discipline and keeping somewhat of a lid on the amount of additional development coming through. So, we see that, as I mentioned, as a very healthy thing. And it's a good window for us to come in and compete very differently. More often than not, we're not seeing as many bids on certain land sites, and we're also seeing some land owners come to us that have either taken a site through percentage of its entitlement process or maybe holistically and still want to actually do a land trade instead of actually doing the development themselves."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Katie. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I\u2019m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, May 4, 2022, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. After that, of course, please feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before I hand the call over to Tom to discuss specific Q1 metrics, I will highlight five areas that are setting the stage for a robust 2022. First, market-to-market business remains very strong. Now that we are four months into the year, we continue to see elevated demand from new customers across the portfolio. Existing customers are also extending average length of stay. We have healthy pricing dynamics, and with move-in rates up 15% and our existing customer rate increase program performing very well. Second, the traditional busy season is taking hold. Inventory is tight with vacancy at about 5%. We see outsized demand for vacant units throughout the markets. Both, consumers and business customers are aggressively seeking space along with more traditional drivers for this time of year, which include home sales and college students. Home affordability, hybrid work environment and a tight commercial market are clearly additive to our performance metrics. Third, our large non-same-store portfolio, now 515 assets across 50 million square feet is growing significantly from a revenue and occupancy standpoint. Non-same-store NOI nearly tripled during the quarter. These assets are highly complementary to our market presence and continue to deliver exceptional returns with outsized move-in activity due to average occupancy of 86%. Of note, the $1.8 billion ezStorage portfolio we acquired a year ago has already achieved the yield we anticipated after year two. The recently acquired $1.5 billion All Storage portfolio is performing ahead of expectations as well. Fourth, as anticipated, fewer assets have entered the sales market this year. Year-to-date, we have closed or are under contract for 21 assets, totaling approximately $275 million. Our industry-leading development platform increased to $833 million. The forecast of relatively stable national deliveries for 2022 and 2023 remains intact as we anticipate approximately 500 to 600 assets will be delivered each of the next two years. And fifth, our industry-leading digital customer experience continues to be embraced by new tenants. This includes digital leasing, centralized property access as well as our PS app. In March, we reached a significant milestone with our 1 millionth eRental move-in. Today, more than half of our customers are choosing eRental, giving them a desirable digital option to lease a unit. Our ongoing investments in the public storage digital platform are improving both, customer experience and employee efficiency. Clearly, a win-win. Now to Tom.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $3.65 for the quarter, representing 29.4% growth over the first quarter of 2021. Our first quarter results represent a strong start to the year and an acceleration from the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 15.8% compared to the first quarter of 2021. That performance is an acceleration from the 13% to 14% range in the second half of 2021. Growth was driven by rate with two factors leading to the continued strength: First, strong demand and limited inventory, which allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 15% versus 2021; second, existing tenant rate increases also contributed with lengthening customer stays as well as comparing to a period in 2021 when we were impacted by rental rate regulation in some of our largest markets. On that note, Los Angeles was a particularly strong contributor accelerating from 8% same-store revenue growth in January to 15% same-store revenue growth in March. Now on to expenses. We had a good quarter on cost of operations, up 3.6% in the quarter, with savings on marketing expense offsetting expected growth in other line items. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 20.5% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter, as Joe mentioned. Now shifting to the outlook. We\u2019re roughly 70 days on from when we introduced our initial 2022 guidance for the year. We reiterated our strong core FFO outlook yesterday with a $15.20 midpoint, representing 17.5% growth from 2021. We\u2019re anticipating another year of strong customer demand from self-storage, and as Joe mentioned, we are experiencing that through April with a very good setup into our traditional busy leasing months ahead. As I\u2019ve highlighted over the past year, with occupancy near record levels, our outlook for growth is driven by rental rate. Shifting gears, PS Business Parks announced it entered into an agreement where Blackstone will acquire the company. We have agreed to vote our shares for the transaction. Upon closing, which is anticipated in the third quarter, we would receive $2.7 billion of cash. And of that $2.7 billion, recognize a $2.3 billion tax gain that would increase our distribution requirements for the year. As we noted in our filings, PSB contributed $25.5 million in core FFO in the first quarter or approximately 4% of company-wide FFO. We have not updated our guidance ranges to reflect this sale, but we\u2019ll plan to update you as the transaction progresses and more details are provided by PSB. Last but not least, our low leverage balance sheet gives us capacity to fund growth and at the same time, is well laddered with long-term debt and $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions against a rising rate environment. Perpetual fixed rate capital is very good capital in today\u2019s markets, and so is $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet at March 31st. And with that, Katie, I\u2019ll turn it to you to open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. And I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re limited to questions. If we are, please let me know. My first question, I guess, if we could talk about April. You commented on seeing continued demand into April. Can you provide any additional comments on what you\u2019re seeing so far in April?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Yes. Joe mentioned, we\u2019re seeing good momentum heading into the second quarter. And we\u2019re seeing that really across the board. Market strengths are pretty consistent through April. Web visits and sales calls are up in the month or were up in the month. We saw good momentum from move-in transactions, move-in rates, which I know is a topic that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re interested in, were up about a little over 12% in the month. We continued to see the occupancy and rate trade off that we saw in the first quarter. So, occupancy ended April down about 120 basis points year-over-year, but again, against the backdrop of really strong rate growth.\nJoe Russell: And, yes, Jeff, maybe to add a little bit more perspective on the comment I made in my opening remarks. The consumer and business customer environment is still very strong. Consumer balance sheets, by everything that we\u2019re seeing relative to statistical levels of health are quite strong. In fact, consumer balance sheets are better today than they were pre-pandemic. We\u2019re seeing very good business activity across the spectrum. Top of funnel demand, as Tom mentioned, is quite vibrant. And on the back end, length of stay continues to increase as well. So, the two bookends of both demand on the front side and then enduring utility of consumer and business utility of the space is quite strong. Many of the factors that I spoke to continue to play out quite well, and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen through the month of April. To your question on how many questions in the queue, we\u2019ll let you ask one more, and then we\u2019ll move on to the next question.\nJeff Spector: Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s great. I guess, then the easy follow-up question is just on guidance. That\u2019s really been the top incoming to me. I know you guys are conservative. It seems like a great or maybe even better start to the year than expected. Can you explain why maintain the guidance right now?\nTom Boyle: Sure. I\u2019m happy to take that. And I guess, what I\u2019d characterize is the year has started out largely right in line with our plan, i.e., strong, but the strong start we anticipated. And, it\u2019s only been 70 days since we set our initial range. When we communicated that, we highlighted that we specifically widened the ranges to try to encapsulate more upside into the ranges compared to maybe last year where we had narrow ranges. And the reason for the width of the range is really the uncertainty as we get into the busy season here and the uncertainty that\u2019s inherent in a month-to-month lease business in the second half of the year. We\u2019re going to learn a lot about how that\u2019s going to play out over the next three months or so, and we\u2019ll certainly provide updates and would expect that as we move through the year, we likely will narrow ranges as we go forward, like we did last year. But, at this point, we feel good about our outlook for the year. And to date, we\u2019ve seen the strong performance we anticipated.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: My first question is on street rates and how do they progress through the quarter and into April? I think given the comparisons are starting to get more difficult, I think the market is trying to understand just how much rates are kind of growing on these more difficult comparisons?\nTom Boyle: Yes. That\u2019s clearly a good question and speaks to the uncertainty as we move through the busy season here. To date, we\u2019ve continued to see good momentum in move-in rents and customers willing to accept those higher move-in rents against an environment, as Joe mentioned of tight inventory. So, while occupancy is off year-over-year, we\u2019re still talking about near-record occupancies, which gives us pricing strength when inventory gets tight. We anticipate that inventory will only get tighter from here as we move into the busy season. From a month-to-month standpoint, we saw pretty consistent year-over-year, call it, mid-teens growth on move-in rents through the first quarter. As I noted in April, we\u2019re up a touch over 12% on move-in rents. And we\u2019re already starting to face those tougher comps year-over-year. So, as Joe mentioned, we clearly have momentum here. Now the question will be how does that play out over the next several months to kind of reset rents potentially higher or where they will reset?\nMichael Goldsmith: Understood. And then, I guess, the piece that kind of goes along with this is the trajectory of ECRIs. Your occupancy was relatively stable in the first quarter, suggesting that length of stay remains strong. And now, as the street rates kind of -- the street rate growth compresses as you face more difficult comparisons, how do you think about applying ECRIs to customers, just given that prices -- market prices are necessarily rising to the same extent that we\u2019ve seen in the past? Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Sure. Thanks, Michael. So, Joe mentioned earlier that the existing tenant rate program is going well through the year. And what we mean by that specifically is consumers are behaving as expected. And we continue to run our modeling to derive expected behavior and optimize increases, that will continue through the year. So clearly, one of the inputs to that you\u2019re highlighting, which is moving rents and the cost to replace a tenant if they move out or if we\u2019re wrong on our predictive analytics. But generally speaking, we\u2019re seeing trends in line with what we expected. The one item I\u2019d maybe add to what you asked is we do have some catch-up in certain markets. I highlighted Los Angeles, for instance, and other markets like New York and San Francisco are put in a similar category where we had rental rate restrictions for a good part of the 2020 and into 2021 time period where even as rental rates maybe don\u2019t need to grow as much to see outsized growth in those markets because we\u2019ve got \"catch-up\" to do versus what we would have otherwise sent to date. And so you see that acceleration in Los Angeles in the quarter and would anticipate that continues.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ki Bin Kim with Truist\nKi Bin Kim: So, just going back to the April trend, thanks for all the details. I was just curious if there\u2019s been any change in promotion activity or marketing dollars that might be supporting that 12% increase in move-in rates?\nTom Boyle: Yes. It\u2019s a good question, Ki Bin. No changes to strategy there. You saw we had marketing dollars that were lower in the first quarter. I\u2019d anticipate that that decline starts to moderate as we move through the year, given comps last year. But overall, advertising spend was lower in April than we had in March, for instance, promotional discounts as we move into this time of the year seasonally adjust lower, and we saw that play out through April as well. So, nothing really to note there out of the ordinary, just overall continued good demand for consumers as well as businesses to store during the month of April, which is helpful set up as we get into May and June.\nKi Bin Kim: Got it. And if I take a step back and look at what\u2019s happening in the market in terms of Netflix and Amazon, there\u2019s this notion that -- or concern that the days of sitting at home and watching a Squid Game and shopping on Amazon might be winding down, and part of that kind of trade, if you want to call it that, the kind of COVID winners may be dissipating. And obviously, self-storage is a little bit different to supply and demand dynamic, but work from home and all the changes that happened throughout COVID definitely did help your portfolio and the demand profile. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing anything on the margins that might suggest some of those demand drivers starting to wind down?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Ki Bin, I would say, we\u2019ve seen a very good balance of, if you call it, some of the wind-down that was purely driven by pandemic, intensity or peak periods of the pandemic, have been compensated for by other things, which include, as I mentioned, affordability from a living standpoint, whether you\u2019re an owner or a renter. That\u2019s always an additive driver to the financial benefit of acquiring a storage unit, financially a lower price point. So, that continues to be very supportive of the demand that we\u2019re seeing. Statistically, from a hybrid and work environment, we\u2019re seeing continued evidence that many companies are continuing to adopt and potentially maintain the level of flexibility for the workforces. That too, continues a very, very healthy driver. Even when certain employees are being pulled back to work, they\u2019re likely not being pulled back on a full time everyday basis. Today, we are seeing what we might see traditionally at this time of year, more college student activity. There\u2019s still good movement relative to home sales, even though interest rates are up, there\u2019s still a very active home sale environment this time of year. So again, many of the more intense drivers through the pandemic, some of those have eased down, we\u2019re seeing other additive, still very compelling reasons, like we\u2019re seeing good customer demand.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just curious on the sunsetting of rent restrictions. If you could just provide any update or progress in the ability to recapture what was a loss over COVID and maybe prior to that? You provided a bit of color around the initial guidance with fourth quarter results, but just curious if you have an update on expectations for the impact to same-store revenues for \u201822?\nTom Boyle: Sure. I\u2019m going to concentrate my commentary around Los Angeles because it\u2019s our largest market, I think the clearer story. And big picture, we\u2019re seeing strong trends in Los Angeles. The long-running rent restrictions expired at the end of the year. We commented on the last call that we anticipated that event would likely add 1.5% to 2% of same-store revenue to the Company overall outlook. Los Angeles is our largest market, and it\u2019s accelerating. As I noted, the same-store revenue growth acceleration within the quarter. The team recently completed capital investments in that market as well through our Property of Tomorrow program. So, the team was ready for January 1st with good-looking properties and poised to accelerate. So, we are seeing that. And I\u2019d reiterate the commentary around the growth potential coming from that market specifically.\nJoe Russell: And on top of that, not only our largest market, but it\u2019s also our highest occupied market, nationally. So, we\u2019re close to 98% occupancy. So again, another very strong states that are for the kind of revenue opportunity that Tom is speaking to.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. So, no change to the 1.5% to 2% benefit, I guess, from L.A. and other rent restrictions coming off, just to...\nTom Boyle: That\u2019s right. We\u2019re seeing the strong acceleration we anticipated.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. And then, I mean, it sounds like you guys are pretty bullish across all geographies, but we\u2019ve definitely seen some markets kind of lag, whether it\u2019s New York, in some markets, i.e., anything in the Sunbelt. How do you think that dynamic plays out as we go into \u201823? Are you a subscriber to the view that the Sunbelt markets, I guess, the product of just tough comps will normalize to the mean and maybe New York kind of led and is a leading indicator of where the other markets will go, or just curious on how you think this plays out from a geographic perspective?\nTom Boyle: Yes. I think you highlighted a good point, which is there is some variability across our markets. We\u2019re seeing really strong demand in the procyclical demand drivers that Joe mentioned, population growth, home activity, et cetera. Florida continues to perform incredibly well. And that\u2019s to date, meaning we\u2019re already starting to face some pretty tough comps in markets like Miami, and Tampa, West Palm Beach, but they continue to perform really well year-over-year. To give you a sense, move-in rents in Miami in the first quarter were up 31%. And similar trends in April. So, really good strong trends there. I do think, over time, we are anticipating that there will be supply that comes into the Sunbelt markets to serve that incremental population growth and the home building activity that\u2019s taking place in many of those markets. And that\u2019s a healthy thing for our industry and for that customer base, which is likely to temper the kinds of rent growth that we\u2019re seeing today. But overall, we\u2019re still seeing good trends. And as Joe mentioned, industry-wide, we\u2019re not anticipating a near-term elevation in new supply, given the challenges related to getting through city processes, the construction process, costs, et cetera, today. So, we\u2019re still seeing good strength there. In terms of New York and San Francisco, maybe just on the flip side, we did see acceleration in those markets that was partly attributable to some of the catch-up I commented on earlier around rental rate restrictions. So, we do have some momentum there. And overall, those markets are still performing really well, but they don\u2019t have the same sort of procyclical drivers that a Miami does or an Atlanta does today.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Samir Khanal with Evercore.\nSamir Khanal: So, Tom, maybe to expand on that and kind of talk a little bit about New York. I know it\u2019s only about 5% of your portfolio. Curious how do you think the sort of second half works out here, right? It\u2019s held up well, still lagging the rest of the portfolio. I mean, is it really a supply thing here or are you seeing any sort of move out sort of pick up as folks return back to the city?\nTom Boyle: Yes. That\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m not going to speak specifically to second half outlook for markets in particular. But I would say, we aren\u2019t seeing anything overly concerning related to move-outs and the specific question you asked around people returning to the city. So, that\u2019s not a driver that we\u2019ve seen to date. There is some new supply that continues to be absorbed in Brooklyn and parts of Queens. But overall, I would anticipate that that supply does get absorbed. And again, first quarter same-store revenue growth of north of 9% in the quarter accelerating from the fourth quarter is a pretty good place to be in a big market like New York.\nSamir Khanal: Got it. And then, just shifting gears to the transaction market a little bit. I know for the year, I think you said it\u2019s about $270 million is sort of what you\u2019ve done so far. Your guidance is still at about $1 billion of acquisitions. Maybe provide color on kind of what you\u2019re seeing out there, sort of what\u2019s in the pipeline and sort of pricing as well?\nJoe Russell: Sure, Samir. The comparable to 2021 was likely to be strong, meaning it was unlikely we\u2019re going to see the same level of trading activity in 2022 that we saw last year. The thing that drove the volume in 2021 was the number of large billion-plus portfolios that came into the market, plus or minus $18 billion of overall transactions took place and almost half of them were tied to those big, very unique portfolios that were in the market at various stages of 2021. As we mentioned even in the earnings call last quarter, we don\u2019t anticipate the same number of large portfolios in the near term coming back into the market this year, and now 4 months in, we haven\u2019t seen that kind of activity emerge. There is still a healthy amount of both, individual and smaller portfolios, say in the $200 million to $300 million range that have either come into the market or will likely come into the market in the coming quarter or two. So, we\u2019ll see how that level of activity matches the kind of smaller activity that we saw in 2021. Pricing is very competitive. I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s any movement yet in cap rates, surprisingly even with interest rates elevating, but there\u2019s a fair amount of pent-up capital that still wants to come into the self-storage sector. So, aggressiveness from buyers remains. We\u2019re seeing some good assets in multiple markets. We\u2019re busy underwriting a number of different transactions, but it\u2019s not the same elevated level of deal flow that either we saw in 2021 or likely to see this year. But, it\u2019s not annual that first quarter is a little quieter. A lot of owners take the first or maybe even sometimes the second quarter to figure out their own playbook relative to bringing assets to market. So, we\u2019ll see how that trends going into Q2 and Q3. And from there, we\u2019ll see what kind of volume plays through.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Keegan Carl with Berenberg.\nKeegan Carl: I think first, just given what\u2019s going on in the broader macro economy of inflationary concerns. Have you guys seen any change in your customer demographics and preferences?\nTom Boyle: Yes. That is a very good question, and there\u2019s a number of dynamics that we\u2019re watching very closely as we typically do, but given the dynamic changes that we saw through the first quarter, we\u2019re watching particularly closely this year. I\u2019d highlight a few of them. On the demand side, we\u2019re watching to see any shifts in demand. And as Joe mentioned earlier, we continue to see a broad group of demand. We\u2019re not seeing shifts in for instance, cohorts by income or demography shifting year-over-year for new customer demand, and that\u2019s healthy. But, we are watching. As Joe mentioned, home sales is a driver as we move through this part of the year. Interest rates are moving higher. We\u2019ve seen new home sale and existing home sale activity decline on a month-over-month basis, but still sitting at activity levels that are well above pre-pandemic levels, which are supportive to demand. So, again, watching that closely, but nothing that we\u2019ve seen to date. As it relates to other pressure points on the consumer, we spoke earlier about our existing tenant rate increase activity and the fact that consumers are behaving as expected there. So, no shift there. The other pain point would be payment activity. And consumer balance sheets continue to support good payment activity. So, we were looking at some data from a money center bank a week or two ago, highlighting the cash balances are still up meaningfully, nearly double what they were pre-pandemic for American households. And I think the other component is home equity, right? There\u2019s been a wealth creation event for homeowners that is supporting American consumer balance sheets as well. So, those are supportive. Now, I would say, we are seeing delinquency off the lows that we saw during the pandemic, but we\u2019re also not in an environment where stimulus checks are going out. And so, it\u2019s natural to see a little bit of a lift in delinquency, but we remain in a good place and certainly better than where we were pre-pandemic, to date. So, we\u2019re watching all of those drivers pretty closely but to this point, continue to see strong trends across the board.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And then, shifting gears a little bit and maybe just a little bit more color on your length of stay. Have the reasons for customers leaving changed at all in recent months? For example, are you maybe seeing more people mention pricing in their reasoning for leaving?\nTom Boyle: Yes, no meaningful change there. The biggest driver that people highlight when they leave is that they no longer need the space, which makes sense, right? You think about the use cases for storage at some point, many customers no longer need the space, either because they move or their living situations change, et cetera. So, that continues to be the biggest driver and no change there. In terms of length of stay, Joe highlighted the lengthening of that metric. And on average, our customers that are in place, their average tenure is about 40 months today, and that compares to a pre-pandemic average in 2019 of around 33 months. So, we continue to see really strong tenure, which is supporting both, our pricing strength as well as existing tenant rate increase programs.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRon Kamdem: Hey. Just going back to L.A., I think the original guidance, I think you\u2019d mentioned sort of 200 basis points of contribution to the same-store revenue line item. You gave some really good comments at the opening remarks about just same-store hitting 15%. So, the question is, anything changed there? And, can you give us a sense just of how below market those rents are sort of post this expiration or price changing? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: Sure. I\u2019d just reiterate what I highlighted earlier, which is we still believe that 1.5% to 2% is the right sort of range. We were obviously starting from a period of a standing start in January when those rental rate restrictions expired. And so, it will take some time to see that acceleration play through, both from new customers coming in at higher rents, older customers leaving us, and then the existing tenant rate program. So, that will take some quarters to season in. But, I specifically highlighted that the January to March trend to just speak to the level of acceleration we\u2019re seeing out of the gates here in 2022.\nRon Kamdem: Great. And then, sort of my second question was just looking at average occupancy. We have it down sort of 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. I sort of appreciate your comments about this year is all about rates. And when you see occupancy down, which doesn\u2019t seem like that much, is the sense that there\u2019s potentially more sort of pricing acceleration to be had during the peak leasing season, or just trying to get a sense of how much harder could you push here?\nTom Boyle: I think we\u2019ll update you on that next quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rob Simone with Hedgeye Risk.\nRob Simone: I had like kind of a higher-level strategic question for you. I mean, obviously, the last year has been fairly transformative for PSA and kind of how you communicate and run the business. I guess, looking back over the past year and without -- obviously, you can\u2019t share things that are discussed at the Board level. But if you had to kind of like think about a scorecard on what you hope to accomplish when -- you said about these changes versus what you did, kind of what was successful and what\u2019s like left hasn\u2019t had its box checked yet, unlike what\u2019s left to do in affecting all of those changes and kind of getting the Company to where you wanted it to be? Thanks.\nJoe Russell: Sure, Rob. Yes, the thing that we were very transparent about and this goes back now almost a year when we did our Investor Day in May of last year was outlining the variety of different strategic initiatives that not only were pronounced from an impact standpoint, but many had been in formation for some time relative to the investments and the opportunities that we saw relative to approaching the market through our technology initiatives. The opportunity that we saw with the quality of assets that we could bring into the portfolio, the expansion of our development program, the way that we\u2019re using data analytics, the digitization of the business. So, we\u2019ve checkmarked a number of different areas that we\u2019ve intentionally been that much more transparent about. I would tell you that the team at large is working very aggressively to continue the optimization in each of those areas. We\u2019re on very good path relative to continuing to deliver more optimization on the way that we\u2019re not only running the business. You\u2019re seeing that through, for instance, our eRental program, very customer effective and very effective from an efficiency and employee satisfaction standpoint, an area that we continue to mine opportunities around through investments and that, again, ties to our development capabilities, and the things that we\u2019re doing very uniquely in the industry by virtue of the size of our team and the way that we\u2019re delivering Gen 5 properties, that also then reverts right back to what we\u2019re doing with our Property of Tomorrow program, where we\u2019re retooling the existing portfolio, adding many amenities that we\u2019ve been putting into these Gen 5 properties, which include solar and efficiencies from that standpoint. So, that all points to a very strong and ongoing commitment to the growth of the business, the investment that we\u2019re making in very different and powerful parts of the business. We\u2019re pleased by the traction. We\u2019re pleased by the business results. But as always, we are very challenged to do more. With a brand like we have at Public Storage, we can continue to expand that brand. You\u2019re seeing that as we invigorated the effectiveness even of the assets that we\u2019ve been buying over the last couple of years in particular, where average occupancy was in, say, the 60% to 65% range. We put them right into the public storage brand, put many of the tools and the operational efficiencies right into those assets, and they do tremendously well. So, the team at large, we continue to invest in. That\u2019s another very prominent strategy that we\u2019ve got. So, we\u2019ve put a lot of additional thought and retooling into the teams throughout the Company, particularly through our operating teams and we\u2019re seeing very good results from that, too. So, great environment to continue to drive the business, and we\u2019re pleased by many of the things that are taking hold.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citigroup.\nSmedes Rose: I just wanted to circle back a little bit on the acquisitions outlook. And I know that you mentioned you haven\u2019t seen any changes in pricing so far that remains very competitive. But, just from your perspective, are you maybe holding back more than you otherwise might have on the expectation that pricing will change, or just kind of how do you see that playing out just because -- I mean, we know that interest rates are going up, right? I mean, that\u2019s been very clear. I\u2019m just wondering, it seems at some point, that has to start being reflected in what -- in seller expectations?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Smedes, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve holistically pivoted or taken a different approach to the way that we\u2019ve been investing. We continue to look for opportunities, just as I outlined relative to the quality of the assets that we\u2019re bringing to the portfolio, the opportunity that we can say from -- that we can see from driving returns, based on our performance and then putting them into our own platform, what kind of success factors we\u2019ll see from there, the additive scale that we\u2019re going to get in any particular market. So, because of some of the shifting that we\u2019re seeing, we haven\u2019t stepped back and said where we\u2019re going to be out of the market or we\u2019re going to shift down relative to our approach to betting and looking at assets that make sense to come into the portfolio. There\u2019s a fair amount of competitive activity. But believe me, the team is working hard. We\u2019re very busy underwriting assets. And there\u2019s a lot of competitive activity playing through. There\u2019s always a tipping point that we\u2019re very cognizant of where we feel an asset may or may not bring forth the relative returns best on a price that it may trade for us. So, we\u2019re going to be very reflective of that, too. But overall, we\u2019re still seeing opportunities. And we\u2019re very optimistic about what can continue to play through. As Tom mentioned, our balance sheet continues to be in very strong shape. We\u2019re sitting on $1 billion of cash. This year, we\u2019re likely to generate another $600 million to $700 million in free cash flow. So, very well positioned to continue to grow the portfolio and seeing very good asset opportunities, and we\u2019ll continue to vet them.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital.\nTodd Thomas: I just wanted to go back to occupancy for a second. The decrease in occupancy at quarter-end compared to the average appeared a little bit atypical for a first quarter. I know you\u2019re at sort of very-high occupancy rates, in general, but -- and I know the goal is to maximize revenue. But, are you seeing occupancy build up further from here at this point during the peak rental season, or are you seeing the occupancy side of the formula just a little bit more challenging to maintain?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Well, I think, I\u2019d make a couple of points. I think one of the comments you made there was an important one, which is that we\u2019re seeking to maximize revenue from the available inventory that we have. And so, occupancy is a component, rental rate is a component. I\u2019ll tell you, occupancy down 80 basis points is a relatively small component of the overall revenue outlook as we think about the year. That said, clearly, we\u2019re managing our inventory. And I guess, maybe reading into your question, are you asking is occupancy lower because of weaker consumer trends. And I think to reiterate comments we\u2019ve made already on the call, we\u2019re not seeing weakening consumer trends. We\u2019re seeing good customer demand for space and then seeking to maximize the revenue that we can from the available inventory and that demand. So, I wouldn\u2019t highlight anything there. I would say, it\u2019s unusual to start the year with the level of occupancy that we had this year. And so, I think, your point is a fair one, which is it\u2019s a bit of a unique year, but that doesn\u2019t change our strategies as we head through the year.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, are there any indicators that give you a sense for maybe the level of vacates that you might anticipate if economic activity slows down from where it\u2019s at here in the quarters ahead? Is there any way to sort of gauge potential vacate activity across the portfolio?\nTom Boyle: Yes. I mean, vacate activity is something that our teams watch very closely. So, you heard from Richard Craig and Philip Kim, on our team on Investor Day around the analytics and pricing methodologies. Part of those methodologies drive on available inventory. And to understand available inventory, you need to understand anticipated vacates and the level of inventory you have to market. So, that\u2019s a metric that I have teams internally looking at daily. And what I\u2019d say is, we have pretty good visibility into vacate levels. And if things start to shift in an unexpected manner, it\u2019s certainly something we\u2019d communicate. But to everything we\u2019ve highlighted to date, we\u2019re not seeing anything that is unusual as it\u2019s related to the predicted vacate activity through the year. I would say the only time we saw really big shifts in anticipated vacates versus what the actuals were was the onset of the pandemic. And that was obviously a pretty unique time period. But really since then, behavior has been pretty predictable.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you Most of my questions have been asked. I just had two maybe on the ancillary revenue side. There\u2019s been a lot of churn across the sector in terms of the third-party management pools. Can you guys maybe just speak to who is buying these assets? Is it any REIT peers, or is the buyer pool changed recently?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Spencer, it\u2019s any and all of the typical buyers that are out in the market. So, that\u2019s a pretty commonplace component of the third-party platforms, whether they\u2019re the platforms you see through the public operators, and there\u2019s a fair amount of private third-party management platforms as well. So, the trading activity that can take place within those platforms can come from either a public operator, private equity, private investors. So, it\u2019s pretty typical of just the overall range of buying activity that takes place. We\u2019ve -- typically, even before we got in the third-party management business, typically bought a fair amount of assets out of different third-party platforms. Last year that -- we also bought a number of assets out of our own third-party management platform. In the first quarter, we bought one. But, there is a fair amount of trading that goes on in these platforms, some of which is tied to structurally, the reasons many of these assets are on these platforms as they\u2019re being teed up to do just that. The owners may not look at their own ownership for long periods of time. They\u2019re looking for certain levels of optimization. They\u2019ll get the asset to that point, and they\u2019ll take back right out of the market to trade. So, very typical kind of the overall dynamics of what happens with third-party management.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay, great. Thank you. And then, can you give a sense of the penetration rates for tenant insurance, just maybe on the same-store pool as compared to your non-same-store pool?\nTom Boyle: Sure. I\u2019m going to speak to coverage overall. Coverage in the same-store pool is in the upper 60s, and that\u2019s been pretty stable. It\u2019s maybe been increasing a little bit over the past couple of years. And in the non-same store, it\u2019s lower than that. And that\u2019s intuitive for development properties. It actually tends to punch a little bit higher than our same-store pool as we see a lot of new customers who find the value in our tenant insurance offering. And then for acquired properties, it takes a little bit longer to have that coverage reach a more stable basis as many tenants are coming in that are in place that maybe don\u2019t choose to utilize the offering. So overall, it tends to be lower. I think for the quarter, off the top of my head, it was in the 50s for coverage in the non-same-store pool versus that upper-60s in the same-store pool. And obviously, part of the strategy over the coming years will not only be to lease up that non-same-store pool, but also offer that product to that tenant base.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: I was just wondering if you could talk maybe a little bit more on supply. Supply is often brought on demand is strong, and it seems like it is. And I think you\u2019ve previously said you didn\u2019t think it would be a real wind to \u201822 or \u201823. So, just wondering if you could give your current view on supply this year and next, and what macro factors may be impacting that, for example, construction costs versus storage-specific drivers, like good demand.\nJoe Russell: Sure, Caitlin. Yes. And I would tell you that as we\u2019ve spoken to over the last several quarters, some of the headwinds that seem to be containing the amount of volume of new development, we feel, is a good thing in one way, meaning there\u2019s elevated risk going in any development opportunity. And I can\u2019t name a city, for instance, nationally that is easier to deal with today than it was pre-pandemic. City staffs are constrained from a staffing standpoint, from a timing standpoint, the complexity to get through both entitlement and then construction processes are very elevated. And with that, there\u2019s more risk at hand, at a time when we\u2019re seeing component costs increase, in some cases, pretty dramatically, whether it\u2019s steel, labor, concrete. And then, with that interest rates are still far from stable. In fact, they\u2019re accelerating. So, very different risk factors that create some pretty meaningful headwinds. So, the development business is still active, however, I mean, still 500 to 600 properties likely to come into the market this year and next. To your point, obviously, some of that\u2019s being driven by the overall success of the sector and the amount of demand that we\u2019re seeing for self-storage, but there\u2019s a healthier level of discipline that\u2019s playing through for many of the factors that I spoke to. It\u2019s been a good window for our development team to continue to do what you\u2019re seeing us do, which is to grow our own pipeline. We\u2019re seeing less competitive activity for certain land sites in certain markets. We\u2019re able to capture opportunities because we\u2019ve got the scale, the efficiency and the opportunity deflect to some degree, some of the pressure points that I just spoke to. But if you\u2019re a first-time developer or a developer that doesn\u2019t have the wherewithal to potentially deal with these risk factors, you\u2019re probably going to be a lot more conservative and -- we think that overall, as I mentioned, that\u2019s a good thing for the industry.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. And then maybe also on the eRental platform. I know you talked earlier that it\u2019s continuing to grow. So, sorry if I missed the stat. Could you just go through what portion of your portfolio or incremental leasing this makes up where you see it going, but also what kind of impact that shift has on the bottom line? Like, are there any less employees or other expenses as a result of that?\nJoe Russell: Yes. So, we\u2019ve seen continued adoption of eRental. Now, over 50% of our customers are using that channel from an election standpoint. We\u2019re not pushing them to it, but they\u2019re actually electing to choose self-directed digital leasing process. By virtue of that, at our own frontlines and the amount of time that our property managers, in particular, historically would have spent on that specific move-in process when you\u2019re seeing the effects of potentially 50-plus-percent of that coming out of the labor demand property to property, it\u2019s pretty powerful. It gives us the opportunity to redirect priorities relative to the utility of the property management team, the things that they\u2019re focused on, the efficiencies that can play through when half or more of their customer activity is actually being self-directed and done on a digital basis. So, it\u2019s a pretty powerful tool. You\u2019re seeing some of that through the cost efficiency and our labor, even though labor costs are up, but there\u2019s continued benefit that we see from increasing the amount of digital options that we\u2019re giving customers. And frankly, we\u2019re getting very good feedback from customers who use that tool as well. It\u2019s a growing and preferred alternative to actually transact. It\u2019s a much more consistent experience, and it can give the customer even that much more flexibility when they choose to move in to a specific property. So, all things considered, it\u2019s been a very powerful tool, and we\u2019re continuing to look at different ways of utilizing it and expanding its use, again, depending on customer choices.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Thanks for letting me get back in the queue. Just one question kind of tying back to a couple of previous ones. At the Investor Day last year, you talked about the longer-term goal of cutting 25% in payroll costs. So, just curious if you have an update on that. Clearly, inflation is a lot higher. This quarter, we saw R&M and centralized management costs on the same-store pull up in the high-teens. So, just if you can give us an update on how we should be thinking about that previous commentary in light of what\u2019s changed, obviously?\nTom Boyle: Yes. So, just to put some financial guardrails around what Joe just highlighted from a strategy standpoint. We did highlight that we would anticipate to reduce hours by about 25% from 2019 levels at the Investor Day. And I\u2019d say, we\u2019re a good bit along that journey, but a little over halfway and continuing to find opportunities to drive that further. So, we\u2019re on track there and anticipate to get through to that 25% in the coming year or two.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan.\nMichael Mueller: Yes. Hi. Curious, as you\u2019re ramping up your development spend, can you talk a little bit about your -- through land positions, and how many years\u2019 worth of starts that that could support?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Mike. What\u2019s typical in the way that we approach land is we\u2019re looking primarily for opportunities where we\u2019re not directly putting land inventory right onto our balance sheet. It\u2019s pretty typical or the types of opportunities that we\u2019re sourcing give us the flexibility as a buyer to actually take the site through layers or stages of entitlements that happen on their ownership time. It\u2019s the obligation they give us or the time we take to actually take the property through reentitlement without actually owning the site. So, contractually, that\u2019s a pretty typical approach. It\u2019s not each and every time, but more often than not, we\u2019re taking a land site through certain layers of entitlements before we actually take ownership to not only reduce risk but to contain costs as well. And with the amount of knowledge, efficiency and resources that we put into these processes, by far, the majority of the landowners that we\u2019re doing business with are agreeable to that kind of approach. So, with that, we\u2019re not holding large land positions. And with -- and more frequently, we\u2019re going to acquire a site when it\u2019s much more closer to the ability or the timing to actually start construction.\nMichael Mueller: Got it. So, I mean, if we\u2019re just thinking about those agreements in the same way that you would think about owning land, I guess, how many you\u2019re in the works -- or how many do you have? And what sort of lead time frame does that give you in terms of we have with what\u2019s under our control, two years worth of development three years or one year or something? I mean, how do you size that up?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Mike, I would say, it aligns exactly to the timing you\u2019re talking about. So, market-to-market, you\u2019ve got some processes that might take you a year or two. You\u2019ve got others that could take three or four. And believe it or not, some that could even be longer than that. So, we\u2019re matching that up. And contractually, we have control of the sites before we\u2019re starting to invest and deploy resources and time into those sites. So, we\u2019ve got control of the land sites themselves. So -- and it matches to exactly what you\u2019re speaking to. So, if you think about the pipeline that we have today, there are components of that pipeline that those land sites are going through the exact same sets of processes that I spoke to. So, we may not have actually acquired the land site itself in certain of those cases, but we have full contractual ability to control the site. And once we get through the entitlement process, we\u2019ll take ownership.\nOperator: Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the program back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thanks, Katie, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s program. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $3.65 for the quarter, representing 29.4% growth over the first quarter of 2021. Our first quarter results represent a strong start to the year and an acceleration from the fourth quarter. Let's look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 15.8% compared to the first quarter of 2021. That performance is an acceleration from the 13% to 14% range in the second half of 2021. Growth was driven by rate with two factors leading to the continued strength: First, strong demand and limited inventory, which allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 15% versus 2021; second, existing tenant rate increases also contributed with lengthening customer stays as well as comparing to a period in 2021 when we were impacted by rental rate regulation in some of our largest markets. On that note, Los Angeles was a particularly strong contributor accelerating from 8% same-store revenue growth in January to 15% same-store revenue growth in March. Now on to expenses. We had a good quarter on cost of operations, up 3.6% in the quarter, with savings on marketing expense offsetting expected growth in other line items. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 20.5% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter, as Joe mentioned. Now shifting to the outlook. We're roughly 70 days on from when we introduced our initial 2022 guidance for the year. We reiterated our strong core FFO outlook yesterday with a $15.20 midpoint, representing 17.5% growth from 2021. We're anticipating another year of strong customer demand from self-storage, and as Joe mentioned, we are experiencing that through April with a very good setup into our traditional busy leasing months ahead. As I've highlighted over the past year, with occupancy near record levels, our outlook for growth is driven by rental rate. Shifting gears, PS Business Parks announced it entered into an agreement where Blackstone will acquire the company. We have agreed to vote our shares for the transaction. Upon closing, which is anticipated in the third quarter, we would receive $2.7 billion of cash. And of that $2.7 billion, recognize a $2.3 billion tax gain that would increase our distribution requirements for the year. As we noted in our filings, PSB contributed $25.5 million in core FFO in the first quarter or approximately 4% of company-wide FFO. We have not updated our guidance ranges to reflect this sale, but we'll plan to update you as the transaction progresses and more details are provided by PSB. Last but not least, our low leverage balance sheet gives us capacity to fund growth and at the same time, is well laddered with long-term debt and $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions against a rising rate environment. Perpetual fixed rate capital is very good capital in today's markets, and so is $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet at March 31st. And with that, Katie, I'll turn it to you to open it up for questions. Sure. Yes. Joe mentioned, we're seeing good momentum heading into the second quarter. And we're seeing that really across the board. Market strengths are pretty consistent through April. Web visits and sales calls are up in the month or were up in the month. We saw good momentum from move-in transactions, move-in rates, which I know is a topic that I'm sure you're interested in, were up about a little over 12% in the month. We continued to see the occupancy and rate trade off that we saw in the first quarter. So, occupancy ended April down about 120 basis points year-over-year, but again, against the backdrop of really strong rate growth. Sure. I'm happy to take that. And I guess, what I'd characterize is the year has started out largely right in line with our plan, i.e., strong, but the strong start we anticipated. And, it's only been 70 days since we set our initial range. When we communicated that, we highlighted that we specifically widened the ranges to try to encapsulate more upside into the ranges compared to maybe last year where we had narrow ranges. And the reason for the width of the range is really the uncertainty as we get into the busy season here and the uncertainty that's inherent in a month-to-month lease business in the second half of the year. We're going to learn a lot about how that's going to play out over the next three months or so, and we'll certainly provide updates and would expect that as we move through the year, we likely will narrow ranges as we go forward, like we did last year. But, at this point, we feel good about our outlook for the year. And to date, we've seen the strong performance we anticipated. Yes. That's clearly a good question and speaks to the uncertainty as we move through the busy season here. To date, we've continued to see good momentum in move-in rents and customers willing to accept those higher move-in rents against an environment, as Joe mentioned of tight inventory. So, while occupancy is off year-over-year, we're still talking about near-record occupancies, which gives us pricing strength when inventory gets tight. We anticipate that inventory will only get tighter from here as we move into the busy season. From a month-to-month standpoint, we saw pretty consistent year-over-year, call it, mid-teens growth on move-in rents through the first quarter. As I noted in April, we're up a touch over 12% on move-in rents. And we're already starting to face those tougher comps year-over-year. So, as Joe mentioned, we clearly have momentum here. Now the question will be how does that play out over the next several months to kind of reset rents potentially higher or where they will reset? Sure. Thanks, Michael. So, Joe mentioned earlier that the existing tenant rate program is going well through the year. And what we mean by that specifically is consumers are behaving as expected. And we continue to run our modeling to derive expected behavior and optimize increases, that will continue through the year. So clearly, one of the inputs to that you're highlighting, which is moving rents and the cost to replace a tenant if they move out or if we're wrong on our predictive analytics. But generally speaking, we're seeing trends in line with what we expected. The one item I'd maybe add to what you asked is we do have some catch-up in certain markets. I highlighted Los Angeles, for instance, and other markets like New York and San Francisco are put in a similar category where we had rental rate restrictions for a good part of the 2020 and into 2021 time period where even as rental rates maybe don't need to grow as much to see outsized growth in those markets because we've got \"catch-up\" to do versus what we would have otherwise sent to date. And so you see that acceleration in Los Angeles in the quarter and would anticipate that continues. Yes. It's a good question, Ki Bin. No changes to strategy there. You saw we had marketing dollars that were lower in the first quarter. I'd anticipate that that decline starts to moderate as we move through the year, given comps last year. But overall, advertising spend was lower in April than we had in March, for instance, promotional discounts as we move into this time of the year seasonally adjust lower, and we saw that play out through April as well. So, nothing really to note there out of the ordinary, just overall continued good demand for consumers as well as businesses to store during the month of April, which is helpful set up as we get into May and June. Sure. I'm going to concentrate my commentary around Los Angeles because it's our largest market, I think the clearer story. And big picture, we're seeing strong trends in Los Angeles. The long-running rent restrictions expired at the end of the year. We commented on the last call that we anticipated that event would likely add 1.5% to 2% of same-store revenue to the Company overall outlook. Los Angeles is our largest market, and it's accelerating. As I noted, the same-store revenue growth acceleration within the quarter. The team recently completed capital investments in that market as well through our Property of Tomorrow program. So, the team was ready for January 1st with good-looking properties and poised to accelerate. So, we are seeing that. And I'd reiterate the commentary around the growth potential coming from that market specifically. That's right. We're seeing the strong acceleration we anticipated. Yes. I think you highlighted a good point, which is there is some variability across our markets. We're seeing really strong demand in the procyclical demand drivers that Joe mentioned, population growth, home activity, et cetera. Florida continues to perform incredibly well. And that's to date, meaning we're already starting to face some pretty tough comps in markets like Miami, and Tampa, West Palm Beach, but they continue to perform really well year-over-year. To give you a sense, move-in rents in Miami in the first quarter were up 31%. And similar trends in April. So, really good strong trends there. I do think, over time, we are anticipating that there will be supply that comes into the Sunbelt markets to serve that incremental population growth and the home building activity that's taking place in many of those markets. And that's a healthy thing for our industry and for that customer base, which is likely to temper the kinds of rent growth that we're seeing today. But overall, we're still seeing good trends. And as Joe mentioned, industry-wide, we're not anticipating a near-term elevation in new supply, given the challenges related to getting through city processes, the construction process, costs, et cetera, today. So, we're still seeing good strength there. In terms of New York and San Francisco, maybe just on the flip side, we did see acceleration in those markets that was partly attributable to some of the catch-up I commented on earlier around rental rate restrictions. So, we do have some momentum there. And overall, those markets are still performing really well, but they don't have the same sort of procyclical drivers that a Miami does or an Atlanta does today. Yes. That's a good question. I'm not going to speak specifically to second half outlook for markets in particular. But I would say, we aren't seeing anything overly concerning related to move-outs and the specific question you asked around people returning to the city. So, that's not a driver that we've seen to date. There is some new supply that continues to be absorbed in Brooklyn and parts of Queens. But overall, I would anticipate that that supply does get absorbed. And again, first quarter same-store revenue growth of north of 9% in the quarter accelerating from the fourth quarter is a pretty good place to be in a big market like New York. Yes. That is a very good question, and there's a number of dynamics that we're watching very closely as we typically do, but given the dynamic changes that we saw through the first quarter, we're watching particularly closely this year. I'd highlight a few of them. On the demand side, we're watching to see any shifts in demand. And as Joe mentioned earlier, we continue to see a broad group of demand. We're not seeing shifts in for instance, cohorts by income or demography shifting year-over-year for new customer demand, and that's healthy. But, we are watching. As Joe mentioned, home sales is a driver as we move through this part of the year. Interest rates are moving higher. We've seen new home sale and existing home sale activity decline on a month-over-month basis, but still sitting at activity levels that are well above pre-pandemic levels, which are supportive to demand. So, again, watching that closely, but nothing that we've seen to date. As it relates to other pressure points on the consumer, we spoke earlier about our existing tenant rate increase activity and the fact that consumers are behaving as expected there. So, no shift there. The other pain point would be payment activity. And consumer balance sheets continue to support good payment activity. So, we were looking at some data from a money center bank a week or two ago, highlighting the cash balances are still up meaningfully, nearly double what they were pre-pandemic for American households. And I think the other component is home equity, right? There's been a wealth creation event for homeowners that is supporting American consumer balance sheets as well. So, those are supportive. Now, I would say, we are seeing delinquency off the lows that we saw during the pandemic, but we're also not in an environment where stimulus checks are going out. And so, it's natural to see a little bit of a lift in delinquency, but we remain in a good place and certainly better than where we were pre-pandemic, to date. So, we're watching all of those drivers pretty closely but to this point, continue to see strong trends across the board. Yes, no meaningful change there. The biggest driver that people highlight when they leave is that they no longer need the space, which makes sense, right? You think about the use cases for storage at some point, many customers no longer need the space, either because they move or their living situations change, et cetera. So, that continues to be the biggest driver and no change there. In terms of length of stay, Joe highlighted the lengthening of that metric. And on average, our customers that are in place, their average tenure is about 40 months today, and that compares to a pre-pandemic average in 2019 of around 33 months. So, we continue to see really strong tenure, which is supporting both, our pricing strength as well as existing tenant rate increase programs. Sure. I'd just reiterate what I highlighted earlier, which is we still believe that 1.5% to 2% is the right sort of range. We were obviously starting from a period of a standing start in January when those rental rate restrictions expired. And so, it will take some time to see that acceleration play through, both from new customers coming in at higher rents, older customers leaving us, and then the existing tenant rate program. So, that will take some quarters to season in. But, I specifically highlighted that the January to March trend to just speak to the level of acceleration we're seeing out of the gates here in 2022. I think we'll update you on that next quarter. Sure. Well, I think, I'd make a couple of points. I think one of the comments you made there was an important one, which is that we're seeking to maximize revenue from the available inventory that we have. And so, occupancy is a component, rental rate is a component. I'll tell you, occupancy down 80 basis points is a relatively small component of the overall revenue outlook as we think about the year. That said, clearly, we're managing our inventory. And I guess, maybe reading into your question, are you asking is occupancy lower because of weaker consumer trends. And I think to reiterate comments we've made already on the call, we're not seeing weakening consumer trends. We're seeing good customer demand for space and then seeking to maximize the revenue that we can from the available inventory and that demand. So, I wouldn't highlight anything there. I would say, it's unusual to start the year with the level of occupancy that we had this year. And so, I think, your point is a fair one, which is it's a bit of a unique year, but that doesn't change our strategies as we head through the year. Yes. I mean, vacate activity is something that our teams watch very closely. So, you heard from Richard Craig and Philip Kim, on our team on Investor Day around the analytics and pricing methodologies. Part of those methodologies drive on available inventory. And to understand available inventory, you need to understand anticipated vacates and the level of inventory you have to market. So, that's a metric that I have teams internally looking at daily. And what I'd say is, we have pretty good visibility into vacate levels. And if things start to shift in an unexpected manner, it's certainly something we'd communicate. But to everything we've highlighted to date, we're not seeing anything that is unusual as it's related to the predicted vacate activity through the year. I would say the only time we saw really big shifts in anticipated vacates versus what the actuals were was the onset of the pandemic. And that was obviously a pretty unique time period. But really since then, behavior has been pretty predictable. Sure. I'm going to speak to coverage overall. Coverage in the same-store pool is in the upper 60s, and that's been pretty stable. It's maybe been increasing a little bit over the past couple of years. And in the non-same store, it's lower than that. And that's intuitive for development properties. It actually tends to punch a little bit higher than our same-store pool as we see a lot of new customers who find the value in our tenant insurance offering. And then for acquired properties, it takes a little bit longer to have that coverage reach a more stable basis as many tenants are coming in that are in place that maybe don't choose to utilize the offering. So overall, it tends to be lower. I think for the quarter, off the top of my head, it was in the 50s for coverage in the non-same-store pool versus that upper-60s in the same-store pool. And obviously, part of the strategy over the coming years will not only be to lease up that non-same-store pool, but also offer that product to that tenant base. Yes. So, just to put some financial guardrails around what Joe just highlighted from a strategy standpoint. We did highlight that we would anticipate to reduce hours by about 25% from 2019 levels at the Investor Day. And I'd say, we're a good bit along that journey, but a little over halfway and continuing to find opportunities to drive that further. So, we're on track there and anticipate to get through to that 25% in the coming year or two."

            "name": "Joe Russell",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before I hand the call over to Tom to discuss specific Q1 metrics, I will highlight five areas that are setting the stage for a robust 2022. First, market-to-market business remains very strong. Now that we are four months into the year, we continue to see elevated demand from new customers across the portfolio. Existing customers are also extending average length of stay. We have healthy pricing dynamics, and with move-in rates up 15% and our existing customer rate increase program performing very well. Second, the traditional busy season is taking hold. Inventory is tight with vacancy at about 5%. We see outsized demand for vacant units throughout the markets. Both, consumers and business customers are aggressively seeking space along with more traditional drivers for this time of year, which include home sales and college students. Home affordability, hybrid work environment and a tight commercial market are clearly additive to our performance metrics. Third, our large non-same-store portfolio, now 515 assets across 50 million square feet is growing significantly from a revenue and occupancy standpoint. Non-same-store NOI nearly tripled during the quarter. These assets are highly complementary to our market presence and continue to deliver exceptional returns with outsized move-in activity due to average occupancy of 86%. Of note, the $1.8 billion ezStorage portfolio we acquired a year ago has already achieved the yield we anticipated after year two. The recently acquired $1.5 billion All Storage portfolio is performing ahead of expectations as well. Fourth, as anticipated, fewer assets have entered the sales market this year. Year-to-date, we have closed or are under contract for 21 assets, totaling approximately $275 million. Our industry-leading development platform increased to $833 million. The forecast of relatively stable national deliveries for 2022 and 2023 remains intact as we anticipate approximately 500 to 600 assets will be delivered each of the next two years. And fifth, our industry-leading digital customer experience continues to be embraced by new tenants. This includes digital leasing, centralized property access as well as our PS app. In March, we reached a significant milestone with our 1 millionth eRental move-in. Today, more than half of our customers are choosing eRental, giving them a desirable digital option to lease a unit. Our ongoing investments in the public storage digital platform are improving both, customer experience and employee efficiency. Clearly, a win-win. Now to Tom. And, yes, Jeff, maybe to add a little bit more perspective on the comment I made in my opening remarks. The consumer and business customer environment is still very strong. Consumer balance sheets, by everything that we're seeing relative to statistical levels of health are quite strong. In fact, consumer balance sheets are better today than they were pre-pandemic. We're seeing very good business activity across the spectrum. Top of funnel demand, as Tom mentioned, is quite vibrant. And on the back end, length of stay continues to increase as well. So, the two bookends of both demand on the front side and then enduring utility of consumer and business utility of the space is quite strong. Many of the factors that I spoke to continue to play out quite well, and we're encouraged by what we've seen through the month of April. To your question on how many questions in the queue, we'll let you ask one more, and then we'll move on to the next question. Yes. Ki Bin, I would say, we've seen a very good balance of, if you call it, some of the wind-down that was purely driven by pandemic, intensity or peak periods of the pandemic, have been compensated for by other things, which include, as I mentioned, affordability from a living standpoint, whether you're an owner or a renter. That's always an additive driver to the financial benefit of acquiring a storage unit, financially a lower price point. So, that continues to be very supportive of the demand that we're seeing. Statistically, from a hybrid and work environment, we're seeing continued evidence that many companies are continuing to adopt and potentially maintain the level of flexibility for the workforces. That too, continues a very, very healthy driver. Even when certain employees are being pulled back to work, they're likely not being pulled back on a full time everyday basis. Today, we are seeing what we might see traditionally at this time of year, more college student activity. There's still good movement relative to home sales, even though interest rates are up, there's still a very active home sale environment this time of year. So again, many of the more intense drivers through the pandemic, some of those have eased down, we're seeing other additive, still very compelling reasons, like we're seeing good customer demand. And on top of that, not only our largest market, but it's also our highest occupied market, nationally. So, we're close to 98% occupancy. So again, another very strong states that are for the kind of revenue opportunity that Tom is speaking to. Sure, Samir. The comparable to 2021 was likely to be strong, meaning it was unlikely we're going to see the same level of trading activity in 2022 that we saw last year. The thing that drove the volume in 2021 was the number of large billion-plus portfolios that came into the market, plus or minus $18 billion of overall transactions took place and almost half of them were tied to those big, very unique portfolios that were in the market at various stages of 2021. As we mentioned even in the earnings call last quarter, we don't anticipate the same number of large portfolios in the near term coming back into the market this year, and now 4 months in, we haven't seen that kind of activity emerge. There is still a healthy amount of both, individual and smaller portfolios, say in the $200 million to $300 million range that have either come into the market or will likely come into the market in the coming quarter or two. So, we'll see how that level of activity matches the kind of smaller activity that we saw in 2021. Pricing is very competitive. I wouldn't say there's any movement yet in cap rates, surprisingly even with interest rates elevating, but there's a fair amount of pent-up capital that still wants to come into the self-storage sector. So, aggressiveness from buyers remains. We're seeing some good assets in multiple markets. We're busy underwriting a number of different transactions, but it's not the same elevated level of deal flow that either we saw in 2021 or likely to see this year. But, it's not annual that first quarter is a little quieter. A lot of owners take the first or maybe even sometimes the second quarter to figure out their own playbook relative to bringing assets to market. So, we'll see how that trends going into Q2 and Q3. And from there, we'll see what kind of volume plays through. Sure, Rob. Yes, the thing that we were very transparent about and this goes back now almost a year when we did our Investor Day in May of last year was outlining the variety of different strategic initiatives that not only were pronounced from an impact standpoint, but many had been in formation for some time relative to the investments and the opportunities that we saw relative to approaching the market through our technology initiatives. The opportunity that we saw with the quality of assets that we could bring into the portfolio, the expansion of our development program, the way that we're using data analytics, the digitization of the business. So, we've checkmarked a number of different areas that we've intentionally been that much more transparent about. I would tell you that the team at large is working very aggressively to continue the optimization in each of those areas. We're on very good path relative to continuing to deliver more optimization on the way that we're not only running the business. You're seeing that through, for instance, our eRental program, very customer effective and very effective from an efficiency and employee satisfaction standpoint, an area that we continue to mine opportunities around through investments and that, again, ties to our development capabilities, and the things that we're doing very uniquely in the industry by virtue of the size of our team and the way that we're delivering Gen 5 properties, that also then reverts right back to what we're doing with our Property of Tomorrow program, where we're retooling the existing portfolio, adding many amenities that we've been putting into these Gen 5 properties, which include solar and efficiencies from that standpoint. So, that all points to a very strong and ongoing commitment to the growth of the business, the investment that we're making in very different and powerful parts of the business. We're pleased by the traction. We're pleased by the business results. But as always, we are very challenged to do more. With a brand like we have at Public Storage, we can continue to expand that brand. You're seeing that as we invigorated the effectiveness even of the assets that we've been buying over the last couple of years in particular, where average occupancy was in, say, the 60% to 65% range. We put them right into the public storage brand, put many of the tools and the operational efficiencies right into those assets, and they do tremendously well. So, the team at large, we continue to invest in. That's another very prominent strategy that we've got. So, we've put a lot of additional thought and retooling into the teams throughout the Company, particularly through our operating teams and we're seeing very good results from that, too. So, great environment to continue to drive the business, and we're pleased by many of the things that are taking hold. Yes. Smedes, I mean, I wouldn't say that we've holistically pivoted or taken a different approach to the way that we've been investing. We continue to look for opportunities, just as I outlined relative to the quality of the assets that we're bringing to the portfolio, the opportunity that we can say from -- that we can see from driving returns, based on our performance and then putting them into our own platform, what kind of success factors we'll see from there, the additive scale that we're going to get in any particular market. So, because of some of the shifting that we're seeing, we haven't stepped back and said where we're going to be out of the market or we're going to shift down relative to our approach to betting and looking at assets that make sense to come into the portfolio. There's a fair amount of competitive activity. But believe me, the team is working hard. We're very busy underwriting assets. And there's a lot of competitive activity playing through. There's always a tipping point that we're very cognizant of where we feel an asset may or may not bring forth the relative returns best on a price that it may trade for us. So, we're going to be very reflective of that, too. But overall, we're still seeing opportunities. And we're very optimistic about what can continue to play through. As Tom mentioned, our balance sheet continues to be in very strong shape. We're sitting on $1 billion of cash. This year, we're likely to generate another $600 million to $700 million in free cash flow. So, very well positioned to continue to grow the portfolio and seeing very good asset opportunities, and we'll continue to vet them. Yes. Spencer, it's any and all of the typical buyers that are out in the market. So, that's a pretty commonplace component of the third-party platforms, whether they're the platforms you see through the public operators, and there's a fair amount of private third-party management platforms as well. So, the trading activity that can take place within those platforms can come from either a public operator, private equity, private investors. So, it's pretty typical of just the overall range of buying activity that takes place. We've -- typically, even before we got in the third-party management business, typically bought a fair amount of assets out of different third-party platforms. Last year that -- we also bought a number of assets out of our own third-party management platform. In the first quarter, we bought one. But, there is a fair amount of trading that goes on in these platforms, some of which is tied to structurally, the reasons many of these assets are on these platforms as they're being teed up to do just that. The owners may not look at their own ownership for long periods of time. They're looking for certain levels of optimization. They'll get the asset to that point, and they'll take back right out of the market to trade. So, very typical kind of the overall dynamics of what happens with third-party management. Sure, Caitlin. Yes. And I would tell you that as we've spoken to over the last several quarters, some of the headwinds that seem to be containing the amount of volume of new development, we feel, is a good thing in one way, meaning there's elevated risk going in any development opportunity. And I can't name a city, for instance, nationally that is easier to deal with today than it was pre-pandemic. City staffs are constrained from a staffing standpoint, from a timing standpoint, the complexity to get through both entitlement and then construction processes are very elevated. And with that, there's more risk at hand, at a time when we're seeing component costs increase, in some cases, pretty dramatically, whether it's steel, labor, concrete. And then, with that interest rates are still far from stable. In fact, they're accelerating. So, very different risk factors that create some pretty meaningful headwinds. So, the development business is still active, however, I mean, still 500 to 600 properties likely to come into the market this year and next. To your point, obviously, some of that's being driven by the overall success of the sector and the amount of demand that we're seeing for self-storage, but there's a healthier level of discipline that's playing through for many of the factors that I spoke to. It's been a good window for our development team to continue to do what you're seeing us do, which is to grow our own pipeline. We're seeing less competitive activity for certain land sites in certain markets. We're able to capture opportunities because we've got the scale, the efficiency and the opportunity deflect to some degree, some of the pressure points that I just spoke to. But if you're a first-time developer or a developer that doesn't have the wherewithal to potentially deal with these risk factors, you're probably going to be a lot more conservative and -- we think that overall, as I mentioned, that's a good thing for the industry. Yes. So, we've seen continued adoption of eRental. Now, over 50% of our customers are using that channel from an election standpoint. We're not pushing them to it, but they're actually electing to choose self-directed digital leasing process. By virtue of that, at our own frontlines and the amount of time that our property managers, in particular, historically would have spent on that specific move-in process when you're seeing the effects of potentially 50-plus-percent of that coming out of the labor demand property to property, it's pretty powerful. It gives us the opportunity to redirect priorities relative to the utility of the property management team, the things that they're focused on, the efficiencies that can play through when half or more of their customer activity is actually being self-directed and done on a digital basis. So, it's a pretty powerful tool. You're seeing some of that through the cost efficiency and our labor, even though labor costs are up, but there's continued benefit that we see from increasing the amount of digital options that we're giving customers. And frankly, we're getting very good feedback from customers who use that tool as well. It's a growing and preferred alternative to actually transact. It's a much more consistent experience, and it can give the customer even that much more flexibility when they choose to move in to a specific property. So, all things considered, it's been a very powerful tool, and we're continuing to look at different ways of utilizing it and expanding its use, again, depending on customer choices. Yes, Mike. What's typical in the way that we approach land is we're looking primarily for opportunities where we're not directly putting land inventory right onto our balance sheet. It's pretty typical or the types of opportunities that we're sourcing give us the flexibility as a buyer to actually take the site through layers or stages of entitlements that happen on their ownership time. It's the obligation they give us or the time we take to actually take the property through reentitlement without actually owning the site. So, contractually, that's a pretty typical approach. It's not each and every time, but more often than not, we're taking a land site through certain layers of entitlements before we actually take ownership to not only reduce risk but to contain costs as well. And with the amount of knowledge, efficiency and resources that we put into these processes, by far, the majority of the landowners that we're doing business with are agreeable to that kind of approach. So, with that, we're not holding large land positions. And with -- and more frequently, we're going to acquire a site when it's much more closer to the ability or the timing to actually start construction. Yes. Mike, I would say, it aligns exactly to the timing you're talking about. So, market-to-market, you've got some processes that might take you a year or two. You've got others that could take three or four. And believe it or not, some that could even be longer than that. So, we're matching that up. And contractually, we have control of the sites before we're starting to invest and deploy resources and time into those sites. So, we've got control of the land sites themselves. So -- and it matches to exactly what you're speaking to. So, if you think about the pipeline that we have today, there are components of that pipeline that those land sites are going through the exact same sets of processes that I spoke to. So, we may not have actually acquired the land site itself in certain of those cases, but we have full contractual ability to control the site. And once we get through the entitlement process, we'll take ownership."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Partnership, for Public Storage. Thank you. Mr. Burke, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thanks, Rob. Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, February 21, 2024, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, if you have more, please feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our fourth quarter and full year 2023 performance, industry views and 2024 outlook. Then we'll open it up for Q&A. 2023 was a year of significant achievement for public storage amidst a competitive industry environment. The team elevated our customer experience and financial profile through digital and operating model transformation. Enhanced existing properties with over 500 solar installations and the Property of Tomorrow program. Advanced complementary business lines, including tenant reinsurance and third-party management and grew the portfolio through acquisitions, development and redevelopment. We did so while maintaining one of the real estate industry's best balance sheets, which is poised to fund growth moving forward in conjunction with significant retained cash flow. Just a few of our collective accomplishments include: exceeding 3,000 owned properties and serving nearly 2 million in-place customers. Achieving an approximately 80% stabilized direct NOI margin through revenue generation and expense efficiency that only Public Storage is capable of. Acquiring and quickly integrating the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage portfolio with approximately 90,000 customers across nearly 130 properties. This was the largest private acquisition in company history. Increasing the size of our high-growth non-same-store pool to 705 properties and 63 million square feet now comprising nearly 30% of our overall portfolio. Generating record revenues, net operating income and core funds from operations. Accelerating growth in third-party property management, adding 132 properties and reaching 324 properties in total. And receiving several accolades tied to sustainability including NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award, a second consecutive great Place to Work award and achieving top scoring benchmarks among U.S. self-storage REITs. The strength of our team, platform and brand was evident with move-in volumes up an impressive 9% in 2023, despite a backdrop of weaker customer demand during the year. The new customer environment remains challenging, but we have seen a degree of improvement in move-in rent trends recently. And our in-place customer base continues to perform well with average length of stay that are longer than the historic norm. We expect demand from new customers to stabilize during 2024 and the behavior of existing customers including our recent move-ins to remain strong due to clear macro conditions, including the potential for a soft landing, the potential for easing interest rates, resilient consumers, leveling home sales and strong home renter behavior. We also anticipate fewer completions of new self-storage facilities nationally reducing the competitive impact of new supply in our local markets. All in, the industry is in better position entering 2024 than it was entering 2023. The full Public Storage team is focused on exercising our competitive advantages, which include advancing our digital and operating model transformation, expanding complementary businesses and creating partnerships across the broader industry, growing the portfolio through acquisitions, development, redevelopment and third-party management, and funding innovation and growth today and into the future with the industry's best balance sheet. All of this adds to the growth of our business over the near, medium and long term. And it comes at a time with the potential for further stabilization in the move-in environment, existing customers exhibiting strong behavior and an outlook for new competitive supply that is clearly in our favor. With good trends in customer demand, less pressure from new supply and our numerous competitive advantages, we are well positioned for 2024 and beyond. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. On to financial performance, we finished the year reporting core FFO of $4.20 for the quarter and $16.89 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range representing 1% growth over the fourth quarter of '22, and 8.3% growth for 2023 overall, excluding the impact of PSB. Looking at the same-store portfolio, revenue increased 80 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '22, at the higher end of our expectation. That was driven by better move-in volume and move-in rate performance. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 5.1% for the fourth quarter, largely driven by increases in marketing spend to support that move-in activity. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties declined 50 basis points in the quarter. Meanwhile, the non-same-store NOI grew 31% and 25% for the fourth quarter and '23, respectively, demonstrating the continued strength of our lease-up and non-stabilized assets. Now turning to the outlook for '24. We introduced 2024 core FFO guidance with a $16.90 midpoint on par with 2023. As Joe mentioned, we entered the year more encouraged than we were last year at this time. We've seen the industry work through the declines in new customer demand from the peaks of 2021. We're anticipating that new customer demand stabilizes in 2024 as the macroeconomic picture becomes clearer. That paired with a consistently strong consumer and lower new competitive new supply. If we look at the same-store outlook for '24 specifically, the midpoint calls for revenue on par with '23. Similar to last year, move-in rates continue to be the biggest variable in the forecast heading through 2024 as well. We're anticipating at the midpoint case that move-in rents lap easier comps through the year, and crossed zero on a year-over-year basis towards the end of the summer. And occupancy results down 80 basis points, which is roughly on top of 2019 occupancies as we sit here today. Our expectations are for 2.75% same-store expense growth driven primarily by property tax and marketing expense. That leads to same-store NOI growth at the midpoint of a decline of 90 basis points. Our non-same-store acquisition and development properties are poised to be a strong contributor again in 2024, growing from $370 million of NOI contribution in '23 to $505 million at the midpoint and will grow from there in future years. In addition, embedded in the outlook is incremental acquisition and development activity, $500 million of acquisitions, and we plan to deliver a record $450 million of development in '24. Finally, our capital and liquidity position remains solid. Our leverage of 3.9x net debt and preferred to EBITDA combined with nearly $400 million of cash on hand at quarter end puts us in a very strong position heading into 2024. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: I was wondering, Tom, if you could talk a little bit about the ECRIs that are maybe embedded in the high and low end of growth and how those may be compared to the ECRIs that you achieved in '23.\nTom Boyle: Sure. Happy to add that color, Steve. I think as you know, I'd like to speak about existing customer rent increases as a combination of customer price sensitivity as well as the cost to replace that customer if they vacate upon receiving a rental rate increase. And as we look at in 2024, there's a couple of things at play here. One is, as we enter the year, right, demand is a little weaker, we'll give you a January, February update here shortly, where move-in rents are down year-over-year as we start the year, similar to how we finished in 2023, that's going to lead to higher replacement costs through the first part of this year. That's going to be a little bit of a drag to ECRI performance. The flip side is, Joe spoke to the strength in move-in volumes that we experienced through '23. Those new customers are going to be eligible for rental rate increases, which will lead to more contribution from the volume of increases that are sent this year. Such that at the midpoint case, we're looking at contribution overall, pretty consistent with 2023 with those two pieces offsetting each other. In the high-end case and low-end case, a little bit better price sensitivity in the high end and a little bit worse than the low end.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. And then on the expense growth, can you maybe just talk about what's embedded for marketing and sort of how you're thinking about that? I guess, we were a little surprised that expense growth overall was coming in kind of at $275 at the midpoint. But just what do you have baked in for marketing just given the still somewhat challenging demand environment.\nTom Boyle: Yes. So as I noted in my prepared remarks that the key drivers of expense growth are property taxes and marketing. So I will note, property tax is our largest expense line item. We do anticipate to be up 4% plus or minus, which is a contributor. And then on marketing expense, taking a step back, we increased marketing spend through the year in 2023 and saw very good returns associated with that. The fourth quarter, our marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.5%. And as you've heard from me in the past, being in that 1% to 3%, 1% back in 2021 when demand was really, really strong and back towards 3% when you go to a more typical operating environment, pre-pandemic, is a comfortable place for us to be. And so the first part of 2024, we're going to be lapping comps that will lead to year-over-year growth levels that are higher, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter and then we'll evaluate as we go from there. But we're comfortable in the ZIP Code and continue to see a very strong return on that advertising dollar.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: You finished the year with 80 basis points of same-store revenue growth in your guidance for the upcoming year ranges from down 1% to up 1%. So presumably same-store revenue growth is going to dip before it kind of rebounds and that goes in line with the -- I think, some of what you've been saying with the -- with your expectations of street rates. So -- how much of -- in the midpoint of your guidance, how much of a dip are you expecting? And when are you expecting trends to kind of inflect better through the year?\nTom Boyle: Good question, Michael. So there's a couple of components to this question that I'll respond to. The first is, as we look at our operating metrics, our operating metrics are starting to improve, right? We talked about occupancy closing the gap as we move through last year, and we finished the year with occupancy down 70 basis points compared to down 240 basis points when we started '23. If you look at move-in rent trends, move-in rents on a year-over-year basis decelerated through the year. In the fourth quarter, they were down 18%. Throughout the quarter, but as we noted in our January update, they improved to down 11% in December. Looking at January and February, they're down in that same 10%, 11% sort of ZIP code. So, that improvement has been lasting. And as you heard through our outlook, we anticipate that to continue to close as we move through this year. I highlight that because operating metrics tend to lead financial metrics, meaning that as we're talking about some of these operating metrics improve, it will take several quarters to see that in financial metrics. And so, if you think about the shape of the curve and the description of the midpoint case that I gave earlier, it would imply that to your point, we're going to see some deceleration through the first couple of quarters of this year. But then the second derivative, the rate of change of growth is going to flip positive in that midpoint case in the second half and you're going to see some reacceleration in the financial metrics, again, lagging those operating metrics in the second half. The second component of the question that I just highlighted is, we're already seeing that in certain markets. And so if you look at the Mid-Atlantic, for instance or Seattle, markets that maybe didn't have the high highs in 2021, but have been solid performers. We're actually seeing those accelerate as we sit here today in the first quarter and would expect those high, high markets, the Floridas, the Atlantas, for instance, to take a little bit longer to find that turn given how high their high was. But we're already seeing some of that turnaround in some of our operating metrics today.\nMichael Goldsmith: And my second question, it's a multi-parter, but it shouldn't be too intimidating. You comment in the that softer that -- you say, you expect industry-wide demand from new customers. To stabilize this year due to improving macroeconomic conditions. So one, are you seeing that today? Two, can you kind of provide an update on where the move in rent were in January and to the extent that you're able to provide insight into February? And then three, the -- you've talked about moving rents crossing the zero. How positive, if that momentum has continued -- how positive could move in rents be as we kind of exit the year?\nJoe Russell: Okay. Apologies accepted, but you took some liberty there, Michael, but we'll address your question. All right. So let me start with consumer strength and what we continue to see in the portfolio that's been trending to a clear advantage, even with the performance we saw quarter-by-quarter in 2023. The consumer activity, first of all, in existing customers, as I've mentioned, has been quite strong, and we're really not seeing any on the margin evidence that that's likely to change even going into what we've seen through almost two months of this year. Balance sheets are quite healthy. Payment patterns are still better than they were pre-pandemic. We're not seeing any undue or new stress evolving into customer activity. The acceptance of our ongoing revenue management tied to existing customer rate increases. We have a very active engagement process with existing customers that guides us to the tolerance and the level of activity that we're pushing through on ECRIs, that too has not hit different levels of either areas that we've become more concerned about. In fact, it's validating many of the things that we've already talked about relative to the performance of existing customers and our confidence that that's likely to stay with us, even coupled with what Tom just mentioned, indicating in certain markets, where you've actually seeing the -- some good percolation taking place. That ties clearly to the kind of activity from a new customer demand activity. We're having to work harder as we did all through 2023 with a variety of tools that we have. They're quite good. In fact, they continue to get much better. We are very confident market to market with our scale and the knowledge we have market to market. We have the right tools. We have the right brand. We have the right technologies to continue to pull customers to our platform, and we're going to continue to leverage those going into the next several months. With the anticipation, as Tom mentioned, that by summer or late summer, we're going to start seeing the residual effects to the positive from all those efforts. And then Tom, you can tackle if you choose to, Michael's additional questions.\nTom Boyle: So Michael, I'll just maybe take a step back and talk a little bit about how we thought about the macro environment in our guidance. So last year, on this call, we spent a good bit of time talking about the macro environment. And we did couch the guidance range last year in macro terms and that we viewed it as appropriate given the landscape at the time. At the time, 65% of Bloomberg economists were expecting a recession during the calendar year, for instance, and we thought it would make sense to provide the investment community our assumptions of what that could potentially look like within our guidance range. Clearly, as we move through '23 that recession outcome became less probable. And as such, our financial performance proved out to be towards the higher end of those expectations as we move through the year. This year, we are not capturing the range in terms of macro. And as you think about the midpoint of the range, we're not assuming that the macro environment needs to improve at the midpoint range, but more around the lines of what Joe was speaking to and what we're seeing today. So I hope that's helpful in terms of how we thought about the range. And then I will hit on one of your comments just again because you asked about what move-in rents were doing in January and February. I'll just reiterate that for the group. Move-in rents were down 10%, 11%. So pretty consistent with December performance, which is, what you'd anticipate, right, because we're at kind of the trough of rental rates in the winter season here, and we'll be looking to March, April and May to see some acceleration in moving rents.\nOperator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJuan Sanabria: Maybe just piggybacking off of part of Michael's question. I guess what is assumed within the range of when street rates break that year-over-year breakeven point? And if you have any color around changes in -- or difference in occupancy assumptions at the high or low end of the range?\nTom Boyle: Sure, Juan. I'll give you some context around both the high and the low. And specifically, you're speaking to same-store revenues. So that's where I'll focus my attention. So as I noted, at the midpoint case, that assumes that we cross that zero on a year-over-year basis for moving rents at the end of the summer and occupancy being down about 80 basis points. Pretty similar to where we finished the year in '23. And I would note that, that's -- as we sit here today, year-to-date, we're down 70, 80 basis points in occupancy, so consistent with where we sit today. In terms of the high end and the low end, the low end assumes that it takes a little bit longer for operating metrics to stabilize here. And as such, the assumption on when we cross zero on year-over-year move-in rents is at the end of the year. And in that case, we're assuming, right, it takes a little longer to stabilize. The move-in environment is going to be a little bit tougher, Occupancy is down about 120 basis points year-over-year. At the high end, we're assuming a more vibrant spring leasing season, one, which we see a little bit of a rebound in the housing market, something we spent a good bit of time talking about through the fall of last year. There are some indications that we could experience that this year. The high end of the range assumes that. And as such, that zero crossing point is at the beginning of the summer in that spring leasing season and occupancy, as you'd expect, results in better performance down about 20% -- or 20 basis points -- sorry, 20 basis points throughout the year with an acceleration in the summer and a higher peak seasonally.\nJuan Sanabria: And then for my follow-up, you're assuming acquisitions in the guidance. So just curious, if you could speak to the investment environment, any color on where you're seeing stabilized cap rates and just the quality and the quantum of opportunities out in the marketplace?\nJoe Russell: Yes, sure, Juan. I'll take that. I would say, at this point, we're continuing to see the same environment that we saw through most of 2023. So a lot of owners are reluctant to put properties into the market. Knowing that they're going to potentially not achieve the cap rate or the valuation that they expected based on prior year inflated valuations, et cetera, when interest rates were at a much different price point. So the reluctance continues. The amount of activity going into the first part of this year, which is typically very light, is just that. We are getting a number of inbound discussions that are tied to properties that are quote-unquote not on the market to either test the water or judge whether or not we are ready to transact at a valuation that either meets or would be acceptable for that particular seller. We do not have anything as noted in our release, currently under contract. The team is busy. We're engaged in a number of different conversations with a variety of different size opportunities, whether single assets or larger portfolios. But as we saw in 2023, the beginning of 2024 is likely to be very similar. And we'll see going into the next few months, if there's either some pent-up demand or additional realization that cap rates have adjusted, and we'll just see if, in fact, there's going to be more trading. Clearly, one thing that could moderate that to some degree in push activity to a higher level is some activity by the Fed reducing interest rates, potentially with some impact on cap rate adjustments, et cetera. But frankly, there's just not a lot of trading going on right now to give you any really clear sense of how directly cap rates have changed at the moment. But the gap continues, meaning the level of seller expectations to what we feel are prudent ways for us to allocate capital. Many of the conversations just start with that, and we'll see how that plays out here in the near term.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Spector: Great. Just trying to think about all the comments, upper end, the lower end assumptions, skepticism, we continue to hear. Just some of the concerns, I mean, I guess to be clear, are you saying from the data you're seeing year-to-date that you finally feel there is more or greater visibility on how to forecast this year versus, let's say, last year?\nTom Boyle: Yes, Jeff, I think as we sit here today, we do have more visibility, we think, heading into this year. I mean, I just spoke earlier around how we couched the ranges last year in the macroeconomic environment. Our view is the macroeconomic environment is clearer this year. We're not couching the ranges that way. And as we sit here today, right, is very different than last year. Last year, we knew that demand was weaker, and we were going to see revenue growth decelerate through the year in a pretty meaningful way. This year, that pace of deceleration has really slowed. And as I highlighted earlier, there's actually some markets in our portfolio that are reaccelerating already in the first quarter, which we view as leading as we move through the year. And so from a range of variability less than last year, that's not to diminish the fact that we're still in an uncertain environment. We're still talking about moving rents being down 10%, 11% to start the year. That's not like a typical pre-pandemic year, where we'd be debating our move-in rent is going to be up 3% or are they going to be up 5% in a very tight band. That's not the environment we've been operating through in the last several years. And as such, we think we've couched the ranges appropriately to encapsulate that variability. But we do feel more confident in the range of outcomes this year than we did last year.\nJoe Russell: And like many times, Jeff, it's never one single issue, but Tom just went through a number of the things that have given us more clarity and perspective going into this year that we think are, a, additive one by one. Another factor that's continuing to trend very favorably to the entire industry that we're seeing, particularly in nearly every market we operate in our reduced levels of deliveries. The development business has continued to be very, very difficult. Funding for new construction is either at a very high cost or from an availability standpoint, very limited. The time to get through entitlements even for our own processes are continuing to be very difficult. So this too creates another additive element that we have even more perspective on now that we've been through a multiyear deceleration of new development deliveries, putting us in a very different position even year-by-year that we've had more confidence to say this is a different environment, very different than where we were even a year ago. So with that, we think that we've got the right perspective, continue to read the variety of tea leaves out there, but we are very confident that we've got the right tools to guide us and put the kind of perspective that we've got into our outlook for 2024.\nJeff Spector: Great. And then my follow-up is, can you discuss trends you're seeing in January and February, including move-in, move-outs, and maybe which markets are doing better or worse? Let's say, year-to-date?\nTom Boyle: Sure, Jeff. I mean I think I've already covered the move-in rate component and as well as the occupancy side. So maybe I'll just focus on the market part of the question, which is not too dissimilar to fourth quarter performance. We continue to see strength in Southern California, for instance as our strongest area of growth. And as we spoke about through '23, the markets that had the highest highs in '21 and '22 are giving back some of that appropriately so. And so the weaker markets on a growth rate basis to start the year are some of those southeastern markets, Florida, Atlanta, et cetera.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKeegan Carl: Maybe first, just where is your development line -- your development pipelines start for the year? And where are you expecting to end based on your anticipated deliveries in '24?\nTom Boyle: Yes, Keegan, maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the development environment and then some of the sequencing of our deliveries. So, as we've sat here today, we've been trying to grow our development business from where we were delivering more like $100 million to $200 million in deliveries in '21 and '22. Last year, we delivered $360 million, as I noted in my remarks, we're looking to deliver $450 million in this year. So an acceleration when the industry overall is seeing delivery slowdown. So we're taking some share there in growing that business. We're doing so because we think it's the highest risk-adjusted return on capital. And you can see the returns that we've achieved on our development vintages in the sub. And we have an in-house team that's dedicated to this program, development, construction, design that are all out working on growing that pipeline. This will be a record year. The team is out of figuring out how we're going to backfill that development pipeline from here in a challenging development environment. But as we sit here today, that's a business we want to grow. And we'll be looking to backfill that pipeline and have deliveries next year, hopefully around the same levels that we have this year and go from there.\nJoe Russell: And yes, just from a timing standpoint, Keegan, a little lighter in Q1 but then pretty balanced deliveries in the subsequent three quarters a little bit differently than what we saw in 2023, where we had a lot of deliveries hit more towards the second half of the year. So, we've got a good combination of both ground up new development, and we're a little over-weighted on expansion and redevelopment opportunities, particularly tied to unusually large projects that we'll complete in 2024. So -- as Tom mentioned, the team is working hard not only to continue to grow the overall pipeline, but to continue to put these generation five Class A properties into a whole variety of markets. And we're continuing to see very good lease-up and again, returns tied to the development activity, both new development and redevelopment.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. That's really helpful. And then shifting gears here, I know Tom mentioned a little bit about demand. I'm just curious, have you seen a material change for storage demand in L.A. on the back of the flooding? And then can you just remind us of what the typical tailwind of a natural disaster is for demand in a given market?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So I wouldn't call the rains that we've had in the winter here in Southern California a natural disaster. It has been raining this week, frankly. So we don't see a surge in demand. In fact, what we tend to see is Southern California residents and drivers tend to stay off the roads and you don't see as much move-in activity or move-out activity, for instance, in periods of time when it's raining here in SoCal. But overall, I'd say demand remains healthy. here. Occupancies are very healthy in L.A., San Diego, Orange County. So we feel very good about how the portfolio is set up, and we'll work through the reins here in SoCal.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nSpenser Allaway: Maybe just a more pointed question on the transaction market. And I know it's a small sample set here, but the 11 assets you closed in the fourth quarter. Can you share the going in yield and then where you expect that to stabilize?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Getting into specifics, I'd say -- the -- there's a range of going in yields depending on how stabilized the assets are. So of those 11 assets, some of them were [CofO] properties where the going-in yield is zero or a little bit negative. And then you had some that were more stabilized that going in yields are probably mid 5% to 6%, and we're going to seek to improve the operations on those portfolios and get them to those assets rather, and get them to 6% plus as we think about the return profile of those assets. And that's pretty consistent with what we saw through most of 2023. As Joe mentioned, we'll see how the interest rate and capital environment plays through into '24, but that hopefully gives you a guidepost on yields.\nJoe Russell: And Spenser, from a strategy and appetite standpoint, we continue to look for properties that are potentially either lease-up opportunities or stabilization opportunities by putting those assets on our own platform. So not shy at all about taking on lease-up risk. In fact, many times we see an actual pretty sharp improvement once we put those assets onto our own platform. And we're confident that again, those strategies will play well even going into this year. And continue to look for a whole range of different type of assets even based on age and maturity of the tenant base, et cetera. But clearly, no differentiation relative to the strategy we've deployed over the last few years looking for opportunities when properties are far from stabilized, and again, buying the properties at the right price point, location, et cetera, continues to be very advantageous for us.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Great. And to that point, in regards to the Simply portfolio. Can you provide an update on where the rent and occupancy stands today for those properties relative to the same-store pool?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So the rents of that portfolio have been improving as they've been added into our portfolio. So we've already seen some of the benefits of adding that portfolio in. The occupancy, as it sits there, I think it's in the mid-80s, today, seasonally, I think when we took it over in the peak of the summer, it was towards the upper 80s. We'll obviously look to lease that back up into the spring leasing season and take the occupancy of there, ultimately into the '90s on stabilization. So seeing good trends as we've added that portfolio and those 90,000 customers into our portfolio and on track for a good spring leasing season with that portfolio with properties orange painted and public storage signage, which the customers are reacting well to.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is A.J. on for Todd. I appreciate you guys taking the time. Just First one, as you've noted, you made good progress on narrowing the occupancy gap year-over-year over the past few quarters. I guess, why would you not expect to call back more occupancy throughout the year, given the easier comps and the broader stabilization that you're anticipating in your base case around move-in rent and demand?\nTom Boyle: Yes. I think part of what you're seeing in that midpoint case is if you take a step back, right, we had really strong demands in occupancies in '21, '22. And as those tenants cycled through and we experienced weaker demand through '23, we're seeking to maximize revenue ultimately in a trade-off between rents and occupancies. And that's managed at a very granular level, at the unit level across our properties based on the demand we're seeing, the customer price sensitivity, et cetera. And so that balance is real at the granular level. And what you see at the output is it made sense to give up in effect some of that 2021 heightened level of occupancy to maximize revenues. And as we sit here today, our occupancies are down about 70, 80 basis points compared to where we started in 2023. Again, that midpoint case doesn't assume that there's a big uplift in seasonal demand. And so you're kind of -- you're not getting a big lift there similar to how we experienced last year. And so as we move through the year, you may see some closing towards the end of the year, but you're going to probably be finished on average through the year about the same as where we're sitting today.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the seasonality, you had softer seasonality last year. What's embedded in the guidance for 2024? And I guess, really looking at historical data. When do you expect to start seeing the pickup in rental demand for the peak rental season?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So, I'll couch seasonality in terms of the peak-to-trough change in occupancy. So last year, we experienced -- taking a step back even further in 2015 to 2019, there was typically about a 280 basis point peak-to-trough change in occupancy, call that from June 30, December 31. In 2022, we experienced about a 240 basis points. So, it was a little bit less seasonal than a typical year. In 2023, that fell all the way down to about 160 basis points peak-to-trough. And in 2024, our midpoint case is a touch over 200. So, a little bit more seasonality, but not as much as we experienced in '22 and a far cry from what we experienced in the pre-pandemic time period.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Wolfe: You talked about the moving rents crossing over into positive territory in late summer. Just curious where moving rents will be at that time. So what's the annual contract rate that you expect to see in late summer? And how much of that improvement from current levels is just driven by seasonality versus a strengthening of your business?\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Eric. So, I think we'll have to dig up and we can get to you exactly. I don't have in front of me what our third quarter move-in rents were, for instance. But at end of summer, we're expecting it to cross zero. So I'd look at plus or minus our third quarter of '23 move-in rents. And I think the team is going to dig up third quarter contract rents, so you can have them. In terms of what we need to see to get there, there's seasonality every year. So as the question earlier, so even in a year last year where I'd call it an atypical year where we didn't see a lot of seasonal strength through your April, May and June. The housing market has been very well publicized as resetting lower in terms of transaction volumes as being a driver there. As we think about move-in rents they're going to rise and they rose last year, they're going to rise on an absolute basis into the summer. And then, what you're going to see is a little bit more growth in rental rates this year to close that gap over the time between now and the end of the year last year -- or the end of the summer, this upcoming year. Does that make sense?\nEric Wolfe: Yes. No, that makes sense. And I guess the question then really is, just -- you talked about that extra gap that it needs to sort of close to get them above and beyond seasonality. Can you just put that in context? Like is that an extra gap that it needs to close pretty large relative to history? Is it somewhat normal relative to other recovery period? Just trying to understand sort of whether it's unusual relative to what you've seen in the past?\nTom Boyle: Yes. I guess the way I'd characterize it is we saw less than what we would typically see last year in terms of a seasonal uplift in rents. And what we're saying is we're expecting stabilization in demand through this year, which means that we shouldn't continue to set new lows seasonally adjusted on moving rents in the midpoint case. And so that's going to result in closing of that gap. We're not suggesting that the environment needs to get significantly better, but rather stabilize as we move through this year and not set fresh lows. And to follow up on your question, the team dug it up. We had move-in rents on a contract basis in the third quarter about $16.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nKi Bin Kim: A quick question on ECRIs. As you look ahead, are you projecting to be a bit more aggressive in terms of magnitude or frequency with your ECRI program compared to 2023?\nTom Boyle: So, Ki Bin, we spoke about this a little earlier. There's a little bit of a give and take this year. We're expecting that on the one side, the consumer remains strong, as Joe highlighted in his remarks, and that we don't see a significant shift in customer price sensitivity, which we've been very encouraged in experiencing through '22 and '23. So that's one side. On the other side, on replacement costs, move-in rents are still down 10%, 11%. So replacement cost is higher at the start of this year than it was at the start of last year on average. And so that's going to have a detriment to overall contribution. But the flip side of that, that I highlighted earlier was the fact that we moved in a lot more new customers. Last year, move-in rents were strong, up about 9%, and that will have a positive impact on the -- not the magnitude, but the number of increases that we send throughout the year. And those things largely will offset such that the contribution of ECRIs as we sit here today in the midpoint case is pretty consistent year-over-year.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And I'm not sure how you internally gauged us, but can you provide any color on changes that you noticed on your customer conversion rate or your market share win of customers?\nTom Boyle: Yes. So Joe spoke to a lot of the tools that we were using through last year. advertising, promotions, rental rates and the power of advertising platform online. So we saw better than industry top-of-funnel demand into our system, which ultimately led to good move-ins. But we also saw stronger conversion associated with both pricing and promotion, which are more conversion-related items such that conversion rates both through -- well, through all the channels that we operate in, both website, call center and folks walking in or higher in '23 compared to '22, and we're seeing good trends into '24 as well.\nJoe Russell: And on top of that, Ki Bin, as we've talked about, our digital platform continues to give customers the ability to again transact with us through not only digital platform, but now even through our care center, et cetera. So, we're making that conversion activity even that much more effective relative to -- again, consumer intent with all the tools that we have to get them to top-of-funnel activity, but then actually to the conversion itself from a speed, efficiency time of day. Frankly, many of our customers transact with us and off business hours now. So all very good tools that continue to lead to a very strong conversion that to Tom's point, we feel like we've got good industry-leading capabilities that we're going to continue to invest and optimize going forward.\nOperator: Next question comes from Zhan Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nHong Heng: I guess, first off, I'm glad you fare homes better and Shurgard definitely fell a little bit more of Northern California. But I guess my first question is just is it safe to think about the low end of the range, that's basically there being no return, no seasonal demand? Or are you expecting higher seasonal demand community than last year even at the low end?\nTom Boyle: We're assuming less seasonal demand in the low end I agree with that. I think that's something I mentioned earlier. So I agree with that and more seasonal demand in the high end.\nHong Heng: Okay. And then I guess my second question. You've grown your management platform pretty well. Have you had any success in sourcing acquisitions from there yet? And how big of a potential source of acquisitions do you think that could represent in the future?\nJoe Russell: Yes. That's key component of the growth of the platform itself. It's a very relationship-oriented business. Thus far, we've acquired close to 40 assets out of the program. Over the last few quarters, it's been on the light side. Again, it's, I think, indicative of the environment that we've been seeing in acquisitions in general with many owners not of a mindset that this is the right time necessarily to do a transaction or a trade. But with the growing platform itself, again, we saw very good traction in 2023. We've got good momentum going into this year as well. Those additive relationships, knowledge of the assets their comfort level with our own ability to transact very efficiently. We'll continue to be a good source of not only relationships but acquisition activity over time. So, I noted that now the programs at about 325 assets. And we still see good momentum to continue to grow to our ultimate goal and optimization of the platform. So, we'll likely see that in the next year to two and with that more acquisition opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Luebchow: You could talk a little bit about the spread between move-in and move-out rents. I assume that gap should start to narrow by midyear just based on the move-in rent improvement you talked about. But should we expect any change in the average rents of customers moving out based on average length of stay or any other variables that we should consider there?\nTom Boyle: Eric, it sounds like you have a pretty good handle on that. We're sitting here in the winter, Q4 and Q1 you're going to have that differential between the move-ins and move-outs to be higher. That's going to then narrow as we move into Q2 and Q3 and then rewiden again in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the comments that I made around moving rents getting to a point where they're not declining on a year-over-year basis through the fourth quarter will be helpful on that, but you're still probably going to end in a similar territory on gap there between move-in and move-outs in the midpoint case. And we're very comfortable with that. and managing to achieve those higher revenues from our in-place customers who are placing a lot of value on our space.\nEric Luebchow: And just my follow-up, you touched on this several times, but the newer customers you've loaded at much lower move-in rates the past year. You talked about increasing the frequency and the magnitude of rate increases for that cohort. So have you seen those large rate increases kind of perform within expectations as you've started to push those through kind of toward the end of '23 and early 2024 in terms of either retention or customer receptivity?\nTom Boyle: Yes, I'd say to reiterate something that Joe mentioned earlier, which is that the customers continue to behave as expected and with some strength, and we continue to see good momentum within that program, and that includes both newer customer as well as longer-term customers in the program.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald Kamdem: The first is just on the same-store revenue guidance of flat. I guess I'm trying to tie your comments about a first half and second half dynamic where the first half maybe is a little bit slower and you have a pickup in the second half. So should we be bracing for sort of negative same-store as you start the year before you end the year somewhere sort of well above zero to get to the midpoint of the guidance.\nTom Boyle: Yes. That's a good question, Ron. I hope that everyone is not embracing. But I would anticipate that we see deceleration through the first part of the year. And yes, that likely involves a negative performance on a year-over-year basis through the first half. And then yes, reacceleration as those -- the lag between operating metric improvement and financial metric performance starts to show in the second half of the year.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then, look, my second question is just, I guess, we're trying to figure out how aggressive or conservative the guidance is because on the one hand, you talked about last year, there were a lot more macro concerns. So maybe that was a reason to be a little bit more conservative versus this year. But you also sort of mentioned that the move in volumes at 9% was basically 2x what you did in sort of 2022, which should presumably set up well for pricing power. So maybe could you -- when you're putting all that together, maybe, can you talk about how much conservatism or not is built into the guidance this year and how we think about that?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So I guess the way I'd couch it is we did cover a macro series of scenarios for our guidance ranges last year. The range on same-store revenue was about 250 basis points. This year, as we sit here, there's still uncertainty as I highlighted, maybe a little bit less than what we experienced last year -- what we were expecting last year. And so, the range is 200 basis points this year, so not too far different. Our core FFO range was about $0.70 last year. I think the range this year is $0.60. So, we're still talking about similar levels of range. And as a reminder, we operate a month-to-month lease business. And so there is some variability that could play out through the year. I've tried to be very transparent on what the range of potential outcomes are in a number of the key metrics, both at the high and the low end. And we'll look on to executing through our plan this year, and I'll leave judging, conservatism or aggressiveness to the investment community, but we want to try to be transparent around what our assumptions are and how we plan on navigating through the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Just one quick follow-up, Tom. It sounds like your contractual rent for move-ins will still be negative in the first half of the year. I think you said it was running down about 11% in the first quarter. I think you said you expect it to get to about a breakeven in the third quarter. I guess, what is the overall expectation for the year? I mean I presume fourth quarter might be up fourth quarter over fourth quarter, but that still leaves you kind of negative for the year? Is that kind of the right way to think about it?\nTom Boyle: Yes. That's the right way to think about it, Steve. The midpoint case, I think move-in rents are down 3% on average through the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Just one quick follow-up for me. I think from our conversations with investors, I think they were expecting same-store revenue growth at kind of like the low end of your same-store revenue guidance. So -- what do you need to see or believe about the consumer or the length of stay to get ECRIs to drive kind of that same-store revenue growth at that low end of the guidance, all else being equal? And I know it's kind of like there's a lot of moving parts there. But just what would need to get the ECRI to the low end of the store revenue guidance?\nJoe Russell: Well, I would...\nTom Boyle: Subject to ECRIs, right? I mean we gave you a lot of different metrics at the low end that gets you there. I gave you the perspective that demand -- new customer demand in that lower end case doesn't stabilize until later in the year and you don't cross year-over-year moving rents until the fourth quarter, really towards the end of the year. ECRIs, we're assuming in that case that there's a little bit more price sensitivity than what we're experiencing right now. To directly answer your question, move out churn, we're anticipating really in is centered around in the midpoint case, the same levels of churn we saw last year, which is very consistent with what we saw in 2019. Churn levels are up a little bit in that low-end case, but not materially. So that's what gets you at the low end.\nJoe Russell: And then again, Michael, as we've been speaking to, we're seeing, again, continued validation of, I would say, healthy economy, very consumer-oriented economy where the pressure points of a year ago or beyond relative to whether it was inflation, interest rates, employment, et cetera, are at a better place today with more clarity today than they were certainly at the beginning of 2023. That continues to play through relative to our own month-by-month operating metrics that we're seeing going even into 2024. So something would have to shift pretty materially away from that to give us a different low-end view as well.\nTom Boyle: Yes. And we'll obviously update you on that as we go through the year. I'd maybe reiterate something I said in my prepared remarks that I would focus more on move-in rents. That has been the big area of variability over the last year or two on same-store revenue performance. Try to give the investment community some guideposts in terms of how we think about that going through the year. But we operate a month-to-month lease business where we're going to be adding about 6% to 8% of our tenant base every month. And the rate with which we add those customers is going to be very impactful on where we end up through this range. And we'll update you on what we're seeing on operating trends as we move through the year.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments.\nRyan Burke: Thanks, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We'll talk to you soon. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. On to financial performance, we finished the year reporting core FFO of $4.20 for the quarter and $16.89 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range representing 1% growth over the fourth quarter of '22, and 8.3% growth for 2023 overall, excluding the impact of PSB. Looking at the same-store portfolio, revenue increased 80 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '22, at the higher end of our expectation. That was driven by better move-in volume and move-in rate performance. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 5.1% for the fourth quarter, largely driven by increases in marketing spend to support that move-in activity. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties declined 50 basis points in the quarter. Meanwhile, the non-same-store NOI grew 31% and 25% for the fourth quarter and '23, respectively, demonstrating the continued strength of our lease-up and non-stabilized assets. Now turning to the outlook for '24. We introduced 2024 core FFO guidance with a $16.90 midpoint on par with 2023. As Joe mentioned, we entered the year more encouraged than we were last year at this time. We've seen the industry work through the declines in new customer demand from the peaks of 2021. We're anticipating that new customer demand stabilizes in 2024 as the macroeconomic picture becomes clearer. That paired with a consistently strong consumer and lower new competitive new supply. If we look at the same-store outlook for '24 specifically, the midpoint calls for revenue on par with '23. Similar to last year, move-in rates continue to be the biggest variable in the forecast heading through 2024 as well. We're anticipating at the midpoint case that move-in rents lap easier comps through the year, and crossed zero on a year-over-year basis towards the end of the summer. And occupancy results down 80 basis points, which is roughly on top of 2019 occupancies as we sit here today. Our expectations are for 2.75% same-store expense growth driven primarily by property tax and marketing expense. That leads to same-store NOI growth at the midpoint of a decline of 90 basis points. Our non-same-store acquisition and development properties are poised to be a strong contributor again in 2024, growing from $370 million of NOI contribution in '23 to $505 million at the midpoint and will grow from there in future years. In addition, embedded in the outlook is incremental acquisition and development activity, $500 million of acquisitions, and we plan to deliver a record $450 million of development in '24. Finally, our capital and liquidity position remains solid. Our leverage of 3.9x net debt and preferred to EBITDA combined with nearly $400 million of cash on hand at quarter end puts us in a very strong position heading into 2024. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob. Sure. Happy to add that color, Steve. I think as you know, I'd like to speak about existing customer rent increases as a combination of customer price sensitivity as well as the cost to replace that customer if they vacate upon receiving a rental rate increase. And as we look at in 2024, there's a couple of things at play here. One is, as we enter the year, right, demand is a little weaker, we'll give you a January, February update here shortly, where move-in rents are down year-over-year as we start the year, similar to how we finished in 2023, that's going to lead to higher replacement costs through the first part of this year. That's going to be a little bit of a drag to ECRI performance. The flip side is, Joe spoke to the strength in move-in volumes that we experienced through '23. Those new customers are going to be eligible for rental rate increases, which will lead to more contribution from the volume of increases that are sent this year. Such that at the midpoint case, we're looking at contribution overall, pretty consistent with 2023 with those two pieces offsetting each other. In the high-end case and low-end case, a little bit better price sensitivity in the high end and a little bit worse than the low end. Yes. So as I noted in my prepared remarks that the key drivers of expense growth are property taxes and marketing. So I will note, property tax is our largest expense line item. We do anticipate to be up 4% plus or minus, which is a contributor. And then on marketing expense, taking a step back, we increased marketing spend through the year in 2023 and saw very good returns associated with that. The fourth quarter, our marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.5%. And as you've heard from me in the past, being in that 1% to 3%, 1% back in 2021 when demand was really, really strong and back towards 3% when you go to a more typical operating environment, pre-pandemic, is a comfortable place for us to be. And so the first part of 2024, we're going to be lapping comps that will lead to year-over-year growth levels that are higher, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter and then we'll evaluate as we go from there. But we're comfortable in the ZIP Code and continue to see a very strong return on that advertising dollar. Good question, Michael. So there's a couple of components to this question that I'll respond to. The first is, as we look at our operating metrics, our operating metrics are starting to improve, right? We talked about occupancy closing the gap as we move through last year, and we finished the year with occupancy down 70 basis points compared to down 240 basis points when we started '23. If you look at move-in rent trends, move-in rents on a year-over-year basis decelerated through the year. In the fourth quarter, they were down 18%. Throughout the quarter, but as we noted in our January update, they improved to down 11% in December. Looking at January and February, they're down in that same 10%, 11% sort of ZIP code. So, that improvement has been lasting. And as you heard through our outlook, we anticipate that to continue to close as we move through this year. I highlight that because operating metrics tend to lead financial metrics, meaning that as we're talking about some of these operating metrics improve, it will take several quarters to see that in financial metrics. And so, if you think about the shape of the curve and the description of the midpoint case that I gave earlier, it would imply that to your point, we're going to see some deceleration through the first couple of quarters of this year. But then the second derivative, the rate of change of growth is going to flip positive in that midpoint case in the second half and you're going to see some reacceleration in the financial metrics, again, lagging those operating metrics in the second half. The second component of the question that I just highlighted is, we're already seeing that in certain markets. And so if you look at the Mid-Atlantic, for instance or Seattle, markets that maybe didn't have the high highs in 2021, but have been solid performers. We're actually seeing those accelerate as we sit here today in the first quarter and would expect those high, high markets, the Floridas, the Atlantas, for instance, to take a little bit longer to find that turn given how high their high was. But we're already seeing some of that turnaround in some of our operating metrics today. So Michael, I'll just maybe take a step back and talk a little bit about how we thought about the macro environment in our guidance. So last year, on this call, we spent a good bit of time talking about the macro environment. And we did couch the guidance range last year in macro terms and that we viewed it as appropriate given the landscape at the time. At the time, 65% of Bloomberg economists were expecting a recession during the calendar year, for instance, and we thought it would make sense to provide the investment community our assumptions of what that could potentially look like within our guidance range. Clearly, as we move through '23 that recession outcome became less probable. And as such, our financial performance proved out to be towards the higher end of those expectations as we move through the year. This year, we are not capturing the range in terms of macro. And as you think about the midpoint of the range, we're not assuming that the macro environment needs to improve at the midpoint range, but more around the lines of what Joe was speaking to and what we're seeing today. So I hope that's helpful in terms of how we thought about the range. And then I will hit on one of your comments just again because you asked about what move-in rents were doing in January and February. I'll just reiterate that for the group. Move-in rents were down 10%, 11%. So pretty consistent with December performance, which is, what you'd anticipate, right, because we're at kind of the trough of rental rates in the winter season here, and we'll be looking to March, April and May to see some acceleration in moving rents. Sure, Juan. I'll give you some context around both the high and the low. And specifically, you're speaking to same-store revenues. So that's where I'll focus my attention. So as I noted, at the midpoint case, that assumes that we cross that zero on a year-over-year basis for moving rents at the end of the summer and occupancy being down about 80 basis points. Pretty similar to where we finished the year in '23. And I would note that, that's -- as we sit here today, year-to-date, we're down 70, 80 basis points in occupancy, so consistent with where we sit today. In terms of the high end and the low end, the low end assumes that it takes a little bit longer for operating metrics to stabilize here. And as such, the assumption on when we cross zero on year-over-year move-in rents is at the end of the year. And in that case, we're assuming, right, it takes a little longer to stabilize. The move-in environment is going to be a little bit tougher, Occupancy is down about 120 basis points year-over-year. At the high end, we're assuming a more vibrant spring leasing season, one, which we see a little bit of a rebound in the housing market, something we spent a good bit of time talking about through the fall of last year. There are some indications that we could experience that this year. The high end of the range assumes that. And as such, that zero crossing point is at the beginning of the summer in that spring leasing season and occupancy, as you'd expect, results in better performance down about 20% -- or 20 basis points -- sorry, 20 basis points throughout the year with an acceleration in the summer and a higher peak seasonally. Yes, Jeff, I think as we sit here today, we do have more visibility, we think, heading into this year. I mean, I just spoke earlier around how we couched the ranges last year in the macroeconomic environment. Our view is the macroeconomic environment is clearer this year. We're not couching the ranges that way. And as we sit here today, right, is very different than last year. Last year, we knew that demand was weaker, and we were going to see revenue growth decelerate through the year in a pretty meaningful way. This year, that pace of deceleration has really slowed. And as I highlighted earlier, there's actually some markets in our portfolio that are reaccelerating already in the first quarter, which we view as leading as we move through the year. And so from a range of variability less than last year, that's not to diminish the fact that we're still in an uncertain environment. We're still talking about moving rents being down 10%, 11% to start the year. That's not like a typical pre-pandemic year, where we'd be debating our move-in rent is going to be up 3% or are they going to be up 5% in a very tight band. That's not the environment we've been operating through in the last several years. And as such, we think we've couched the ranges appropriately to encapsulate that variability. But we do feel more confident in the range of outcomes this year than we did last year. Sure, Jeff. I mean I think I've already covered the move-in rate component and as well as the occupancy side. So maybe I'll just focus on the market part of the question, which is not too dissimilar to fourth quarter performance. We continue to see strength in Southern California, for instance as our strongest area of growth. And as we spoke about through '23, the markets that had the highest highs in '21 and '22 are giving back some of that appropriately so. And so the weaker markets on a growth rate basis to start the year are some of those southeastern markets, Florida, Atlanta, et cetera. Yes, Keegan, maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the development environment and then some of the sequencing of our deliveries. So, as we've sat here today, we've been trying to grow our development business from where we were delivering more like $100 million to $200 million in deliveries in '21 and '22. Last year, we delivered $360 million, as I noted in my remarks, we're looking to deliver $450 million in this year. So an acceleration when the industry overall is seeing delivery slowdown. So we're taking some share there in growing that business. We're doing so because we think it's the highest risk-adjusted return on capital. And you can see the returns that we've achieved on our development vintages in the sub. And we have an in-house team that's dedicated to this program, development, construction, design that are all out working on growing that pipeline. This will be a record year. The team is out of figuring out how we're going to backfill that development pipeline from here in a challenging development environment. But as we sit here today, that's a business we want to grow. And we'll be looking to backfill that pipeline and have deliveries next year, hopefully around the same levels that we have this year and go from there. Sure. So I wouldn't call the rains that we've had in the winter here in Southern California a natural disaster. It has been raining this week, frankly. So we don't see a surge in demand. In fact, what we tend to see is Southern California residents and drivers tend to stay off the roads and you don't see as much move-in activity or move-out activity, for instance, in periods of time when it's raining here in SoCal. But overall, I'd say demand remains healthy. here. Occupancies are very healthy in L.A., San Diego, Orange County. So we feel very good about how the portfolio is set up, and we'll work through the reins here in SoCal. Sure. Getting into specifics, I'd say -- the -- there's a range of going in yields depending on how stabilized the assets are. So of those 11 assets, some of them were [CofO] properties where the going-in yield is zero or a little bit negative. And then you had some that were more stabilized that going in yields are probably mid 5% to 6%, and we're going to seek to improve the operations on those portfolios and get them to those assets rather, and get them to 6% plus as we think about the return profile of those assets. And that's pretty consistent with what we saw through most of 2023. As Joe mentioned, we'll see how the interest rate and capital environment plays through into '24, but that hopefully gives you a guidepost on yields. Sure. So the rents of that portfolio have been improving as they've been added into our portfolio. So we've already seen some of the benefits of adding that portfolio in. The occupancy, as it sits there, I think it's in the mid-80s, today, seasonally, I think when we took it over in the peak of the summer, it was towards the upper 80s. We'll obviously look to lease that back up into the spring leasing season and take the occupancy of there, ultimately into the '90s on stabilization. So seeing good trends as we've added that portfolio and those 90,000 customers into our portfolio and on track for a good spring leasing season with that portfolio with properties orange painted and public storage signage, which the customers are reacting well to. Yes. I think part of what you're seeing in that midpoint case is if you take a step back, right, we had really strong demands in occupancies in '21, '22. And as those tenants cycled through and we experienced weaker demand through '23, we're seeking to maximize revenue ultimately in a trade-off between rents and occupancies. And that's managed at a very granular level, at the unit level across our properties based on the demand we're seeing, the customer price sensitivity, et cetera. And so that balance is real at the granular level. And what you see at the output is it made sense to give up in effect some of that 2021 heightened level of occupancy to maximize revenues. And as we sit here today, our occupancies are down about 70, 80 basis points compared to where we started in 2023. Again, that midpoint case doesn't assume that there's a big uplift in seasonal demand. And so you're kind of -- you're not getting a big lift there similar to how we experienced last year. And so as we move through the year, you may see some closing towards the end of the year, but you're going to probably be finished on average through the year about the same as where we're sitting today. Sure. So, I'll couch seasonality in terms of the peak-to-trough change in occupancy. So last year, we experienced -- taking a step back even further in 2015 to 2019, there was typically about a 280 basis point peak-to-trough change in occupancy, call that from June 30, December 31. In 2022, we experienced about a 240 basis points. So, it was a little bit less seasonal than a typical year. In 2023, that fell all the way down to about 160 basis points peak-to-trough. And in 2024, our midpoint case is a touch over 200. So, a little bit more seasonality, but not as much as we experienced in '22 and a far cry from what we experienced in the pre-pandemic time period. Thanks, Eric. So, I think we'll have to dig up and we can get to you exactly. I don't have in front of me what our third quarter move-in rents were, for instance. But at end of summer, we're expecting it to cross zero. So I'd look at plus or minus our third quarter of '23 move-in rents. And I think the team is going to dig up third quarter contract rents, so you can have them. In terms of what we need to see to get there, there's seasonality every year. So as the question earlier, so even in a year last year where I'd call it an atypical year where we didn't see a lot of seasonal strength through your April, May and June. The housing market has been very well publicized as resetting lower in terms of transaction volumes as being a driver there. As we think about move-in rents they're going to rise and they rose last year, they're going to rise on an absolute basis into the summer. And then, what you're going to see is a little bit more growth in rental rates this year to close that gap over the time between now and the end of the year last year -- or the end of the summer, this upcoming year. Does that make sense? Yes. I guess the way I'd characterize it is we saw less than what we would typically see last year in terms of a seasonal uplift in rents. And what we're saying is we're expecting stabilization in demand through this year, which means that we shouldn't continue to set new lows seasonally adjusted on moving rents in the midpoint case. And so that's going to result in closing of that gap. We're not suggesting that the environment needs to get significantly better, but rather stabilize as we move through this year and not set fresh lows. And to follow up on your question, the team dug it up. We had move-in rents on a contract basis in the third quarter about $16. So, Ki Bin, we spoke about this a little earlier. There's a little bit of a give and take this year. We're expecting that on the one side, the consumer remains strong, as Joe highlighted in his remarks, and that we don't see a significant shift in customer price sensitivity, which we've been very encouraged in experiencing through '22 and '23. So that's one side. On the other side, on replacement costs, move-in rents are still down 10%, 11%. So replacement cost is higher at the start of this year than it was at the start of last year on average. And so that's going to have a detriment to overall contribution. But the flip side of that, that I highlighted earlier was the fact that we moved in a lot more new customers. Last year, move-in rents were strong, up about 9%, and that will have a positive impact on the -- not the magnitude, but the number of increases that we send throughout the year. And those things largely will offset such that the contribution of ECRIs as we sit here today in the midpoint case is pretty consistent year-over-year. Yes. So Joe spoke to a lot of the tools that we were using through last year. advertising, promotions, rental rates and the power of advertising platform online. So we saw better than industry top-of-funnel demand into our system, which ultimately led to good move-ins. But we also saw stronger conversion associated with both pricing and promotion, which are more conversion-related items such that conversion rates both through -- well, through all the channels that we operate in, both website, call center and folks walking in or higher in '23 compared to '22, and we're seeing good trends into '24 as well. We're assuming less seasonal demand in the low end I agree with that. I think that's something I mentioned earlier. So I agree with that and more seasonal demand in the high end. Eric, it sounds like you have a pretty good handle on that. We're sitting here in the winter, Q4 and Q1 you're going to have that differential between the move-ins and move-outs to be higher. That's going to then narrow as we move into Q2 and Q3 and then rewiden again in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the comments that I made around moving rents getting to a point where they're not declining on a year-over-year basis through the fourth quarter will be helpful on that, but you're still probably going to end in a similar territory on gap there between move-in and move-outs in the midpoint case. And we're very comfortable with that. and managing to achieve those higher revenues from our in-place customers who are placing a lot of value on our space. Yes, I'd say to reiterate something that Joe mentioned earlier, which is that the customers continue to behave as expected and with some strength, and we continue to see good momentum within that program, and that includes both newer customer as well as longer-term customers in the program. Yes. That's a good question, Ron. I hope that everyone is not embracing. But I would anticipate that we see deceleration through the first part of the year. And yes, that likely involves a negative performance on a year-over-year basis through the first half. And then yes, reacceleration as those -- the lag between operating metric improvement and financial metric performance starts to show in the second half of the year. Sure. So I guess the way I'd couch it is we did cover a macro series of scenarios for our guidance ranges last year. The range on same-store revenue was about 250 basis points. This year, as we sit here, there's still uncertainty as I highlighted, maybe a little bit less than what we experienced last year -- what we were expecting last year. And so, the range is 200 basis points this year, so not too far different. Our core FFO range was about $0.70 last year. I think the range this year is $0.60. So, we're still talking about similar levels of range. And as a reminder, we operate a month-to-month lease business. And so there is some variability that could play out through the year. I've tried to be very transparent on what the range of potential outcomes are in a number of the key metrics, both at the high and the low end. And we'll look on to executing through our plan this year, and I'll leave judging, conservatism or aggressiveness to the investment community, but we want to try to be transparent around what our assumptions are and how we plan on navigating through the year. Yes. That's the right way to think about it, Steve. The midpoint case, I think move-in rents are down 3% on average through the year. Subject to ECRIs, right? I mean we gave you a lot of different metrics at the low end that gets you there. I gave you the perspective that demand -- new customer demand in that lower end case doesn't stabilize until later in the year and you don't cross year-over-year moving rents until the fourth quarter, really towards the end of the year. ECRIs, we're assuming in that case that there's a little bit more price sensitivity than what we're experiencing right now. To directly answer your question, move out churn, we're anticipating really in is centered around in the midpoint case, the same levels of churn we saw last year, which is very consistent with what we saw in 2019. Churn levels are up a little bit in that low-end case, but not materially. So that's what gets you at the low end. Yes. And we'll obviously update you on that as we go through the year. I'd maybe reiterate something I said in my prepared remarks that I would focus more on move-in rents. That has been the big area of variability over the last year or two on same-store revenue performance. Try to give the investment community some guideposts in terms of how we think about that going through the year. But we operate a month-to-month lease business where we're going to be adding about 6% to 8% of our tenant base every month. And the rate with which we add those customers is going to be very impactful on where we end up through this range. And we'll update you on what we're seeing on operating trends as we move through the year."

            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our fourth quarter and full year 2023 performance, industry views and 2024 outlook. Then we'll open it up for Q&A. 2023 was a year of significant achievement for public storage amidst a competitive industry environment. The team elevated our customer experience and financial profile through digital and operating model transformation. Enhanced existing properties with over 500 solar installations and the Property of Tomorrow program. Advanced complementary business lines, including tenant reinsurance and third-party management and grew the portfolio through acquisitions, development and redevelopment. We did so while maintaining one of the real estate industry's best balance sheets, which is poised to fund growth moving forward in conjunction with significant retained cash flow. Just a few of our collective accomplishments include: exceeding 3,000 owned properties and serving nearly 2 million in-place customers. Achieving an approximately 80% stabilized direct NOI margin through revenue generation and expense efficiency that only Public Storage is capable of. Acquiring and quickly integrating the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage portfolio with approximately 90,000 customers across nearly 130 properties. This was the largest private acquisition in company history. Increasing the size of our high-growth non-same-store pool to 705 properties and 63 million square feet now comprising nearly 30% of our overall portfolio. Generating record revenues, net operating income and core funds from operations. Accelerating growth in third-party property management, adding 132 properties and reaching 324 properties in total. And receiving several accolades tied to sustainability including NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award, a second consecutive great Place to Work award and achieving top scoring benchmarks among U.S. self-storage REITs. The strength of our team, platform and brand was evident with move-in volumes up an impressive 9% in 2023, despite a backdrop of weaker customer demand during the year. The new customer environment remains challenging, but we have seen a degree of improvement in move-in rent trends recently. And our in-place customer base continues to perform well with average length of stay that are longer than the historic norm. We expect demand from new customers to stabilize during 2024 and the behavior of existing customers including our recent move-ins to remain strong due to clear macro conditions, including the potential for a soft landing, the potential for easing interest rates, resilient consumers, leveling home sales and strong home renter behavior. We also anticipate fewer completions of new self-storage facilities nationally reducing the competitive impact of new supply in our local markets. All in, the industry is in better position entering 2024 than it was entering 2023. The full Public Storage team is focused on exercising our competitive advantages, which include advancing our digital and operating model transformation, expanding complementary businesses and creating partnerships across the broader industry, growing the portfolio through acquisitions, development, redevelopment and third-party management, and funding innovation and growth today and into the future with the industry's best balance sheet. All of this adds to the growth of our business over the near, medium and long term. And it comes at a time with the potential for further stabilization in the move-in environment, existing customers exhibiting strong behavior and an outlook for new competitive supply that is clearly in our favor. With good trends in customer demand, less pressure from new supply and our numerous competitive advantages, we are well positioned for 2024 and beyond. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Okay. Apologies accepted, but you took some liberty there, Michael, but we'll address your question. All right. So let me start with consumer strength and what we continue to see in the portfolio that's been trending to a clear advantage, even with the performance we saw quarter-by-quarter in 2023. The consumer activity, first of all, in existing customers, as I've mentioned, has been quite strong, and we're really not seeing any on the margin evidence that that's likely to change even going into what we've seen through almost two months of this year. Balance sheets are quite healthy. Payment patterns are still better than they were pre-pandemic. We're not seeing any undue or new stress evolving into customer activity. The acceptance of our ongoing revenue management tied to existing customer rate increases. We have a very active engagement process with existing customers that guides us to the tolerance and the level of activity that we're pushing through on ECRIs, that too has not hit different levels of either areas that we've become more concerned about. In fact, it's validating many of the things that we've already talked about relative to the performance of existing customers and our confidence that that's likely to stay with us, even coupled with what Tom just mentioned, indicating in certain markets, where you've actually seeing the -- some good percolation taking place. That ties clearly to the kind of activity from a new customer demand activity. We're having to work harder as we did all through 2023 with a variety of tools that we have. They're quite good. In fact, they continue to get much better. We are very confident market to market with our scale and the knowledge we have market to market. We have the right tools. We have the right brand. We have the right technologies to continue to pull customers to our platform, and we're going to continue to leverage those going into the next several months. With the anticipation, as Tom mentioned, that by summer or late summer, we're going to start seeing the residual effects to the positive from all those efforts. And then Tom, you can tackle if you choose to, Michael's additional questions. Yes, sure, Juan. I'll take that. I would say, at this point, we're continuing to see the same environment that we saw through most of 2023. So a lot of owners are reluctant to put properties into the market. Knowing that they're going to potentially not achieve the cap rate or the valuation that they expected based on prior year inflated valuations, et cetera, when interest rates were at a much different price point. So the reluctance continues. The amount of activity going into the first part of this year, which is typically very light, is just that. We are getting a number of inbound discussions that are tied to properties that are quote-unquote not on the market to either test the water or judge whether or not we are ready to transact at a valuation that either meets or would be acceptable for that particular seller. We do not have anything as noted in our release, currently under contract. The team is busy. We're engaged in a number of different conversations with a variety of different size opportunities, whether single assets or larger portfolios. But as we saw in 2023, the beginning of 2024 is likely to be very similar. And we'll see going into the next few months, if there's either some pent-up demand or additional realization that cap rates have adjusted, and we'll just see if, in fact, there's going to be more trading. Clearly, one thing that could moderate that to some degree in push activity to a higher level is some activity by the Fed reducing interest rates, potentially with some impact on cap rate adjustments, et cetera. But frankly, there's just not a lot of trading going on right now to give you any really clear sense of how directly cap rates have changed at the moment. But the gap continues, meaning the level of seller expectations to what we feel are prudent ways for us to allocate capital. Many of the conversations just start with that, and we'll see how that plays out here in the near term. And like many times, Jeff, it's never one single issue, but Tom just went through a number of the things that have given us more clarity and perspective going into this year that we think are, a, additive one by one. Another factor that's continuing to trend very favorably to the entire industry that we're seeing, particularly in nearly every market we operate in our reduced levels of deliveries. The development business has continued to be very, very difficult. Funding for new construction is either at a very high cost or from an availability standpoint, very limited. The time to get through entitlements even for our own processes are continuing to be very difficult. So this too creates another additive element that we have even more perspective on now that we've been through a multiyear deceleration of new development deliveries, putting us in a very different position even year-by-year that we've had more confidence to say this is a different environment, very different than where we were even a year ago. So with that, we think that we've got the right perspective, continue to read the variety of tea leaves out there, but we are very confident that we've got the right tools to guide us and put the kind of perspective that we've got into our outlook for 2024. And yes, just from a timing standpoint, Keegan, a little lighter in Q1 but then pretty balanced deliveries in the subsequent three quarters a little bit differently than what we saw in 2023, where we had a lot of deliveries hit more towards the second half of the year. So, we've got a good combination of both ground up new development, and we're a little over-weighted on expansion and redevelopment opportunities, particularly tied to unusually large projects that we'll complete in 2024. So -- as Tom mentioned, the team is working hard not only to continue to grow the overall pipeline, but to continue to put these generation five Class A properties into a whole variety of markets. And we're continuing to see very good lease-up and again, returns tied to the development activity, both new development and redevelopment. And Spenser, from a strategy and appetite standpoint, we continue to look for properties that are potentially either lease-up opportunities or stabilization opportunities by putting those assets on our own platform. So not shy at all about taking on lease-up risk. In fact, many times we see an actual pretty sharp improvement once we put those assets onto our own platform. And we're confident that again, those strategies will play well even going into this year. And continue to look for a whole range of different type of assets even based on age and maturity of the tenant base, et cetera. But clearly, no differentiation relative to the strategy we've deployed over the last few years looking for opportunities when properties are far from stabilized, and again, buying the properties at the right price point, location, et cetera, continues to be very advantageous for us. And on top of that, Ki Bin, as we've talked about, our digital platform continues to give customers the ability to again transact with us through not only digital platform, but now even through our care center, et cetera. So, we're making that conversion activity even that much more effective relative to -- again, consumer intent with all the tools that we have to get them to top-of-funnel activity, but then actually to the conversion itself from a speed, efficiency time of day. Frankly, many of our customers transact with us and off business hours now. So all very good tools that continue to lead to a very strong conversion that to Tom's point, we feel like we've got good industry-leading capabilities that we're going to continue to invest and optimize going forward. Yes. That's key component of the growth of the platform itself. It's a very relationship-oriented business. Thus far, we've acquired close to 40 assets out of the program. Over the last few quarters, it's been on the light side. Again, it's, I think, indicative of the environment that we've been seeing in acquisitions in general with many owners not of a mindset that this is the right time necessarily to do a transaction or a trade. But with the growing platform itself, again, we saw very good traction in 2023. We've got good momentum going into this year as well. Those additive relationships, knowledge of the assets their comfort level with our own ability to transact very efficiently. We'll continue to be a good source of not only relationships but acquisition activity over time. So, I noted that now the programs at about 325 assets. And we still see good momentum to continue to grow to our ultimate goal and optimization of the platform. So, we'll likely see that in the next year to two and with that more acquisition opportunities. Well, I would... And then again, Michael, as we've been speaking to, we're seeing, again, continued validation of, I would say, healthy economy, very consumer-oriented economy where the pressure points of a year ago or beyond relative to whether it was inflation, interest rates, employment, et cetera, are at a better place today with more clarity today than they were certainly at the beginning of 2023. That continues to play through relative to our own month-by-month operating metrics that we're seeing going even into 2024. So something would have to shift pretty materially away from that to give us a different low-end view as well."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations for Public Storage. Thank you. Mr. Burke, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Ron. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, October 31, 2023 and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements to become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplemental report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially keep your questions to two. Of course, after that, feel free to jump back in the queue. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thank you, Ryan and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through a few highlights for Q3 and then open up the call for questions. Each team at Public Storage is successfully exercising our platform-wide advantages in a more competitive environment as demonstrated by third quarter performance and our raised outlook for the remainder of 2023. As we entered this year and expectedly, we saw new move-in customer demand for the sector shift lower, particularly with softening existing home sales due to the rapid rise in home mortgage rates. On the flipside, there has been solid and increased demand from new customers that are renters. They have proven to be very good customers as well, particularly from a length of stay perspective. We have the right team, technologies and analytics to determine the appropriate mix of marketing, promotions and rental rates. Drawn by these top-of-funnel tools, along with our leading brand, self-storage users are clearly choosing public storage. Our strong move-in volume, coupled with healthy in-place customer behavior has led to better-than-expected occupancy trends with our same-store occupancy gap narrowing from 250 basis points at the beginning of the year to 120 basis points at the end of September and to 60 basis points as of today. Our digital and operating model transformation continues to be a significant enhancement to customer experience and our financial profile. Customers benefit from having digital options at their fingertips across their entire journey. Our proprietary digital ecosystem is a compelling reason to choose us with over 60% of our customers running through our online leasing platform. And today, we have more than 1.4 million PS app users. And our financial profile benefits as well. We are putting these digital tools in the hands of our customers and employees for convenience combined with in-person on-site customer service when and where it is needed. The result is a better customer experience and enhanced margins, particularly in regard to labor efficiencies. We are also growing our portfolio amidst broader market dislocation. Our industry-leading NOI margins, multifactor in-house operating platform, access and cost of capital and growth-oriented balance sheet put us in a very unique position. So far this year, we have acquired more than $2.6 billion worth of properties, including the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage portfolio comprising 127 properties. As is our regular practice, every property was fully integrated into the public storage platform on day 1 and we welcomed over 250 new associates and approximately 90,000 customers. We are also ahead of schedule on reimaging the entire portfolio to public storage to ensure the maximum benefit from our industry-leading brand. We will have also delivered $375 million in development by year end and have a pipeline of nearly $1 billion of development to be delivered over the next 2 years. Since we updated you last quarter, the sharp move in interest rates has backed up the acquisition market with fewer deals likely to trade by year end, typically a busy time of year for asset closings. We are actively engaged with a full range of owners that give us confidence that some sellers\u2019 expectations will adjust as the cost of capital has clearly increased. Our advantages enable us to acquire and develop when others can\u2019t. We have a strong appetite to grow our portfolio as seller expectations continue to correct and we have a matching ability to execute. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $4.33 per share for the third quarter, representing 5.6% growth year-over-year, excluding the contribution from PS Business Parks. Looking at the key components for the quarter, same-store revenues increased 2.5%. As Joe mentioned, move-in rental rates continue to be lower for us and the industry, but we are seeing strong move-in volume along with the right mix of marketing spend and promotions. Our existing customer base continues to perform well with move-out volumes further moderating this quarter. These trends largely continued in October with the year-over-year occupancy gap narrowing to 60 basis points as of today, as Joe mentioned. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 2.8%, leading to 2.4% stabilized same-store NOI growth at an industry leading operating margin of 80%. Our largest market, Los Angeles, continues to lead our portfolio. The 214 properties in the same-store pool grew NOI by 6% on steady demand and limited new supply of facilities. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities continues to be a standout, with NOI increasing nearly 20% year-over-year in the quarter. This pool of 685 properties and more than 60 million square feet comprises nearly 30% of our total portfolio today and is the strong contributor to FFO growth today and into the future. Shifting toward the outlook, we sit here in October, raising our core FFO range once again, increasing both the low and high-ends to $16.60 at the low end to $16.85 at the high end. Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remained rock solid. We are well positioned with a strong appetite for growth, coupled with the ability to execute in a dynamic capital markets environment. Rob, with that, let\u2019s please open it up to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You continue to navigate the environment well, though the guidance implies continued deceleration into the fourth quarter for same-store revenue growth and same-store NOI growth with both turning negative at the midpoint. So what are you seeing in October to this point and how are you viewing how the last 2 months of the year will play out?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Thanks, Michael. Good question. So I will provide a little bit of context on the same-store revenue outlook for the remainder of the year and then specifically speak to October. So, as we have spoken to in the prepared remarks the environment for new move-ins continues to be competitive and that\u2019s persisted through the second half as we sit here in October. We and the industry are responding with lower rental rates, promotions as well as advertising. But on the flipside, we are seeing good move-in volume growth. Those tenants are staying longer than last year and our existing tenant base has been strong. When we look at the exit rates for move-in rates and occupancy to give you a sense what\u2019s assumed in our outlook on move-in rates we assume that at the midpoint move-in rents are down circa 18% at the midpoint. The high-end of our outlook assumes 13% decline year-over-year in the low-end, 22%. On the occupancy side, the midpoint assumes that we hold the year-over-year decline from September at about 120 basis points decline year-over-year. At the high-end of the range, we nearly closed the gap to last year by the end of December. And obviously, at the low-end, we go backwards on occupancy towards the end of the year. Speaking specifically to October, we\u2019ve seen, again, good volumes but at lower rates. As we look at the move-in rental rate decline on an apples-to-apples basis, move-in rents down, call it, 18% in October to date. Obviously, today, we\u2019ll wrap up the month. We and others ran some fall in Halloween sales on select units in the back half that will cause a little bit of a decline in that towards the back half of the month. But overall, seeing very good volumes. Volume is up nearly 9% in the month of October. So the tools that Joe highlighted continue to work very well. And I would point again to existing customers performing well. Move-outs were down or actually are down year-over-year this month-to-date. And the occupancy gap, as Joe highlighted, has improved to down about 60 basis points today. So we\u2019re seeing good traffic in existing tenant performance.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks for that. That\u2019s really helpful. And my follow-up question is on the existing customer. You\u2019ve talked about in the past with the existing customer, how they respond as a function of price sensitivity or you see rise or a function of price sensitivity and the replacement cost, given the pressure on move-in rates, how do you think about your ECRI philosophy heading into the back half of the year or heading into the through the fourth quarter, just given what you\u2019ve seen from the customer? And then separately, as a follow-up to the first part, is there any change in your guidance philosophy you\u2019ve been able to hold your guidance pretty flat through the year, at least the high-end of the guidance hasn\u2019t been raised as the low-end has moved up. And now you finally touched the high-end. So any change in philosophy on the guidance as well? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: Okay. That\u2019s a lot, Michael. Let\u2019s step through that. So on the existing customer rate increases, I would reiterate what we\u2019ve been saying really all year, which is on the first component, which you highlighted, which is customer behavior and our expectations for customer behavior continue to be met or exceeded, frankly, as we move through the year. And so that side of the equation has been quite strong. It\u2019s been one of the drivers that\u2019s led to better performance through the year. And then the second component cost to replace continues to get more challenging. So as we\u2019ve highlighted throughout the year to date that\u2019s led to lower magnitude and lower frequencies have increased to customers. But no real change there in terms of talking points. The second component of your question related to guidance. And so we did lift the lower end as well as the higher end of our guidance range this quarter. And in February, we were pretty upfront and describe the different pathways that we could take through the year. We\u2019ve been encouraged by the pathways that we\u2019ve ultimately executed upon and are towards the high-end of that range and again, lifted the high-end this quarter. And I think I used some guideposts around the macro economy at that time as well to frame the outlook. And I think we\u2019re all somewhat pleasantly surprised by the macro economy and obviously, a strong third quarter GDP print that further reinforces the performance towards the higher end of that original guidance range.\nJoe Russell: And yes, Michael, one thing, just a little bit more context on existing customers. Again, we\u2019re all looking to the prints that Tom just mentioned. But month-by-month, through this year, we\u2019ve been quite and pleasantly surprised by the consistent behavior of existing customers. We\u2019re not seeing any new or emerging stress coming through the economy continues to support our customer base quite well. We\u2019re not seeing, again, any level of additive stress tie delinquencies, etcetera. So continuing to see very, very consistent behavior from existing customers, which is very good for the business. And again, assuming the economy at large continues to do what it\u2019s doing. We think we\u2019re in very good shape, again, going through the rest of this quarter and then setting up for 2024.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question\nSteve Sakwa: Great, thanks. Maybe first, just talking on that the transaction market. It sounds like you\u2019re maybe starting to see some sellers capitulate. I\u2019m just wondering, Joe, how have you guys changed your underwriting criteria on the revenue NOI growth side, IRR side, cap rate side? And how wide do you think the bid-ask spread is today?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Steve. So again, a lot of moving parts there. And as you spoke to, we clearly need to be very conscientious of change in cost of capital. One of the things that step-by-step, as I alluded to, with a very high degree of dialogue we\u2019re having with all different types of owners, the realization of a different trading market is starting to play through. Clearly, some entities may have more pressure points likely not tied to the actual performance of the asset or the portfolio, but maybe more particularly tied to any capital event that may be emerging, again, tied to the very different environment that an owner would go through to reset an existing capital structure and how to deal with that and/or different pressure points to bring a particular asset or portfolio to the market. So, we have seen the migration and the realization that the environment has clearly changed. As I mentioned, we\u2019re anticipating very low levels of trading volume between today and the end of the year, which is somewhat unusual, particularly for the fourth quarter. But what we\u2019ve been seeing with the iterative discussions with many entities is the realization that things have changed quite a bit. In our own underwriting, we have put different hurdles in place relative to those facts, which we should. So our own cost of capital has changed, and we are again seeing a difference in bid to ask, but I will tell you that gap depending on the situation of a particular owner is shifting, and we hope that too puts us in very good shape to actually transact in a different environment and very uniquely, as I mentioned, we can do this unlike most others. So the capital that we have available, the balance sheet, our ability to transact very quickly is serving us well, and we\u2019re going to continue to exercise that opportunity as we see fit relative to the types of hurdles we hope to achieve through this very different trading environment.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And maybe just to clarify a few numbers that \u2013 that Tom threw out just when you talked about move-in rents down 18%, just to be clear, you\u2019re talking about move-in rents in Q4 versus move-in rents in the year ago period. And if that\u2019s true, how \u2013 I guess, I\u2019m just trying to look at what is the spread between the move-in rents and the move-out rents because I think that widened out a bit in Q3. And I\u2019m just curious what your expectations are for Q4 and maybe moving into the first half of \u201824.\nTom Boyle: Yes. Good question, Steve and clarification. So yes, I was speaking to a year-over-year metric there. And then, due to the second component of your question about the difference between move-in and move-out rates, I think in the third quarter, that differential was about 26%. And as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we don\u2019t manage that number specifically, right? So we talk about our existing tenant rate increase program being driven by predictive analytics on individual customers and units and understanding the expected sensitivity of that customer over time and how we can influence that. And on the flipside, right, we are dynamically managing rental rates. And so were trying to attract customers and maximize revenue through a combination of rental rate and move-in volumes. And so what spits out of that more dynamic at the local level, management is that differential in gap. And again, that gap suggests that we\u2019re earning good revenue on the existing tenant base that continues to perform quite well. To your question around how do we think about that gap today? Clearly, it\u2019s in a range that we\u2019ve operated in, in the past. I think the first quarter, that gap was about 24%, 25%, so not dissimilar to where we are now. You\u2019re suggesting, as we move through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter again, based on the assumptions around move-in rents, we\u2019re likely to see that gap increase a little bit more. And that\u2019s something we\u2019re comfortable operating in.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks for the answers.\nTom Boyle: Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. Apologize if I missed this, but are you guys able to provide some color on the cap rates as it relates to the 3Q acquisitions and the acquisitions that you\u2019re under contract or have completed so far in 4Q?\nJoe Russell: So maybe a little perspective on how cap rates are trending Spencer. And then deal-by-deal, there\u2019s likely to be a range in the actual cap rate depending on the asset itself or the portfolio from a stabilization standpoint, etcetera. But if you kind of step back and look to where the environment was going back to 2021, we were in a range of plus 4% or so on a cap rate basis, shifted up to 2022 to 2025. This year, I would say we\u2019re at a 6 handle trending potentially to 7. So again, reflective of the change in cost of capital, Steve\u2019s question about this gap from a seller expectation standpoint, does take a little bit of time from a realization standpoint, but we do see that trend continuing. And we are using that as an opportunity to continue to find appropriately priced assets to bring into the portfolio. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a number of different situations playing through that we\u2019re confident at some point will likely trade, it just takes some period of time depending on the pressure points and the timing of a particular seller.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then are you guys able to provide any update, if there is any, on the integration of your new tenant insurance platform?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So I think you\u2019re speaking to our Savvy program. So we announced that we would be launching that program here in next month in November. And it\u2019s an initiative, we\u2019re launching the industry to offer our tenant insurance program to other operators. This really came out of our third-party management business in dialogue with some of the operators, they have continued to like to operate the portfolios themselves in our dialogue, but they have said, hey, but what about that tenant insurance piece? Can we talk about that on a standalone basis, and they were intrigued by that. As you know, we share a portion of the premiums that we collect on our third-party managed properties with the owners of those facilities. So we\u2019ve been working to streamline and simplify our tenant insurance process including making it easy to use digitally, something our customers have embraced over the past couple of years, and we think the industry can benefit from. So in that press release, we noted that we\u2019ve been working with [indiscernible], which is the largest software provider in the industry to be able to offer that same experience on their property management software, and we\u2019re going to be launching that starting here in November. In terms of the opportunity, it\u2019s obviously very early days. We\u2019re launching it next month. But the addressable market, frankly, could be larger than third-party management for those that are interested in a different tenant insurance component, but just getting started there. And I\u2019d say stepping back, it\u2019s just another way for us to create a win-win with other owners in the industry and build relationships that could bear fruit in a multitude of different ways over time.\nSpenser Allaway: Great. Thank you, guys.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Just hoping to follow-up on a prior point on the ECR commentary. So has the quantum and/or pace of increases that you\u2019re looking to pass through to existing customers moderated throughout this year? And do you expect \u2013 and if not, do you expect that to happen in \u201824 at some point if the current environment continues into next year?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Juan, it\u2019s moderated throughout the year as that cost to replace component has gotten more costly, right? I mean stepping back a couple of years ago, right, we\u2019re in an environment where in many markets, we had a benefit to replace, which is pretty unusual in the sector, and now we\u2019re back to a point in time where there is a cost to replace. And so as we move through this year, and frankly, as we move through last year, too, the cost to replace grew. And so on a year-over-year basis, the contributions from existing customer rate increases has declined modestly year-over-year. The flip side of that is the new move-in volume that we\u2019ve been getting really over the last year is supportive, right, because the more tenants that are coming in will receive those increases over time. And so that will benefit the 2023 back half as well as 2024, given the significant volumes of moving activity we\u2019ve seen.\nJuan Sanabria: And then I was just hoping you could spend a couple minutes on Los Angeles. I know you had some benefit starting last year as the rental restrictions rolled off. Where are we in that? Is that done? And any benefit that is going to wear off as we kind of roll the calendar forward a year?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Sure, Juan. Yes, just to step back, as you know, Los Angeles is our largest market. We\u2019ve got 229 properties here in the L.A. Basin, another 26 properties in San Diego, but as a full Southern California portfolio, L.A., in particular, we\u2019re beyond the correction or the opportunity that was at hand based on the price constraints that we had for that 3-year period. So the level of performance you\u2019re seeing now is truly indicative quality of the market and the strength of that size portfolio, the location and the overall dynamics that we see here in Southern California continue to provide, which is, again, very, very healthy levels of new customer activity, very healthy levels of existing customer behavior in a market that, again, we have a very outsized level of not only presence but a very strong portfolio. We\u2019ve talked about this to some degree, recently, but it\u2019s also a portfolio that we\u2019ve touched holistically from our Property of Tomorrow program. We\u2019ve invested $80 million plus in the assets to pull them into a very ideal position relative to curb appeal, other attributes that we\u2019ve added through Property of Tomorrow enhancements, etcetera. So all things considered the market is humming along quite well. And we think we will continue to see good activity and good performance going forward.\nJuan Sanabria: Just one last quick follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind. You mentioned occupancy was down 60 basis points year-over-year at the end of October. What\u2019s the absolute occupancy percentage, if you don\u2019t mind sharing that.\nTom Boyle: The occupancy percentage as we sit here today, I\u2019m not sure, is directly relevant to what the period-end occupancies are going to be. Obviously, we\u2019re getting towards the end of the month. Today, we will be a move out day at many of our facilities. So I guess, I suggest that not too dissimilar to where we were in September. The occupancies are north of 93% today, but expect them to be in the 92s as we finish the business day up here.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Thank you, Juan.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. I just \u2013 I guess I wanted to ask about the market in general, just listening to your comments and thinking about is there an equilibrium like some point where, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s national occupancy, something to alleviate the pressure on new rates? Or do you not really care because your volumes are so strong? Like how are you thinking about that as we\u2019re trying to forecast and think about the coming months into \u201824.\nTom Boyle: Jeff, there is a lot there. I guess what I\u2019d suggest is \u2013 if you think about this year, right, we came into this year expecting that the move-in environment would be more competitive. And that was based on our outlook and what we were seeing, no question housing having a component of that with record last 20-year record high, mortgage rates, as Joe mentioned, that\u2019s led to a slowdown in demand. The flip side is we\u2019ve seen good activity from renters as we\u2019ve highlighted, but the move-in environment has gotten more competitive, right? Our facilities, in particular, if you rewind a couple of years, we\u2019re full. And frankly, we were turning customers away in 2021. Because we were so full and we were pushing rate. And so the combination of that dynamic and where we are now, has led to a correction. And I think in terms of moving rents, maybe an overcorrection in certain markets where the industry as a whole is reacting to an environment where the larger operators are taking their typical move-in volumes and the overall demand environment is a little softer than where it was maybe 2 years ago. But demand continues to be relatively healthy if you go back in time for self-storage, it\u2019s just nowhere near what it was in 2021. And no question that\u2019s led to declining move-in rents. And as we look at how our business has performed through this year, that has been the one notable component of the revenue algorithm that has underpunched expectations, i.e., moving rents have been lower than what we anticipated. The good thing is on the flip side, moving volumes, to your point, have been strong. The existing tenant behavior has been good, move-outs have moderated. So obviously, leading to us increasing our outlook as we move through the year. But I don\u2019t want to shy away from the fact that move-in rents have been a particular soft spot as we move through the year.\nJoe Russell: And yes, on top of that, Jeff, you again, need to be reflective of the three tools that we continue to speak to marketing, promotions and rental rates. Those are tools that are highly interrelated right down to a per property and per customer basis relative to the way that we can optimize the utility of each of those with the data that we have, the amount of demand, volume and knowledge that we have relative to any particular trade area. More often than not, we\u2019re typically competing with owners that have far few tools of any depth and/or ability to judge and react to any of the dynamics that Tom just spoke to. These, frankly, are tools that are deep seated. We\u2019ve used them in a whole variety of different economic arenas. Clearly, the last 3 years or so, most operators have had to rely on those tools very frequently. We\u2019re very good at using those tools. And frankly, we\u2019ve become better even over the near-term relative to our own utility of data, the knowledge that we have and we will continue to unlock relative to all the operational efficiencies as well. So we feel very encouraged that we\u2019re using those tools to not only drive top-of-funnel demand, but conversion to the move-in activity that we\u2019re reporting, and we\u2019re going to continue to keep them very sharp and active.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. Very helpful. And just one question, a clarification, please. On the 60 basis points year-over-year for occupancy, was that the end of period or the average, if it was end of period \u2013 can you state the average?\nTom Boyle: For the month of October. Well, we started the month at down 120 basis points. We\u2019re finishing up down 60 basis points. So the average is right about in the midpoint there.\nJeff Spector: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. \nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. First question, I just wanted to follow-up on the last question about move-in rents. Tom, you talked about moving volumes being stronger than expected. And it sounds like you\u2019ve taken share from other operators. Joe, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that customers are choosing public storage more and more. In this environment, a more competitive environment, I guess really without sort of an increase in overall demand, even if occupancy stabilizes in Public Storage\u2019s portfolio, which I think the high end of your guidance now assumes at year-end, do you foresee the ability for move-in rents to stabilize or begin to stabilize or will they continue to drift lower until overall industry occupancy really stabilizes and maybe find a bottom?\nTom Boyle: Yes. I think that there is a number of factors at play. And certainly, as I noted, we were in an environment where moving rents, you pick a market move in rents in Miami, for instance, we\u2019re up significantly in the 2020, 2021, 2022 time period, and we\u2019re giving some of that back. And I think as an industry, no question that\u2019s playing through. But as we think about the different components at play as we head into \u201824 and \u201825, housing has gotten a lot of airtime this year around its impact to demand. No question, that\u2019s a component of demand. And that\u2019s been softer. If you look at existing home sales over time, they have been in a range of, call it, 4 million to 7 million existing home sales per year. We\u2019re trading right around that 4 million today, which if you go back and look at the financial crisis or other periods where the housing market is has slowed down pretty consistent. So we worked through that decline as we move through 2023. And \u2013 so that\u2019s helpful as we think about the setup into \u201824 and \u201825 and the fact that existing home sales aren\u2019t likely to take another significant leg lower. But obviously, we will see how that plays out. The other side is renters and people that are running our space at home, there is less movement. And frankly, those are good storage customers, and they tend to have longer length of stays in some instances, in many instances. And so we\u2019ve seen that benefit as we move through this year, longer length of stays for move-ins this year and have been getting good customers, which again supports \u201824 and \u201825, supports occupancy, I think, for the industry overall. So those are all helpful as we move into \u201824 and \u201825. And I\u2019d add to that, the fact that the development environment continues to be quite challenging. Construction costs are up over the last several years, city processes continue to be challenging with understaffing and delays. And no question, cost of capital in the construction lending environment is going to lead to lower levels of deliveries as we go into \u201824 and \u201825. All of those things are helpful as we think about stabilizing rental rates in some of the markets that maybe I even characterize as maybe overcorrecting in some instances. I also think getting into the busy season next year will be quite helpful, right? We go into a time period in the spring where seasonally, you\u2019re going to see more demand. This year, we didn\u2019t have much of a season, partially attributable to the housing environment. So the comps from a seasonal standpoint next year are a little easier. And we will have to the benefit of what plays through in \u201824 to the dynamics with moving rental rates heading into March, April and May of next year.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my other question is around the development and expansion pipeline, which decreased a little bit in the quarter versus last quarter. I realize it\u2019s just one quarter, not necessarily a trend, but the environment is more challenging today. And I\u2019m just curious if that is intentional at all as you look for either rents to stabilize or greater certainty around lease-up or if it\u2019s just timing related. But really, just wondering if your return requirements maybe to start new projects have really changed at all in the current environment.\nJoe Russell: So yes, to again, give full perspective on the focus and the priority we continue to put into our development and redevelopment capabilities. It continues to be our most vibrant opportunity from a return on invested capital standpoint. So we think that ironically or counterintuitively, this is actually even a better environment for us to source and compete for a land sites and b, work certain properties through entitlement and development processes where others are retrenching. The lending environment particularly tied to construction loans continues to be much more constrained. In fact, with the pressure into regional banks where most of the construction lending goes on, particularly tied to one-off construction loans for self-storage, again, very, very tough hurdles for any developer to meet very differently than we\u2019ve seen over the last several years. This continues to be a good opportunity for us to compete very differently and ideally look for expansion opportunities for the portfolio as a whole. The slight reduction, Todd, to your point, was just a \u2013 that was just a one-off quarter impact from some deliveries that took place. But the team is working very hard to continue to not only operate in an environment where, yes, some of the hurdles are being adjusted, but development is a long game as well. We\u2019re dealing with multiyear processes not only to get a particular asset approved and launch from a construction standpoint, but then a number of years beyond that to get them stabilized. So in this environment, particularly, you\u2019ve got to have very strong fortitude to get through those time frames, particularly with cost of capital being very different. But we look at this as an ideal opportunity for us to continue to leverage the skills, the strong balance sheet and our knowledge market to market. The team is well seated nationally. We continue to find new and different opportunities region by region across the country, and we\u2019re going to continue to work hard to not only unlock ground-up development, but redevelopment activity as well. So it continues to be a very vibrant part of the business that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on very strongly.\nTodd Thomas: Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow-up, you mentioned expectations of lower deliveries, I think, industry-wide in \u201824 and \u201825. Is there \u2013 can you just quantify that a little more in terms of either dollars invested you\u2019re seeing in the space or a percent increase in existing supply? And are there any markets where you see outsized growth coming up for one reason or another or anywhere it looks particularly favorable, meaning like very little growth.\nJoe Russell: Yes. Smedes a lot of moving parts there, but step by step, and we\u2019ve been speaking to this for some time. We\u2019ve been seeing the usually difficult hurdles you go through to get projects a, approved and then b, funded and now again, with the constraints I just spoke to in the lending environment, getting them into production themselves. So statistically, we think most of the information out there is not accurate because it\u2019s not reflective of the continued deceleration in annual deliveries. From a step-by-step basis going from this year to \u201824 and likely into \u201825, we think that the pool of assets that had been predicted to deliver are probably shrinking by plus or minus at least 10% or more on a per annum basis. We had kind of ratcheted down to a delivery level nationally, plus or minus $3 billion or so of assets in the 2022 to 2023 time frame, and that\u2019s going to continue to notch down in our view based on all the constraints that I just spoke to. It\u2019s a very good thing for the industry as a whole, can\u2019t really point to any number of markets that at the moment are overburdened from a delivery standpoint outside of potentially Las Vegas, Phoenix to a degree, Portland starting to work, but a little bit of an outstretched level of new deliveries in that market as well. But frankly, the good news is the amount of deliveries that have come to the market over the last couple of years has been slower, and it\u2019s likely to continue to get slower from a volume standpoint going into the next couple of years.\nSmedes Rose: Great, thank you. And then I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned that I think in the past that renters tend to have a longer length of stay. So are you seeing that in the portfolio now? Could you just talk a little bit more about where length of stay is and the changes you might be seeing?\nTom Boyle: Yes. In terms of length of stay overall, continues to be quite strong. So we\u2019ve spoken a lot over the last couple of years in terms of how that\u2019s extended from, call it, 32, 33 months on average. If you take a snapshot of all of our tenants in place pre-pandemic to more like 35, 36 and that persists today. And that\u2019s persisting in an environment we\u2019re obviously adding more new tenants, which brings that average down. So continue to see strong trends there. Customers that have been with us for longer than 2 years continues to punch well above where we were pre-pandemic in the 40s as a percentage of the total tenant base and that continues to be the most stable and important component of the tenant base.\nSmedes Rose: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Luebchow: I appreciate the question, guys. I wanted to go back to the ECRI discussion from earlier. I think you talked about higher cost of replaces somewhat moderated your ability to push through ECRIs to some degree. But does that dynamic shift at all, given you\u2019re loading more new customers now at lower rates? Can you push ECRIs harder and faster with this cohort given the cost to replace presumably for them is slightly lower than your in-place customer?\nTom Boyle: That\u2019s spot on, Eric.  That\u2019s spot on, Eric. So, as we talk about the tenant base overall, right, the cost to replace has gone higher. But those new tenants that have moved in this year, right, don\u2019t have that same dynamic and are more like customers in prior years with a lower cost to replace and are likely to receive higher magnitude and frequency of increases, which is supportive as we move more customers in through 2023 into \u201824 and \u201825.\nEric Luebchow: Okay. Great. And then just one last one, maybe you could touch on the cost side. You have seen marketing expenses, payroll, utilities continue to increase, especially with an uncertain demand backdrop into next year, how \u2013 maybe you can talk about how effectively you will be able to manage your costs and any cost line items that we should be aware of that will be pressure points in your NOI growth outlook for next year.\nTom Boyle: Yes. So, I guess starting with marketing, right, marketing is the one that this quarter was up most notably. We continue to get very good returns on the marketing spend that we are utilizing. And that is a process that we manage dynamically at the local level in conjunction with promotions and rental rates, as Joe highlighted earlier. If you look at marketing spend over time, we have historically been in a range of, say, 1% to 3% of revenue spent on marketing. We got all the way down to 1% or so in 2021. And I think this quarter, we sat right around 2%, 2.1%. So, there continues to be a room at least from a historical lens for us to continue to increase that and see good return associated with that and we will do that. I would think about marketing spend on the expense line item certainly will create higher levels of expense growth, but that\u2019s going to be an NOI positive investment given the returns we are seeing. The other line items, utilities as well as property payroll continue to be areas that are strategic initiatives that we outlined at Investor Day continue to bear fruit. So, as we close 2023, we will meet our 25% payroll hour reduction that we highlighted at Investor Day. That\u2019s helped to offset as we have gone through initiatives around technology as well as specialization and centralization of property roles that are leading to career advancement opportunities and as well as good efficiencies and good customer experience. So, that\u2019s one side that will continue through 2024 to benefit us. And the other is our solar power programs, we would like to put solar on over 1,000 rooms. And today, we are sitting with solar. We will finish the year with around 500 of those complete and we think there is more to go there, which will help offset utility pressure. And in addition to that, be good for the environment and our carbon emissions.\nEric Luebchow: Alright. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nJoe Russell: Thanks Eric.\nOperator: Our next question is from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKeegan Carl: Yes. So I hate to leave [ph] the point on ECRI, but maybe just on 4Q in particular, when do you guys typically stop sending rates for the year? And does the current operating environment change that plan at all various historical levels?\nTom Boyle: No. As I have noted, the existing customer base continues to perform as expected, and frankly, very stable versus the prior several years. which is encouraging. So, our program continues. It\u2019s part of how we manage revenues. And that\u2019s not going to change. It won\u2019t change in the fourth quarter and don\u2019t anticipate it to change into \u201824 barring any significant shock or change. So, that continues to be a strong point as it relates to the overall customer base and I wouldn\u2019t point to anything significant there.\nKeegan Carl: I guess just to clarify though, you are comfortable sending increases throughout the entire year. Like the quarter, you are not going to stop around the holidays. I thought that was a trend that\u2019s typically present in storage.\nTom Boyle: No, we send increases throughout the year.\nKeegan Carl: Okay. And then just shifting gears here, so you guys obviously over on your interest income in the quarter just given the hold on to cash prior to closing on simply, just curious what a good run rate for this would be going forward.\nTom Boyle: Yes, that\u2019s a good question. So, as everyone is aware, we announced the Simply transaction on Monday in July. We did the financing associated with that transaction on the same day, which was meant to match fund both the acquisition as well as the financing associated with it. In hindsight, that looks pretty good because interest rates are up over 100 basis points since that time period. But the other benefit was we obviously sat on that cash for a period of time. And believe it or not, we actually \u2013 we eked out a positive spread on that cash versus our financing costs given where you can earn on cash, about 3 basis points, so nothing to write home about. But it certainly led to both higher interest income for the quarter as well as higher interest expense because we were sitting on that cash, and we had raised it for a period of time. So, no real impact to FFO, but certainly drove incremental. And then if you think about that interest and other income line, right, you are just doing some simple math, $2.2 billion in cash and sitting on it earning a little over 5%. I think we get the numbers for 50 days of about a $15 million benefit during the quarter. So, you could think about that as not recurring. We won\u2019t be sitting on that $2.2 billion of cash in the fourth quarter.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Thanks for the time guys and Happy Halloween.\nTom Boyle: Thanks Keegan.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Happy Halloween.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRon Kamdem: Hey. Just two quick ones. I think you guys were one of the first this year to talk about the potential of same-store revenue to go negative. And obviously, the guidance in 4Q implies that it does that and I think we could sort of use your wisdom as we are thinking about sort of next year. If I go back to that move-in, move-out spread down 26% in 3Q, which got a little bit worse, it sort of suggests that, that things are still sort of decelerating. So, the question really is, like as we are thinking about next year, is it occupancy response, is it length of stay, like what sort of factors should we be watching to get a sense of the direction of the same-store trend into next year?\nTom Boyle: Well, Ron, I think there is a few things there that I will pick out and comment on. One is, certainly, we started 2023 at a point of particular strength and rents were significantly higher. I have commented on some of the positives and negatives that have played through this year. But no question, growth rates have moderated through the year. Commented on move-in rates, in particular, have been softer than expected. And I think that\u2019s certainly the case as we move through the third quarter and the fourth quarter here. Going into 2024, I am not going to speak to specifics, but one of the things that we spent a good bit of time on earlier in the year talking about this year was that comps eased in the second half because the environment started to change last year. And I would suggest that, that\u2019s not just a second half of 2023 thing. It\u2019s also into 2024 as we work through a demand environment that softened through 2023 as well as move-in rents that declined through 2023. And so for the same reasons that we discussed moderation and deceleration are easy comps in the second half of 2023, maybe we haven\u2019t seen that as much as we initially envisioned, but we have also seen the levels of performance of the existing tenants make up some of that rental rate comp dynamic. But we are still, to your point, looking at negative same-store revenue growth at the midpoint in the fourth quarter, to your point, we were highlighting that in February. Our outlook for the fourth quarter has gotten better as we move through the year. I think the midpoint now is down 50 basis points in same-store revenue. So, almost there at flat, which is frankly an improvement from where we were sitting starting the year. And to your point on 2024, I think I probably said as much as I should. And we will be providing a good bit more detail in February on the assumptions and fresh guidance for the year.\nRon Kamdem: Great. And then my second question was just going back to the supply question, but instead of just like the macro forecast, do you guys have a sense of how much of the portfolio is actually competing directly with new supply high level? Is it a quarter? Is it half? Just trying to get a sense of the range of the actual assets that are competing with new supply. Thanks.\nJoe Russell: Yes. That\u2019s going to vary, Ron, market-to-market. There is a whole spectrum. As I mentioned, our largest market, being here in Southern California, almost no new supply to speak to other parts of the country that are well known to be the tougher markets to develop into have same and similar dynamics. I mentioned on the other end of the spectrum, we are keeping a close eye on the amount of deliveries that are playing through in Phoenix and Las Vegas. But frankly, it goes right down to a very submarket impact. And I would say it\u2019s less than and continuing to shrink below the lower number you pointed to, i.e., whether it\u2019s 20% or lower, it\u2019s definitely a factor below that. And I think we will continue to shrink, which as I mentioned earlier, is a very good thing for the industry as a whole.\nRon Kamdem: Thanks so much.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. I think I was wondering, I know the Simply Storage deal is still pretty fresh. But wondering if you could go through whether you have started to realize any synergies and/or just go through the near-term strategies you are implementing?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Caitlin. I mentioned in my opening comments that our goal with that portfolio, which is to-date, our largest private transaction with 127 assets coming to us. The benefit that we saw in that portfolio is it crosses 18 different states. It didn\u2019t put any undue burden on our ops team, market-to-market. And frankly, over the last 3 years or 4 years, we have become very good at integration on a whole level of different scale market-to-market, where we have seen certain portfolios with dozens of assets, whether it was easy storage in the Washington DC market or the portfolio that we bought in Dallas-Fort Worth that again, was \u2013 again, very efficiently brought into the portfolio on a much more concentrated basis. But this portfolio from an advantage and integration standpoint was different. It was definitely sizable and we were able to deploy many of the techniques that we have used over the last few years to integrate those assets. Now, from a data integration standpoint, again, our toolkit has become incredibly strong relative to the efficiency. As I mentioned, we pulled 90,000 customers on to our portfolio overnight. That synergy continues to play quite well now that we are in the seventh week or so of owning those assets. We were able to integrate and train 250-plus new employees that came to us from that portfolio, great additions to the platform as well. So, that opportunity from a training synergy and adaptability standpoint has gone very effectively. And we are also leveraging many of the things we do day-in and day-out to drive margins. Again, with the scale that we have got market-to-market, the ability for us to see optimization, so we really haven\u2019t seen any shortfalls at all. And if anything, we have been pleasantly surprised with the continued strength of that portfolio. Occupancy is holding quite well. The transition from both customers to our platform, the transition from the branding is going very effectively. We will have that finished no later at the end of the year. We see definite inherent value to transitioning what were once blue properties to orange properties. And we are very excited about what we have got ahead of us because we think that, that portfolio as a whole is very additive to the scale that we have got across the 18 states that I spoke to. So, very pleased by, again, the tools that we have got and the ability to exercise the synergies. Tom spoke to some length this morning about many of the tools we are using right now from a revenue management standpoint, whether it\u2019s tied to new customer, top of funnel demand and/or existing customer opportunities. So, those two are different toggles that we are deploying into that portfolio as we speak and not seeing anything that\u2019s going sideways. In fact, more encouraged that things are actually even better than what we predicted when we underwrote the portfolio.\nCaitlin Burrows: Great. And then maybe another quick one. I know you have talked a number of different ways about the lower expected deliveries in \u201824 and \u201825, which is encouraging. So, that would suggest, you have started to see development, started slow, I was just wondering if you could talk about the magnitude of that slowdown and/or when it started, like how new is that?\nJoe Russell: Well, it\u2019s been year-by-year transitionary. We hit a peak of deliveries back in the 2019 or so timeframe with plus or minus, say, $5 billion of assets that were again, added the market, which actually equates to about 5% of additional inventory. And as I have mentioned, this year, it\u2019s down to about $3 billion or about 3%. We think that, that\u2019s going to notch down by at least another 10% factor each successive year between 2024 and 2025. By the time we get to 2025, we may be in the low-2% range of deliveries from an inventory standpoint. And to your point, that\u2019s a good thing and gives us a very different opportunity to leverage our opportunity as not only the largest developer in the sector, but the only public developer of assets. And we are able to do many things even more efficiently because of the scale we have got with our own development team and the amount of capital that we can sensibly deploy into development and redevelopment opportunities.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. Thanks.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. So, you guys mentioned that you were testing out some additional promotion activity in October, call it, a follow-up Halloween special. I was just curious, do you plan on keeping that type of promotional activity past October into November, or would those come off?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Ki Bin, sales are something that the company has been doing for years and years. You go back and look at pre-pandemic activities, the company started doing Memorial Day sales going back probably more than a decade ago and see good traction from that. And so around holidays, we oftentimes will run sales and get some traction and we offer discounts on select units in our markets that we operate in. And we have seen good traction on that this year. We did a more of a [ph] sale. We did a Labor Day sale. And this one, I don\u2019t know if you want to call it a Halloween sale or I think we call it a fall sale on the website, but it will wrap up today. And we see good customer demand traffic. And others in the industry do, too, the big public REITs generally run these types of sales as well. And so they are good traffic drivers, and they get the team in the field excited as well, and we see good conversion there. So, it\u2019s a part of the business that\u2019s been around for some time, and we will continue to use it as we have in the past. We didn\u2019t use them in \u201821, \u201822 because we, frankly, were too full for it to make a lot of sense, but we are back to an occupancy environment where it makes good sense, and so we are utilizing it again.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And on the debt maturities, you have a U.S. note and a euro note coming due next year. Just any high-level thoughts you can share on refinancing plan?\nTom Boyle: Yes. We will plan to refinance those as we get into 2024. The $700 million U.S. note is a floating rate note and we will plan to refinance that as we get into the first part of the year.\nKi Bin Kim: And assuming the spreads will be pretty similar, or should I expect that to change?\nTom Boyle: It depends on ultimately what tenor we issue and the nature of the interest rates at the time. But it\u2019s our floating rate note, as I have said. So, it\u2019s at market from a benchmark rate standpoint. So, there won\u2019t be a significant headwind associated with refinancing that particular note. It will be more spreads. And we will update you on financing costs as we get into the first quarter. And frankly, that\u2019s. I mean if you look at our balance sheet overall, we obviously have a very long-dated set of financing tools, most notably the over $4 billion of preferred stock that we don\u2019t need to refinance ever, but we can refinance at our election to the extent interest rates change. And we have a very well laddered maturity profile. So, you are highlighting some refinancing we have in \u201824, we have modest in \u201825, a little bit more in \u201826. But overall, a very small percentage of the capital structure is coming due in any given year.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thanks Ki Bin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Mueller: Yes. Hi. Just a real quick one here. Joe, when you are talking about cap rates trending 6% to 7%, is that \u2013 was that meant to be a day one cap rate if you are buying a stabilized asset, or is that more the yield that you are looking at if you are buying vacancy and assuming the lease-up risk?\nJoe Russell: Yes. I mean again, that would be, in our view, a stabilized expectation would be. If you are dealing with a highly stabilized existing asset, that too, I think would be in that similar zone. There is always going to be a gap or some kind of a risk that you are going to inherit the time and again, we have been more comfortable doing that, knowing if we can buy an underperforming asset at a going in lower yield, we will be able to extract the kind of ultimate value and yield hurdle that we are speaking to. So, those are the stabilized yields that we are aiming at, Mike, as we are looking at investments in this arena right now.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments.\nRyan Burke: Thanks Rob and thanks to all of you out there for joining us today. Have a great Halloween, and we will talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. We reported core FFO of $4.33 per share for the third quarter, representing 5.6% growth year-over-year, excluding the contribution from PS Business Parks. Looking at the key components for the quarter, same-store revenues increased 2.5%. As Joe mentioned, move-in rental rates continue to be lower for us and the industry, but we are seeing strong move-in volume along with the right mix of marketing spend and promotions. Our existing customer base continues to perform well with move-out volumes further moderating this quarter. These trends largely continued in October with the year-over-year occupancy gap narrowing to 60 basis points as of today, as Joe mentioned. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 2.8%, leading to 2.4% stabilized same-store NOI growth at an industry leading operating margin of 80%. Our largest market, Los Angeles, continues to lead our portfolio. The 214 properties in the same-store pool grew NOI by 6% on steady demand and limited new supply of facilities. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities continues to be a standout, with NOI increasing nearly 20% year-over-year in the quarter. This pool of 685 properties and more than 60 million square feet comprises nearly 30% of our total portfolio today and is the strong contributor to FFO growth today and into the future. Shifting toward the outlook, we sit here in October, raising our core FFO range once again, increasing both the low and high-ends to $16.60 at the low end to $16.85 at the high end. Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remained rock solid. We are well positioned with a strong appetite for growth, coupled with the ability to execute in a dynamic capital markets environment. Rob, with that, let's please open it up to Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Michael. Good question. So I will provide a little bit of context on the same-store revenue outlook for the remainder of the year and then specifically speak to October. So, as we have spoken to in the prepared remarks the environment for new move-ins continues to be competitive and that's persisted through the second half as we sit here in October. We and the industry are responding with lower rental rates, promotions as well as advertising. But on the flipside, we are seeing good move-in volume growth. Those tenants are staying longer than last year and our existing tenant base has been strong. When we look at the exit rates for move-in rates and occupancy to give you a sense what's assumed in our outlook on move-in rates we assume that at the midpoint move-in rents are down circa 18% at the midpoint. The high-end of our outlook assumes 13% decline year-over-year in the low-end, 22%. On the occupancy side, the midpoint assumes that we hold the year-over-year decline from September at about 120 basis points decline year-over-year. At the high-end of the range, we nearly closed the gap to last year by the end of December. And obviously, at the low-end, we go backwards on occupancy towards the end of the year. Speaking specifically to October, we've seen, again, good volumes but at lower rates. As we look at the move-in rental rate decline on an apples-to-apples basis, move-in rents down, call it, 18% in October to date. Obviously, today, we'll wrap up the month. We and others ran some fall in Halloween sales on select units in the back half that will cause a little bit of a decline in that towards the back half of the month. But overall, seeing very good volumes. Volume is up nearly 9% in the month of October. So the tools that Joe highlighted continue to work very well. And I would point again to existing customers performing well. Move-outs were down or actually are down year-over-year this month-to-date. And the occupancy gap, as Joe highlighted, has improved to down about 60 basis points today. So we're seeing good traffic in existing tenant performance. Okay. That's a lot, Michael. Let's step through that. So on the existing customer rate increases, I would reiterate what we've been saying really all year, which is on the first component, which you highlighted, which is customer behavior and our expectations for customer behavior continue to be met or exceeded, frankly, as we move through the year. And so that side of the equation has been quite strong. It's been one of the drivers that's led to better performance through the year. And then the second component cost to replace continues to get more challenging. So as we've highlighted throughout the year to date that's led to lower magnitude and lower frequencies have increased to customers. But no real change there in terms of talking points. The second component of your question related to guidance. And so we did lift the lower end as well as the higher end of our guidance range this quarter. And in February, we were pretty upfront and describe the different pathways that we could take through the year. We've been encouraged by the pathways that we've ultimately executed upon and are towards the high-end of that range and again, lifted the high-end this quarter. And I think I used some guideposts around the macro economy at that time as well to frame the outlook. And I think we're all somewhat pleasantly surprised by the macro economy and obviously, a strong third quarter GDP print that further reinforces the performance towards the higher end of that original guidance range. Yes. Good question, Steve and clarification. So yes, I was speaking to a year-over-year metric there. And then, due to the second component of your question about the difference between move-in and move-out rates, I think in the third quarter, that differential was about 26%. And as we've talked about in the past, we don't manage that number specifically, right? So we talk about our existing tenant rate increase program being driven by predictive analytics on individual customers and units and understanding the expected sensitivity of that customer over time and how we can influence that. And on the flipside, right, we are dynamically managing rental rates. And so were trying to attract customers and maximize revenue through a combination of rental rate and move-in volumes. And so what spits out of that more dynamic at the local level, management is that differential in gap. And again, that gap suggests that we're earning good revenue on the existing tenant base that continues to perform quite well. To your question around how do we think about that gap today? Clearly, it's in a range that we've operated in, in the past. I think the first quarter, that gap was about 24%, 25%, so not dissimilar to where we are now. You're suggesting, as we move through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter again, based on the assumptions around move-in rents, we're likely to see that gap increase a little bit more. And that's something we're comfortable operating in. Thank you. Sure. So I think you're speaking to our Savvy program. So we announced that we would be launching that program here in next month in November. And it's an initiative, we're launching the industry to offer our tenant insurance program to other operators. This really came out of our third-party management business in dialogue with some of the operators, they have continued to like to operate the portfolios themselves in our dialogue, but they have said, hey, but what about that tenant insurance piece? Can we talk about that on a standalone basis, and they were intrigued by that. As you know, we share a portion of the premiums that we collect on our third-party managed properties with the owners of those facilities. So we've been working to streamline and simplify our tenant insurance process including making it easy to use digitally, something our customers have embraced over the past couple of years, and we think the industry can benefit from. So in that press release, we noted that we've been working with [indiscernible], which is the largest software provider in the industry to be able to offer that same experience on their property management software, and we're going to be launching that starting here in November. In terms of the opportunity, it's obviously very early days. We're launching it next month. But the addressable market, frankly, could be larger than third-party management for those that are interested in a different tenant insurance component, but just getting started there. And I'd say stepping back, it's just another way for us to create a win-win with other owners in the industry and build relationships that could bear fruit in a multitude of different ways over time. Thank you. Yes. Juan, it's moderated throughout the year as that cost to replace component has gotten more costly, right? I mean stepping back a couple of years ago, right, we're in an environment where in many markets, we had a benefit to replace, which is pretty unusual in the sector, and now we're back to a point in time where there is a cost to replace. And so as we move through this year, and frankly, as we move through last year, too, the cost to replace grew. And so on a year-over-year basis, the contributions from existing customer rate increases has declined modestly year-over-year. The flip side of that is the new move-in volume that we've been getting really over the last year is supportive, right, because the more tenants that are coming in will receive those increases over time. And so that will benefit the 2023 back half as well as 2024, given the significant volumes of moving activity we've seen. The occupancy percentage as we sit here today, I'm not sure, is directly relevant to what the period-end occupancies are going to be. Obviously, we're getting towards the end of the month. Today, we will be a move out day at many of our facilities. So I guess, I suggest that not too dissimilar to where we were in September. The occupancies are north of 93% today, but expect them to be in the 92s as we finish the business day up here. Jeff, there is a lot there. I guess what I'd suggest is \u2013 if you think about this year, right, we came into this year expecting that the move-in environment would be more competitive. And that was based on our outlook and what we were seeing, no question housing having a component of that with record last 20-year record high, mortgage rates, as Joe mentioned, that's led to a slowdown in demand. The flip side is we've seen good activity from renters as we've highlighted, but the move-in environment has gotten more competitive, right? Our facilities, in particular, if you rewind a couple of years, we're full. And frankly, we were turning customers away in 2021. Because we were so full and we were pushing rate. And so the combination of that dynamic and where we are now, has led to a correction. And I think in terms of moving rents, maybe an overcorrection in certain markets where the industry as a whole is reacting to an environment where the larger operators are taking their typical move-in volumes and the overall demand environment is a little softer than where it was maybe 2 years ago. But demand continues to be relatively healthy if you go back in time for self-storage, it's just nowhere near what it was in 2021. And no question that's led to declining move-in rents. And as we look at how our business has performed through this year, that has been the one notable component of the revenue algorithm that has underpunched expectations, i.e., moving rents have been lower than what we anticipated. The good thing is on the flip side, moving volumes, to your point, have been strong. The existing tenant behavior has been good, move-outs have moderated. So obviously, leading to us increasing our outlook as we move through the year. But I don't want to shy away from the fact that move-in rents have been a particular soft spot as we move through the year. For the month of October. Well, we started the month at down 120 basis points. We're finishing up down 60 basis points. So the average is right about in the midpoint there. Yes. I think that there is a number of factors at play. And certainly, as I noted, we were in an environment where moving rents, you pick a market move in rents in Miami, for instance, we're up significantly in the 2020, 2021, 2022 time period, and we're giving some of that back. And I think as an industry, no question that's playing through. But as we think about the different components at play as we head into \u201824 and \u201825, housing has gotten a lot of airtime this year around its impact to demand. No question, that's a component of demand. And that's been softer. If you look at existing home sales over time, they have been in a range of, call it, 4 million to 7 million existing home sales per year. We're trading right around that 4 million today, which if you go back and look at the financial crisis or other periods where the housing market is has slowed down pretty consistent. So we worked through that decline as we move through 2023. And \u2013 so that's helpful as we think about the setup into \u201824 and \u201825 and the fact that existing home sales aren't likely to take another significant leg lower. But obviously, we will see how that plays out. The other side is renters and people that are running our space at home, there is less movement. And frankly, those are good storage customers, and they tend to have longer length of stays in some instances, in many instances. And so we've seen that benefit as we move through this year, longer length of stays for move-ins this year and have been getting good customers, which again supports \u201824 and \u201825, supports occupancy, I think, for the industry overall. So those are all helpful as we move into \u201824 and \u201825. And I'd add to that, the fact that the development environment continues to be quite challenging. Construction costs are up over the last several years, city processes continue to be challenging with understaffing and delays. And no question, cost of capital in the construction lending environment is going to lead to lower levels of deliveries as we go into \u201824 and \u201825. All of those things are helpful as we think about stabilizing rental rates in some of the markets that maybe I even characterize as maybe overcorrecting in some instances. I also think getting into the busy season next year will be quite helpful, right? We go into a time period in the spring where seasonally, you're going to see more demand. This year, we didn't have much of a season, partially attributable to the housing environment. So the comps from a seasonal standpoint next year are a little easier. And we will have to the benefit of what plays through in \u201824 to the dynamics with moving rental rates heading into March, April and May of next year. Yes. In terms of length of stay overall, continues to be quite strong. So we've spoken a lot over the last couple of years in terms of how that's extended from, call it, 32, 33 months on average. If you take a snapshot of all of our tenants in place pre-pandemic to more like 35, 36 and that persists today. And that's persisting in an environment we're obviously adding more new tenants, which brings that average down. So continue to see strong trends there. Customers that have been with us for longer than 2 years continues to punch well above where we were pre-pandemic in the 40s as a percentage of the total tenant base and that continues to be the most stable and important component of the tenant base. That's spot on, Eric.  That's spot on, Eric. So, as we talk about the tenant base overall, right, the cost to replace has gone higher. But those new tenants that have moved in this year, right, don't have that same dynamic and are more like customers in prior years with a lower cost to replace and are likely to receive higher magnitude and frequency of increases, which is supportive as we move more customers in through 2023 into \u201824 and \u201825. Yes. So, I guess starting with marketing, right, marketing is the one that this quarter was up most notably. We continue to get very good returns on the marketing spend that we are utilizing. And that is a process that we manage dynamically at the local level in conjunction with promotions and rental rates, as Joe highlighted earlier. If you look at marketing spend over time, we have historically been in a range of, say, 1% to 3% of revenue spent on marketing. We got all the way down to 1% or so in 2021. And I think this quarter, we sat right around 2%, 2.1%. So, there continues to be a room at least from a historical lens for us to continue to increase that and see good return associated with that and we will do that. I would think about marketing spend on the expense line item certainly will create higher levels of expense growth, but that's going to be an NOI positive investment given the returns we are seeing. The other line items, utilities as well as property payroll continue to be areas that are strategic initiatives that we outlined at Investor Day continue to bear fruit. So, as we close 2023, we will meet our 25% payroll hour reduction that we highlighted at Investor Day. That's helped to offset as we have gone through initiatives around technology as well as specialization and centralization of property roles that are leading to career advancement opportunities and as well as good efficiencies and good customer experience. So, that's one side that will continue through 2024 to benefit us. And the other is our solar power programs, we would like to put solar on over 1,000 rooms. And today, we are sitting with solar. We will finish the year with around 500 of those complete and we think there is more to go there, which will help offset utility pressure. And in addition to that, be good for the environment and our carbon emissions. No. As I have noted, the existing customer base continues to perform as expected, and frankly, very stable versus the prior several years. which is encouraging. So, our program continues. It's part of how we manage revenues. And that's not going to change. It won't change in the fourth quarter and don't anticipate it to change into \u201824 barring any significant shock or change. So, that continues to be a strong point as it relates to the overall customer base and I wouldn't point to anything significant there. No, we send increases throughout the year. Yes, that's a good question. So, as everyone is aware, we announced the Simply transaction on Monday in July. We did the financing associated with that transaction on the same day, which was meant to match fund both the acquisition as well as the financing associated with it. In hindsight, that looks pretty good because interest rates are up over 100 basis points since that time period. But the other benefit was we obviously sat on that cash for a period of time. And believe it or not, we actually \u2013 we eked out a positive spread on that cash versus our financing costs given where you can earn on cash, about 3 basis points, so nothing to write home about. But it certainly led to both higher interest income for the quarter as well as higher interest expense because we were sitting on that cash, and we had raised it for a period of time. So, no real impact to FFO, but certainly drove incremental. And then if you think about that interest and other income line, right, you are just doing some simple math, $2.2 billion in cash and sitting on it earning a little over 5%. I think we get the numbers for 50 days of about a $15 million benefit during the quarter. So, you could think about that as not recurring. We won't be sitting on that $2.2 billion of cash in the fourth quarter. Thanks Keegan. Happy Halloween. Well, Ron, I think there is a few things there that I will pick out and comment on. One is, certainly, we started 2023 at a point of particular strength and rents were significantly higher. I have commented on some of the positives and negatives that have played through this year. But no question, growth rates have moderated through the year. Commented on move-in rates, in particular, have been softer than expected. And I think that's certainly the case as we move through the third quarter and the fourth quarter here. Going into 2024, I am not going to speak to specifics, but one of the things that we spent a good bit of time on earlier in the year talking about this year was that comps eased in the second half because the environment started to change last year. And I would suggest that, that's not just a second half of 2023 thing. It's also into 2024 as we work through a demand environment that softened through 2023 as well as move-in rents that declined through 2023. And so for the same reasons that we discussed moderation and deceleration are easy comps in the second half of 2023, maybe we haven't seen that as much as we initially envisioned, but we have also seen the levels of performance of the existing tenants make up some of that rental rate comp dynamic. But we are still, to your point, looking at negative same-store revenue growth at the midpoint in the fourth quarter, to your point, we were highlighting that in February. Our outlook for the fourth quarter has gotten better as we move through the year. I think the midpoint now is down 50 basis points in same-store revenue. So, almost there at flat, which is frankly an improvement from where we were sitting starting the year. And to your point on 2024, I think I probably said as much as I should. And we will be providing a good bit more detail in February on the assumptions and fresh guidance for the year. Yes. We will plan to refinance those as we get into 2024. The $700 million U.S. note is a floating rate note and we will plan to refinance that as we get into the first part of the year. It depends on ultimately what tenor we issue and the nature of the interest rates at the time. But it's our floating rate note, as I have said. So, it's at market from a benchmark rate standpoint. So, there won't be a significant headwind associated with refinancing that particular note. It will be more spreads. And we will update you on financing costs as we get into the first quarter. And frankly, that's. I mean if you look at our balance sheet overall, we obviously have a very long-dated set of financing tools, most notably the over $4 billion of preferred stock that we don't need to refinance ever, but we can refinance at our election to the extent interest rates change. And we have a very well laddered maturity profile. So, you are highlighting some refinancing we have in \u201824, we have modest in \u201825, a little bit more in \u201826. But overall, a very small percentage of the capital structure is coming due in any given year. Thanks Ki Bin."

            "content": "Thank you, Ryan and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through a few highlights for Q3 and then open up the call for questions. Each team at Public Storage is successfully exercising our platform-wide advantages in a more competitive environment as demonstrated by third quarter performance and our raised outlook for the remainder of 2023. As we entered this year and expectedly, we saw new move-in customer demand for the sector shift lower, particularly with softening existing home sales due to the rapid rise in home mortgage rates. On the flipside, there has been solid and increased demand from new customers that are renters. They have proven to be very good customers as well, particularly from a length of stay perspective. We have the right team, technologies and analytics to determine the appropriate mix of marketing, promotions and rental rates. Drawn by these top-of-funnel tools, along with our leading brand, self-storage users are clearly choosing public storage. Our strong move-in volume, coupled with healthy in-place customer behavior has led to better-than-expected occupancy trends with our same-store occupancy gap narrowing from 250 basis points at the beginning of the year to 120 basis points at the end of September and to 60 basis points as of today. Our digital and operating model transformation continues to be a significant enhancement to customer experience and our financial profile. Customers benefit from having digital options at their fingertips across their entire journey. Our proprietary digital ecosystem is a compelling reason to choose us with over 60% of our customers running through our online leasing platform. And today, we have more than 1.4 million PS app users. And our financial profile benefits as well. We are putting these digital tools in the hands of our customers and employees for convenience combined with in-person on-site customer service when and where it is needed. The result is a better customer experience and enhanced margins, particularly in regard to labor efficiencies. We are also growing our portfolio amidst broader market dislocation. Our industry-leading NOI margins, multifactor in-house operating platform, access and cost of capital and growth-oriented balance sheet put us in a very unique position. So far this year, we have acquired more than $2.6 billion worth of properties, including the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage portfolio comprising 127 properties. As is our regular practice, every property was fully integrated into the public storage platform on day 1 and we welcomed over 250 new associates and approximately 90,000 customers. We are also ahead of schedule on reimaging the entire portfolio to public storage to ensure the maximum benefit from our industry-leading brand. We will have also delivered $375 million in development by year end and have a pipeline of nearly $1 billion of development to be delivered over the next 2 years. Since we updated you last quarter, the sharp move in interest rates has backed up the acquisition market with fewer deals likely to trade by year end, typically a busy time of year for asset closings. We are actively engaged with a full range of owners that give us confidence that some sellers' expectations will adjust as the cost of capital has clearly increased. Our advantages enable us to acquire and develop when others can't. We have a strong appetite to grow our portfolio as seller expectations continue to correct and we have a matching ability to execute. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom. And yes, Michael, one thing, just a little bit more context on existing customers. Again, we're all looking to the prints that Tom just mentioned. But month-by-month, through this year, we've been quite and pleasantly surprised by the consistent behavior of existing customers. We're not seeing any new or emerging stress coming through the economy continues to support our customer base quite well. We're not seeing, again, any level of additive stress tie delinquencies, etcetera. So continuing to see very, very consistent behavior from existing customers, which is very good for the business. And again, assuming the economy at large continues to do what it's doing. We think we're in very good shape, again, going through the rest of this quarter and then setting up for 2024. Yes, Steve. So again, a lot of moving parts there. And as you spoke to, we clearly need to be very conscientious of change in cost of capital. One of the things that step-by-step, as I alluded to, with a very high degree of dialogue we're having with all different types of owners, the realization of a different trading market is starting to play through. Clearly, some entities may have more pressure points likely not tied to the actual performance of the asset or the portfolio, but maybe more particularly tied to any capital event that may be emerging, again, tied to the very different environment that an owner would go through to reset an existing capital structure and how to deal with that and/or different pressure points to bring a particular asset or portfolio to the market. So, we have seen the migration and the realization that the environment has clearly changed. As I mentioned, we're anticipating very low levels of trading volume between today and the end of the year, which is somewhat unusual, particularly for the fourth quarter. But what we've been seeing with the iterative discussions with many entities is the realization that things have changed quite a bit. In our own underwriting, we have put different hurdles in place relative to those facts, which we should. So our own cost of capital has changed, and we are again seeing a difference in bid to ask, but I will tell you that gap depending on the situation of a particular owner is shifting, and we hope that too puts us in very good shape to actually transact in a different environment and very uniquely, as I mentioned, we can do this unlike most others. So the capital that we have available, the balance sheet, our ability to transact very quickly is serving us well, and we're going to continue to exercise that opportunity as we see fit relative to the types of hurdles we hope to achieve through this very different trading environment. Thank you. So maybe a little perspective on how cap rates are trending Spencer. And then deal-by-deal, there's likely to be a range in the actual cap rate depending on the asset itself or the portfolio from a stabilization standpoint, etcetera. But if you kind of step back and look to where the environment was going back to 2021, we were in a range of plus 4% or so on a cap rate basis, shifted up to 2022 to 2025. This year, I would say we're at a 6 handle trending potentially to 7. So again, reflective of the change in cost of capital, Steve's question about this gap from a seller expectation standpoint, does take a little bit of time from a realization standpoint, but we do see that trend continuing. And we are using that as an opportunity to continue to find appropriately priced assets to bring into the portfolio. And as I mentioned, we've got a number of different situations playing through that we're confident at some point will likely trade, it just takes some period of time depending on the pressure points and the timing of a particular seller. Thank you. Yes. Sure, Juan. Yes, just to step back, as you know, Los Angeles is our largest market. We've got 229 properties here in the L.A. Basin, another 26 properties in San Diego, but as a full Southern California portfolio, L.A., in particular, we're beyond the correction or the opportunity that was at hand based on the price constraints that we had for that 3-year period. So the level of performance you're seeing now is truly indicative quality of the market and the strength of that size portfolio, the location and the overall dynamics that we see here in Southern California continue to provide, which is, again, very, very healthy levels of new customer activity, very healthy levels of existing customer behavior in a market that, again, we have a very outsized level of not only presence but a very strong portfolio. We've talked about this to some degree, recently, but it's also a portfolio that we've touched holistically from our Property of Tomorrow program. We've invested $80 million plus in the assets to pull them into a very ideal position relative to curb appeal, other attributes that we've added through Property of Tomorrow enhancements, etcetera. So all things considered the market is humming along quite well. And we think we will continue to see good activity and good performance going forward. Thank you, Juan. And yes, on top of that, Jeff, you again, need to be reflective of the three tools that we continue to speak to marketing, promotions and rental rates. Those are tools that are highly interrelated right down to a per property and per customer basis relative to the way that we can optimize the utility of each of those with the data that we have, the amount of demand, volume and knowledge that we have relative to any particular trade area. More often than not, we're typically competing with owners that have far few tools of any depth and/or ability to judge and react to any of the dynamics that Tom just spoke to. These, frankly, are tools that are deep seated. We've used them in a whole variety of different economic arenas. Clearly, the last 3 years or so, most operators have had to rely on those tools very frequently. We're very good at using those tools. And frankly, we've become better even over the near-term relative to our own utility of data, the knowledge that we have and we will continue to unlock relative to all the operational efficiencies as well. So we feel very encouraged that we're using those tools to not only drive top-of-funnel demand, but conversion to the move-in activity that we're reporting, and we're going to continue to keep them very sharp and active. So yes, to again, give full perspective on the focus and the priority we continue to put into our development and redevelopment capabilities. It continues to be our most vibrant opportunity from a return on invested capital standpoint. So we think that ironically or counterintuitively, this is actually even a better environment for us to source and compete for a land sites and b, work certain properties through entitlement and development processes where others are retrenching. The lending environment particularly tied to construction loans continues to be much more constrained. In fact, with the pressure into regional banks where most of the construction lending goes on, particularly tied to one-off construction loans for self-storage, again, very, very tough hurdles for any developer to meet very differently than we've seen over the last several years. This continues to be a good opportunity for us to compete very differently and ideally look for expansion opportunities for the portfolio as a whole. The slight reduction, Todd, to your point, was just a \u2013 that was just a one-off quarter impact from some deliveries that took place. But the team is working very hard to continue to not only operate in an environment where, yes, some of the hurdles are being adjusted, but development is a long game as well. We're dealing with multiyear processes not only to get a particular asset approved and launch from a construction standpoint, but then a number of years beyond that to get them stabilized. So in this environment, particularly, you've got to have very strong fortitude to get through those time frames, particularly with cost of capital being very different. But we look at this as an ideal opportunity for us to continue to leverage the skills, the strong balance sheet and our knowledge market to market. The team is well seated nationally. We continue to find new and different opportunities region by region across the country, and we're going to continue to work hard to not only unlock ground-up development, but redevelopment activity as well. So it continues to be a very vibrant part of the business that we're going to continue to focus on very strongly. Thank you. Yes. Smedes a lot of moving parts there, but step by step, and we've been speaking to this for some time. We've been seeing the usually difficult hurdles you go through to get projects a, approved and then b, funded and now again, with the constraints I just spoke to in the lending environment, getting them into production themselves. So statistically, we think most of the information out there is not accurate because it's not reflective of the continued deceleration in annual deliveries. From a step-by-step basis going from this year to \u201824 and likely into \u201825, we think that the pool of assets that had been predicted to deliver are probably shrinking by plus or minus at least 10% or more on a per annum basis. We had kind of ratcheted down to a delivery level nationally, plus or minus $3 billion or so of assets in the 2022 to 2023 time frame, and that's going to continue to notch down in our view based on all the constraints that I just spoke to. It's a very good thing for the industry as a whole, can't really point to any number of markets that at the moment are overburdened from a delivery standpoint outside of potentially Las Vegas, Phoenix to a degree, Portland starting to work, but a little bit of an outstretched level of new deliveries in that market as well. But frankly, the good news is the amount of deliveries that have come to the market over the last couple of years has been slower, and it's likely to continue to get slower from a volume standpoint going into the next couple of years. Thanks Eric. Thank you. Yes. That's going to vary, Ron, market-to-market. There is a whole spectrum. As I mentioned, our largest market, being here in Southern California, almost no new supply to speak to other parts of the country that are well known to be the tougher markets to develop into have same and similar dynamics. I mentioned on the other end of the spectrum, we are keeping a close eye on the amount of deliveries that are playing through in Phoenix and Las Vegas. But frankly, it goes right down to a very submarket impact. And I would say it's less than and continuing to shrink below the lower number you pointed to, i.e., whether it's 20% or lower, it's definitely a factor below that. And I think we will continue to shrink, which as I mentioned earlier, is a very good thing for the industry as a whole. Thank you. Yes, Caitlin. I mentioned in my opening comments that our goal with that portfolio, which is to-date, our largest private transaction with 127 assets coming to us. The benefit that we saw in that portfolio is it crosses 18 different states. It didn't put any undue burden on our ops team, market-to-market. And frankly, over the last 3 years or 4 years, we have become very good at integration on a whole level of different scale market-to-market, where we have seen certain portfolios with dozens of assets, whether it was easy storage in the Washington DC market or the portfolio that we bought in Dallas-Fort Worth that again, was \u2013 again, very efficiently brought into the portfolio on a much more concentrated basis. But this portfolio from an advantage and integration standpoint was different. It was definitely sizable and we were able to deploy many of the techniques that we have used over the last few years to integrate those assets. Now, from a data integration standpoint, again, our toolkit has become incredibly strong relative to the efficiency. As I mentioned, we pulled 90,000 customers on to our portfolio overnight. That synergy continues to play quite well now that we are in the seventh week or so of owning those assets. We were able to integrate and train 250-plus new employees that came to us from that portfolio, great additions to the platform as well. So, that opportunity from a training synergy and adaptability standpoint has gone very effectively. And we are also leveraging many of the things we do day-in and day-out to drive margins. Again, with the scale that we have got market-to-market, the ability for us to see optimization, so we really haven't seen any shortfalls at all. And if anything, we have been pleasantly surprised with the continued strength of that portfolio. Occupancy is holding quite well. The transition from both customers to our platform, the transition from the branding is going very effectively. We will have that finished no later at the end of the year. We see definite inherent value to transitioning what were once blue properties to orange properties. And we are very excited about what we have got ahead of us because we think that, that portfolio as a whole is very additive to the scale that we have got across the 18 states that I spoke to. So, very pleased by, again, the tools that we have got and the ability to exercise the synergies. Tom spoke to some length this morning about many of the tools we are using right now from a revenue management standpoint, whether it's tied to new customer, top of funnel demand and/or existing customer opportunities. So, those two are different toggles that we are deploying into that portfolio as we speak and not seeing anything that's going sideways. In fact, more encouraged that things are actually even better than what we predicted when we underwrote the portfolio. Well, it's been year-by-year transitionary. We hit a peak of deliveries back in the 2019 or so timeframe with plus or minus, say, $5 billion of assets that were again, added the market, which actually equates to about 5% of additional inventory. And as I have mentioned, this year, it's down to about $3 billion or about 3%. We think that, that's going to notch down by at least another 10% factor each successive year between 2024 and 2025. By the time we get to 2025, we may be in the low-2% range of deliveries from an inventory standpoint. And to your point, that's a good thing and gives us a very different opportunity to leverage our opportunity as not only the largest developer in the sector, but the only public developer of assets. And we are able to do many things even more efficiently because of the scale we have got with our own development team and the amount of capital that we can sensibly deploy into development and redevelopment opportunities. Thank you. Yes. Ki Bin, sales are something that the company has been doing for years and years. You go back and look at pre-pandemic activities, the company started doing Memorial Day sales going back probably more than a decade ago and see good traction from that. And so around holidays, we oftentimes will run sales and get some traction and we offer discounts on select units in our markets that we operate in. And we have seen good traction on that this year. We did a more of a [ph] sale. We did a Labor Day sale. And this one, I don't know if you want to call it a Halloween sale or I think we call it a fall sale on the website, but it will wrap up today. And we see good customer demand traffic. And others in the industry do, too, the big public REITs generally run these types of sales as well. And so they are good traffic drivers, and they get the team in the field excited as well, and we see good conversion there. So, it's a part of the business that's been around for some time, and we will continue to use it as we have in the past. We didn't use them in \u201821, \u201822 because we, frankly, were too full for it to make a lot of sense, but we are back to an occupancy environment where it makes good sense, and so we are utilizing it again. Yes. I mean again, that would be, in our view, a stabilized expectation would be. If you are dealing with a highly stabilized existing asset, that too, I think would be in that similar zone. There is always going to be a gap or some kind of a risk that you are going to inherit the time and again, we have been more comfortable doing that, knowing if we can buy an underperforming asset at a going in lower yield, we will be able to extract the kind of ultimate value and yield hurdle that we are speaking to. So, those are the stabilized yields that we are aiming at, Mike, as we are looking at investments in this arena right now."

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Shelby. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, August 3, 2023, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports, and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. [Operator Instructions].  With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Russell: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us today. As demonstrated by our second quarter performance and raised outlook for the year, Public Storage continues to maximize its competitive advantages across our platform with several key factors driving positive results, including a better-than-expected macro environment with higher odds of a soft landing; increased rental activity from our needs-oriented customer base; and execution across all aspects of our industry-leading platform. We are built to operate in all macro environments and we are proving just that. Let me highlight three specific areas. First, we are driving record year-over-year growth in customer move-in volumes. Move-in volume growth has accelerated throughout the year, up nearly 14% in the second quarter. We have closed the year-over-year occupancy gap from down 220 basis points at the end of March to down 160 basis points at the end of June. We have the right team technologies and analytics to determine the appropriate mix of marketing, promotions, and rental rates to meet customer expectations in the current environment.  Drawn by our leading brand and enhanced digital customer experience, self-storage users are clearly choosing Public Storage. These trends support our raised outlook along with the easing of difficult year-over-year comps as we move through the second half of the year. Second, we are growing our portfolio amidst broader market dislocation. Last Monday, we announced and fully funded the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage acquisition in a matter of a few hours. This is something that very few companies could do today and separates Public Storage as the acquirer of choice within our industry. We have the strongest balance sheet and the lowest cost of capital, both of which were highlighted by our rapid execution on the Simply Self Storage transaction. With the Simply Self Storage acquisition, we are excited to combine our respective strengths as we integrate their portfolio to ours and achieve significant operational enhancements immediately and into the future. As an example, under our platform, the $1.8 billion ezStorage portfolio acquired in 2021 has seen significant operating margin improvement of 1,100 basis points from 72% to 83%. As we do with all of our acquisitions, the entire Simply Self Storage portfolio will be rebranded to Public Storage in order to maximize the benefits and value of our iconic brand and platform. We expect to stabilize the portfolio at a mid-6% nominal yield by year three. Third, we are well positioned for continued strong execution and growth across the company. From an operating perspective, our digital and operating model transformations are proving to be significant win-win-wins with result to exceeding expectations. Customers benefit from having robust digital options at their fingertips across the entire journey, finding a unit, renting a unit, moving in, managing their account, and navigating the property when on site. Our proprietary digital ecosystem will continue to be a primary reason that customers choose us with more than 2 million PS app downloads and over 60% of customers renting through our online leasing platform today.  Additionally, public storage team members benefit from being able to place even more focus on our customers, and for those that excel, the transformation has enabled us to create new pathways for career advancement. And our financial profile benefits as well. We are putting these digital tools in the hands of our customers and employees for convenience, combined with in-person on-site customer service when and where it's needed. The result is a better customer and employee experience and a higher operating margin. From an external growth perspective, our industry-leading NOI margins, multifactor in-house platform, access and cost of capital, and growth-oriented balance sheet put us in a unique position. So far this year, we have secured $2.5 billion worth of properties. We will have also delivered $375 million in development by year-end and have a pipeline of more than $1 billion of development to be delivered over the next two years. Our advantages enable us to acquire and develop when others can't. We have a strong appetite for more with a matching ability to execute.  Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Boyle : Thanks, Joe. As Joe highlighted, we sit here more than halfway through the year with both our year-to-date performance and updated outlook better than we expected. Core FFO per share was $4.28 for the second quarter, representing 11.5% growth year-over-year, excluding the contribution from PS Business Parks. Looking at the key components for the quarter. Same-store revenues increased 6.3% as we drove record move-in growth. Our existing tenant base continues to perform well, and these trends continued into July with the year-over-year occupancy gap narrowing to 130 basis points at month-end. Same-store cost of operations were up 5.2%, leading to 6.6% stabilized same-store net operating income growth at a direct operating margin exceeding 80%.  In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities continues to be a standout, with net operating income increasing 20% year-over-year. These 544 properties and more than 50 million square feet comprise 25% of our total portfolio and are an engine of growth. And this pool will grow further with the addition of the Simply Self Storage acquisition. Shifting to guidance. We once again lifted our outlook for the year, primarily driven by a 50-basis point increase to the low end of our same-store revenue growth guidance, reflecting outperformance to date and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year. We also lifted our non-same-store NOI expectation by $40 million at the midpoint to primarily reflect outperformance and improved outlook and also to incorporate the impact of the Simply acquisition. Interest expense expectations increased accordingly. Our outlook for the non-same-store pool beyond 2023 improved as well. We lifted our expectations for incremental NOI stabilization from $80 million to $190 million to reflect outperformance to date, stronger future expectations, and the Simply acquisition. And last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remain rock solid. We refinanced our untapped line of credit in June, tripling its size to $1.5 billion, and as Joe mentioned, fully funded the $2.2 billion Simply acquisition in the unsecured bond market immediately following the announcement. We're well positioned with a strong appetite for growth, coupled with the ability to execute upon the opportunity.  Now I'll turn the call back to Shelby to open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Goldsmith : Good morning, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. The guidance for the full year implies a pretty material slowdown in the back half of the year with potential for same-store revenue growth and same-store NOI growth to turn negative in the fourth quarter. So, what would you have to see from the input of revenue growth, like occupancy, move-in volume, street rates and ECRIs in order to hit the middle and bottom range of the guidance, and if you see these as realistic or conservative scenarios? Thanks.\nTom Boyle : Sure. Thanks, Michael. It's a good question with lots of components. So maybe taking a step back, we've been consistent throughout the year providing investors and analysts with a range of\u2026 [Technical Difficulty] in terms of the different components of the outlook, I've been consistent that the upper end of that outlook encapsulates an environment where we experienced a soft landing. And as we move through the year, the probability of that soft landing has increased. As we think about the assumptions that are baked into the lower end, that is more of a tougher macroeconomic environment. And in particular, we're assuming [Technical Difficulty] I think about the midpoint. The same-store growth moderates but starts to stabilize. In that midpoint outcome, it does encapsulate a negative outcome in the fourth quarter for same-store revenue growth. But again, easier comps help and start to stabilize. And from an overall FFO standpoint, the midpoint is certainly aided by continued standout growth from the non-same-store pool of properties there as well. So again, a range of outcomes embedded within our out. [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Please stand by. Your conference will begin momentarily. Thank you for your patience in holding. To our site on hold, we appreciate your patience and ask that you continue to standby. Your conference will begin in a few moments.\nRyan Burke : Hi. Shelby, this is Ryan Burke from Public Storage. Trying to get through to you to resume the call. Are you hearing us?\nOperator: Absolutely. Yes, sir. You're coming in loud and clear, and your conference may continue.\nRyan Burke : Thank you, Shelby, and apologies to everybody if you're hearing us. We've had some technical difficulties. We're hoping that we're through those at this point. Shelby, if we could go back to Q&A, we would appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our next question from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Your line is open.  And I'm hearing no response, we will move to the next question. We'll take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Your line is open.  Hearing no response, moving on to the next question. We'll take our next question from Samir Khanal with Evercore. [Operator Instructions].\nSamir Khanal : Hi, good morning, Jo and Tom. Can you talk about what you're seeing in July, maybe move-in rates and demand trends, and if anything, on the customer side, given some of the price increases? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: Yes. Great question, Samir. So, in July, we've seen largely continuing trends from the second quarter. So, as we think about the different components of customer activity, we saw a good move-in volume growth, call it, 7% or 8% above prior year. Move-in rent's down a similar kind of down 14% as we sit here in July. Move-outs have begun to moderate, again, as we talked about. Easing comps as we move into the second part of the year. Move-outs are up about 4% in July, ultimately leading to that occupancy gap closing, again, as I mentioned earlier, down to -- down 130 basis points at the end of July. There's a couple of points I'd highlight about July. One is we've talked about how comps in the first half of the year are more challenging. And I think from a move-in rate standpoint, we do believe July is really the point in time where those comps are the most challenging and should ease up from here. And so, as you think about the different pathways for growth going forward, we're anticipating that move-in rate declines year-over-year start to moderate. In terms of existing tenant performance, continues to be quite strong. And the length of stays within the customer base, we're at records through the second quarter. Some of the activity we're seeing to date mathematically is likely to bring that average length of stay down a little bit, given the significant amounts of new customers that we're adding to the pool year-to-date. But the core longer-term customer base, be it greater than one year or greater than two years, continues to perform quite well throughout the summer here.\nSamir Khanal : And then just talking about maybe given the LA market is a big market for you, it was still solid. I mean, don't get me wrong but sort of like maybe decelerate a little bit from the first quarter. I know the restrictions have been lifted there. So maybe just talk around kind of the trends you're seeing in that market as we kind of think through maybe the next sort of six months to 12 months.\nJoseph Russell : Yes, Samir. The LA market continues to serve us well. We clearly have a very strong position here with north of 200 properties, excellent locations. We've completely rebranded the portfolio through a POT effort. And with that, we've continued even outside of lifting the restrictions that we were burdened by for over three years, we still got good opportunity to drive revenue and strong occupancy, still very good top of funnel demand. It's well documented. There's very little supply that has or will come into that market by virtue of lack of land sites, cost of new development, et cetera. So, we're well positioned and feel very confident that, that market is going to continue to perform well. Tom can give you a little bit more color on how we're looking at the horizon based on the fact that we've certainly gone through a wave of recovering, to some degree, the amount of pricing power that we did not have for that three-year period. But we still feel confident that the market itself is going to perform quite well.\nTom Boyle : Yes. And specifically, if you remember, Samir, last year, we talked about 150 basis point to 200 basis points of same-store revenue benefit because of the expiration of those restrictions. This year, it's more like 50 basis points to 100 basis points. And the deceleration that you're seeing through 2023 is really attributable to the fact that this year, we're facing comps where we were playing catch-up on customers last year. And so that market is expected to continue to moderate its growth because of those comps. But overall, as Joe mentioned, fundamentals in the marketplace remain quite strong. And frankly, it's not just an LA phenomenon either, if you look at San Diego, that's one of our top markets as well. Southern California performing well through 2023 for Public Storage today.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nTodd Thomas: Can you hear me okay?\nJoseph Russell : We can. Thank you for checking. Hopefully, you can hear us.\nTodd Thomas: Yes, loud and clear. I wanted to ask about the occupancy build in 2Q and -- which was a little bit more muted than it has been in prior spring and summer seasons, and it sounds like the year-over-year occupancy gaps narrowed a bit further in July, which is positive. And Tom, you mentioned July is a tough comp. But as we think about the seasonality of the business, do you think that the peak rental season, particularly this year has a little bit less weight than it has in prior years and prior cycles in your view? And does the lower seasonality in the spring and summer mean that you might expect to have less seasonality around Labor Day and sort of through fall and winter in the back half of the year?\nTom Boyle : Yes, that's a great question, Todd. I think stepping back, we haven't had a typical demand year since 2019, and we could debate whether 2019 was one as well. Every year has had its unique attributes given what we've all lived through over the last several years. And certainly, 2023 is no different than that. This year, some of the factors at play, certainly the housing market is one that I would highlight. And we've been highlighting for some time the existing home sales volumes declining, having an impact on some of the seasonal demand that we would oftentimes see in a May, June, and July time period, we're not seeing as much of this year. And I do think that, that's one of the primary reasons for the difference in occupancy build as we move through the year. That said, we've continued to see very good move-in volumes, as we've highlighted already on the call. And that's being made up by renter activity by folks that continue to run out of space at home, which is also somewhat tied to people not selling their existing homes. And so, we feel good about the level of new customers that we're acquiring today but it is a different year. And then maybe to your second part of your question around how does that impact our thoughts on the second half, I think because of how the first year has played out and that demand dynamic, we would anticipate that we'd probably see a little bit less of a seasonal decline in occupancy as we move through the year, which is likely to lead to continued modest closing of the occupancy gap year-over-year as we move through the year.\nJoseph Russell : And just to highlight a couple of other things, Todd, the seasonality predictable components are shifting. And what you have to be in an environment like this is quite nimble and to interpret what effects or counter-affects you may have or be able to deploy as the traditional seasonality theories or events are shifting. And to Tom's point, since 2019, we've learned all kinds of different range of impacts, whether it's tied directly to housing, hybrid work-from-home environments. I can tell you maybe the one consistent predictable driver is just college, and that too got upended during the pandemic. That seems to be back so there's a little bit of movement that we think we can predict there. But the good news is with our platform and our ability to interpret changing demand factors, we're actually able to maneuver through what would be, as Tom pointed out, less predictability around seasonality, but at the same time, we're seeing very good customer demand driven by even new and additional factors, many of which seem to be deep-seated and are likely to be with us for some period of time.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And so, Tom, I guess just in terms of the revised guidance, I mean, does that account for lower seasonality in the second half of the year, less move-out activity than you would ordinarily see in terms of occupancy loss through Labor Day in the back half of the year? And then the last piece here, I guess with less rental activity driven by moving activity related to the housing market, do you feel that you have sort of a healthier, longer staying customer in the portfolio today?\nTom Boyle : So, first component of your question there, we're adding them up here, is yes. So, the outlook is -- does incorporate what I highlighted earlier. The second component of your question is also a good one to highlight, and that is that customers that have moved in year-to-date are exhibiting longer length of stay attributes because of what you're highlighting and what Joe highlighted around the use cases for storage. So consistently, kind of each month's cohort of move-ins are performing better than prior year, which is encouraging as you think about the tenant base and the durability of revenue heading through '23 and into '24.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJeff Spector : Thank you. I just wanted to, I guess, go through your -- the comments on record move-ins, better-than-expected first half, and tie this into some of the concerns, let's say, going back to at least last year and the follow-on weaker street rate. Like how do you explain the dynamic and how you're thinking about it? You're mentioning you're bringing in the right customers, it sounds like, through June, but private continue to compete on lower street rates. So how should we think about that dynamic? And again, there's this concern that it will eventually impact your ability to push on existing but that existing customer continues to exhibit great behavior. So, it is a bit confusing.\nTom Boyle : All right. Jeff, there's a good number of parts to that question, too. Let's take them one by one. So, to your point around good move-in volume, as Joe highlighted earlier, we think the tools that we have are working quite well. We run a very granular and dynamic pricing and advertising process, and our ops team is built to drive move-in volumes, paired with our digital ecosystem that Joe spoke to. We think the customers are reacting quite well to. So, all of that, combined with our brand, I think it's certainly helping drive good move-in volumes. I think your point specifically on move-in rate, there's a couple of components there. One is, no question that the industry overall, as there's been more vacancy through last year and into this year, has lowered rental rates, and it's a very competitive environment for new customers today. We feel like, as I noted, we're getting good customers and a good volume of them, but the rents are lower than what they were in the prior year, down about 14% in the second quarter. To give you context, in the second quarter, our rents were about a couple percent above our competitors within the trade areas. So, we're largely charging what our competitors are charging in the marketplace but seeing very good volume and traction associated with that. It is certainly one of the components that drives the deceleration of revenue growth as we moved through last fall and through the beginning part of this year. And I noted earlier that as we sit here today, the comps do start to ease, and we think the July print could be the trough as we move through the year, and that's embedded in our outlook as we look through the second half of the year. But overall, that's certainly been a drag to revenue growth but should be a stabilizing factor as we move forward. The third component to your question related to its impact on existing tenant rate increases. And that's something we've been very consistent in speaking about. We like to talk about it in two components. One is how is the customer base performing. And as I've noted in prior calls, the existing customer base continues to perform quite well. So, the length of stays of the longer-term tenants, one-year, two-year-plus continue to be strong. Delinquencies are below pre-pandemic levels and they are accepting of our rental rate increases. The thing that has changed over the past two years is what it is to replace those tenants when they move out. And so that's the second component, the replacement cost of those tenants if they move. And that has certainly flipped from -- in certain markets, there was actually a benefit to replace those tenants in certain prior years. And this year, it's certainly a cost to replace, again going back to what you highlighted, which is move-in rental rates lower year-over-year. That's led to lower magnitude and lower frequency of increases through the start of 2023, but no real change there as we sit here in July versus what we would have told you in February on that point.\nJeff Spector : Okay, very helpful. And if I could ask, given I'm getting a few incoming to repeat your first answer to the first question kind of on the back half guidance. I think we missed a lot of that answer. And maybe I would just try to clarify that the bottom end of guidance, does that still reflect -- it sounds like it still reflects that recessionary scenario?\nTom Boyle : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. And bummer that you couldn't hear my first response, but I'll go at it for attempt number two. Hopefully, this works. So, the outlook as we move through the year, we've now raised it 2 times. And we highlighted earlier, that's because of better-than-expected performance year-to-date as well as improved outlook for the second half of the year. We've been consistent since February and speaking about the outlook as a relatively wide range of potential outcomes. And that's driven by a combination of an uncertain macro environment, which we're all still living in day-to-day as well as a consumer backdrop that is -- that continues to shift, obviously, impacted by that macro line. At the lower end of our guidance does encapsulate the potential that the Fed doesn't quite stick the landing here in the second half of the year. It doesn't have as much of an impact on 2023 as what it may have on 2024, which is certainly leading to improved outlook at the lower end. But there's certainly that possibility that the consumer weakens, longer-term length of stay customers start to vacate at a higher frequency. Again, something we're not seeing today but could play out as we move through the year and would be typical in a tougher macro environment. And a still competitive move-in environment, which the point earlier, is something that we've seen year-to-date, a very competitive move-in environment. The flip side, though, is also fair, which is we continue to think that there's a good potential for a soft landing and a continued strong performance from the existing tenant base, the easing of comps in the second half, which would lead to the higher end of that range as well. So again, a good performance year-to-date. The outlook's improving as we move through the second half, but we do still encapsulate that broad range of potential outcomes here.\nJeff Spector : Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Your line is open.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. Can you guys hear me?\nJoseph Russell : We can. Thanks, Spenser, for being patient.\nSpenser Allaway: No problem. So, apologies if this was covered, but marketing spend [indiscernible] up this quarter and that's understandable, given you weren't spending much in '22. But just curious if you can talk about the absolute customer acquisition costs and how does that trend -- or how is that trending, sorry, versus historic norms?\nTom Boyle : Yes. Thanks, Spenser. So, you noted clearly high year-over-year growth in marketing spend because we didn't really spend last year. I think one way to look at it that we track through time periods is the percentage of marketing spend as a percentage of revenue. And in the second quarter, I believe that was about 1.7% of revenue. And that's a good bit below pre-pandemic averages that were in the 2% to 3% range. If you think about overall customer acquisition costs are frankly attractive, which is one of the reasons why we continue to use that tool, along with the other tools in our toolkit to drive good move-in volume, and we're seeing very good response from that. So, we'll continue to use marketing spend as a component of the customer acquisition toolkit and have an ability to continue to spend there if we get good return.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay, great. And then you commented that you were receiving a high volume of inbound calls as it relates to potential deal activity. Can you just comment on the \u201822 assets that were acquired in 2Q and 3Q? Where do you inbounds? And then how much activity are you guys kind of seeing in 3Q outside of the Simply deal?\nJoseph Russell : Yes. Sure, Spenser. Year-to-date, from a sector standpoint, the amount of transaction volume is pretty similar to what we saw in 2022. So, I would tell you, to your point, there are a number of more inbound calls coming to us. Many of the owners coming into the market are looking for a different level of commitment and a surety that a close can take place. Clearly, with the lending environment not only from availability capital, the cost of capital, a number of traditional or otherwise active buyers in past years are not as active or capable as they would be today. So that gives us a leg up. As I mentioned, we are hearing, time and again, we're an acquirer of choice. We've got a very unique opportunity to continue to execute very effectively. Just as we did, obviously, on a very large scale with the Simply deal. We typically know an asset quite well in the market position. It's at -- again, have very efficient discussions with the existing owner, whether it's a one-off transaction or a portfolio. So, we're using that opportunity and we're being contacted more directly by virtue of the fact that there's much more surety of close, and we can be very effective and efficient and it's been a good window for us. So many of the deals, to your question, that came through were along those lines. We're still doing traditional marketed opportunities where the economics and the quality of the asset makes sense. One of the things that's fresh, 10 days now post announcement of the Simply deal, we are getting some additional inbounds knowing, again, the effectiveness that played through on a $2.2 billion acquisition. And that plays through, again, whether it's a one-off deal or a much smaller portfolio, that continues to be good bread-and-butter growth and acquisition opportunity for us, and the team continues to be busy. As typical this time of year, next quarter or so is typically the more active time of year for transaction opportunities, so we're going to continue to stay focused on that, and we feel we're in a very good spot.\nSpenser Allaway: Thanks, so much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose : Hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask, it sounds like from your remarks that you were able to come to a decision very quickly on the decision to acquire the Simply portfolio. And I was just wondering how you would compare maybe some of the opportunities you saw with that acquisition versus your original proposed acquisition of the Life Storage portfolio.\nJoseph Russell : Well, Smedes, very different processes and M&A opportunities got a whole different level of complexity and moving parts than maybe a traditional private opportunity. Speaking more directly to the Simply transaction, that was a process where it was a market or a deal that was brought to the market through their own advisory. And so, there was a process that Blackstone went through to bring the portfolio to the market. Because of its size and -- the portfolio has been in place for nearly 20 years, we knew it quite well. We had understood and studied the evolution of the portfolio, so we had very good and crisp knowledge of the portfolio going into that process that was set up by Blackstone. So again, very good opportunity for us to look at a portfolio of that size, integrate it very effectively. As I mentioned, we're about 10 days into the process right now, and we expect to close in the middle of September. By all accounts, the integration opportunity looks every bit, if not more, compelling than it was when we announced the deal. So very confident about our ability to integrate the 127 assets and the 25 properties that are in the third-party management platform. So, feel good about the ability to allocate capital of that size. In a private transaction market, this is the largest deal that's been done since roughly the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022 if you think about the timing of Manhattan Mini. But we're very confident that it's a very strong ability in our to allocate capital, get very strong returns, and integrate those assets very quickly.\nSmedes Rose : And then I just wanted to make sure, the $190 million of the non-same-store contribution you called out, that includes the Simply execution?\nJoseph Russell : Yes, it does.\nTom Boyle : Yes, it does.\nSmedes Rose : Okay, thank you.\nTom Boyle : Thanks, Smedes.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria : Just curious on the investment side, and the balance sheet, kind of marrying those two areas together. You used a lot of the dry powder here on simply, and the accretion was modest kind of initially. So, just curious how we should think about what the remaining capacity is and what kind of cap rates or yield expectations going into deploying that kind of precious capital.\nTom Boyle : Yes. Well, happy to take that. As we looked at underwriting the Simply portfolio, we viewed it as an attractive real estate transaction really across any way that you underwrite it or you think about the cost of capital. As we've spoken about in the past, we view things on an unlevered basis despite the fact, certainly in prior years, we've used leverage in order to acquire assets very quickly. We look at things on an unlevered basis and real estate level returns as well as basis. We view the Simply transaction as an attractive one. Your comment around accretion, we grew the asset base by about 4%, and we're anticipating growing FFO by 1%. That's a pretty good ratio. And our leverage at the time was 3.3 times. We increased it to 3.8 times, which is a good bit below our long-term target of 4 times to 5 times, which gives us still significant capacity to grow for the right sorts of transactions. As Joe highlighted, we're poised to do that. To give you context, I think post-transaction, we have over $5 billion of capacity to continue to grow towards the higher end of that long-term target of ours. So, still have a very good bit of capacity and are actively seeking good real estate opportunities to grow the platform.\nJuan Sanabria : Just as my follow-up, you made comments earlier that given the more modest peak leasing season experienced to date, that you would expect a softer kind of get-back or decel in the back half. But just curious if there's any thought to maybe the opposite actually holding true, that because you didn't see a steeper climb during the peak leasing season that, that portends something weaker, and whether it's the consumer or the housing that it's laying under the surface that may see an actually a bigger get-back than normal. Just curious on that -- those thoughts there.\nTom Boyle : Sure, Juan. I mean, we've walked through now the range of potential outcomes, and so, we do think we have a wide range encapsulated in our outlook. My comments around our belief that we don't see as big of an occupancy decline is really driven by the fact that we didn't see the seasonal demand that typically can be a shorter length of stay. And I highlighted earlier that our customers that have moved into date have been longer lengths of stay, which supports less move-out activity through the second half of the year. Ultimately, we'll have to see how the year plays out. And we've given you some guideposts as to what that looks like throughout our outlook range and feel like we're very well-positioned to navigate through the environment in the second half.\nJuan Sanabria : Thank tom. Thank you very much. \nTom Boyle : Thanks, man.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Your line is open.  And hearing no response, moving to the next question. We'll take our next question from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hearing no response, moving to the next question. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Goldsmith : As my second question, kind of on the occupancy and kind of the churn of the portfolio through the quarter. Occupancy at the end of March was 92.8%, end of May was 93.1%, and end of June was 93.2%. But the average occupancy in the second quarter was 93.7%, which is higher than all of that. So, does that mean that there's elevated churn within the portfolio? And how do you think about the potential loss of some of these high-quality, high-rate customers that have been driving the growth of your portfolio in an environment where maybe there's a little bit more elevated churn?\nTom Boyle : Yes. Thanks, Michael. A couple of components there. One, churn is actually improving on a year-over-year basis as we move through the year. And you can see that in year-over-year move-out volume growth in the first quarter compared to the second quarter. And then I highlighted in July, the move-out volume's only up 4% year-over-year. So, continue to see good behavior from the tenant base. Highlighted earlier that length of stays from new customers that have moved in have been attractive. And so, we feel good about the customer base overall and easier comps as we move through the year on normalization of churn from that tenant base playing out. As you think about the occupancy lift and the difference between the average and the period end, that's going to be consistently the case because of how we operate the portfolio month in, and month out, our average occupancy or occupancy peaks in the middle of the month, and then we typically see more move-out activity towards the back half of the month, which lowers occupancy. That's the case month in, and month out. And so, nothing concerning there. You can interpret the lift in average and the lift in the period end as occupancy was higher through those periods, i.e., higher in June than it was in May.\nMichael Goldsmith : Got it. And just from the first quarter to the second quarter, same-store revenue growth stepped down by 350 basis points to 6.3%. As we move through the rest of the year, does the step-downs get smaller? And does that reflect just like the comparisons getting easier? I'm just trying to better understand the cadence of the step-down as you guys see it.\nTom Boyle : Okay, good question Michael. The cadence of the step-downs will begin to ease and I think, we've highlighted that the comps really start to ease in September, October. And so, as we move through, I highlighted earlier, comps are actually quite challenging as we sit here in July and we would anticipate the comps do ease as we move through the back half of the year. And so, embedded in that range of outlooks is obviously a differing range of moderation of that deceleration rate but would anticipate that comps help, but particularly in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.\nMichael Goldsmith : Got it. Good luck in the back half.\nTom Boyle : Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. [Operator Instructions] Hearing no response, moving on to the next question. We'll take our next question from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim : Hi, can you hear me?\nJoseph Russell : Yes.\nTom Boyle : Yes.\nKi Bin Kim : Yes, thank you. So, your move-in rates increased about 5.5% sequentially going into 2Q. I'm just curious like when you look at say, whatever you want to call it, a normal year, how does that 5.5% increase compare?\nTom Boyle : Yes, Ki Bin, that is a little bit lower of an increase than what you typically see. Typically, in a seasonal year, you'd see more occupancy lift, and associated with that more occupancy lift, you see more pricing power. And in a typical year, you'd see more like low teens difference between the end of the year and the midpoint of the year. And so, if you think about first to second quarter comparison, it's probably upper single digits full first quarter versus full second quarter increase. So, a little bit softer but along the same themes that we've been speaking about with a little bit less seasonal demand, in particular, in the second quarter.\nKi Bin Kim : Okay. And in terms of your $450 million CapEx guidance for the year, obviously, when you look back historically, it was under $300 million in 2021, and under $100 million pretty much every year before that. So, I'm just curious like how many more years of this newer and more elevated CapEx should we think about versus returning back to something that's more approaching from a historical level?\nJoseph Russell : Yes, Ki Bin. A couple of moving parts there. So, we're 3/4 of the way through our $600 million Property of Tomorrow initiative. We're targeting the end of 2024. It may taper in the part of 2025 to get the full portfolio completed so that spending will continue through that time period. The other additional but very effective component of that program that we're going to continue to invest on top of the easing down of just that spend tied to the Property of Tomorrow program is solar. So, we're putting more additional dollars into our solar initiatives in many, many markets. Our goal is to get north of 1,000 properties to some level of solar orientation, which would include just the property needs itself. And you may have seen yesterday, we made an announcement relative to what we're doing with community solar in certain markets. That's a program that's continued to grow as well. So, with that, Tom, you can give a little color on what we're seeing relative to outlook relative to spend on a year-over-year basis. But for those factors, we've still got a couple more years of elevated capital spend.\nTom Boyle : Yes. And I think to Joe's point, the Property of Tomorrow spend, when we wrap up that program will go away. The spend on solar, we think, is a very good opportunity. To Joe's point, we're getting mid-teens IRRs on the capital we're investing in that program, and we've got a lot of opportunity there. And at the end of the year, we're targeting having solar on about 500 properties, with the expectation of getting over 1,000 properties over the next several years. So, a lot of opportunity there that will be capital spent but also with a good return associated with it.\nKi Bin Kim : Okay, thank you.\nTom Boyle : Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeegan Carl : Can you guys hear me?\nJoseph Russell : We can.\nKeegan Carl: Helpful. All right, cool. So, annual contract rent per square foot in the same-store pool is up 7.1% year-over-year. Just looking for some more color on the ECRI program. What rate increase are you sending out? And what are your plans on it for the back half of the year?\nTom Boyle : Yes. Keegan, as I highlighted earlier on a question when we think about the existing tenant rate increase program as the two components of existing tenant performance and behavior as well as the replacement cost, the existing tenants continue to perform well. So, we're healthy increases to that tenant base, but the magnitude of those increases are less than the prior year, and the frequencies are less as well. But still sending increases and they're being accepted by that tenant base, which is helping to drive that rental rate performance that you saw through the first half.\nKeegan Carl: Is that a fair assumption then for the back half of the year that, that continues to moderate?\nTom Boyle : I'd say that because of everything I highlighted earlier around rental rate comps as well as occupancy through the year, and the churn rates, that we'd anticipate it's pretty similar as what we saw through the first half.\nKeegan Carl: Okay. And then shifting gears to your third-party management platform. You guys added 16 net stores in the quarter. Just curious, one, what you're seeing out there in the market today. And two, on the back of extra space acquiring Life Storage, are you seeing any new customers from that portfolio come to you?\nJoseph Russell : Yes, Keegan. We added, actually, 23 properties in the quarter. And then one was taken out of the platform by virtue of being sold to another party. So, the program now is at 215 assets. We're still seeing a dominant factor play through relative to properties typically coming into the platform through development processes. We've got, I think, a whole host of encouraging conversations and relationships that we're developing on that side of the business. We'll certainly welcome and entertain any existing assets, and any other platform as we always do. If they're flagged in another third-party management platform, public or private, from time to time, there's some pretty unique opportunities, whether it is, as you're asking, relative to a portfolio changing hands that might have a third-party management component to it or not, but we've got very good traction in the program. We've got a very good offering, and we're seeing the opportunity to continue to grow it.\nKeegan Carl: Thanks for that.\nJoseph Russell : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Mueller : Can you hear me this time?\nJoseph Russell : We can, Mike. Thanks for trying again.\nMichael Mueller : Yes, I had no clue if you talked about this already. I basically dropped at 12:40 and dialed back in because I had silence. But could you talk about the percentage of customers in place for over a year and two years and if you're seeing any notable changes to those pool sizes?\nJoseph Russell : No, that's not been asked. [indiscernible] question, give you some color.\nTom Boyle : So, we continue to see very good performance from our longer length of stay customers, that customers have been with us for longer than two years, for instance, as a percentage of the tenant base is in the low 40s, which is up still 5%, 6% compared to what it was pre-pandemic. So, continue to see very strong composition as well as performance from that group. The newer tenants continue to cycle in. I highlighted earlier that we're actually likely to start talking about a potential that the overall average length of stay starts to moderate because we're getting so many new good customers that are coming into the platform, which are going to bring that average down. But overall, the longer-term tenants continue to be solid and a good bit above pre-pandemic norms. And the new customers that we're acquiring are also experiencing better length of stay trends on a year-over-year basis.\nMichael Mueller : Got it okay great thank you.\nTom Boyle : Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria : Hey. A quick follow-up. On the ECRI question, I just wanted to confirm, has the pace or cadence of increases declined at all year-to-date from your initial expectations to start the year or is that holding steady?\nTom Boyle : Juan, it's holding steady. There's some seasonal factors which I won't quite get into, but generally speaking, on plan and consistent with expectations.\nJuan Sanabria : Okay, great. And then just one more, if you could humor me. So, what does the guidance range imply for the kind of fourth quarter or exit run rate? Just trying to think about the decel Layering into easier comps in the fall.\nTom Boyle : Yes. So again, the outlook encapsulates the range. The low end of the range is a tougher macro environment. No question, that would likely lead to same-store revenue growth dipping into negative territory at the lower end there. At the higher end, we would anticipate that same-store revenue growth remains positive. Again, those easier comps lead to a stabilization through the second half of the year and exiting in that manner. Obviously, the midpoint is in between there. I think the midpoint does touch negative in the fourth quarter, and certainly positive in the third quarter. But again, we'll update you on performance through that range as we move through the year. We've been encouraged year-to-date on performance, and we'll continue to update you on where we end up through the year.\nJuan Sanabria : Thank you for being patient.\nTom Boyle : Thanks, Juan. Thank you for being patient.\nOperator: And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Burke : Thank you, Shelby, and thanks once again to all of you for your patience today on the technical difficulties. We appreciate it. We hope you have a good rest of the week and into the weekend.\nOperator: That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. As Joe highlighted, we sit here more than halfway through the year with both our year-to-date performance and updated outlook better than we expected. Core FFO per share was $4.28 for the second quarter, representing 11.5% growth year-over-year, excluding the contribution from PS Business Parks. Looking at the key components for the quarter. Same-store revenues increased 6.3% as we drove record move-in growth. Our existing tenant base continues to perform well, and these trends continued into July with the year-over-year occupancy gap narrowing to 130 basis points at month-end. Same-store cost of operations were up 5.2%, leading to 6.6% stabilized same-store net operating income growth at a direct operating margin exceeding 80%.  In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities continues to be a standout, with net operating income increasing 20% year-over-year. These 544 properties and more than 50 million square feet comprise 25% of our total portfolio and are an engine of growth. And this pool will grow further with the addition of the Simply Self Storage acquisition. Shifting to guidance. We once again lifted our outlook for the year, primarily driven by a 50-basis point increase to the low end of our same-store revenue growth guidance, reflecting outperformance to date and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year. We also lifted our non-same-store NOI expectation by $40 million at the midpoint to primarily reflect outperformance and improved outlook and also to incorporate the impact of the Simply acquisition. Interest expense expectations increased accordingly. Our outlook for the non-same-store pool beyond 2023 improved as well. We lifted our expectations for incremental NOI stabilization from $80 million to $190 million to reflect outperformance to date, stronger future expectations, and the Simply acquisition. And last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remain rock solid. We refinanced our untapped line of credit in June, tripling its size to $1.5 billion, and as Joe mentioned, fully funded the $2.2 billion Simply acquisition in the unsecured bond market immediately following the announcement. We're well positioned with a strong appetite for growth, coupled with the ability to execute upon the opportunity.  Now I'll turn the call back to Shelby to open it up for questions. Sure. Thanks, Michael. It's a good question with lots of components. So maybe taking a step back, we've been consistent throughout the year providing investors and analysts with a range of... [Technical Difficulty] in terms of the different components of the outlook, I've been consistent that the upper end of that outlook encapsulates an environment where we experienced a soft landing. And as we move through the year, the probability of that soft landing has increased. As we think about the assumptions that are baked into the lower end, that is more of a tougher macroeconomic environment. And in particular, we're assuming [Technical Difficulty] I think about the midpoint. The same-store growth moderates but starts to stabilize. In that midpoint outcome, it does encapsulate a negative outcome in the fourth quarter for same-store revenue growth. But again, easier comps help and start to stabilize. And from an overall FFO standpoint, the midpoint is certainly aided by continued standout growth from the non-same-store pool of properties there as well. So again, a range of outcomes embedded within our out. [Technical Difficulty] Yes. Great question, Samir. So, in July, we've seen largely continuing trends from the second quarter. So, as we think about the different components of customer activity, we saw a good move-in volume growth, call it, 7% or 8% above prior year. Move-in rent's down a similar kind of down 14% as we sit here in July. Move-outs have begun to moderate, again, as we talked about. Easing comps as we move into the second part of the year. Move-outs are up about 4% in July, ultimately leading to that occupancy gap closing, again, as I mentioned earlier, down to -- down 130 basis points at the end of July. There's a couple of points I'd highlight about July. One is we've talked about how comps in the first half of the year are more challenging. And I think from a move-in rate standpoint, we do believe July is really the point in time where those comps are the most challenging and should ease up from here. And so, as you think about the different pathways for growth going forward, we're anticipating that move-in rate declines year-over-year start to moderate. In terms of existing tenant performance, continues to be quite strong. And the length of stays within the customer base, we're at records through the second quarter. Some of the activity we're seeing to date mathematically is likely to bring that average length of stay down a little bit, given the significant amounts of new customers that we're adding to the pool year-to-date. But the core longer-term customer base, be it greater than one year or greater than two years, continues to perform quite well throughout the summer here. Yes. And specifically, if you remember, Samir, last year, we talked about 150 basis point to 200 basis points of same-store revenue benefit because of the expiration of those restrictions. This year, it's more like 50 basis points to 100 basis points. And the deceleration that you're seeing through 2023 is really attributable to the fact that this year, we're facing comps where we were playing catch-up on customers last year. And so that market is expected to continue to moderate its growth because of those comps. But overall, as Joe mentioned, fundamentals in the marketplace remain quite strong. And frankly, it's not just an LA phenomenon either, if you look at San Diego, that's one of our top markets as well. Southern California performing well through 2023 for Public Storage today. Yes, that's a great question, Todd. I think stepping back, we haven't had a typical demand year since 2019, and we could debate whether 2019 was one as well. Every year has had its unique attributes given what we've all lived through over the last several years. And certainly, 2023 is no different than that. This year, some of the factors at play, certainly the housing market is one that I would highlight. And we've been highlighting for some time the existing home sales volumes declining, having an impact on some of the seasonal demand that we would oftentimes see in a May, June, and July time period, we're not seeing as much of this year. And I do think that, that's one of the primary reasons for the difference in occupancy build as we move through the year. That said, we've continued to see very good move-in volumes, as we've highlighted already on the call. And that's being made up by renter activity by folks that continue to run out of space at home, which is also somewhat tied to people not selling their existing homes. And so, we feel good about the level of new customers that we're acquiring today but it is a different year. And then maybe to your second part of your question around how does that impact our thoughts on the second half, I think because of how the first year has played out and that demand dynamic, we would anticipate that we'd probably see a little bit less of a seasonal decline in occupancy as we move through the year, which is likely to lead to continued modest closing of the occupancy gap year-over-year as we move through the year. So, first component of your question there, we're adding them up here, is yes. So, the outlook is -- does incorporate what I highlighted earlier. The second component of your question is also a good one to highlight, and that is that customers that have moved in year-to-date are exhibiting longer length of stay attributes because of what you're highlighting and what Joe highlighted around the use cases for storage. So consistently, kind of each month's cohort of move-ins are performing better than prior year, which is encouraging as you think about the tenant base and the durability of revenue heading through '23 and into '24. All right. Jeff, there's a good number of parts to that question, too. Let's take them one by one. So, to your point around good move-in volume, as Joe highlighted earlier, we think the tools that we have are working quite well. We run a very granular and dynamic pricing and advertising process, and our ops team is built to drive move-in volumes, paired with our digital ecosystem that Joe spoke to. We think the customers are reacting quite well to. So, all of that, combined with our brand, I think it's certainly helping drive good move-in volumes. I think your point specifically on move-in rate, there's a couple of components there. One is, no question that the industry overall, as there's been more vacancy through last year and into this year, has lowered rental rates, and it's a very competitive environment for new customers today. We feel like, as I noted, we're getting good customers and a good volume of them, but the rents are lower than what they were in the prior year, down about 14% in the second quarter. To give you context, in the second quarter, our rents were about a couple percent above our competitors within the trade areas. So, we're largely charging what our competitors are charging in the marketplace but seeing very good volume and traction associated with that. It is certainly one of the components that drives the deceleration of revenue growth as we moved through last fall and through the beginning part of this year. And I noted earlier that as we sit here today, the comps do start to ease, and we think the July print could be the trough as we move through the year, and that's embedded in our outlook as we look through the second half of the year. But overall, that's certainly been a drag to revenue growth but should be a stabilizing factor as we move forward. The third component to your question related to its impact on existing tenant rate increases. And that's something we've been very consistent in speaking about. We like to talk about it in two components. One is how is the customer base performing. And as I've noted in prior calls, the existing customer base continues to perform quite well. So, the length of stays of the longer-term tenants, one-year, two-year-plus continue to be strong. Delinquencies are below pre-pandemic levels and they are accepting of our rental rate increases. The thing that has changed over the past two years is what it is to replace those tenants when they move out. And so that's the second component, the replacement cost of those tenants if they move. And that has certainly flipped from -- in certain markets, there was actually a benefit to replace those tenants in certain prior years. And this year, it's certainly a cost to replace, again going back to what you highlighted, which is move-in rental rates lower year-over-year. That's led to lower magnitude and lower frequency of increases through the start of 2023, but no real change there as we sit here in July versus what we would have told you in February on that point. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. And bummer that you couldn't hear my first response, but I'll go at it for attempt number two. Hopefully, this works. So, the outlook as we move through the year, we've now raised it 2 times. And we highlighted earlier, that's because of better-than-expected performance year-to-date as well as improved outlook for the second half of the year. We've been consistent since February and speaking about the outlook as a relatively wide range of potential outcomes. And that's driven by a combination of an uncertain macro environment, which we're all still living in day-to-day as well as a consumer backdrop that is -- that continues to shift, obviously, impacted by that macro line. At the lower end of our guidance does encapsulate the potential that the Fed doesn't quite stick the landing here in the second half of the year. It doesn't have as much of an impact on 2023 as what it may have on 2024, which is certainly leading to improved outlook at the lower end. But there's certainly that possibility that the consumer weakens, longer-term length of stay customers start to vacate at a higher frequency. Again, something we're not seeing today but could play out as we move through the year and would be typical in a tougher macro environment. And a still competitive move-in environment, which the point earlier, is something that we've seen year-to-date, a very competitive move-in environment. The flip side, though, is also fair, which is we continue to think that there's a good potential for a soft landing and a continued strong performance from the existing tenant base, the easing of comps in the second half, which would lead to the higher end of that range as well. So again, a good performance year-to-date. The outlook's improving as we move through the second half, but we do still encapsulate that broad range of potential outcomes here. Yes. Thanks, Spenser. So, you noted clearly high year-over-year growth in marketing spend because we didn't really spend last year. I think one way to look at it that we track through time periods is the percentage of marketing spend as a percentage of revenue. And in the second quarter, I believe that was about 1.7% of revenue. And that's a good bit below pre-pandemic averages that were in the 2% to 3% range. If you think about overall customer acquisition costs are frankly attractive, which is one of the reasons why we continue to use that tool, along with the other tools in our toolkit to drive good move-in volume, and we're seeing very good response from that. So, we'll continue to use marketing spend as a component of the customer acquisition toolkit and have an ability to continue to spend there if we get good return. Yes, it does. Thanks, Smedes. Yes. Well, happy to take that. As we looked at underwriting the Simply portfolio, we viewed it as an attractive real estate transaction really across any way that you underwrite it or you think about the cost of capital. As we've spoken about in the past, we view things on an unlevered basis despite the fact, certainly in prior years, we've used leverage in order to acquire assets very quickly. We look at things on an unlevered basis and real estate level returns as well as basis. We view the Simply transaction as an attractive one. Your comment around accretion, we grew the asset base by about 4%, and we're anticipating growing FFO by 1%. That's a pretty good ratio. And our leverage at the time was 3.3 times. We increased it to 3.8 times, which is a good bit below our long-term target of 4 times to 5 times, which gives us still significant capacity to grow for the right sorts of transactions. As Joe highlighted, we're poised to do that. To give you context, I think post-transaction, we have over $5 billion of capacity to continue to grow towards the higher end of that long-term target of ours. So, still have a very good bit of capacity and are actively seeking good real estate opportunities to grow the platform. Sure, Juan. I mean, we've walked through now the range of potential outcomes, and so, we do think we have a wide range encapsulated in our outlook. My comments around our belief that we don't see as big of an occupancy decline is really driven by the fact that we didn't see the seasonal demand that typically can be a shorter length of stay. And I highlighted earlier that our customers that have moved into date have been longer lengths of stay, which supports less move-out activity through the second half of the year. Ultimately, we'll have to see how the year plays out. And we've given you some guideposts as to what that looks like throughout our outlook range and feel like we're very well-positioned to navigate through the environment in the second half. Thanks, man. Yes. Thanks, Michael. A couple of components there. One, churn is actually improving on a year-over-year basis as we move through the year. And you can see that in year-over-year move-out volume growth in the first quarter compared to the second quarter. And then I highlighted in July, the move-out volume's only up 4% year-over-year. So, continue to see good behavior from the tenant base. Highlighted earlier that length of stays from new customers that have moved in have been attractive. And so, we feel good about the customer base overall and easier comps as we move through the year on normalization of churn from that tenant base playing out. As you think about the occupancy lift and the difference between the average and the period end, that's going to be consistently the case because of how we operate the portfolio month in, and month out, our average occupancy or occupancy peaks in the middle of the month, and then we typically see more move-out activity towards the back half of the month, which lowers occupancy. That's the case month in, and month out. And so, nothing concerning there. You can interpret the lift in average and the lift in the period end as occupancy was higher through those periods, i.e., higher in June than it was in May. Okay, good question Michael. The cadence of the step-downs will begin to ease and I think, we've highlighted that the comps really start to ease in September, October. And so, as we move through, I highlighted earlier, comps are actually quite challenging as we sit here in July and we would anticipate the comps do ease as we move through the back half of the year. And so, embedded in that range of outlooks is obviously a differing range of moderation of that deceleration rate but would anticipate that comps help, but particularly in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Thanks, Michael. Yes. Yes, Ki Bin, that is a little bit lower of an increase than what you typically see. Typically, in a seasonal year, you'd see more occupancy lift, and associated with that more occupancy lift, you see more pricing power. And in a typical year, you'd see more like low teens difference between the end of the year and the midpoint of the year. And so, if you think about first to second quarter comparison, it's probably upper single digits full first quarter versus full second quarter increase. So, a little bit softer but along the same themes that we've been speaking about with a little bit less seasonal demand, in particular, in the second quarter. Yes. And I think to Joe's point, the Property of Tomorrow spend, when we wrap up that program will go away. The spend on solar, we think, is a very good opportunity. To Joe's point, we're getting mid-teens IRRs on the capital we're investing in that program, and we've got a lot of opportunity there. And at the end of the year, we're targeting having solar on about 500 properties, with the expectation of getting over 1,000 properties over the next several years. So, a lot of opportunity there that will be capital spent but also with a good return associated with it. Thank you. Yes. Keegan, as I highlighted earlier on a question when we think about the existing tenant rate increase program as the two components of existing tenant performance and behavior as well as the replacement cost, the existing tenants continue to perform well. So, we're healthy increases to that tenant base, but the magnitude of those increases are less than the prior year, and the frequencies are less as well. But still sending increases and they're being accepted by that tenant base, which is helping to drive that rental rate performance that you saw through the first half. I'd say that because of everything I highlighted earlier around rental rate comps as well as occupancy through the year, and the churn rates, that we'd anticipate it's pretty similar as what we saw through the first half. So, we continue to see very good performance from our longer length of stay customers, that customers have been with us for longer than two years, for instance, as a percentage of the tenant base is in the low 40s, which is up still 5%, 6% compared to what it was pre-pandemic. So, continue to see very strong composition as well as performance from that group. The newer tenants continue to cycle in. I highlighted earlier that we're actually likely to start talking about a potential that the overall average length of stay starts to moderate because we're getting so many new good customers that are coming into the platform, which are going to bring that average down. But overall, the longer-term tenants continue to be solid and a good bit above pre-pandemic norms. And the new customers that we're acquiring are also experiencing better length of stay trends on a year-over-year basis. Thanks, Michael. Juan, it's holding steady. There's some seasonal factors which I won't quite get into, but generally speaking, on plan and consistent with expectations. Yes. So again, the outlook encapsulates the range. The low end of the range is a tougher macro environment. No question, that would likely lead to same-store revenue growth dipping into negative territory at the lower end there. At the higher end, we would anticipate that same-store revenue growth remains positive. Again, those easier comps lead to a stabilization through the second half of the year and exiting in that manner. Obviously, the midpoint is in between there. I think the midpoint does touch negative in the fourth quarter, and certainly positive in the third quarter. But again, we'll update you on performance through that range as we move through the year. We've been encouraged year-to-date on performance, and we'll continue to update you on where we end up through the year. Thanks, Juan. Thank you for being patient."

            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us today. As demonstrated by our second quarter performance and raised outlook for the year, Public Storage continues to maximize its competitive advantages across our platform with several key factors driving positive results, including a better-than-expected macro environment with higher odds of a soft landing; increased rental activity from our needs-oriented customer base; and execution across all aspects of our industry-leading platform. We are built to operate in all macro environments and we are proving just that. Let me highlight three specific areas. First, we are driving record year-over-year growth in customer move-in volumes. Move-in volume growth has accelerated throughout the year, up nearly 14% in the second quarter. We have closed the year-over-year occupancy gap from down 220 basis points at the end of March to down 160 basis points at the end of June. We have the right team technologies and analytics to determine the appropriate mix of marketing, promotions, and rental rates to meet customer expectations in the current environment.  Drawn by our leading brand and enhanced digital customer experience, self-storage users are clearly choosing Public Storage. These trends support our raised outlook along with the easing of difficult year-over-year comps as we move through the second half of the year. Second, we are growing our portfolio amidst broader market dislocation. Last Monday, we announced and fully funded the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage acquisition in a matter of a few hours. This is something that very few companies could do today and separates Public Storage as the acquirer of choice within our industry. We have the strongest balance sheet and the lowest cost of capital, both of which were highlighted by our rapid execution on the Simply Self Storage transaction. With the Simply Self Storage acquisition, we are excited to combine our respective strengths as we integrate their portfolio to ours and achieve significant operational enhancements immediately and into the future. As an example, under our platform, the $1.8 billion ezStorage portfolio acquired in 2021 has seen significant operating margin improvement of 1,100 basis points from 72% to 83%. As we do with all of our acquisitions, the entire Simply Self Storage portfolio will be rebranded to Public Storage in order to maximize the benefits and value of our iconic brand and platform. We expect to stabilize the portfolio at a mid-6% nominal yield by year three. Third, we are well positioned for continued strong execution and growth across the company. From an operating perspective, our digital and operating model transformations are proving to be significant win-win-wins with result to exceeding expectations. Customers benefit from having robust digital options at their fingertips across the entire journey, finding a unit, renting a unit, moving in, managing their account, and navigating the property when on site. Our proprietary digital ecosystem will continue to be a primary reason that customers choose us with more than 2 million PS app downloads and over 60% of customers renting through our online leasing platform today.  Additionally, public storage team members benefit from being able to place even more focus on our customers, and for those that excel, the transformation has enabled us to create new pathways for career advancement. And our financial profile benefits as well. We are putting these digital tools in the hands of our customers and employees for convenience, combined with in-person on-site customer service when and where it's needed. The result is a better customer and employee experience and a higher operating margin. From an external growth perspective, our industry-leading NOI margins, multifactor in-house platform, access and cost of capital, and growth-oriented balance sheet put us in a unique position. So far this year, we have secured $2.5 billion worth of properties. We will have also delivered $375 million in development by year-end and have a pipeline of more than $1 billion of development to be delivered over the next two years. Our advantages enable us to acquire and develop when others can't. We have a strong appetite for more with a matching ability to execute.  Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. Yes, Samir. The LA market continues to serve us well. We clearly have a very strong position here with north of 200 properties, excellent locations. We've completely rebranded the portfolio through a POT effort. And with that, we've continued even outside of lifting the restrictions that we were burdened by for over three years, we still got good opportunity to drive revenue and strong occupancy, still very good top of funnel demand. It's well documented. There's very little supply that has or will come into that market by virtue of lack of land sites, cost of new development, et cetera. So, we're well positioned and feel very confident that, that market is going to continue to perform well. Tom can give you a little bit more color on how we're looking at the horizon based on the fact that we've certainly gone through a wave of recovering, to some degree, the amount of pricing power that we did not have for that three-year period. But we still feel confident that the market itself is going to perform quite well. We can. Thank you for checking. Hopefully, you can hear us. And just to highlight a couple of other things, Todd, the seasonality predictable components are shifting. And what you have to be in an environment like this is quite nimble and to interpret what effects or counter-affects you may have or be able to deploy as the traditional seasonality theories or events are shifting. And to Tom's point, since 2019, we've learned all kinds of different range of impacts, whether it's tied directly to housing, hybrid work-from-home environments. I can tell you maybe the one consistent predictable driver is just college, and that too got upended during the pandemic. That seems to be back so there's a little bit of movement that we think we can predict there. But the good news is with our platform and our ability to interpret changing demand factors, we're actually able to maneuver through what would be, as Tom pointed out, less predictability around seasonality, but at the same time, we're seeing very good customer demand driven by even new and additional factors, many of which seem to be deep-seated and are likely to be with us for some period of time. We can. Thanks, Spenser, for being patient. Yes. Sure, Spenser. Year-to-date, from a sector standpoint, the amount of transaction volume is pretty similar to what we saw in 2022. So, I would tell you, to your point, there are a number of more inbound calls coming to us. Many of the owners coming into the market are looking for a different level of commitment and a surety that a close can take place. Clearly, with the lending environment not only from availability capital, the cost of capital, a number of traditional or otherwise active buyers in past years are not as active or capable as they would be today. So that gives us a leg up. As I mentioned, we are hearing, time and again, we're an acquirer of choice. We've got a very unique opportunity to continue to execute very effectively. Just as we did, obviously, on a very large scale with the Simply deal. We typically know an asset quite well in the market position. It's at -- again, have very efficient discussions with the existing owner, whether it's a one-off transaction or a portfolio. So, we're using that opportunity and we're being contacted more directly by virtue of the fact that there's much more surety of close, and we can be very effective and efficient and it's been a good window for us. So many of the deals, to your question, that came through were along those lines. We're still doing traditional marketed opportunities where the economics and the quality of the asset makes sense. One of the things that's fresh, 10 days now post announcement of the Simply deal, we are getting some additional inbounds knowing, again, the effectiveness that played through on a $2.2 billion acquisition. And that plays through, again, whether it's a one-off deal or a much smaller portfolio, that continues to be good bread-and-butter growth and acquisition opportunity for us, and the team continues to be busy. As typical this time of year, next quarter or so is typically the more active time of year for transaction opportunities, so we're going to continue to stay focused on that, and we feel we're in a very good spot. Well, Smedes, very different processes and M&A opportunities got a whole different level of complexity and moving parts than maybe a traditional private opportunity. Speaking more directly to the Simply transaction, that was a process where it was a market or a deal that was brought to the market through their own advisory. And so, there was a process that Blackstone went through to bring the portfolio to the market. Because of its size and -- the portfolio has been in place for nearly 20 years, we knew it quite well. We had understood and studied the evolution of the portfolio, so we had very good and crisp knowledge of the portfolio going into that process that was set up by Blackstone. So again, very good opportunity for us to look at a portfolio of that size, integrate it very effectively. As I mentioned, we're about 10 days into the process right now, and we expect to close in the middle of September. By all accounts, the integration opportunity looks every bit, if not more, compelling than it was when we announced the deal. So very confident about our ability to integrate the 127 assets and the 25 properties that are in the third-party management platform. So, feel good about the ability to allocate capital of that size. In a private transaction market, this is the largest deal that's been done since roughly the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022 if you think about the timing of Manhattan Mini. But we're very confident that it's a very strong ability in our to allocate capital, get very strong returns, and integrate those assets very quickly. Yes, it does. Yes. Yes, Ki Bin. A couple of moving parts there. So, we're 3/4 of the way through our $600 million Property of Tomorrow initiative. We're targeting the end of 2024. It may taper in the part of 2025 to get the full portfolio completed so that spending will continue through that time period. The other additional but very effective component of that program that we're going to continue to invest on top of the easing down of just that spend tied to the Property of Tomorrow program is solar. So, we're putting more additional dollars into our solar initiatives in many, many markets. Our goal is to get north of 1,000 properties to some level of solar orientation, which would include just the property needs itself. And you may have seen yesterday, we made an announcement relative to what we're doing with community solar in certain markets. That's a program that's continued to grow as well. So, with that, Tom, you can give a little color on what we're seeing relative to outlook relative to spend on a year-over-year basis. But for those factors, we've still got a couple more years of elevated capital spend. We can. Yes, Keegan. We added, actually, 23 properties in the quarter. And then one was taken out of the platform by virtue of being sold to another party. So, the program now is at 215 assets. We're still seeing a dominant factor play through relative to properties typically coming into the platform through development processes. We've got, I think, a whole host of encouraging conversations and relationships that we're developing on that side of the business. We'll certainly welcome and entertain any existing assets, and any other platform as we always do. If they're flagged in another third-party management platform, public or private, from time to time, there's some pretty unique opportunities, whether it is, as you're asking, relative to a portfolio changing hands that might have a third-party management component to it or not, but we've got very good traction in the program. We've got a very good offering, and we're seeing the opportunity to continue to grow it. Thank you. We can, Mike. Thanks for trying again. No, that's not been asked. [indiscernible] question, give you some color."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Britney. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I\u2019m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, May 4, 2023, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplemental report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially keep your questions limited to two. Of course, if you have additional questions, feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Russell: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us today. Public Storage had a very good start to 2023. We remain focused on leading the self-storage industry\u2019s digital evolution, transforming our own operating model, and enhancing and growing the portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved new milestones on several of our key initiatives, which included exceeding 60% of customers choosing to move in through our eRental online lease, eclipsing two million downloads of the Public Storage mobile app, reaching 400 properties on our customer demand-driven digital operating platform, installing solar at more than 200 properties putting us on track to complete at least 1,000 property installations within the next three years, completion of over 70% of the property of Tomorrow Enhancement Program, growing NOI by 29% across the 529 acquisition and development properties in our non-same-store pool, and driving the industry\u2019s largest development pipeline to an excess of $1 billion to be delivered over the next 24 months. We had a strong operating performance in the first quarter, particularly with existing customers performing well and same-store move-in volume up nearly 13%. Length of stays are strong and same-store revenues were up nearly 10% year-over-year. Our exceptionally large non-same store acquisition and development pool now nearly 25% of the overall portfolio continues to outperform as well. Fundamentally, self-storage is a needs-based business with demand drivers that are multidimensional and fluid throughout economic cycles. We also continue to benefit from people spending more time at home, which has increasing permanence with remote and hybrid work here to stay. Additionally, with the return to more seasonal patterns of demand, we are currently also seeing an uptick in movement activity that has continued into the second quarter. We also continue to find good opportunity in development and redevelopment as well, with a vibrant pipeline poised to generate growth for years to come. Our unique ability to weather economic cycles serves us well, particularly while other developers have slowed their activity due to higher interest rates, cost pressures, difficult municipal processes and concern over the near macro term landscape. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom to discuss acquisition market and financial performance.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. The transaction market has been relatively quiet to start the year as potential sellers feel out the macro environment, higher interest rates and the spread between buyer and seller expectations. That said, we have closed or are under contract to acquire nearly $200 million right on track for our $750 million outlook for the year. The vast majority of our acquisitions this year have been done off-market quietly. More recently, we\u2019ve been encouraged by an increase in inbounds, which are primarily small to medium-sized portfolios. We\u2019re in a great position to acquire today given our cost and access to capital advantages paired with our industry-leading NOI margins. Now on to financial performance. As Joe mentioned, we started the year strong reporting core FFO of $4.08 for the quarter, representing 16.2% growth over the first quarter of 2022, excluding the contribution from PSB. Looking at the components. In the same-store, our revenue increased 9.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022. We drove strong move-in volumes up 13% during the quarter heading into our peak leasing season and the existing tenant base remained strong with length of stays sitting at records. Same-store cost of operations were up 5.6%, leading to total net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties growing 11.2% for the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up in performance of the recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter growing 29% compared to last year. Shifting to the outlook. We lifted our outlook for the year, driven by increasing our same-store revenue assumptions. While the macro environment remains uncertain, performance to date has been encouraging. We\u2019re set up well heading into the second quarter. Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remains rock solid. Our net leverage of 3.3x, combined with $700 million of cash on hand at quarter-end, puts us in a very strong position for capital allocation as we move through the year. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Joe.\nJoseph Russell: Thanks, Tom. Our people, technologies, platforms, balance sheet and brand have and will be continually enhanced to create and strengthen the competitive advantages we have across the entire Public Storage enterprise. We see opportunity in the current environment and are poised to execute with focus on delivering growth and value for our shareholders. Let\u2019s go ahead and open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning. Joe or Tom, I was just hoping you could speak to April trends and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of demand and/or price sensitivity from customers out there? Any \u2013 some of your peers have talked to some softness in March or April depending on their market exposure. So just curious what you guys are seeing across your platform.\nTom Boyle: Yes, thanks for the question, Juan. As we move through the quarter and you could hear it in the prepared remarks, we saw continued strength in move-in volumes and interest into our system. And so as we move through March and into April, that trend continued. I wouldn\u2019t characterize March as weak, but I would characterize April as strong. And so we\u2019ve seen accelerating move-in volume growth as we move through what was a strong margin into a stronger April. One of the things you highlighted there was existing customer sensitivity to price. And I\u2019d also note that we haven\u2019t seen anything concerning there. Price sensitivity has been very in line with our expectations. And so against that backdrop, seeing good move-in volumes, which is encouraging in particular as we head into the next several months.\nJuan Sanabria: Thanks. And then just for my second question, just on the Property of Tomorrow spend, you guys have made excellent progress on deploying that capital. Just curious on the types of returns you\u2019re generating as you look at the CapEx that you\u2019ve spent and how that\u2019s augmenting growth either in the same-store or non-same store pool?\nJoseph Russell: So, the step back, Juan, the program has been quite well received by both customers, our employees and now that we\u2019re at a point where we\u2019re actually getting to full market completion in several of our key markets as we finish up and round out the program over the next couple of years. We\u2019re actually seeing a very good response and overall lift just to the \u2013 again, the image and the power of the brand, particularly where we\u2019ve got meaningful scale in many, many markets. So we continue to track and see the benefits from that. It\u2019s continuing to enhance our presence market-to-market. And with that, we continue to be very excited about getting the program completed. The team has done a very nice job figuring out any and all ways to optimize the amount of volume we\u2019re actually going to pull it in plus or minus a year earlier than we intended to. And with that, we\u2019ll be in a very good position nationally to have elevated the crisp and enhanced brand attributes that play well in many parts of our business.\nJuan Sanabria: Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nJoseph Russell: Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Juan.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on the guidance. You brought up the low end. Is that a reflection of the trends that you\u2019ve already experienced in the first quarter? Or that guided \u2013 the low end of your range was based on a full recession scenario? Is the increasing guidance more reflective of that outcome is less likely to occur? And then within this, you\u2019ve included this quote in your supplemental that suggests that the potential of revenue growth rates is wide and including the potential for year-over-year declines in revenue in the second half of the year. Is there anything that you saw in the first quarter that changes your view on that? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: Sure. Thanks for that question, Michael. I would characterize the first quarter as a strong quarter and that is really what\u2019s leading to the lift in the low end of that revenue assumption component. And so we\u2019ve talked to the strength in the first quarter you\u2019re highlighting how we characterize the wide range of potential outcomes embedded within our outlook for the year. There\u2019s still certainly macro uncertainty in the back half of the year that hasn\u2019t changed, but performance to date has been quite encouraging, which is leading to the increase in the outlook for the year.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And my follow-up question is about the strength and the sustainability of the LA market. Same-store NOI growth was up 20% in the quarter to added 300 basis points to the overall number. Presumably, this is reflecting the rate restrictions that were lifted in February of 2022, which you lap during the quarter. But is there kind of like a second \u2013 is there a second year of growth coming from the LA market? Or have we kind of \u2013 have you kind of used up all the gain there and the gain should be more modest going forward? Thanks.\nJoseph Russell: Yes, Michael. First of all, LA being our largest market, we\u2019ve been very pleased by the performance we\u2019ve been able to achieve over the last year or so, to your point, where the owner\u2019s restrictions have been lifted, but it is also a market where we have a commanding presence. We\u2019ve got very good inherent demand. We\u2019ve got very good occupancies and very little new competitive product coming literally to any of the submarkets that we\u2019re competing in. So the inherent demand in the market is quite good. We think we\u2019ve got against some good traction ahead of us, certainly going into the rest of 2023 and we\u2019ll continue to see where we go from there. But we\u2019ve been very pleased by the performance of that portfolio. It is one of the markets that we \u2013 to go back to my comment about property tomorrow, we put about $75 million into that portfolio to lift it from a brand awareness standpoint, finished that a little over a year-and-a-half ago and again good timing and tie to that \u2013 being that much more prominent in the market. And one of the ways we measure the receptivity of that too is Net Promoter Scores, again getting very good reaction from customers and the brand itself is playing through quite well. So with that good demand and that good continued performance.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nJoseph Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is open.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thank you. You mentioned the almost 13% move-in volume across the first quarter, but move-out volume was lower, but kind of almost kept pace with the move-in volume. I was just wondering if you saw a similar trends in April as well.\nTom Boyle: That\u2019s a great question, Smedes. So one of the things that took place during the quarter was we did gain occupancy as you anticipate. And so occupancy from the end of the year through March was up 50 basis points. And in April, we gained another 20 basis points. So starting to see that seasonal uplift in occupancy that will really continue here into May. And I\u2019d characterize the trajectories of year-over-year move-in and move-out growth as being favorable, i.e., as we move through the quarter, the move-out volume growth has modestly lowered and the move-in volume growth has modestly increased into April, i.e. So April was actually our best month in terms of gaining occupancy and closing the year-over-year occupancy gap on an incremental basis. So again encouraging trends here as we head into the peak leasing season.\nSmedes Rose: Thanks. And then I just I noticed that the late charges, the pace of growth picked up at a faster pace on \u2013 rental income. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything kind of to read into that? And have you seen an uptick in kind of non-payments or anything that would suggest some customers are under economic duress?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Yes, there\u2019s two components to that line item. The one is what you\u2019re highlighting, which is that there are more customers that are making late payments this year than last year. But if you frame it over a multiyear time period, we\u2019re coming off of really, really low delinquency time periods over the last several years and remain well below 2019 levels delinquency, but you\u2019re seeing an uptick there in late payments. And then I think more interestingly, the fact that we had significant move-in volume growth also contributed there with our administrative fee that\u2019s charged to new customers when they move-in, leading to a year-over-year increase in that line item as well.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Thank you.\nJoseph Russell: Thanks, Smedes.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning out there. First question just related to investments. Tom, the balance sheet is in great shape. I think you commented that you\u2019re seeing an increase in inbound call volume from owners. Are you seeing the pipeline build? And can you speak a little bit to pricing, whether pricing seems to be moving in your favor such that we should expect to see deal flow pick up in the quarters ahead?\nTom Boyle: Sure. So we have started to see or started to receive more inbounds more recently. And I do think that that\u2019s healthy. And as you know, Todd, it\u2019s traditional to have a busier second half for storage transaction volumes in the first half and we\u2019re encouraged to start to see that inbound activity. And we suspect it is going to lead to a pickup in volume as we move into the second half of this year. And in terms of the valuation as you think about the assets and where things have traded, transaction volumes have been relatively light to start the year. So I wouldn\u2019t point to a significant amount of data for us to sit here and say, that cap rates are an X or Y with significant precision. We\u2019re continuing to find good value in many of the assets and or closing that buyer and seller gap in many instances, but it remains wide in others. And so we\u2019re still working through that and anticipate to work through that through the rest of the year given what\u2019s played out with interest rates and the macro environment. To put some numbers on it, I think on the last call, we said the cap rates had moved up about 100 to 125 basis points from the lows. And I would say we haven\u2019t seen anything over the last three months that would have us direct you any differently from that.\nTodd Thomas: Okay.\nJoseph Russell: Yes, Mike. And then Todd, just a little bit more relative to the complexion of the activity so far. So Tom mentioned that we\u2019ve been doing a number of deals off-market. So as always, we are looking for those kinds of opportunities as well. There are still owners out there that are looking for an efficient clean transaction. The average occupancy of the $186 million that we\u2019ve done so far has been about 50%. So thematically very similar objective on our part where and if we can acquire properties that have upside once we put them in our platform that\u2019s going to make sense relative to the ultimate yields that we\u2019re likely to achieve from those assets. So we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to continue to see those kind of opportunities going into the rest of the year.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then how would you sort of compare and contrast the U.S. versus non-U.S. opportunity set today? And then also would you \u2013 just given the amount of development activity that\u2019s taken place over the last several years and some of the tighter lending environment that we\u2019re seeing today, would you consider building out a structured finance program at all to be a financing solution for borrowers, but also as a way to maybe expand the platform through third-party management and build a future investment pipeline?\nJoseph Russell: Okay. So, yes, a couple of questions or more on that statement. So first of all, from an international standpoint, I would say, consistent with what we\u2019ve spoken to for some time, which is we\u2019re well equipped to consider and evaluate outside border opportunities, we continue to do that, nothing to speak to as we are here today. But again, that\u2019s part of the overall mining that we\u2019re doing both inside and outside borders. But we\u2019ll see how that plays out over time. Clearly, there\u2019s been far more in border opportunities over the last three or four years. And maybe to a tight \u2013 another part of your question is the fact that part of the reason for that is the amount of development that\u2019s come into the cycle has been done by owners that have no intention of being long-term holders of those assets. So that continues to be a good breeding ground for us to find deals. I\u2019ll let Tom talk about thoughts around going into any kind of lending platform et cetera.\nTom Boyle: But yes, I\u2019d maybe take a step back and comment on your question around the lending environment because if you think stepping back the lending environment, it certainly gotten more challenged for many developers at this point. It could lead to lower new supply heading forward. So we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. In terms of our participation in other parts of the capital stack, we continue to find very good value in the equity portion of the capital stack and have been deploying capital there consistently over the last several years and have found that to be a good risk adjusted return. And I note in addition to that, we have made some lending investments with some of our partners on a smaller scale. So something that we\u2019re considering as part of our wheelhouse as we move forward.\nTodd Thomas: All right. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thank you.\nJoseph Russell: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeegan Carl: Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe first here, just any more color in your development pipeline, particularly those assets are completed from 2018 to 2020. It seems as if occupancy levels are below your portfolio average by decent margin, but yet they should have stabilized at this point based on your press release commentary. So just any sort of color on what\u2019s driving and if it\u2019s maybe market specific would be helpful.\nTom Boyle: Yes, I\u2019d characterize as the performance of those assets to be pretty strong, right? I mean anything we delivered over that time period has benefited from really strong demand drivers. And frankly, they\u2019ve been exceeding our expectations. Your comments around occupancies, I think, some of those vintages are a touch under 90%, but they\u2019ll certainly stabilize above 90%. One of the things that I\u2019d remind you is that occupancy is only one part of the equation of stabilization and rental rates is certainly the other. And we\u2019re seeking to maximize revenue from those pools of assets the same way we do our same-store pool. So occupancy will ultimately get over 90%, but I think more importantly the rate growth there has been exceptionally strong and likely has several more years of strong rate growth compared to the same-store pool from that group of assets. And you can see the yields that we\u2019re achieving there. It continues to reinforce the strong risk-adjusted return of that program and it leads to our increase in desire to continue to build moving forward. So the development pipeline now is sitting over $1 billion as we seek to grow that program.\nKeegan Carl: That\u2019s helpful. And then one thing I noticed in the supplement, just your commentary on credit card fees stood out. Just kind of curious, is there a way for you guys to charge a higher rate on those using credit cards to offset that? Or do you just now want to take the risk of them bulking given those people on auto pay tend to be better customers?\nTom Boyle: Yes, I\u2019d say for the most part the increase in credit card fees relates to the increase in revenues and that\u2019s by far and away the contribution. So as revenues increase, you\u2019re going to see those payment processing fees go higher. From an operational standpoint, we do spend time thinking about ways to incentivize our customers to use attractive payment patterns for them, but also one that may be cheaper for us to process. And so that\u2019s an ongoing kind of year in and year out attempt through different operational methods. But to your point, we love to move people in and achieve that auto pay and ultimately it\u2019s much more important to achieve that move-in than it is to focus on the payments process.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Super helpful. Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I'm sure you guys are disappointed in the outcome with Life Storage, but does that sort of change kind of your view at all about kind of large-scale M&A? Or do you feel like this kind of puts pressure for you to find other transactions of size to kind of keep your lead in the industry?\nJoseph Russell: Yes, Steve. Clearly, we are well positioned to continue to grow in all different shapes and sizes. And we feel every bit, if not more, confident that opportunities will continue to arise going forward. So we're very focused on that. We are looking at many different alternatives going into future opportunity scenarios. But we feel that, again, the reset to whatever degree happens in the sector by virtue of the LSI and ESR combination. At the end of the day, it doesn't change the landscape from a competitive standpoint. One of the things that we've learned over time scales one part of efficiency and optimization, but many other things play through as well, that we continue to invest in that lead to our industry-leading margins, the things that we've done to enhance our own brand, the effectiveness of the presence we have market-to-market, and we feel very confident we're in good shape going forward, and we'll continue to make those investments.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. And then, I guess, secondly, on development, we continue to hear that development should be coming down given all the challenges in the lending environment. You guys have remained, I think, active I'm just curious, are you sort of changing kind of how you guys underwrite development today? Have you changed your hurdles? Are you changing anything in the, I guess, the framework and the way you evaluate new development projects?\nJoseph Russell: Yes. The \u2013 first of all, development is a long game, right? So we're typically looking at scenarios that \u2013 well without question, go in and out of all kinds of different ranges of economic cycles, et cetera, when you're thinking about total time periods to actually put a property to a point of not only opening, but stabilization, I mean you can easily be at a five-year plus mark asset to asset. So that I think, is a good headwind, particularly in this environment where, again, many owners are seeing different headwinds around cost of capital, availability of capital, component costs. I mentioned the amount of timing it takes to get approval, city-to-city, and we've been talking about for some time is far more difficult today than it's ever been on that front. And literally almost everywhere. I can't even name a market where it's easier to develop today than it was one, two or three years ago. So you've got to be, again, ready to work through those kinds of demands or those kinds of factors, those kinds of risk components. We feel very well suited to do that. In this environment, where we're actually seeing the opportunity to pull more interesting properties into our own pipeline that potentially have far less competition from a land standpoint or even a repurposing standpoint. So the team is working hard, and we're finding some good opportunities. I'll let Tom talk a little bit about how our underwriting process play through as well. But that's something that always is reflective not only the current environment, but the long-term environment.\nTom Boyle: Yes. And just to piggyback on that, I think we're consistently looking to try to improve our underwriting processes year in and year out. And if you recall at Investor Day, our data science leader talked about some of the tools that, that team has helped develop with \u2013 for use with our development and acquisition team. Those processes continue to be underway. We try to use our wealth of data internally to give us advantages on picking those sites and adding in new development. So underwriting process is consistently evolving in a positive way. In terms of hurdles and the like, obviously, we do with acquisitions as well as development and think about what our cost of capital is and evaluate that in the context of the returns that we expect on new capital allocation. But I'd point you to a relatively consistent trend, which we said that we're seeking to build new sites that will generate a yield on cost of circa 8% plus at delivery, and that's not significantly changed over the last several years.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks.\nJoseph Russell: Thanks, Steve.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning. Did you guys provide an update on April moving rates? Sorry if I missed it.\nTom Boyle: No, we didn't. The way I'd characterize move-in rents, and I think this is the first question on move-in rents on the call, which maybe a record in terms of depth before we get that question, but move-in rates across the sector have been lower. And I think that's been pretty well documented. Move-in rents in the first half of the year, we anticipate to be down more significantly than maybe the back half of the year given the comp scenario that we've been discussing with the first half, really tough comps versus last year in the second half, easier comps. And so as we move into the second quarter, we anticipate moving rents, and we're seeing that in April to be down in that kind of upper single digits to low double-digit type ZIP code.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Great. And how many stores do you have right now that are managed fully remotely without people? And are those \u2013 any kind of shared characteristics are those usually just smaller stores in tertiary markets or in different places as well?\nJoseph Russell: Yes, Ki Bin. I would tell you there's a broader context of the way we're approaching the whole concept of \"remote.\" One of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, is we've now got 400 properties on what we call customer-driven technological platforms, which includes a piece of what you might consider a property to be remotely managed. A misnomer on remote is remote also requires and every property still requires some level of on-site personnel. What we have done in a broader context is continue to test and now deploy pretty effective technological, predictive and data sources that we have to put people in the right places based on property activity, the amount of demand that's likely to come through the patterns both on a weekly, daily and monthly and even quarterly basis. So with that, we can really take even that baseline concept of remote to a far different level, which can work in suburban or remote areas. It can work in more dense areas. It can help us optimize the amount of necessary on-site labor. And this is all built around something that's first and foremost, which is actually maintaining or improving customer service. So there's a whole range of different components to that platform, some of which include kiosks for instance, some of which include the way that we interact with customers through our customer care center. And then another leg of that whole puzzle is a very effective time and presence from a face-to-face Public Storage employee. So all of those things are being optimized piece-by-piece, and we've done some very interesting things, and we have a lot more to come. Very excited about that part of the business.\nKi Bin Kim: And so you said 400 properties, you have about 2,900. I guess, can you apply to all? And if you do, like does the FTE go from 2 to 1? Or I am just trying to understand the impact overall?\nJoseph Russell: Yes, yes. It's the roadmap we're on. I wouldn't say it's pure enough to say each and every one of the 2,900 properties have the same impact from the platform, but the great part about our overall strategy as there are components to this. So you can optimize FTE based on, again, what size of property you're dealing with, what historic level of either staffing or presence you'd have from an employee standpoint. And then Tom, you can talk a little bit about some of the economic benefits that we're likely to continue to see. But the great thing about this, like I said, far deeper than just remote because it can apply to many different types of assets, and we're excited about deploying in that many more parts of the business.\nTom Boyle: Yes. The only thing I'd add to that Ki Bin is in our Investor Day presentation, we did highlight our objective to reduce labor hours and get more efficient with labor hours through the specialization and centralization that Joe is speaking to in reacting to customer demand. And the target we set is for a reduction in labor hours of 25%. We'll achieve that this year. In fact, we think that there is more upside from here. So just another component of how we're seeking to get more efficient and drive our industry-leading margins higher.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you.\nJoseph Russell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Mueller: Yes, hi. I was wondering, are you seeing any signs of like the degradation of length of stay for your lower-term customers that have been there over a year or two?\nJoseph Russell: Yes. I mean, we characterize the length of stay is sitting at records in our prepared remarks earlier. And so generally speaking, while we have seen move-outs increase in trend back towards 2019 levels, the length of stay of the overall platform continues to be really strong. The portfolio now \u2013 the average length of stay of the tenant base today is over 36 months and has been sitting around that sort of ZIP Code for the last several quarters. In terms of the longer length of stay customers themselves and how they're behaving, they continue to behave quite well. And on a year-over-year basis, the percentage of customers greater than two years is actually higher than where it was last year. So continuing to demonstrate the strength of that component of tenant base.\nMichael Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Your line is open.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. Maybe just another one similar to the development topic. But can you just remind us what percent of the portfolio would you say has true expansion opportunity?\nJoseph Russell: Yes, Spenser, I don't think we've ever characterized that as a specific number. What leads to those kinds of expansion opportunities are several factors. We have hundreds of properties that have been developed, say, 30, 40 or 50 years ago that in those periods of time, a traditional properties you might have a much larger amount of acreage and would typically have what we would call our Gen 1 product simple, single-story drive-up product. There are many opportunities within the portfolio to potentially acquire different and higher levels of FAR to magnify the size of those properties. And frankly, many of them are in great locations, some of which we get far better customer demand once we actually even make the property that much bigger. So there's a sizable set of those types of assets. Time and the effort that goes into that to be quite complex. Many cities won't allow us to do certain expansions of that magnitude. Some that may open the door to that, actually, they will put you through a multiyear process. That, again, you've got to work through very diligently. So we've got a number of those efforts in play as we speak. Another thing that we have at hand in many assets, for instance, is either some additional excess land or parking area that, too, can be developed or expanded into, again, a more modern facility as an extension of what's already on the property. So there's a whole range of things that we're continuing to evaluate on that front, but the good news is by virtue of our very consistent investment processes now for several decades. We've got amazing sites. And with that, in many areas, properties that have far different demand and better demand dynamics when they're originally built that could fit very well to, again, the opportunity going forward. Today, the $1 billion development pipeline, plus or minus about 50% of that is actually tied to the kinds of sites I'm speaking to. And the team is going to continue to work, to monetize and unlock those opportunities as we go forward. One of the great things about our development team is they can wear both hats. They can work on ground-up development as well as expansion development. We're doing that like-for-like, clearly in many of the markets that we're looking for expansion.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. That was really helpful color. And I was also just wondering, just given the fact that there has been a lack of larger portfolios in the market, has there been any increase to the personnel dedicated to sourcing or underwriting acquisitions just as I would imagine, the deals are a little bit more granular, excuse me, than normal. But it sounds like from what you just said, your personnel are very dynamic and perhaps can wear multiple hats.\nJoseph Russell: Yes. To that point, maybe just to give you a little context. 2021, to your point, it was an unusual year where we did a couple of very large unusual transactions. And again, the flip side of that, though, is that was only half of our volume of the $5.1 billion that we did. The other half was dedicated to what's very traditional, either single asset acquisitions or much smaller portfolios. We've got a deep-seated team, very knowledgeable, very well placed relative to knowledge of markets, knowledge of owners and the kind of dialogue that comes with that from a relationship standpoint, has been and will continue to be very important for our efforts to grow the portfolio. As Tom mentioned, about half \u2013 or more than half, excuse me, a lion share of the acquisition volume that we've done in 2023 has come from off-market transactions. So part of that is just, again, as I think you're alluding to, we've got the right team in place to go out and engage. We've got a great reputation as a preferred buyer, and we're going to continue to leverage that.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you.\nJoseph Russell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: It appears we have no further questions on the line at this time. I will turn the program back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Burke: Thanks, Britney, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Joe. The transaction market has been relatively quiet to start the year as potential sellers feel out the macro environment, higher interest rates and the spread between buyer and seller expectations. That said, we have closed or are under contract to acquire nearly $200 million right on track for our $750 million outlook for the year. The vast majority of our acquisitions this year have been done off-market quietly. More recently, we've been encouraged by an increase in inbounds, which are primarily small to medium-sized portfolios. We're in a great position to acquire today given our cost and access to capital advantages paired with our industry-leading NOI margins. Now on to financial performance. As Joe mentioned, we started the year strong reporting core FFO of $4.08 for the quarter, representing 16.2% growth over the first quarter of 2022, excluding the contribution from PSB. Looking at the components. In the same-store, our revenue increased 9.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022. We drove strong move-in volumes up 13% during the quarter heading into our peak leasing season and the existing tenant base remained strong with length of stays sitting at records. Same-store cost of operations were up 5.6%, leading to total net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties growing 11.2% for the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up in performance of the recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter growing 29% compared to last year. Shifting to the outlook. We lifted our outlook for the year, driven by increasing our same-store revenue assumptions. While the macro environment remains uncertain, performance to date has been encouraging. We're set up well heading into the second quarter. Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remains rock solid. Our net leverage of 3.3x, combined with $700 million of cash on hand at quarter-end, puts us in a very strong position for capital allocation as we move through the year. Now I'll turn it back to Joe. Yes, thanks for the question, Juan. As we move through the quarter and you could hear it in the prepared remarks, we saw continued strength in move-in volumes and interest into our system. And so as we move through March and into April, that trend continued. I wouldn't characterize March as weak, but I would characterize April as strong. And so we've seen accelerating move-in volume growth as we move through what was a strong margin into a stronger April. One of the things you highlighted there was existing customer sensitivity to price. And I'd also note that we haven't seen anything concerning there. Price sensitivity has been very in line with our expectations. And so against that backdrop, seeing good move-in volumes, which is encouraging in particular as we head into the next several months. Thanks, Juan. Sure. Thanks for that question, Michael. I would characterize the first quarter as a strong quarter and that is really what's leading to the lift in the low end of that revenue assumption component. And so we've talked to the strength in the first quarter you're highlighting how we characterize the wide range of potential outcomes embedded within our outlook for the year. There's still certainly macro uncertainty in the back half of the year that hasn't changed, but performance to date has been quite encouraging, which is leading to the increase in the outlook for the year. That's a great question, Smedes. So one of the things that took place during the quarter was we did gain occupancy as you anticipate. And so occupancy from the end of the year through March was up 50 basis points. And in April, we gained another 20 basis points. So starting to see that seasonal uplift in occupancy that will really continue here into May. And I'd characterize the trajectories of year-over-year move-in and move-out growth as being favorable, i.e., as we move through the quarter, the move-out volume growth has modestly lowered and the move-in volume growth has modestly increased into April, i.e. So April was actually our best month in terms of gaining occupancy and closing the year-over-year occupancy gap on an incremental basis. So again encouraging trends here as we head into the peak leasing season. Sure. Yes, there's two components to that line item. The one is what you're highlighting, which is that there are more customers that are making late payments this year than last year. But if you frame it over a multiyear time period, we're coming off of really, really low delinquency time periods over the last several years and remain well below 2019 levels delinquency, but you're seeing an uptick there in late payments. And then I think more interestingly, the fact that we had significant move-in volume growth also contributed there with our administrative fee that's charged to new customers when they move-in, leading to a year-over-year increase in that line item as well. Sure. So we have started to see or started to receive more inbounds more recently. And I do think that that's healthy. And as you know, Todd, it's traditional to have a busier second half for storage transaction volumes in the first half and we're encouraged to start to see that inbound activity. And we suspect it is going to lead to a pickup in volume as we move into the second half of this year. And in terms of the valuation as you think about the assets and where things have traded, transaction volumes have been relatively light to start the year. So I wouldn't point to a significant amount of data for us to sit here and say, that cap rates are an X or Y with significant precision. We're continuing to find good value in many of the assets and or closing that buyer and seller gap in many instances, but it remains wide in others. And so we're still working through that and anticipate to work through that through the rest of the year given what's played out with interest rates and the macro environment. To put some numbers on it, I think on the last call, we said the cap rates had moved up about 100 to 125 basis points from the lows. And I would say we haven't seen anything over the last three months that would have us direct you any differently from that. But yes, I'd maybe take a step back and comment on your question around the lending environment because if you think stepping back the lending environment, it certainly gotten more challenged for many developers at this point. It could lead to lower new supply heading forward. So we'll have to see how that plays out. In terms of our participation in other parts of the capital stack, we continue to find very good value in the equity portion of the capital stack and have been deploying capital there consistently over the last several years and have found that to be a good risk adjusted return. And I note in addition to that, we have made some lending investments with some of our partners on a smaller scale. So something that we're considering as part of our wheelhouse as we move forward. Thank you. Yes, I'd characterize as the performance of those assets to be pretty strong, right? I mean anything we delivered over that time period has benefited from really strong demand drivers. And frankly, they've been exceeding our expectations. Your comments around occupancies, I think, some of those vintages are a touch under 90%, but they'll certainly stabilize above 90%. One of the things that I'd remind you is that occupancy is only one part of the equation of stabilization and rental rates is certainly the other. And we're seeking to maximize revenue from those pools of assets the same way we do our same-store pool. So occupancy will ultimately get over 90%, but I think more importantly the rate growth there has been exceptionally strong and likely has several more years of strong rate growth compared to the same-store pool from that group of assets. And you can see the yields that we're achieving there. It continues to reinforce the strong risk-adjusted return of that program and it leads to our increase in desire to continue to build moving forward. So the development pipeline now is sitting over $1 billion as we seek to grow that program. Yes, I'd say for the most part the increase in credit card fees relates to the increase in revenues and that's by far and away the contribution. So as revenues increase, you're going to see those payment processing fees go higher. From an operational standpoint, we do spend time thinking about ways to incentivize our customers to use attractive payment patterns for them, but also one that may be cheaper for us to process. And so that's an ongoing kind of year in and year out attempt through different operational methods. But to your point, we love to move people in and achieve that auto pay and ultimately it's much more important to achieve that move-in than it is to focus on the payments process. Yes. And just to piggyback on that, I think we're consistently looking to try to improve our underwriting processes year in and year out. And if you recall at Investor Day, our data science leader talked about some of the tools that, that team has helped develop with \u2013 for use with our development and acquisition team. Those processes continue to be underway. We try to use our wealth of data internally to give us advantages on picking those sites and adding in new development. So underwriting process is consistently evolving in a positive way. In terms of hurdles and the like, obviously, we do with acquisitions as well as development and think about what our cost of capital is and evaluate that in the context of the returns that we expect on new capital allocation. But I'd point you to a relatively consistent trend, which we said that we're seeking to build new sites that will generate a yield on cost of circa 8% plus at delivery, and that's not significantly changed over the last several years. Thanks, Steve. No, we didn't. The way I'd characterize move-in rents, and I think this is the first question on move-in rents on the call, which maybe a record in terms of depth before we get that question, but move-in rates across the sector have been lower. And I think that's been pretty well documented. Move-in rents in the first half of the year, we anticipate to be down more significantly than maybe the back half of the year given the comp scenario that we've been discussing with the first half, really tough comps versus last year in the second half, easier comps. And so as we move into the second quarter, we anticipate moving rents, and we're seeing that in April to be down in that kind of upper single digits to low double-digit type ZIP code. Yes. The only thing I'd add to that Ki Bin is in our Investor Day presentation, we did highlight our objective to reduce labor hours and get more efficient with labor hours through the specialization and centralization that Joe is speaking to in reacting to customer demand. And the target we set is for a reduction in labor hours of 25%. We'll achieve that this year. In fact, we think that there is more upside from here. So just another component of how we're seeking to get more efficient and drive our industry-leading margins higher."

            "name": "Joseph Russell",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us today. Public Storage had a very good start to 2023. We remain focused on leading the self-storage industry's digital evolution, transforming our own operating model, and enhancing and growing the portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved new milestones on several of our key initiatives, which included exceeding 60% of customers choosing to move in through our eRental online lease, eclipsing two million downloads of the Public Storage mobile app, reaching 400 properties on our customer demand-driven digital operating platform, installing solar at more than 200 properties putting us on track to complete at least 1,000 property installations within the next three years, completion of over 70% of the property of Tomorrow Enhancement Program, growing NOI by 29% across the 529 acquisition and development properties in our non-same-store pool, and driving the industry's largest development pipeline to an excess of $1 billion to be delivered over the next 24 months. We had a strong operating performance in the first quarter, particularly with existing customers performing well and same-store move-in volume up nearly 13%. Length of stays are strong and same-store revenues were up nearly 10% year-over-year. Our exceptionally large non-same store acquisition and development pool now nearly 25% of the overall portfolio continues to outperform as well. Fundamentally, self-storage is a needs-based business with demand drivers that are multidimensional and fluid throughout economic cycles. We also continue to benefit from people spending more time at home, which has increasing permanence with remote and hybrid work here to stay. Additionally, with the return to more seasonal patterns of demand, we are currently also seeing an uptick in movement activity that has continued into the second quarter. We also continue to find good opportunity in development and redevelopment as well, with a vibrant pipeline poised to generate growth for years to come. Our unique ability to weather economic cycles serves us well, particularly while other developers have slowed their activity due to higher interest rates, cost pressures, difficult municipal processes and concern over the near macro term landscape. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss acquisition market and financial performance. Thanks, Tom. Our people, technologies, platforms, balance sheet and brand have and will be continually enhanced to create and strengthen the competitive advantages we have across the entire Public Storage enterprise. We see opportunity in the current environment and are poised to execute with focus on delivering growth and value for our shareholders. Let's go ahead and open the call up for questions. So, the step back, Juan, the program has been quite well received by both customers, our employees and now that we're at a point where we're actually getting to full market completion in several of our key markets as we finish up and round out the program over the next couple of years. We're actually seeing a very good response and overall lift just to the \u2013 again, the image and the power of the brand, particularly where we've got meaningful scale in many, many markets. So we continue to track and see the benefits from that. It's continuing to enhance our presence market-to-market. And with that, we continue to be very excited about getting the program completed. The team has done a very nice job figuring out any and all ways to optimize the amount of volume we're actually going to pull it in plus or minus a year earlier than we intended to. And with that, we'll be in a very good position nationally to have elevated the crisp and enhanced brand attributes that play well in many parts of our business. Thank you. Yes, Michael. First of all, LA being our largest market, we've been very pleased by the performance we've been able to achieve over the last year or so, to your point, where the owner's restrictions have been lifted, but it is also a market where we have a commanding presence. We've got very good inherent demand. We've got very good occupancies and very little new competitive product coming literally to any of the submarkets that we're competing in. So the inherent demand in the market is quite good. We think we've got against some good traction ahead of us, certainly going into the rest of 2023 and we'll continue to see where we go from there. But we've been very pleased by the performance of that portfolio. It is one of the markets that we \u2013 to go back to my comment about property tomorrow, we put about $75 million into that portfolio to lift it from a brand awareness standpoint, finished that a little over a year-and-a-half ago and again good timing and tie to that \u2013 being that much more prominent in the market. And one of the ways we measure the receptivity of that too is Net Promoter Scores, again getting very good reaction from customers and the brand itself is playing through quite well. So with that good demand and that good continued performance. Thank you. Thanks, Smedes. Yes, Mike. And then Todd, just a little bit more relative to the complexion of the activity so far. So Tom mentioned that we've been doing a number of deals off-market. So as always, we are looking for those kinds of opportunities as well. There are still owners out there that are looking for an efficient clean transaction. The average occupancy of the $186 million that we've done so far has been about 50%. So thematically very similar objective on our part where and if we can acquire properties that have upside once we put them in our platform that's going to make sense relative to the ultimate yields that we're likely to achieve from those assets. So we're confident we're going to continue to see those kind of opportunities going into the rest of the year. Okay. So, yes, a couple of questions or more on that statement. So first of all, from an international standpoint, I would say, consistent with what we've spoken to for some time, which is we're well equipped to consider and evaluate outside border opportunities, we continue to do that, nothing to speak to as we are here today. But again, that's part of the overall mining that we're doing both inside and outside borders. But we'll see how that plays out over time. Clearly, there's been far more in border opportunities over the last three or four years. And maybe to a tight \u2013 another part of your question is the fact that part of the reason for that is the amount of development that's come into the cycle has been done by owners that have no intention of being long-term holders of those assets. So that continues to be a good breeding ground for us to find deals. I'll let Tom talk about thoughts around going into any kind of lending platform et cetera. Thanks. Yes, Steve. Clearly, we are well positioned to continue to grow in all different shapes and sizes. And we feel every bit, if not more, confident that opportunities will continue to arise going forward. So we're very focused on that. We are looking at many different alternatives going into future opportunity scenarios. But we feel that, again, the reset to whatever degree happens in the sector by virtue of the LSI and ESR combination. At the end of the day, it doesn't change the landscape from a competitive standpoint. One of the things that we've learned over time scales one part of efficiency and optimization, but many other things play through as well, that we continue to invest in that lead to our industry-leading margins, the things that we've done to enhance our own brand, the effectiveness of the presence we have market-to-market, and we feel very confident we're in good shape going forward, and we'll continue to make those investments. Yes. The \u2013 first of all, development is a long game, right? So we're typically looking at scenarios that \u2013 well without question, go in and out of all kinds of different ranges of economic cycles, et cetera, when you're thinking about total time periods to actually put a property to a point of not only opening, but stabilization, I mean you can easily be at a five-year plus mark asset to asset. So that I think, is a good headwind, particularly in this environment where, again, many owners are seeing different headwinds around cost of capital, availability of capital, component costs. I mentioned the amount of timing it takes to get approval, city-to-city, and we've been talking about for some time is far more difficult today than it's ever been on that front. And literally almost everywhere. I can't even name a market where it's easier to develop today than it was one, two or three years ago. So you've got to be, again, ready to work through those kinds of demands or those kinds of factors, those kinds of risk components. We feel very well suited to do that. In this environment, where we're actually seeing the opportunity to pull more interesting properties into our own pipeline that potentially have far less competition from a land standpoint or even a repurposing standpoint. So the team is working hard, and we're finding some good opportunities. I'll let Tom talk a little bit about how our underwriting process play through as well. But that's something that always is reflective not only the current environment, but the long-term environment. Thanks, Steve. Yes, Ki Bin. I would tell you there's a broader context of the way we're approaching the whole concept of \"remote.\" One of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, is we've now got 400 properties on what we call customer-driven technological platforms, which includes a piece of what you might consider a property to be remotely managed. A misnomer on remote is remote also requires and every property still requires some level of on-site personnel. What we have done in a broader context is continue to test and now deploy pretty effective technological, predictive and data sources that we have to put people in the right places based on property activity, the amount of demand that's likely to come through the patterns both on a weekly, daily and monthly and even quarterly basis. So with that, we can really take even that baseline concept of remote to a far different level, which can work in suburban or remote areas. It can work in more dense areas. It can help us optimize the amount of necessary on-site labor. And this is all built around something that's first and foremost, which is actually maintaining or improving customer service. So there's a whole range of different components to that platform, some of which include kiosks for instance, some of which include the way that we interact with customers through our customer care center. And then another leg of that whole puzzle is a very effective time and presence from a face-to-face Public Storage employee. So all of those things are being optimized piece-by-piece, and we've done some very interesting things, and we have a lot more to come. Very excited about that part of the business. Yes, yes. It's the roadmap we're on. I wouldn't say it's pure enough to say each and every one of the 2,900 properties have the same impact from the platform, but the great part about our overall strategy as there are components to this. So you can optimize FTE based on, again, what size of property you're dealing with, what historic level of either staffing or presence you'd have from an employee standpoint. And then Tom, you can talk a little bit about some of the economic benefits that we're likely to continue to see. But the great thing about this, like I said, far deeper than just remote because it can apply to many different types of assets, and we're excited about deploying in that many more parts of the business. Great. Thank you. Yes. I mean, we characterize the length of stay is sitting at records in our prepared remarks earlier. And so generally speaking, while we have seen move-outs increase in trend back towards 2019 levels, the length of stay of the overall platform continues to be really strong. The portfolio now \u2013 the average length of stay of the tenant base today is over 36 months and has been sitting around that sort of ZIP Code for the last several quarters. In terms of the longer length of stay customers themselves and how they're behaving, they continue to behave quite well. And on a year-over-year basis, the percentage of customers greater than two years is actually higher than where it was last year. So continuing to demonstrate the strength of that component of tenant base. Yes, Spenser, I don't think we've ever characterized that as a specific number. What leads to those kinds of expansion opportunities are several factors. We have hundreds of properties that have been developed, say, 30, 40 or 50 years ago that in those periods of time, a traditional properties you might have a much larger amount of acreage and would typically have what we would call our Gen 1 product simple, single-story drive-up product. There are many opportunities within the portfolio to potentially acquire different and higher levels of FAR to magnify the size of those properties. And frankly, many of them are in great locations, some of which we get far better customer demand once we actually even make the property that much bigger. So there's a sizable set of those types of assets. Time and the effort that goes into that to be quite complex. Many cities won't allow us to do certain expansions of that magnitude. Some that may open the door to that, actually, they will put you through a multiyear process. That, again, you've got to work through very diligently. So we've got a number of those efforts in play as we speak. Another thing that we have at hand in many assets, for instance, is either some additional excess land or parking area that, too, can be developed or expanded into, again, a more modern facility as an extension of what's already on the property. So there's a whole range of things that we're continuing to evaluate on that front, but the good news is by virtue of our very consistent investment processes now for several decades. We've got amazing sites. And with that, in many areas, properties that have far different demand and better demand dynamics when they're originally built that could fit very well to, again, the opportunity going forward. Today, the $1 billion development pipeline, plus or minus about 50% of that is actually tied to the kinds of sites I'm speaking to. And the team is going to continue to work, to monetize and unlock those opportunities as we go forward. One of the great things about our development team is they can wear both hats. They can work on ground-up development as well as expansion development. We're doing that like-for-like, clearly in many of the markets that we're looking for expansion. Yes. To that point, maybe just to give you a little context. 2021, to your point, it was an unusual year where we did a couple of very large unusual transactions. And again, the flip side of that, though, is that was only half of our volume of the $5.1 billion that we did. The other half was dedicated to what's very traditional, either single asset acquisitions or much smaller portfolios. We've got a deep-seated team, very knowledgeable, very well placed relative to knowledge of markets, knowledge of owners and the kind of dialogue that comes with that from a relationship standpoint, has been and will continue to be very important for our efforts to grow the portfolio. As Tom mentioned, about half \u2013 or more than half, excuse me, a lion share of the acquisition volume that we've done in 2023 has come from off-market transactions. So part of that is just, again, as I think you're alluding to, we've got the right team in place to go out and engage. We've got a great reputation as a preferred buyer, and we're going to continue to leverage that. Great. Thank you."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Ryan Burke. Thank you. You may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Rob. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

We do ask that you initially limit yourselves to two questions. Of course after that if you have more feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our recent performance and updated views. Then we'll open the call up for Q&A. As we anticipated, operating fundamentals are stabilizing across our portfolio in the broader industry. We started the year with sequential revenue growth acceleration in a handful of markets. We are now achieving acceleration across most markets and expect the trend to continue. The improvement will be gradual and take some time to be fully reflected in our reported financial results. But as we'll discuss today many things are moving in the right direction for Public Storage. In particular pricing for new customers is stabilizing with move-in rents down 9% year-over-year in the third quarter and down 5% in October. This is a meaningful improvement from the first quarter of this year when move-in rents were down 16%. Our in-place customers are also behaving very well. Payment patterns are strong, average length of stay is long and move-outs are down year-to-date. All of this speaks to the convenience and affordability we provide to our customers. With move-in rents down nearly 30% since 2022, we have become even more affordable relative to other space alternatives. including moving into a larger home or apartment just to get the incremental space. Self-storage is the affordable and convenient choice. The supply environment is also on a favorable path with deliveries of new competitive properties slowing further over the next couple of years. Less new competition will support operating fundamentals on top of the improving demand trends. We continue to focus on growth enhancing initiatives that are unique to us as well. Public Storage customers are fully embracing the new and modern experience we've created by putting a full slate of digital engagement options in their hands. These options complement the service provided by our fantastic property managers, local teams and customer care center representatives. The ability to choose between interacting digitally and in-person is a major draw to customer seeking self-storage today. I am proud of the entire team's efforts in creating the industry's most comprehensive, hybrid, digital operating model that cohesively connects our customers, team and systems across field and corporate operations. And we're tracking ahead of schedule on our transformation with now 75% move-ins using eRental, our digital online lease. We have nearly two million PS app users and on a daily basis, tenants across our entire portfolio using our digital property access and remote customer service. The transformation is amounting to a win-win-win across our customers, team members and financial performance. Through it, we have created more specialized and career-advancing roles across the company. New opportunities for our property managers have been particularly well received, as they now have career paths that aren't available elsewhere in the industry. Due in part to these efforts, we are proud to have received the Great place to Work designation, for a third year in a row. Another area of focus is utilities. We have reduced usage by 30% through conversion to LED lighting across the portfolio, and installing solar power at more than 800 properties so far. We recently increased our solar goal to 1,300 properties by the end of 2025. The team has innovated and implemented at a rapid pace over the past few years. We are fully in gear and are excited about more to come. Now, Tom will provide additional detail.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. With fundamentals improving and the team keenly focused on transformation and optimization initiatives, we are very well positioned with signs that the acquisition market is picking up. We see more one-off deals, more portfolios and evidence of convergence around buyer and seller expectations, following a quiet couple of years. Our growth-oriented capital and liquidity profile, is strong. Industry-leading leverage, balance sheet capacity and cost of capital have us poised to execute on pent-up seller dialogue in combination with our operational and acquisition integration advantages. Shifting to our third quarter financial performance. We achieved core FFO of $4.20 per share representing a 3% decline compared to last year. Revenues in our same-store portfolio of stabilized properties declined 1.3% compared to last year, with a relatively even balance between rent and occupancy. A couple of important things to note, regarding the stabilization that Joe spoke to. First, the second derivative of growth continues to improve. Revenue growth in the quarter, decelerated 30 basis points sequentially relative to the growth in the second quarter of this year. This is significant improvement from the 380 basis points of deceleration reported from the second to third quarter of last year. Secondly, as implied by our guidance midpoint, we expect our nominal same-store revenue growth to begin improving due to the positive trends that Joe described. At the midpoint, the fourth quarter would be the first sequential growth improvement in more than two years. Moving now to the outlook. We reiterated our core FFO guidance of $16.50 to $16.85 per share, rolling through higher third quarter G&A and lower third quarter ancillary income while lifting our same-store revenue outlook for the year. The strong performance of our non-same-store pool continues. We increased the outlook for our incremental NOI from this pool of assets in 2025 and beyond through stabilization to $120 million in total to come from this pool. Currently at 23% of our total square footage, the pool will be an engine of growth for the remainder of this year and into the future. With that, I'll turn it back to you Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thanks, Tom. At Public Storage, our team continues to enhance the industry's strongest brand, highest quality portfolio, best revenue NOI and NOI margin, leading acquisition development and integration platforms, the lowest leverage and best cost of capital, the highest free cash flow conversion and strongest FFO and dividend growth over the past few years. With many things moving in the right direction, including improving operating fundamentals, transformation efforts that are further enhancing our advantages and a reinvigorated transaction market, we are excited about Public Storage's trajectory over the near, medium and long term. And finally, I'd like to make a call out to the full operations and asset management teams at Public Storage, during the two significant hurricanes. Fortunately, our employees and properties were well prepared, with safety as the top priority and we are grateful to have had relatively minor impact. With that, I'll turn the call back to Rob to open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. Maybe I'll start just big picture. I consider you guys to be conservative, especially with your outlook. So just given the time of the year, November, you've made a few comments here, not just about stabilization but actually improvement, which means it seems like you're saying you're going to end the year strong and again, it bodes well for 2025. I guess, can you talk about that a little bit more, the decision not just to talk about, okay, as you said, it's clear you see signs of stabilization. But it does seem like you're messaging pretty strongly here that you expect improvement into '25. And I guess, is that regardless of improving housing, et cetera?\nJoe Russell: So yeah, Jeff, there's a few things, obviously, that give us confidence that 2024 has become a year as we predicted of stabilization, where we've seen, as Tom and I noted in our opening comments, the progression of better and higher degrees of market improvement that we're seeing across more of the portfolio than we've certainly seen at the beginning of the year. That continues to trend. Now we're into the fourth quarter of 2024. Stabilization should fundamentally lead to improvement. So we're pleased by the continued trajectory we're seeing as we've spoken to stabilization. And with that, we're going to be in a better position going into 2025 than we were going into 2024. Many things are trending well. Additively, and then we'll see what impacts other effects could have too, whether it's an improved housing market, change in interest rates, continued growth in the economy, et cetera. But again, we're very pleased by what we continue to see through 2024.\nJeff Spector: Thanks. And just to clarify, I mean, again, improvement, you don't really need to -- if demand just continues as is, where you talked about improving demand for that demand has improved, if it stays as is versus the backdrop you described, including lower supply pressure in '25. That ties into your thoughts on improvement?\nTom Boyle: Yeah. I mean, I think there's a couple of things there, Jeff. I mean, we've been talking about stabilization of demand throughout this year. And in Joe's prepared remarks, he commented on that, including industry-wide demand. But we've been speaking all year to the fact that we've actually seen some improvement in a number of different markets. So some of the early markets we called out like Seattle, for instance, is still actually negative on revenue growth for the third quarter, but it's consistently improved quarter-by-quarter throughout this year. And so that's been a leading market that we've been observing and there are other markets like that and frankly, more. That doesn't mean that overall, we're seeing significant growth. Obviously, our outlook is still calling for same-store revenue growth to be down for the year, just a touch better than 1%. So as Joe spoke to in his remarks, the stabilization will take a little bit of time to roll through our financial metrics, but stabilization is the first step, and we've seen that across a number of markets, and we'll obviously update you on a path to recover as we move from here.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Seems like there's been an improvement in the move-in rents down 9% in the third quarter, down 5% in October. Is there any -- what do you think is driving that? And then also, can you provide the October occupancy update just to provide a little bit more context around the influence on street rates?\nTom Boyle: Yeah, sure. Happy to. So the -- as you noted we've continued to see improvements on move-in rents through the year. The October number is encouraging. And I would call out that it's driven by improving demand trends, right? When we started this year industry-wide demand was down still 20%. And we're in a point now in September October where it's roughly flat year-over-year. And so some may call that comps. But again, you need to lap those comps without setting fresh new lows to stabilize and that's what we're starting to see here. We've got some markets as I highlighted earlier that have move-in rent growth, as we sit here today, but some are certainly still setting fresh lows. So the dynamic there is a stabilization trend, as we've been anticipating heading in through the fourth quarter of this year. In terms of further October updates, occupancy is down about 90% -- or 90% down -- 90 basis points. As we sit here today, the move-in rents again down 5% for the month. Existing customers are performing well. Move-outs are again down year-over-year in the month. So continued encouraging trajectory from the existing customer base and really strengthened the consumer overall.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And you talked a little bit about demand improving and recognize -- and I think you kind of recognize that some of it is comparisons. But is there any other factors that are just driving demand in particular whether it's -- are you seeing a better housing turnover? Are you seeing a better demand from apartment renters? Just trying to get a sense of who is using the facilities more? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: Yeah. That's a great question, Michael. I think the demand picture has shifted over the last several years, right? We've talked about how the existing home sales driven demand has softened. The apartment renter activity has continued to be strong. And at the same time, we've seen more customers that are using storage that have ran out of space at home frankly record usage of that through this year. And overall, levels of demand pretty consistent year-over-year as we sit here entering into the fourth quarter. Speaking to housing specifically there is some encouraging pending home sales numbers that came out, yesterday we watch that all closely. But at this point what we're looking for again is stabilization and we're looking for not setting fresh lows i.e. not demand going lower from here and that's what we're starting to see across the portfolio.\nJoe Russell: And maybe Michael to add on one other thing. Again, no different, but consistent and very encouraging trend. Length of stays are still longer than pre-pandemic levels. We've seen with many of the things that Tom just spoke to customers continuing to retain space on average higher than what we saw certainly pre-pandemic. And again, with the stabilized set of metrics around delinquency and payment patterns, et cetera, no different view relative to the stable customer base that we are very pleased to have here at Public Storage.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter.\nJoe Russell: Great. Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSamir Khanal: Hi, Tom. As it relates to the move-in rates, you mentioned down 5% in October. I mean is there a way to kind of think about the trajectory of that move-in rates over the next, I don't know let's call it the next several quarters. I mean do we need the housing market to pick up to see that trend turn positive? Or help us think through that a little bit more please.\nTom Boyle: Sure. So as we've noted a number of times on the call already really what we're looking for is a stabilization and level of demand. As that stabilization occurs, you should see a stabilization in things like move-in rents and customer activity. And so in our outlook for the year, we've expected that move-in rents are down mid-single digits at the end of the year. So it feels like we're heading in that direction based on October performance. But then we're likely to hit the trough of the year just seasonally. And so without getting into specifics around assumptions for 2025, I would expect that we probably would start the year clearly at that sort of ZIP code and would take the lift of demand seasonally in the spring to meaningfully improve that number from that point.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. And then just on the \u2013 just shifting gears a little bit on the expense side. Payroll has been down this year in the quarter and even for the nine months ended September. Is that just a function of sort of higher e-rentals you're doing that dynamic? Trying to see how much further in terms of savings there is kind of into next year. Thanks.\nJoe Russell: Yes, Samir, I talked about the many advantages that we continue to lead in the industry relative to our digital platform. One key being the one you noted our e-rental, our digital leasing platform. So now with 70% to 75% of our customers using that channel, we continue to use that as one way of optimizing the way in which we're using employees and properties relative to their optimization and skill sets and the things that they can do even on a more focused basis. So it's worked well not only for a customer interaction but employee engagement and employee opportunities relative to as I mentioned, different specializations that we're putting through in different career paths, et cetera property management levels as well. So the great news that that leads to our levels of optimization that continues to work well not only for customers but for our employees as well.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. I was just curious in the markets where you've seen the biggest occupancy uplift. Are you seeing any greater signs of improved move-in pricing there? Or is the customer still just very elastic to that move-in price. I'm effectively just wondering if improving occupancy should be viewed as a leading indicator of pricing or if there are other dynamics that's preventing that from happening?\nTom Boyle: Sure. I would say it's improving demand trends overall, right? We're trying to balance both occupancy as well as rental rate to maximize revenue. So occupancy is certainly one thing you can look at. But just using Seattle as an example, as a market I highlighted earlier, occupancy there was up 35 basis points year-over-year and has positive move-in rent growth. So there's some \u2013 there's certainly some momentum in that market but it's not purely occupancy based.\nEric Wolfe: And I guess based on the test that you're doing, I'm assuming that you're adjusting your algorithms to test various price points and seeing how the customer is responding. Like are you seeing any decrease in that sort of elasticity of demand? Or when you adjust pricing like you see a big shift in revenue potential from potential changes in occupancy.\nTom Boyle: Yes. So I guess taking a step back, we're looking to try to optimize the revenue associated with customers that come in the door. And that \u2013 based on our understanding of what our inventory is likely to be and so we understand what likely rental units we have to offer our customers. And so we offer those online and in the store. At the same time we have an understanding about what demand is for that sort of unit at the local trade area level. And to your point around price sensitivity, we're consistently testing and augmenting our understanding of what that customer price elasticity is. But if you have an understanding of what your inventory is to sell and what the demand is for the unit and the price sensitivity, we're trying to optimize that equation to lead to the maximum revenue opportunity for Public Storage, given the amount of inventory we have there to rent. And what we continue to see is customers are competitive and price-sensitive to new customers but place a lot of value on those units once they move in. And that's been pretty consistent over time.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Luebchow: Hi. Great. Appreciate you taking the question. You touched on this a little bit about how you were encouraged by the transaction market picking up. It sounds like that's more likely into 2025. So maybe you could give us some color on where kind of bid-ask spreads are and what kind of stabilized yields you're seeing on transaction activity you're underwriting today?\nJoe Russell: Yes. Sure, Eric. We've spoken to this for the last few quarters which, there's been a lot of interest on sellers' behalf to potentially trade but factually very few have indeed done so. And we've got almost now a two-year track record where again industry transaction volumes have been quite low even on a historic level. So now, rounding out 2024 differently even than we've seen in prior quarters, the volume of not only those inquiries but again, even some additional assets coming through traditional brokerage channels and otherwise, there's momentum building. Again, it's tough to say yet what the bid/ask spread is going to be, because a lot of those transactions haven't been completed yet. We've had a lot of inbound calls both, again, from owners that are looking to us even on a private basis to potentially transact. So we're encouraged by the fact that again after two years, there's I think a landscape of different opportunities rounding out this year and going into 2025. We'll see how that plays out. But would say it'd be unusual for us to go into a third year of the low volumes that we've seen. And with that we're encouraged by the type of assets that are coming to market, both small and large. And the receptivity in a different way that owners have, I think settled out relative to their price expectations et cetera.\nEric Luebchow: Got you. That's helpful. And then I guess, secondly, I think you touched on kind of existing customer activity being a little bit better in terms of ECRIs than you previously expected. So maybe you can provide a little more color on that. Is that your ability to push rents to the newer customers coming in at lower rates or your longer duration customers that are more receptive to that? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nTom Boyle: Sure. Yes, I think it's a number of those factors you highlighted. The existing tenant pool continues to be strong, as Joe mentioned, really across the metrics that we monitor, be it payment patterns and delinquency, length of stays, vacate activity, customer price sensitivity to rental rate increase, all pointing to a very stable and strong existing customer base, which is encouraging and we've been pleasantly surprised as we move through this year. And really that was the primary driver of the lift in revenue outlook for the remainder of the year is just continued strong trends there. In terms of the rental rate program, in particular. it's a combination of the price sensitivity being very strong and frankly a touch better than we expected as well as the continued follow through, as you mentioned, of those newer customers that we've moved in over the past year and a half given our strong move-in volumes over that time period that give us more contribution really to the existing customer rent increase program.\nEric Luebchow: Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. Turning back to the move-in pricing. If you look at the promotional discount, they were up in the third quarter year-over-year. They also look like as a percentage of revenue one of the highest or percentage of move-in rents one of the higher numbers in the last year or so. So can you just talk a little bit about like what's driving that higher promotional discounts in the third quarter? And how we should think about that impact going forward maybe in the fourth quarter, because I know you talked about move-in rents that delta improving but I'm not sure how we should think about the promotional discounts in the fourth quarter.\nTom Boyle: Sure. Yes, promotional discounts, obviously, ebb and flow throughout the year based on really the -- at the unit level analysis and pricing strategies. We did use promotions a little bit more into the third quarter, but again, pretty modest still relative to historical trends. And so throughout the year, between 40% and 60% of our customers have received some sort of first month promotion. In the third quarter, it was closer to that 60% number. The comparison period in say 2019, for instance, would have been closer to 85% or 90%. So the -- there's no question that there continues to be an ability for us to utilize promotions as well as advertising as move-in rents to optimize that customer acquisition plan.\nNicholas Yulico: Okay. That's helpful, Tom. I guess just following up on that. Can you just remind us how that works for the promotional dollars like the timing and just the accounting treatment? Is that just all the money literally being spent as -- and it's a contra revenue account in the quarter? Or is there some sort of like amortization of the promotion?\nTom Boyle: Sure. Yeah. Our most popular promotion is the dollar special for the first month rent. And as you just highlighted that's a contra revenue discount that will be applied in that first month. And so if we move a customer in on September 1st, we're going to recognize $1 of revenue from that customer in rent.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. Appreciate it.\nTom Boyle: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nSpenser Allaway: Yeah. Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on the transaction landscape. In terms of what you're seeing marketed today, is it predominantly still the single asset deals? Or are there any portfolios being marketed today?\nJoe Russell: Yeah, Spenser it's a combination. The traditional smaller deal activities been with us. And again that's been still muted as I mentioned overall, but there's still a fair amount of individual or small asset activity in the market. But there are larger portfolios that are starting to surface. Again that's no different than what we've spoken to though over the last couple of years where we had a lot of private inquiries, particularly on some larger portfolios but there are now a few that are starting to come into the market through I would say both traditional processes and then still some of the again off-market conversations we're continuing to have as well.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Thanks. And then just on the ECRI front, if we do a rough back-of-the-envelope math like just given where move-in rents were for the quarter, it does appear that rent bumps were maybe a little bit higher in the quarter. Is that fair to say? And are you able to just give us an idea of where you see ECRIs ending the year on an annual basis?\nTom Boyle: Yeah. Just given what I had spoken to in terms of their performing better in the third quarter I would agree the contribution in the third quarter was a little bit better year-over-year. But would go back to the commentary I just made around, a lot of that's driven by those newer customers that we moved in over the last 12 to 18 months and their contribution to that program really driving it versus a change in strategy or otherwise.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you so much.\nTom Boyle: Thanks, Spenser.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, thanks for the time. Just on the acquisitions market, recognizing there hasn't been a ton of actual deals closing, but just curious on your expectations for cap rates. I believe earlier in the year you were looking for 6%-plus, initial yields or stabilized yields. So just curious if that's moved down as the general market has improved from a REIT's cost to capital perspective and rates have come down at least on the unsecured side. So just curious on your latest expectations on pricing and cap rates or where you'd be willing to do deals?\nTom Boyle: Yeah. Thanks Juan. Good question. And I would generally say that the way you characterize it is pretty consistent and has been for some time, meaning that we're still looking for stabilized yields that are in the 6% sort of ZIP codes. And what that typically means is we're acquiring things in the fives. And, obviously, that was the case for Simply last year probably the largest private transaction that we've been speaking to, but that's been consistent for the last year or so and that's the current state of play. Obviously as more transactions occur here over the next couple of quarters we'll have more to talk about on cap rates. But that's the right sort of ZIP code to be thinking about.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay, great. And then just curious if you could talk a little bit about the strategy or thinking behind the COO hiring and what you expect the seat to bring or the person to bring as a result of the addition?\nJoe Russell: Yeah, sure. Obviously without question as you've seen and track the things that we're doing relative to our investment in all the tools, digital optimization, the advantages that we're continuing to deploy through our scale our brand and everything that again drives operations day-to-day, the leadership tied to that is incredibly critical as well. So we're excited about Chris Sambar joining us, great experience with a very solid career at AT&T for over 20 years, certainly understands many of the components of what drives our business particularly technology and infrastructure-related great experience with running large teams within the AT&T platform. In his last role he had over 25,000 employees reporting to him. So these are all key attributes that we're excited to bring into the senior leadership ranks. And we're very confident he's going to be able to put a strong mark on the business operations and otherwise.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Thomas: Yeah. Hi, thanks. I wanted to go back to the promotions in the quarter and some of the commentary there and ask about the use of promotions in October as we think about the down 5% move-in rent and the improvement that you saw there relative to the third quarter. And then I think in the past you previously indicated that the use of promotions on some level may have attracted a slightly lower lifetime value customer. Has that changed now? Or are you seeing a better response and sort of stronger customer entering the portfolio with the use of promotions?\nTom Boyle: Sure. That's a multipart question, there we'll get into. So in October, I'd say, year-over-year promotions pretty consistent to prior year. The driver of the promotions in the third quarter was just a different mix of promotions. So we used a little bit less of the 50% off and a little bit more of the dollar special. So -- and that's just more tactically on the ground. In terms of the promotions you're right, different promotions have different profiles. They attract customers and ultimately are used based on the amount of inventory we have to sell, the pricing dynamics in the local market and are tuned to try to maximize revenue over the medium-term in conjunction again with advertising and move-in rental rates.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then, my second question, I wanted to just ask or trying to try to clarify the occupancy update that you provided for October was that -- did you mean a decrease from September so down 90 basis points? Or do you mean that the year-over-year decrease at the end of October is down 90 basis points. Can you just clarify and maybe just provide an occupancy rate for where the portfolio sits today?\nTom Boyle: Yeah. That's a good clarification there, Todd. What I was speaking to was 90 basis points year-over-year. And as we've talked about through this year, we had a little bit more occupancy up-tick through the summer and have anticipated a little bit more occupancy decline into the fall. And we've seen that play out kind of as anticipated. And we're anticipating through the year at our last outlook update we said, down 80 basis points on average. Given the increase in the outlook, it's probably down closer to 70 basis points on average through the year from here. But continue to see a closing of that gap overall on a year-over-year basis, but some different seasonal patterns through the year. And then in terms of quarter end occupancy or month end occupancy obviously we haven't closed the month of October, but it will be pretty similar to where we ended September. But obviously that's not a number that you often see. So -- but just seasonally you don't see a big move there, so just a touch lower than where we finished September.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRon Kamdem: Hey, just following up on the stabilization comments. I think you talked about different markets and obviously move-in rents sort of improving. But anything on sort of the website data and the website visits any other sort of data points that are sort of confirming that story would be helpful.\nTom Boyle: Yeah. So we've talked about industry-wide demand and that really reaching parity as we moved into September and October that's been really encouraging and we've continued to see good traction from web visits through our platform as well. Really a combination of strong web visits that are in positive territory year-over-year as well as good conversion rates frankly online and through our different channels to the store.\nRon Kamdem: And then just my second one was I think you've been interesting stat on 70% to 75%. I think I heard that right through the channel. Just wondering as you're thinking about over the next three to five years is that sort of optimal? Is there more room there? And what the implication could be on cost savings?\nTom Boyle: Yes. No, I think that's right. So, about 75% of our customers are utilizing a digital channel to complete their rental and that's a number that's grown pretty steadily over the last several years. And just a reminder, we're not providing any sort of incentive for customers to utilize that as the way to complete their rental agreement. But customers continue to embrace it and frankly more and more year-over-year. And so we're optimistic that more customers will choose that channel to complete their rental agreement before they arrive at the property over the next several years and that will lead to continued optimization alternatives that Joe spoke to earlier in terms of providing that win-win-win both for customers and how they choose to complete their rentals our employees and how we think about their career opportunities specialization and centralization that we've utilized as well as the financial impact.\nJoe Russell: Yes. And Ron I'd add too. It's certainly a very impactful channel and the infrastructure and the effectiveness of our digital platform is certainly playing through relative to speed, effectiveness, et cetera that customers are embracing. We also as I noted in my opening comments now have about 2 million users on our PS app that tool as well again is additive to the way customers are interacting with us is much easier from an account management standpoint, communication standpoint, et cetera. So, we're bolting on and building a very robust environment. The customers as Tom mentioned are not being incentivized by us to use these tools. They're telling us these are tools they want and they're gravitating to them very aggressively. So, we'll still provide when customers require it face-to-face interaction with again our skilled property managers at properties, but this is one additional way for them to have that much more of an effective transaction with us. And then from an ongoing relationship standpoint it's a different level of service we can provide them through the PS app as well.\nRon Kamdem: Okay, that\u2019s it from me. Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi everyone. I don't think this has been talked about yet but we talked about acquisitions and the volume. It looks like guidance is reduced for the year but you mentioned the pent-up seller dialogue. So, is that just timing and you expect an above-average January or have some deals fallen off or some mixture?\nTom Boyle: Yes, you hit it. It's just a timing element which is we have been anticipating that the transaction market would improve throughout the year and it has. But just in terms of the level of dialogue it's really picked up over the last 60 to 90 days. And so a good bit of the activity that we're speaking about is likely to fall in the start of 2025 versus finishing out closing in 2024. But obviously you saw we had under contract a pickup in acquisition volumes and we have more to come on that front as we close out the year, but some of it will slip into 2025.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. And then maybe just on your own development. I was wondering if you could give a sense of your own pace of development deliveries in 2024 and how you think that will end up comparing to 2025 and 2026. Is a pretty consistent increasing decreasing or your goals?\nJoe Russell: So, yes, Caitlin this will be a record year of deliveries for us from a development standpoint. So, we'll finish out 2024 with about $430 million of development deliveries that includes both ground-up new construction as well as redevelopment. The work and the timing of consistent level of deliveries year-to-year can be somewhat challenging particularly with many of the hurdles that we're facing with development across multiple markets, longer entitlement times, more complicated improvement processes, different areas of the business from a development standpoint, that create more risk and much of that's time related. So, we're going to see a bit of a drop going into 2025. And with that, we'll continue to work to elevate the amount of deliveries we'll see in 2026 and beyond. So the team's doing a great job, developing and redeveloping great new assets, giving us more scale in markets. And with the record amount of deliveries this year, it was a great bar to hit and we're going to challenge ourselves to match, if not exceed that in subsequent years. But 2025, we'll see a slight decrease in deliveries.\nQ \u2013 Caitlin Burrows: Thanks.\nTom Boyle: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nQ \u2013 Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe on the labor front, how do you balance the labor saving -- cost savings versus the risk of reducing on-site staff too much? I'm sure, you're cognizant of this risk. Just how you monitor and how you think about it?\nJoe Russell: Yes. That's part of what we've been very diligent about making sure that we're using a variety of different tools analytically and otherwise to not only property by property understand, the impacts of the way that we've been changing our operating model, that may give us the opportunities as I've spoken about to reset the type of skills and labor that we have with properties to properties, but we've got growing sets of analytics that help to predictively look at staffing levels, because sometimes properties are busy for instance, beginning end of the month, or it could be because of some seasonality issues that may be different times of the month, different times of a week. So, we've got a lot of very interesting and growing analytics that are helping us optimize the ability to put our own people where we know they're going to be able to serve customers even more effectively. Part of that also relates to the specialized roles that our platform has been able to create within our property management ranks. So, a lot of great tools that give us the confidence, that we've got a very good balance. And as I mentioned earlier, customers are gravitating to this quite effectively as well. We've got a vibrant back channel that's become more and more effective through our care center, as well. So we've got many tools, even beyond just the amount of labor that's resident at a particular property that actually enhances the amount of service that we can provide to customers.\nQ \u2013 Brendan Lynch: Great. That's, helpful. And my other question is just on kind of market strength. Tom, you called out Seattle as being particularly strong. I think Florida, has been weaker in some of the past quarters. Maybe just give us an update on, which ones are performing best, which ones are still struggling a bit.\nTom Boyle: Yes. So we've provided a good list of markets that have started to accelerate earlier in the year. So I mentioned Seattle, but the DCs and San Franciscos, as well. The markets that we've highlighted that are still working through normalization continue to be those that were really the highest flyers through the 2021 and 2022 time period. So a market like Atlanta, for instance, has that normalization, but also some new supply to work through. And so that's how I would characterize the performance. That said, even those markets that maybe are having a tougher go at it, if you look at overall changes in same-store revenue growth year-over-year you're starting to see some improvement in some of those markets like in Orlando, for instance. For the quarter, revenue was down 6.1%, but that's frankly starting to improve from there. And so, some of those initial indications of stabilization are occurring in a few of those markets as well, even those that had really strong performance in 2021 and 2022. On the West Coast of Florida, you highlighted Florida specifically, Joe highlighted the hurricane impact. We disclosed that that's likely to have about a $7 million impact financially. But at the same time, the customer traffic on the West Coast of Florida has impacted and we want to be there to help serve those customer bases as they seek to rebuild on the West Coast of Florida. And so we've seen an increase in move-in activity and occupancy there related to the storm activity and really the storm rebuilding.\nQ \u2013 Brendan Lynch: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning. Just going back to some of the comments on stabilization. Correct me if I'm wrong but last October I thought you guys cut rates pretty deeply. So when you talk about stabilization. How do you take that into account? And when you look at rent trends sequentially does that paint a similar story of improvement?\nTom Boyle: Yes. I think there's a few things there. One I'm giving you a rent number in October that is kind of an apples-to-apples rent number. And again we're looking for move-in rents to be in the kind of down single-digits towards the end of the year and I think we're on track for that.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And on the hurricane impact how much NOI benefit did you get on the portfolio level from people maybe moving in?\nTom Boyle: Well I just highlighted the fact that actually we'll have a financial cost associated with the storms. And as I noted we are seeing some move-in activities, but I think it's too early to tell to talk about NOI impact overall. But no question we've had some cleanup work to do at a few of our properties that were impacted and those are getting right back online. Frankly most of them are back online serving customers as we sit right here. And as Joe mentioned relatively modest impact overall and relatively fortunate given where the storm came through.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Mueller: Yes. Hi. Going back to development. Can you talk a little bit about your land positioning and the visibility to kind of keep the development engine going? For example how many years of development starts do you control?\nJoe Russell: I'll speak in general terms Mike as far as our strategy around land holdings and then we can give you a little bit more color more specifically to your question. But what we more often than not do in a vast majority of the development transactions is we'll take control of a parcel depending on the timing for entitlements and other permitted processes you have to go through. We have a contractual option on the land. We don't own the property itself. So that's far more typical than just putting a big land inventory on our balance sheet. So we'll typically acquire a property. And again this would be a vacant parcel once we've gotten through what we feel are necessary and any risk-related improvements. So once we get to that point we'll go ahead and take ownership of the land site. But frankly more often than not we're literally ready to build as we do that. Tom I don't know if you got a specific number to point to relative to overall holdings but...\nTom Boyle: Yes. We own about $60 million worth of land in that context given the strategy that Joe just highlighted.\nMike Mueller: And out of curiosity that $60 million of land that gives you about what in terms of total expected investment what's buildable on that?\nTom Boyle: Yes, that's going to give you ability. Obviously, part of our activity is redevelopment as well. So as you think about that $60 million that gives us visibility over the next couple of years. And as Joe mentioned, we've got an ability to see further than that based on the agreements we have in place with landowners.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Great. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Rob and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Have a great Halloween and we'll talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. With fundamentals improving and the team keenly focused on transformation and optimization initiatives, we are very well positioned with signs that the acquisition market is picking up. We see more one-off deals, more portfolios and evidence of convergence around buyer and seller expectations, following a quiet couple of years. Our growth-oriented capital and liquidity profile, is strong. Industry-leading leverage, balance sheet capacity and cost of capital have us poised to execute on pent-up seller dialogue in combination with our operational and acquisition integration advantages. Shifting to our third quarter financial performance. We achieved core FFO of $4.20 per share representing a 3% decline compared to last year. Revenues in our same-store portfolio of stabilized properties declined 1.3% compared to last year, with a relatively even balance between rent and occupancy. A couple of important things to note, regarding the stabilization that Joe spoke to. First, the second derivative of growth continues to improve. Revenue growth in the quarter, decelerated 30 basis points sequentially relative to the growth in the second quarter of this year. This is significant improvement from the 380 basis points of deceleration reported from the second to third quarter of last year. Secondly, as implied by our guidance midpoint, we expect our nominal same-store revenue growth to begin improving due to the positive trends that Joe described. At the midpoint, the fourth quarter would be the first sequential growth improvement in more than two years. Moving now to the outlook. We reiterated our core FFO guidance of $16.50 to $16.85 per share, rolling through higher third quarter G&A and lower third quarter ancillary income while lifting our same-store revenue outlook for the year. The strong performance of our non-same-store pool continues. We increased the outlook for our incremental NOI from this pool of assets in 2025 and beyond through stabilization to $120 million in total to come from this pool. Currently at 23% of our total square footage, the pool will be an engine of growth for the remainder of this year and into the future. With that, I'll turn it back to you Joe. Yeah. I mean, I think there's a couple of things there, Jeff. I mean, we've been talking about stabilization of demand throughout this year. And in Joe's prepared remarks, he commented on that, including industry-wide demand. But we've been speaking all year to the fact that we've actually seen some improvement in a number of different markets. So some of the early markets we called out like Seattle, for instance, is still actually negative on revenue growth for the third quarter, but it's consistently improved quarter-by-quarter throughout this year. And so that's been a leading market that we've been observing and there are other markets like that and frankly, more. That doesn't mean that overall, we're seeing significant growth. Obviously, our outlook is still calling for same-store revenue growth to be down for the year, just a touch better than 1%. So as Joe spoke to in his remarks, the stabilization will take a little bit of time to roll through our financial metrics, but stabilization is the first step, and we've seen that across a number of markets, and we'll obviously update you on a path to recover as we move from here. Yeah, sure. Happy to. So the -- as you noted we've continued to see improvements on move-in rents through the year. The October number is encouraging. And I would call out that it's driven by improving demand trends, right? When we started this year industry-wide demand was down still 20%. And we're in a point now in September October where it's roughly flat year-over-year. And so some may call that comps. But again, you need to lap those comps without setting fresh new lows to stabilize and that's what we're starting to see here. We've got some markets as I highlighted earlier that have move-in rent growth, as we sit here today, but some are certainly still setting fresh lows. So the dynamic there is a stabilization trend, as we've been anticipating heading in through the fourth quarter of this year. In terms of further October updates, occupancy is down about 90% -- or 90% down -- 90 basis points. As we sit here today, the move-in rents again down 5% for the month. Existing customers are performing well. Move-outs are again down year-over-year in the month. So continued encouraging trajectory from the existing customer base and really strengthened the consumer overall. Yeah. That's a great question, Michael. I think the demand picture has shifted over the last several years, right? We've talked about how the existing home sales driven demand has softened. The apartment renter activity has continued to be strong. And at the same time, we've seen more customers that are using storage that have ran out of space at home frankly record usage of that through this year. And overall, levels of demand pretty consistent year-over-year as we sit here entering into the fourth quarter. Speaking to housing specifically there is some encouraging pending home sales numbers that came out, yesterday we watch that all closely. But at this point what we're looking for again is stabilization and we're looking for not setting fresh lows i.e. not demand going lower from here and that's what we're starting to see across the portfolio. Sure. So as we've noted a number of times on the call already really what we're looking for is a stabilization and level of demand. As that stabilization occurs, you should see a stabilization in things like move-in rents and customer activity. And so in our outlook for the year, we've expected that move-in rents are down mid-single digits at the end of the year. So it feels like we're heading in that direction based on October performance. But then we're likely to hit the trough of the year just seasonally. And so without getting into specifics around assumptions for 2025, I would expect that we probably would start the year clearly at that sort of ZIP code and would take the lift of demand seasonally in the spring to meaningfully improve that number from that point. Sure. I would say it's improving demand trends overall, right? We're trying to balance both occupancy as well as rental rate to maximize revenue. So occupancy is certainly one thing you can look at. But just using Seattle as an example, as a market I highlighted earlier, occupancy there was up 35 basis points year-over-year and has positive move-in rent growth. So there's some \u2013 there's certainly some momentum in that market but it's not purely occupancy based. Yes. So I guess taking a step back, we're looking to try to optimize the revenue associated with customers that come in the door. And that \u2013 based on our understanding of what our inventory is likely to be and so we understand what likely rental units we have to offer our customers. And so we offer those online and in the store. At the same time we have an understanding about what demand is for that sort of unit at the local trade area level. And to your point around price sensitivity, we're consistently testing and augmenting our understanding of what that customer price elasticity is. But if you have an understanding of what your inventory is to sell and what the demand is for the unit and the price sensitivity, we're trying to optimize that equation to lead to the maximum revenue opportunity for Public Storage, given the amount of inventory we have there to rent. And what we continue to see is customers are competitive and price-sensitive to new customers but place a lot of value on those units once they move in. And that's been pretty consistent over time. Sure. Yes, I think it's a number of those factors you highlighted. The existing tenant pool continues to be strong, as Joe mentioned, really across the metrics that we monitor, be it payment patterns and delinquency, length of stays, vacate activity, customer price sensitivity to rental rate increase, all pointing to a very stable and strong existing customer base, which is encouraging and we've been pleasantly surprised as we move through this year. And really that was the primary driver of the lift in revenue outlook for the remainder of the year is just continued strong trends there. In terms of the rental rate program, in particular. it's a combination of the price sensitivity being very strong and frankly a touch better than we expected as well as the continued follow through, as you mentioned, of those newer customers that we've moved in over the past year and a half given our strong move-in volumes over that time period that give us more contribution really to the existing customer rent increase program. Thanks. Sure. Yes, promotional discounts, obviously, ebb and flow throughout the year based on really the -- at the unit level analysis and pricing strategies. We did use promotions a little bit more into the third quarter, but again, pretty modest still relative to historical trends. And so throughout the year, between 40% and 60% of our customers have received some sort of first month promotion. In the third quarter, it was closer to that 60% number. The comparison period in say 2019, for instance, would have been closer to 85% or 90%. So the -- there's no question that there continues to be an ability for us to utilize promotions as well as advertising as move-in rents to optimize that customer acquisition plan. Sure. Yeah. Our most popular promotion is the dollar special for the first month rent. And as you just highlighted that's a contra revenue discount that will be applied in that first month. And so if we move a customer in on September 1st, we're going to recognize $1 of revenue from that customer in rent. Thanks. Yeah. Just given what I had spoken to in terms of their performing better in the third quarter I would agree the contribution in the third quarter was a little bit better year-over-year. But would go back to the commentary I just made around, a lot of that's driven by those newer customers that we moved in over the last 12 to 18 months and their contribution to that program really driving it versus a change in strategy or otherwise. Thanks, Spenser. Yeah. Thanks Juan. Good question. And I would generally say that the way you characterize it is pretty consistent and has been for some time, meaning that we're still looking for stabilized yields that are in the 6% sort of ZIP codes. And what that typically means is we're acquiring things in the fives. And, obviously, that was the case for Simply last year probably the largest private transaction that we've been speaking to, but that's been consistent for the last year or so and that's the current state of play. Obviously as more transactions occur here over the next couple of quarters we'll have more to talk about on cap rates. But that's the right sort of ZIP code to be thinking about. Thank you. Sure. That's a multipart question, there we'll get into. So in October, I'd say, year-over-year promotions pretty consistent to prior year. The driver of the promotions in the third quarter was just a different mix of promotions. So we used a little bit less of the 50% off and a little bit more of the dollar special. So -- and that's just more tactically on the ground. In terms of the promotions you're right, different promotions have different profiles. They attract customers and ultimately are used based on the amount of inventory we have to sell, the pricing dynamics in the local market and are tuned to try to maximize revenue over the medium-term in conjunction again with advertising and move-in rental rates. Yeah. That's a good clarification there, Todd. What I was speaking to was 90 basis points year-over-year. And as we've talked about through this year, we had a little bit more occupancy up-tick through the summer and have anticipated a little bit more occupancy decline into the fall. And we've seen that play out kind of as anticipated. And we're anticipating through the year at our last outlook update we said, down 80 basis points on average. Given the increase in the outlook, it's probably down closer to 70 basis points on average through the year from here. But continue to see a closing of that gap overall on a year-over-year basis, but some different seasonal patterns through the year. And then in terms of quarter end occupancy or month end occupancy obviously we haven't closed the month of October, but it will be pretty similar to where we ended September. But obviously that's not a number that you often see. So -- but just seasonally you don't see a big move there, so just a touch lower than where we finished September. Yeah. So we've talked about industry-wide demand and that really reaching parity as we moved into September and October that's been really encouraging and we've continued to see good traction from web visits through our platform as well. Really a combination of strong web visits that are in positive territory year-over-year as well as good conversion rates frankly online and through our different channels to the store. Yes. No, I think that's right. So, about 75% of our customers are utilizing a digital channel to complete their rental and that's a number that's grown pretty steadily over the last several years. And just a reminder, we're not providing any sort of incentive for customers to utilize that as the way to complete their rental agreement. But customers continue to embrace it and frankly more and more year-over-year. And so we're optimistic that more customers will choose that channel to complete their rental agreement before they arrive at the property over the next several years and that will lead to continued optimization alternatives that Joe spoke to earlier in terms of providing that win-win-win both for customers and how they choose to complete their rentals our employees and how we think about their career opportunities specialization and centralization that we've utilized as well as the financial impact. Yes, you hit it. It's just a timing element which is we have been anticipating that the transaction market would improve throughout the year and it has. But just in terms of the level of dialogue it's really picked up over the last 60 to 90 days. And so a good bit of the activity that we're speaking about is likely to fall in the start of 2025 versus finishing out closing in 2024. But obviously you saw we had under contract a pickup in acquisition volumes and we have more to come on that front as we close out the year, but some of it will slip into 2025. Thank you. Yes. So we've provided a good list of markets that have started to accelerate earlier in the year. So I mentioned Seattle, but the DCs and San Franciscos, as well. The markets that we've highlighted that are still working through normalization continue to be those that were really the highest flyers through the 2021 and 2022 time period. So a market like Atlanta, for instance, has that normalization, but also some new supply to work through. And so that's how I would characterize the performance. That said, even those markets that maybe are having a tougher go at it, if you look at overall changes in same-store revenue growth year-over-year you're starting to see some improvement in some of those markets like in Orlando, for instance. For the quarter, revenue was down 6.1%, but that's frankly starting to improve from there. And so, some of those initial indications of stabilization are occurring in a few of those markets as well, even those that had really strong performance in 2021 and 2022. On the West Coast of Florida, you highlighted Florida specifically, Joe highlighted the hurricane impact. We disclosed that that's likely to have about a $7 million impact financially. But at the same time, the customer traffic on the West Coast of Florida has impacted and we want to be there to help serve those customer bases as they seek to rebuild on the West Coast of Florida. And so we've seen an increase in move-in activity and occupancy there related to the storm activity and really the storm rebuilding.\nQ \u2013 Brendan Lynch: Great. Thank you. Yes. I think there's a few things there. One I'm giving you a rent number in October that is kind of an apples-to-apples rent number. And again we're looking for move-in rents to be in the kind of down single-digits towards the end of the year and I think we're on track for that. Well I just highlighted the fact that actually we'll have a financial cost associated with the storms. And as I noted we are seeing some move-in activities, but I think it's too early to tell to talk about NOI impact overall. But no question we've had some cleanup work to do at a few of our properties that were impacted and those are getting right back online. Frankly most of them are back online serving customers as we sit right here. And as Joe mentioned relatively modest impact overall and relatively fortunate given where the storm came through. Thanks. Yes. We own about $60 million worth of land in that context given the strategy that Joe just highlighted. Yes, that's going to give you ability. Obviously, part of our activity is redevelopment as well. So as you think about that $60 million that gives us visibility over the next couple of years. And as Joe mentioned, we've got an ability to see further than that based on the agreements we have in place with landowners. Great. Thanks, Mike."

            "name": "Joe Russell",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our recent performance and updated views. Then we'll open the call up for Q&A. As we anticipated, operating fundamentals are stabilizing across our portfolio in the broader industry. We started the year with sequential revenue growth acceleration in a handful of markets. We are now achieving acceleration across most markets and expect the trend to continue. The improvement will be gradual and take some time to be fully reflected in our reported financial results. But as we'll discuss today many things are moving in the right direction for Public Storage. In particular pricing for new customers is stabilizing with move-in rents down 9% year-over-year in the third quarter and down 5% in October. This is a meaningful improvement from the first quarter of this year when move-in rents were down 16%. Our in-place customers are also behaving very well. Payment patterns are strong, average length of stay is long and move-outs are down year-to-date. All of this speaks to the convenience and affordability we provide to our customers. With move-in rents down nearly 30% since 2022, we have become even more affordable relative to other space alternatives. including moving into a larger home or apartment just to get the incremental space. Self-storage is the affordable and convenient choice. The supply environment is also on a favorable path with deliveries of new competitive properties slowing further over the next couple of years. Less new competition will support operating fundamentals on top of the improving demand trends. We continue to focus on growth enhancing initiatives that are unique to us as well. Public Storage customers are fully embracing the new and modern experience we've created by putting a full slate of digital engagement options in their hands. These options complement the service provided by our fantastic property managers, local teams and customer care center representatives. The ability to choose between interacting digitally and in-person is a major draw to customer seeking self-storage today. I am proud of the entire team's efforts in creating the industry's most comprehensive, hybrid, digital operating model that cohesively connects our customers, team and systems across field and corporate operations. And we're tracking ahead of schedule on our transformation with now 75% move-ins using eRental, our digital online lease. We have nearly two million PS app users and on a daily basis, tenants across our entire portfolio using our digital property access and remote customer service. The transformation is amounting to a win-win-win across our customers, team members and financial performance. Through it, we have created more specialized and career-advancing roles across the company. New opportunities for our property managers have been particularly well received, as they now have career paths that aren't available elsewhere in the industry. Due in part to these efforts, we are proud to have received the Great place to Work designation, for a third year in a row. Another area of focus is utilities. We have reduced usage by 30% through conversion to LED lighting across the portfolio, and installing solar power at more than 800 properties so far. We recently increased our solar goal to 1,300 properties by the end of 2025. The team has innovated and implemented at a rapid pace over the past few years. We are fully in gear and are excited about more to come. Now, Tom will provide additional detail. Thanks, Tom. At Public Storage, our team continues to enhance the industry's strongest brand, highest quality portfolio, best revenue NOI and NOI margin, leading acquisition development and integration platforms, the lowest leverage and best cost of capital, the highest free cash flow conversion and strongest FFO and dividend growth over the past few years. With many things moving in the right direction, including improving operating fundamentals, transformation efforts that are further enhancing our advantages and a reinvigorated transaction market, we are excited about Public Storage's trajectory over the near, medium and long term. And finally, I'd like to make a call out to the full operations and asset management teams at Public Storage, during the two significant hurricanes. Fortunately, our employees and properties were well prepared, with safety as the top priority and we are grateful to have had relatively minor impact. With that, I'll turn the call back to Rob to open it up for Q&A. So yeah, Jeff, there's a few things, obviously, that give us confidence that 2024 has become a year as we predicted of stabilization, where we've seen, as Tom and I noted in our opening comments, the progression of better and higher degrees of market improvement that we're seeing across more of the portfolio than we've certainly seen at the beginning of the year. That continues to trend. Now we're into the fourth quarter of 2024. Stabilization should fundamentally lead to improvement. So we're pleased by the continued trajectory we're seeing as we've spoken to stabilization. And with that, we're going to be in a better position going into 2025 than we were going into 2024. Many things are trending well. Additively, and then we'll see what impacts other effects could have too, whether it's an improved housing market, change in interest rates, continued growth in the economy, et cetera. But again, we're very pleased by what we continue to see through 2024. And maybe Michael to add on one other thing. Again, no different, but consistent and very encouraging trend. Length of stays are still longer than pre-pandemic levels. We've seen with many of the things that Tom just spoke to customers continuing to retain space on average higher than what we saw certainly pre-pandemic. And again, with the stabilized set of metrics around delinquency and payment patterns, et cetera, no different view relative to the stable customer base that we are very pleased to have here at Public Storage. Great. Thank you, Michael. Yes, Samir, I talked about the many advantages that we continue to lead in the industry relative to our digital platform. One key being the one you noted our e-rental, our digital leasing platform. So now with 70% to 75% of our customers using that channel, we continue to use that as one way of optimizing the way in which we're using employees and properties relative to their optimization and skill sets and the things that they can do even on a more focused basis. So it's worked well not only for a customer interaction but employee engagement and employee opportunities relative to as I mentioned, different specializations that we're putting through in different career paths, et cetera property management levels as well. So the great news that that leads to our levels of optimization that continues to work well not only for customers but for our employees as well. Thank you. Yes. Sure, Eric. We've spoken to this for the last few quarters which, there's been a lot of interest on sellers' behalf to potentially trade but factually very few have indeed done so. And we've got almost now a two-year track record where again industry transaction volumes have been quite low even on a historic level. So now, rounding out 2024 differently even than we've seen in prior quarters, the volume of not only those inquiries but again, even some additional assets coming through traditional brokerage channels and otherwise, there's momentum building. Again, it's tough to say yet what the bid/ask spread is going to be, because a lot of those transactions haven't been completed yet. We've had a lot of inbound calls both, again, from owners that are looking to us even on a private basis to potentially transact. So we're encouraged by the fact that again after two years, there's I think a landscape of different opportunities rounding out this year and going into 2025. We'll see how that plays out. But would say it'd be unusual for us to go into a third year of the low volumes that we've seen. And with that we're encouraged by the type of assets that are coming to market, both small and large. And the receptivity in a different way that owners have, I think settled out relative to their price expectations et cetera. Yeah, Spenser it's a combination. The traditional smaller deal activities been with us. And again that's been still muted as I mentioned overall, but there's still a fair amount of individual or small asset activity in the market. But there are larger portfolios that are starting to surface. Again that's no different than what we've spoken to though over the last couple of years where we had a lot of private inquiries, particularly on some larger portfolios but there are now a few that are starting to come into the market through I would say both traditional processes and then still some of the again off-market conversations we're continuing to have as well. Yeah, sure. Obviously without question as you've seen and track the things that we're doing relative to our investment in all the tools, digital optimization, the advantages that we're continuing to deploy through our scale our brand and everything that again drives operations day-to-day, the leadership tied to that is incredibly critical as well. So we're excited about Chris Sambar joining us, great experience with a very solid career at AT&T for over 20 years, certainly understands many of the components of what drives our business particularly technology and infrastructure-related great experience with running large teams within the AT&T platform. In his last role he had over 25,000 employees reporting to him. So these are all key attributes that we're excited to bring into the senior leadership ranks. And we're very confident he's going to be able to put a strong mark on the business operations and otherwise. Yes. And Ron I'd add too. It's certainly a very impactful channel and the infrastructure and the effectiveness of our digital platform is certainly playing through relative to speed, effectiveness, et cetera that customers are embracing. We also as I noted in my opening comments now have about 2 million users on our PS app that tool as well again is additive to the way customers are interacting with us is much easier from an account management standpoint, communication standpoint, et cetera. So, we're bolting on and building a very robust environment. The customers as Tom mentioned are not being incentivized by us to use these tools. They're telling us these are tools they want and they're gravitating to them very aggressively. So, we'll still provide when customers require it face-to-face interaction with again our skilled property managers at properties, but this is one additional way for them to have that much more of an effective transaction with us. And then from an ongoing relationship standpoint it's a different level of service we can provide them through the PS app as well. Okay. Thank you. So, yes, Caitlin this will be a record year of deliveries for us from a development standpoint. So, we'll finish out 2024 with about $430 million of development deliveries that includes both ground-up new construction as well as redevelopment. The work and the timing of consistent level of deliveries year-to-year can be somewhat challenging particularly with many of the hurdles that we're facing with development across multiple markets, longer entitlement times, more complicated improvement processes, different areas of the business from a development standpoint, that create more risk and much of that's time related. So, we're going to see a bit of a drop going into 2025. And with that, we'll continue to work to elevate the amount of deliveries we'll see in 2026 and beyond. So the team's doing a great job, developing and redeveloping great new assets, giving us more scale in markets. And with the record amount of deliveries this year, it was a great bar to hit and we're going to challenge ourselves to match, if not exceed that in subsequent years. But 2025, we'll see a slight decrease in deliveries.\nQ \u2013 Caitlin Burrows: Thanks. Yes. That's part of what we've been very diligent about making sure that we're using a variety of different tools analytically and otherwise to not only property by property understand, the impacts of the way that we've been changing our operating model, that may give us the opportunities as I've spoken about to reset the type of skills and labor that we have with properties to properties, but we've got growing sets of analytics that help to predictively look at staffing levels, because sometimes properties are busy for instance, beginning end of the month, or it could be because of some seasonality issues that may be different times of the month, different times of a week. So, we've got a lot of very interesting and growing analytics that are helping us optimize the ability to put our own people where we know they're going to be able to serve customers even more effectively. Part of that also relates to the specialized roles that our platform has been able to create within our property management ranks. So, a lot of great tools that give us the confidence, that we've got a very good balance. And as I mentioned earlier, customers are gravitating to this quite effectively as well. We've got a vibrant back channel that's become more and more effective through our care center, as well. So we've got many tools, even beyond just the amount of labor that's resident at a particular property that actually enhances the amount of service that we can provide to customers.\nQ \u2013 Brendan Lynch: Great. That's, helpful. And my other question is just on kind of market strength. Tom, you called out Seattle as being particularly strong. I think Florida, has been weaker in some of the past quarters. Maybe just give us an update on, which ones are performing best, which ones are still struggling a bit. I'll speak in general terms Mike as far as our strategy around land holdings and then we can give you a little bit more color more specifically to your question. But what we more often than not do in a vast majority of the development transactions is we'll take control of a parcel depending on the timing for entitlements and other permitted processes you have to go through. We have a contractual option on the land. We don't own the property itself. So that's far more typical than just putting a big land inventory on our balance sheet. So we'll typically acquire a property. And again this would be a vacant parcel once we've gotten through what we feel are necessary and any risk-related improvements. So once we get to that point we'll go ahead and take ownership of the land site. But frankly more often than not we're literally ready to build as we do that. Tom I don't know if you got a specific number to point to relative to overall holdings but..."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ryan Burke. Thank you. You may begin.\nRyan Burke: Thank you, Rob. Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, July 31st, 2024, and we assume no obligation to update, revise, or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplement report, SEC reports, and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, after that, feel free to jump in queue with more. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Russell: Thank you, Ryan and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our recent performance and updated views. Then we'll open it up for Q&A. Our second quarter performance exceeded our expectations regarding existing customer behavior and occupancy levels, but fell short on rents charged to new move-in customers. Move-in rents were down 14% with competitive pricing dynamics in many markets. That compares to down 6% in our original forecast. Accordingly, we have adjusted our guidance ranges to reflect more competitive market move-in rent conditions for the remainder of the year, which Tom will cover in a moment. Overall, we are encouraged by positive momentum in our business, including new customer activity, supported by a healthy consumer with a sustained need for more space at home and the effectiveness of our broad-based customer acquisition strategies. Occupancy trends outpacing expectations with positive net move-ins year-to-date. Our in-place customers are behaving well with good payment patterns, reduced vacate activity on a year-over-year basis, and strong length of stays. Our high-growth non-same-store pool, which comprises 542 properties and 22% of total portfolio square footage is leasing up quickly with NOI growing nearly 50% during the second quarter. Several markets within our portfolio are seeing month-over-month revenue growth improvement. Waning development of new competitive supply, which will be supportive to accelerating operating fundamentals. And the acquisition market, while still quiet, is showing some signs of broader activity. Based on these favorable trends and our strong capital position, we also repurchased $200 million in Public Storage common shares during the quarter. We continue to view 2024 as a year of stabilization across our portfolio. We are excited about our trajectory over the near, medium and long term. Now, Tom will provide additional detail.\nTom Boyle: Thanks Joe. We reported second quarter core FFO of $4.23 per share, representing a 1.2% decline compared to the same period in 2023, and in line with the same 1.2% experienced during the first quarter. Looking at the same-store portfolio of stabilized properties, revenues declined 1% compared to the second quarter of 2023. A relatively even mix of lower occupancy and rents drove that decline. The rent decline was primarily driven by lower market move-in rents, which were partially offset by better-than-expected behavior of our in-place customers. Our occupancy gap compared to 2023 narrowed to down 30 basis points at quarter end, outperforming our expectation on positive net move-ins. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 90 basis points in the second quarter. As our operating model transformation and solar power generation strategic initiatives reduced payroll, utilities and indirect costs, helping offset other line items. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool declined 1.6% in the quarter. Our operating margin remained healthy at an industry-leading 79%. The strong performance of our non-same-store pool continues, as Joe mentioned. With this pool at 83% occupancy and comprising 22% of our total square footage, it will be an engine of growth for the remainder of this year and into the future, which is a good segue into our updated outlook for 2024. We revised our same-store revenue assumptions and core FFO per share guidance to reflect lower move-in rents during our busy season, namely in May, June, and into July. We removed the more optimistic scenarios within our revenue growth range, which reflected the possibility of move-in rents reaching parity with last year during 2024. The assumptions underpinning the negative 1% growth scenario at our new midpoint are as follows; move-in rents, on average, down 12% for the full year, finishing in December with move-in rents down mid-single-digits. Our other assumptions are unchanged. Occupancy averaging down 80 basis points for the year and a consistent contribution from existing customer rent increases compared to last year. We also adjusted our 2024 non-same-store NOI outlook by $17 million at the midpoint to reflect later timing of acquisition closings and lower move-in rents similar to the same-store pool. Our outlook for the non-same-store pool is for a strong 32% growth this year at the midpoint. That strong growth is expected to continue with an additional $110 million of incremental NOI in 2025 and beyond from this pool. Based on those assumption changes, we have revised our core FFO guidance to range of $16.50 to $16.85 per share, an approximate 1% reduction compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance range. Our outlook for capital allocation in 2024 is unchanged. We will deliver $450 million in new development activity this year, a record year for Public Storage. We're seeing signs of activity in the acquisition transaction market, and we're both eager and well-positioned in pent-up activity services there. Our capital and liquidity position remains strong. We refinanced our 2024 maturities in April and leverage of 3.9 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA puts us in a very strong position. As Joe highlighted earlier, we are encouraged by positive momentum in many aspects of the business. We're confident in our trajectory as we move through this year of stabilization in 2024. So, with that, I'll turn the call back to Rob to open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. I guess, good morning out there. Maybe, Tom, just sort of following up on the sort of the guidance changes in the down 12% that you and Joe sort of spoke about. Maybe just talk about either the market mix or how you thought about that? And I guess under what economic conditions or housing scenarios, could that possibly get better in the back half of the year? And I guess, what are the risks that, that down 12% could maybe be worse than you're currently forecasting?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Sure, Steve. So, there's a couple of components there. I'll start with the first piece that you highlighted, which is, what are we seeing in markets? And we are seeing continued positive momentum in many of the markets that we've highlighted to date, the markets like the Mid-Atlantic, Seattle, San Francisco and we can reiterate those if helpful. But we're seeing improvements in move-in rents in those markets as well. So, a market like Seattle, for instance, was nearly flat on move-in rents for the second quarter already with improving trends there. The flip side, and we've spoken about this a good bit is that markets that were maybe more high flyers during the last several years have tougher comps and continue to have move-in rent growth that is more like down in the 20%, even higher than down 20% in many instances. Those markets are still in very good shape versus pre-pandemic in terms of their demand fundamentals, population inflows and the like, but are going to take a little bit longer to stabilize. And I'd say big picture, for move-in rents. We've seen a modest improvement year-to-date, right. If you look at the first quarter, move-in rents for us were down 16%, the second quarter down 14%. As we sit here in July, they're down 12%. So, the improvement is there. It's just more modest in terms of pace than what we had originally outlined in our February call. And as we sit here today, we're still calling for modest improvements here, but we've recalibrated that pace into the second half as well.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And maybe just touching on the capital allocation. It was interesting to see that the share buybacks -- and I assume that, that's partly a function of capital activity on the acquisition side, just not really being there. I guess, what are you seeing on the acquisition front? And I think you mentioned maybe things were picking up a bit, but what are the opportunity sets and how do you sort of measure away the buybacks against either development spend and/or acquisitions?\nJoe Russell: Okay. Sure. I'll start, Steve. From an acquisition opportunity standpoint, for the last two or three quarters, we pointed to the fact that there was a relatively active amount of inbound calls that we were in dialogue with a whole host of different types of owners, whether individual, small and in some cases, somewhat larger portfolios. That type of activities still at hand. What typically happens on an annual basis, you'll see more activity start to percolate in the second half of the year. We think that there is likely that type of activity ahead of us. There is a number of -- or there are a number of different owners that, for a variety of reasons, are in a position to transact, whether it's capital constraint related or need for recapitalizing either existing assets or pivoting out of any asset for any particular reason. So, we have a fair amount of activity that gives us a level of confidence that we're likely to meet the number that we guided to at the beginning of the year. Clearly, we'll see how that continues to play out. But we're encouraged by the amount of activity that's playing through as we speak. Now, from an alternative standpoint, your question around how do we think about the timing, the size, and the efficacy of actually buying back our own stock, that's typically something that we look at from a capital alternative investment standpoint. We felt for a variety of reasons, we had a good opportunity in the quarter. to buy back shares. Obviously, we've got plenty of capital to deploy. We felt it was a good opportunity for us to extract the value that we see in our shares. And as we go forward, we'll continue to look at that alternative as we always do. And with that, we'll see what plays through as we go forward.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Just -- with the revised same-store revenue range, just hoping you could speak a little bit about the cadence or said differently, the exit run rate that you guys are thinking will come out of 2024 at, just to think about early days, I know, but how 2025 at least may start?\nTom Boyle: Yes, sure, Juan. So, obviously, implied in the revised outlook is a number for the second half, right? And I think as you look at the first half, our same-store revenue growth was down about 50 basis points implied in the second half is down about 1.5%. So, I wouldn't get any more specific in terms of where exactly we're going to be the month of December or otherwise. And obviously, we'll give you 2025 outlook as we get into February. The one set of points that I would share is that we continue to be positive around the trajectory of both industry fundamentals as well as our own fundamentals as we sit here today. We've spoken about how this year is a year of stability and stabilization for the sector. There's reasons to be optimistic around future demand growth as we get through 2025 to 2027. And at the same time, that's going to be counterbalanced with declining deliveries of new competitive supply given the challenges in new construction today. So, we continue to be optimistic around the outlook for the business in future years without getting into any 2025 specifics.\nJuan Sanabria: Fair enough. And then just a follow-up to Steve's question. Hoping you could talk a little bit about cap rates, maybe where you're looking to buy assets whether stabilized or still leasing up? And kind of maybe where assets are transacting, recognizing there's not a huge amount of volume changing hands, but just commentary on asset pricing, please?\nJoe Russell: Yes, I think, first of all, there's no question we need more transaction activity to either stabilize or reinforce where cap rates have trended to. If you look at the progression on cap rate change over the last two years or so -- say, two-plus years ago, we were probably looking at plus or minus 4% handles and it trenched to 5%. Today, we're probably looking at 6% handles for, again, transaction activity. But to your point one, we need to see and realize a fair amount of trading volume for those to stabilize. We clearly see the value from our standpoint, based on our cost of capital to transact plus or minus in that 6% range, but we're keeping a very close eye on what's coming into the market and what value creation you can extract, whether it's a stabilized asset or something that's unstabilized that clearly is going to have some lease activity tied to it as well. But again, we're well-positioned relative to our own cost of capital, the size and the magnitude of capital that we can deploy, and we'll confidently go forward with any opportunity that we see that makes sense, again, based on the value creation that we're seeing.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Yulico: Thank you. Sorry if I missed this. Did you give any commentary yet, or are you able to, on the July occupancy and move-in rates?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Sure, Nick. I can provide some commentary there. I did highlight that July move-in rents are down about 12% as we sit here today. So, again, sequential improvement from the first and second quarters there. On occupancy, we're closing the month down circa 40 basis points in occupancy. So, a touch below where we finished June, but in a narrower gap than where we started the year.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Thanks for that Tom. And then in terms of a question on ECRI, what are you seeing in trends with tenants? I mean, is there any signs of fatigue or pushback that you're getting on ECRI? I just wanted to be clear as well on the same-store guidance change. Was there any assumptions that were change on ECRIs? Or is it all just moving rents?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Thanks. So, we continue to be encouraged by behavior from our existing tenants. And if you think about the existing tenant base and storage, right, a lot of the existing tenants we're speaking to today were move-in customers last year and the year before. And we continue to be encouraged by the performance of those tenants as they age with us and find value in our product in their marketplaces. And what we've seen from a trend standpoint is very consistent price sensitivity from that customer base. And at the same time, we've got an environment where we moved a lot more customers in the last year than we had in the prior year. And frankly, we've largely matched that sort of volume in the first half year-to-date, such that the contribution from more recent move-ins has been quite strong. And so we've been pointing to a relatively consistent overall contribution from that program to revenue growth in 2024 compared to 2023. And that, to your point, is unchanged from our original outlook we continue to be encouraged by that customer base.\nNick Yulico: All right. Thanks Tom.\nTom Boyle: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. My first question, can you provide more color on the move-ins, given -- you've said a few times that the net move-ins has been better than expected. Can you discuss that a little bit more? I know we all focus on housing as a key driver. But just curious to see if anything has changed on why people are moving in. I don't know if you do surveys?\nJoe Russell: Sure, Jeff. Yes, we definitely keep a very close eye on the variety of demand factors that bring customers to us. Housing in general, obviously, is an important part of that overall acquisition opportunity. What has continue to be quite strong. I mentioned in my opening comments, the need for more space, whether you're an owner or a renter continues to be, again, a very active rationale or active reason to come to self-storage. Clearly, it was surfacing through the pandemic. We're far past that now. The different dynamic tied to needing more space needing more space at home is the affordability factor, whether you're a renter or an owner. There's clearly less activity going on in existing sale activity the counter to that and actually the driver that's 2-plus or times larger than home sale activity is renter activity. And those customer types continue to be quite good relative to length of stay, commitment to the space, affordability factors, et cetera. And we're really not seeing any erosion relative to that kind of activity, which has been quite beneficial to the acquisition opportunity that we've been able to keep moving activity quite vibrant. So, no real change there. And actually, as Tom and I have spoken to, we look at that as -- again a very key driver relative to the vibrancy of the business overall. We're just in a more competitive environment relative to what those initial move-in rates are. But the stabilization and the behavior of existing customers is quite good.\nJeff Spector: And then my second question, I think you said in your opening remarks, you talked about waning development and new supply, lower supply. Can you quantify that? Or I guess, elaborate on that comment, please?\nJoe Russell: Yes, sure. Again, I wouldn't say there's any sea change in the consistent view that we've had on national development deliveries, meaning on an increase on an existing stock basis. We're kind of in that mid-2% range or so. So, the development activity that seeing any particular market has been quite positive, meaning, it's not the same volume that we've seen certainly in prior cycles, and we don't really see any momentum coming back to the amount of volume that's likely to happen nationally. Like always, we're keeping a close eye on a handful of markets that might be a little too active relative to development activity. One example might be, for instance, the West Coast of Florida. There's quite a bit of activity going on there. Phoenix and Las Vegas on a percentage of existing stock have a little bit more activity than we'd like to see. But frankly, beyond that, we're very happy with the lack of new development activity coming into the markets. The headwinds around development activity are very consistent to what we've spoken about over the last several quarters. Cost of capital, timing for entitlements, risk around component costs, and then, again, the amount of time and projections that are going into rent levels and stabilization need to be factored in as well. So, with all that, we basically have a backdrop of very low development activity. On the flip side, for our own development team, it's given us a good opportunity to jump into a number of markets that's fueling the amount of development activity we particularly continue to drive. As Tom mentioned, we're looking at a record level of development activity in 2024, and the team is working hard to look for additional opportunities into 2025, 2026 and 2027.\nJeff Spector: Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, just two quick ones. One is, just starting on with the expenses. Maybe just a little bit more commentary on both the property taxes as well as sort of the payroll reductions? And how much has being able to get a lot of tenants moving in digitally sort of help with that? And how much more is there to go?\nTom Boyle: Yes. So the first question around property taxes for the quarter, up 3.9% year-to-date, up 5.6%. I think our outlook is plus or minus 5% for the year in property taxes. So, right around what we're anticipating there. And really that's working through assessments that are still catching up to both NOI as well as property value increases over the last several years based on assessment cycles. What more interesting is your question around property payroll. I highlighted earlier around some of the operating model transformation that we've continued to embark upon over the last several years, and we've talked to in some more specifics around our Investor Day going back several years. Our initial expectations at that time were to utilize one of the elements that you highlighted, which is our digital leasing platform, which we call eRental, which today, about 70% of our new lease transactions are coming to us being signed digitally before a customer arrives at the property, and that's powerful. But that's allowed us to put a digital ecosystem around that. that has enabled us to think differently around both operational roles and staffing levels. And you can see that in the P&L. Initially, we had shared reducing property hours by about 25%. We achieved that at the end of last year. And so you can see here through this year, we've got continued optimization that's taking place. And we're not done talking about this. We think there's opportunity from here. So, we continue to be encouraged by that activity, providing a digital and consistent customer experience. While I've got the mic on. On expenses, I might as well highlight our solar power initiatives as well. And I highlighted in my prepared remarks, you can see utilities down 8% in the quarter also. We're on a path of putting solar on over 1,000 of our properties over the next several years. And you're starting to see that benefit in utilities as well. That obviously benefits both, our utility expenses, also our carbon footprint and the like. So, we continue to be encouraged by that initiative as well.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. Thanks for that. And then my second question was just going to be going back to sort of the guidance changes on the new tenants pricing. I think when you think about the environment, whether it's website visits or bad debt, I think the commentary has been that's actually been pretty good. So I guess what we're trying to figure out is -- but what do you think is causing more competition? Is it just a more cost-conscious consumer? Is it housing? Like what's -- if the demand sort of indicators still look pretty good, supply presumably is coming down, what's at the heart of the more competitive environment that's driving us? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: Yes. That's a good question, Ron. I think there's a couple of components to talk through there. One is what Joe mentioned earlier around our own move-in traffic has been pretty consistent with last year, which was a very strong year. So, we continue to see good traffic on our side. But we're using tools in order to attract those customers, including increased advertising, et cetera. Looking at the industry overall, as we think about the impact to the competitive landscape in our local markets, demand is down year-over-year. One of the metrics that we can share with you is around Google keyword search volumes for storage-related terms. And we've highlighted that in the past as being down year-over-year. We started the year down year-over-year. We continue to be -- now the encouraging thing there is that the year-over-year decline is half today what it was at the start of the year. So, we're continuing to see signs of stabilization there, but I think that's contributed to the competitive move-in dynamic for new customers in many of our markets.\nRonald Kamdem: That\u2019s it from me. Thanks so much.\nJoe Russell: Thanks Ron.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. On the market rent growth, you said it was down 14% in the second quarter and down 12% in July. So, can you just provide context on what happened in June just to see like the most recent sequential improvement? And then, are your expectations for the improvement in the back half of the year, is it the same magnitude of improvement just like with a different starting point? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: Yes. So, a couple of components there. One, June was pretty similar, down about 12%. So, we saw a pretty good improvement from April and May into June and July, but nowhere near the pace or the magnitude of improvement that we were anticipating. And as you get into June and July, you're at the peak of the rents. And so that isn't a very important guidepost as you think about the rents through the remainder of the year. And it's also why those several months are so important as it relates to setting market rents for the year. In terms of the pace of improvement, we are anticipating moderation in that decline as we move through the second half of the year, but we have recalibrated that based on the June and July performance. And so we're starting from a different place than what we had originally assumed, but for modest improvement here.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks for that. My follow-up question is just like when thing -- this may be a little bit speculative, but when things start to get better, how quickly can things unwind, right? Like it seems that a lot of the independents and the privates kind of took their time re-cutting street rate as street rates move down? Like is there an expectation that when demand starts to come back, the other players and the rest of the industry will kind of more rapidly bring rate up. So, like when does it get better? It should improve a lot quicker than maybe this kind of slow grind down that we've kind of experienced? Thanks.\nTom Boyle: I think that still remains to be seen in terms of the ultimate pace, right? We've given you guidepost in terms of what our assumptions are through the remainder of the year. We've highlighted about the fact that this is a variable and competitive dynamic for new customer rates. I'm not going to speculate specifically around private operators and how they'll react.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nTom Boyle: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. I just wanted to touch on occupancy. You mentioned July being down 40 basis points year-over-year. it seems like implied in guidance is, could that gap divided in the back half, you're at about 100 basis points. So, can you talk about kind of what's underpinning that assumption?\nTom Boyle: Yes, that's a good question. So -- we did see improvements in occupancy and more of an upward slope to occupancy through the spring here. based on the move-in activity that Joe was highlighting and frankly, really strong performance from the existing tenant base through the first part of the year as well. Heading into the back half we're anticipating if we did last year from an assumption standpoint that as you go up in the spring, you're likely to come down in the fall. And so that's what's underpinning some of that activity. And recall, we're talking about seasonal moves in occupancy that are much less than what we had experienced in the pre-pandemic time period. So, while we're talking about a little bit more decline in occupancy this year versus last year because of the rise in occupancy we saw in the first half, still nowhere near the seasonal decline that we saw in a typical year.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. And then just for the $110 million of incremental non-same-store NOI, is there any additional capital that needs to be spent for that? Or is that all basically just dropping to the NOI as it flows through?\nTom Boyle: Yes, that's a good clarification. So, that is on the in-place assets. And so as we think about the in-place NOI for 2024, you can add that $110 million to that to get to, in effect, our expectation for stabilization of that in-place pool. No additional capital required there. As we invest capital into the second half of this year, we'll adjust that number. And frankly, that will only be incremental upside from here.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then some of that will become within the same-store pool in 2025?\nTom Boyle: Well, the upside isn't likely to come into the same-store pool, right? As you think about it, we add properties into our same-store pool that are stabilized for both occupancy, rents and operating expenses. And so as we think about upside to stabilization, that will remain in our non-same-store pool but the stabilized properties over time will cycle into the same-store pool. .\nNick Joseph: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nTom Boyle: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKeegan Carl: Yes, thanks for the time guys. I guess just first, maybe broad commentary on what you're seeing with the consumer? And are you seeing any material softness that sort of impacted your outlook for the rest of the year?\nJoe Russell: Yes, Keegan, I wouldn't highlight any particular new or evolving level of stress and/or change in the pattern of both behavior from a payment standpoint, length of stay, the amount of activity that we're just seeing relative to even movement that we can assess based on any particular stress that's playing through on our own customer base. We've been pleasantly surprised that all the tools that we're using to keep, again, delinquency in good shape or continue to serve us well. And we're not seeing any new and changing risk factor tied to the consumer payment patterns that have been relatively consistent now for a number of quarters.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And then just shifting gears. I'm just curious for how your third-party management platform is trending and if there are any changes in the pipeline versus last quarter?\nJoe Russell: Yes, sure. So frankly, we've had a pretty good run for the last few quarters with the improved size and complexion of our third-party management platform. So, today, we have approximately 375 assets in that program. 260 of them are open, and we have another 115 that are in a variety of different stages relative to development that we'll be opening over the next year or so. This quarter, we added 17. That puts us at year-to-date over 60 additional additions to the program. . So, again, seeing a good amount of activity, both small and frankly, some larger portfolios where we've got a number of existing clients that are actually expanding the number of assets they're putting into our program. So, it's continuing to serve us well relative to additional scale in many markets. Different things that can be very advantageous, not only to our clients but ourselves. So, we're continuing to see good growth in the program and putting a fair amount of resource into it as well with the public storage team that's wholly dedicated to that platform as well. So, again, good traction, and we see some good activity going into the second half of this year.\nKeegan Carl: Super helpful. Thanks for your time guys.\nJoe Russell: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Thomas: Hi thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the ECRIs and pricing a bit. Tom, I understand the contribution to revenue growth has not changed with the revised guidance. But just given the softer demand environment and the lack of pricing power that you experienced during the quarter and into July versus your prior expectations. Is there an effort to preserve occupancy a little bit more ahead of and into the back half of the off-peak rental season just to provide a little bit of a better potential setup in the 2025 when demand might recover?\nTom Boyle: Okay, there's a lot there, Todd. Let me take a step back and talk through how we think about the program because I think that, that will reinforce the drivers as we think about where we're going from here. So, I've consistently spoken about really two components to the existing customer rent increase side. I've already spoken on this call around the customer price sensitivity side of the equation, which has been very consistent. The other side that I think too, is around the cost to replace the tenants. And that component, right, the cost to replace tenant is influenced by the market moving rents, how long the space will remain vacant, marketing expenses, all those sorts of things play into that side. And over the last several years, that has been the component that has been more variable, both on the upside and then on the downside over the past two years. And so there isn't an over focus internally around preserving occupancy or otherwise. But as the cost to replace increases, the frequency and magnitude of increases will moderate. And then I'd add a third component because I've been speaking to it over the past year or so, I might as well add as a third component, which is the volume of tenants that are eligible for the program. And that's the piece that's been additive as we moved into 2024 around more recent tenants that have moved in that have been a positive offset. But there's no overt decisions around protecting or not protecting occupancy. It's more of an optimization around the rents that we can charge from our existing customers who are placing a lot of value on their units.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Got it. So, the percent of tenants eligible for rent increases is higher today than it was last year and the prior year, it sounds.\nTom Boyle: Yes. yes, and there's more near-term tenants that are in the program.\nTodd Thomas: Right. Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question was just around the latest Board appointment, Maria Hawthorne. I was just curious if you could speak to that announcement and the process the Board went through to make that decision, the PSP transaction closed in 2022. So, I'm just curious about the timing and the decision to expand the Board today?\nJoe Russell: Yes, sure. The Board itself has a very committed and vibrant process relative to board composition skill and the collective amount of knowledge and wisdom that any phase of our Board configuration continues to serve the company as a whole. So, Maria is a great addition to that in many ways, not only based on her experience as a standing CEO of another public REIT, but also her knowledge relative to real estate. She sits on two other public boards as well. She's got very strong financial acumen, coupled with very strong history of delivering great shareholder value, et cetera. So, overall, we feel she's a great addition to the Board and look forward to her contributions with the rest of the board as it stands today.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. all right. thank you.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning. So, when I look at your combined marketing spend and promotions as a percent of the new contract rates you brought into the company. It was a little bit more percentage-wise than last year. When you look at that, how do you digest that? Do you think maybe you could have spent more to optimize revenue? Or are you more of the mindset that -- just the lack of -- just given that maybe slightly weaker demand that wouldn't have had great efficacy to increase it?\nTom Boyle: Yes, Ki Bin, you're highlighting both promotions as well as marketing spend. Let me maybe take the two independent. Those are two of the levers. In addition, obviously, the move-in rents that we are toggling back and forth in the competitive move-in environment. And we've been very active utilizing, frankly, both over the last several years. On marketing specifically, we've increased our marketing spend consistently over the last couple of years because we're seeing very good returns. And we speak regularly around the advantages of our scale and marketplace, providing customers a rich inventory set, the power of our brand, the customers are increasingly aware of in our markets and that efficacy continues today. And so as you look at the spend increase in the second quarter, and year-to-date, those have been very good returns associated with those investments and new customer acquisition, and we'll continue to use that lever as we move forward. given the good returns associated with it, and we anticipate that to continue into the second half. On promotional activity, there's a couple of things going on with that particular metric that you're looking at. One is, I'd highlight that about the same number of customers year-over-year have received promotions, maybe a touch more. But the reason you're seeing a decline in that metric is, it's a promotional activity versus our move-in rents. And as we've discussed, our move-in rents themselves were down 14%. And so just nominally the discount dollars and promotional dollars associated with giving, for instance, the first month for $1 is less on a nominal basis year-over-year, but that continues to be a vibrant tool we're using.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And second question, where do you think your rents are today versus, let's say, 2019. Move-in rents?\nTom Boyle: Yes. Our rents today are in a similar territory to where they are, we're in 2019, depending on the market, right? We've got some markets that are a good bit above 2019. And we have some markets that are below 2019 as well. We've highlighted in the past around some markets that we feel like have overcorrected in terms of move-in rents and I'd reiterate that as it relates to 2019.\nKi Bin Kim: Yes. So, that's the part I'm trying to understand better, right? Since 2019, we've probably had about 20% cumulative inflation, but rental are relatively flat versus that time period. So we've definitely given back more than just the COVID surge in rents. So, I was just curious on your take, I guess, what accounts for the additional weakness? Is it absorbed through additional supply? Or, is there something else by the consumer that's changed over that timeframe? Just trying to understand where that demand has abated?\nTom Boyle: Yes, I would characterize it, and Joe, you can chime in here, too. I would characterize it as we've had a sharp number of years in movement in demand, right? We had a sharp move higher and sharp move lower. And as I said, that metric is pretty variable depending on the marketplace that you're looking at. Some of the markets that Joe highlighted are impacted by new supply and so you have some of that competitive dynamic. But overall, I'd say the shift in demand lower and the tough comps of 2021 and 2022 have led to pretty competitive pricing activity amongst operators in the sector. And in many cases, that may have led to an overcorrection in marketplaces. But I think the positive component that you're highlighting is, if you think about the move-in rents today that we're charging versus discretionary income or consumers' monthly budget, it's frankly even more attractive today than what it was in the past. And so as you think about potential opportunity for that number through a cycle to move higher. I think it's more encouraging, frankly, given its more affordable today than it was in the past. And we're working through that stabilization of demand. And as an industry, we will get to the other side.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Boyle: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Luebchow: Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about any changes you've seen year-to-date and more recently on length of stay of the in-place space in terms of the type of customers that are moving out? Are they coming from more of the lower replacement cost customers that are at lower rates versus the longer tenured customers that are materially above current movement rates?\nTom Boyle: Yes, sure, Eric. Stepping back and looking at the last several years, we've spoken a lot around how length of stay really extended from 2020 to 2022. And that was a combination of longer length of stay tenants staying for longer as well as the need to replace those tenants with fewer new customers. So, from a mix standpoint, length of stay grew pretty sharply over that time period and was a big contributor to some of the pricing power and financial performance we had over that time period. Really, since then, we've been seeing moderation. And we've been really encouraged at the pace of that moderation, right? I think if I were to go back and listen to myself on these calls probably a couple of years ago, I maybe was anticipating a more rapid return to \"pre-pandemic sort of length of stays.\" And we've been encouraged by the fact that it has been several years of moderation in those numbers. And as we sit here today, length of stays on average continue to be longer than what they were in 2019. So some encouraging trends there. The second component of your question was just around vacate levels. And I'd highlight that our longer-term tenants tend to be stickier. They've gotten comfortable using their space. They have goods in there that have a use case of sitting in the unit for a long time versus maybe an apartment renter that's moving between one apartment and another and is using the space period of time, for instance, as an example, use case. And so the vacate frequency from those tenants is less. And so as you look at our vacate activity, really, in any given quarter, it's more concentrated within those customers that have been more recently joined the public storage customer base.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Appreciate that commentary. And just a follow-up, sorry to harp about moving rents. But as we think about what you've assumed in second half of this year, you said the guide assumes we exit the year down about mid-single digits. Does that assume a relatively normal amount of seasonality from kind of the peak summer months into the fall and winter because I know that from a comp perspective, things do get a lot easier in September and October, given there were some more aggressive pricing actions made last year. So just thinking about how seasonality compares to what would be a normal year, and I realize we haven't had a normal year in quite some time.\nTom Boyle: Yes, I think that last point is probably the operable one, which is we haven't had a \"normal year\" for a number of years. But clearly, we recognize and have taken into consideration what you highlighted around last year being a very competitive move-in environment where moving rents for the industry did decline on a more accelerated path last fall. And our assumptions, clearly, based on a narrowing in the year-over-year gap is that we don't face that same sort of decline. But we're continuing to expect that it's a competitive moving environment in the second half and that move-in rents are below where they were last year.\nEric Luebchow: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nTom Boyle: Thanks Eric.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Hughes: Hi, good morning out there. The predictive revenue growth metric when I combined contract rent and occupancy for the next quarter has been pretty accurate lately. And when I do that for a third quarter and combine it with a full year guide, it implies revenue growth actually accelerates or gets less negative in the fourth quarter. And the only time in the last decade that revenue growth improved from 3Q to 4Q was 4Q 2020 when we were coming out of COVID lockdowns. So, does that sequential improvement in the fourth quarter sounds like what's embedded in guidance? And if so, what gives you the confidence we'll see that improvement since it is so unique?\nTom Boyle: Well, one of the things that I've highlighted over the last couple of years around that forward metric based on period-end numbers, is that when things are moving around quite a bit, it loses some of its efficacy. And there's certainly we've started to provide a more robust transparency related to our outlook for the year on a financial terms with our guidance. And so I'd point you more towards the implied outlook from guidance than using any particular period end metrics 1 quarter versus the other, given how things have been moving around. But specifically, I'm not going to comment quarter-by-quarter guidance, right? We're giving you annual outlook. And as I noted earlier, the second half is implied to be down 1.5% on same-store revenue specifically. And we do have confidence in improving trends in many of our markets that it's going to lead to stabilization and then ultimately reacceleration across those markets over time.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay. My second question. Just looking at L.A., I noticed that the revenue growth premium there, it did slow to, call it, 60 basis points from an average of 500 basis points the prior five quarters. I know comps are tough, but yesterday, Equity Residential kind of talked about some affordability and supply headwinds in L.A. So, maybe there's a broader economic slowdown in that specific market but can expect a more modest revenue growth premium in L.A. going forward? Could that even turn negative as rents and occupancy there are the highest in the portfolio? Thanks.\nJoe Russell: Yes. First of all, just the overall health of that market continues to be very good, Jonathan. It's a market that we're not going to see any meaningful addition to supply just the trend that you're pointing to relative to the outstripped revenue growth that we saw in that market for a sustained period of time, and it's leveling off. We hope that we'll continue to see very good trajectory going into future periods. But we don't see some of the issues, certainly in Los Angeles that you might in other markets that have been more impacted value either supply or a material shift in overall demand, I would just say it's relatively stable at this point, and we'll continue to see how it performs. We're in very good shape relative to the quality of those assets. We see very strong occupancies. As I mentioned, no new and concerning dynamics from new supply. So, -- the other thing that supports L.A. over time is it is a high cost of living market, which again supports the inherent demand for public -- for storage relative to our particular portfolio there because, again, with great locations, great scale overall in the market, and we see good in-customer demand playing through.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay. Thanks for the time.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Mueller: Yes, hi. Just a quick follow-up on move-in rates. Is the guidance an assumption of move-in rates improving to down mid-single digits by year-end. Is that being driven, I guess, by improvement in spot rates or just the comp issue or some sort of combination of both?\nTom Boyle: Well, I guess -- In -- I'm trying to think about the right way to think about this. There's no question that seasonally, we're at the peaks of rental rates. So, as we talk about what's going to play out through the second half and what's assumed in the outlook. The level of rents in the fourth quarter are going to be lower than where they are now, right. But as you think about the year-over-year differential, we did have a pretty significant move-in rent decline as we moved through last year. And just a reminder, last year's fourth quarter move-ins for us were down about 18% year-over-year. And so the comps do ease on a year-over-year basis. And so while we're expecting, as we do every year, that rents decline between here and where they are in December, the level of decline between now and December, we're anticipating to be more modest than what we experienced last year, which was really, frankly, a sharp decline.\nMike Mueller: Got it. So, it seems like you're making some improvement in there. just ignoring the comp dynamic?\nTom Boyle: I would say it's primarily the comp dynamic, and we're expecting -- to decline as we typically would between a summer and winter [indiscernible].\nMike Mueller: Okay. Yes, I was thinking a little bit more outside of seasonality as the overall environment getting better from that front, but, Okay. that's it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. Maybe just one more on the non-same-store pool. You guys have had great success on the lease-up front, but -- are you able to provide additional color on markets where you're seeing either above average lease-up trends? Or maybe conversely, where you're seeing some slower activity here on the leasing front?\nTom Boyle: I'd say overall, leasing activity has been very strong, really, across the board within the non-same-store pool. One of the things I highlighted right, obviously, the lower move-in rents impacts the whole portfolio, not just the same store. But as we think about actual lease-up pace, you can see a strong lease-up pace in our development, redevelopment vintages, which are probably the easiest place to see that lease-up pace. We continue to be encouraged by that. And as Joe mentioned, I think that's being supplemented by the fact that there isn't an overwhelming amount of new supply in these markets that we're delivering into. And because of that, the new activity that we are delivering is being well received in the marketplace, absorbed efficiently. And we think that, that helps both our non-same-store pool, but also the dynamics for the industry and the local marketplace of our same-store assets in those marketplaces as well.\nJoe Russell: Maybe Spenser, just on a headline portfolio standpoint, if you look at the larger portfolios that we've taken down over the last couple of years. I'd say they are all kind of in a similar range relative to either meeting or exceeding not only our underwriting, but we've seen good traction particularly in markets where we've been able to increase scale. And then most recently, the Simply portfolio, which touched 18 different states. Again, I wouldn't point out or call out any unusual negative trends. In fact, we're seeing continued outperformance relative to our own underwriting even in that portfolio that was multi-market based. So, just to reinforce what Tom was speaking to, we're continuing to see good traction and stabilization throughout that entire portfolio and definitely look at it as being a continued driver of growth going into future periods.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay, great. Thank you both for the color. And Tom, you kind of alluded to this, but how does this time the stabilization for readouts and new developments today compared to historic averages in your portfolio?\nTom Boyle: Yes, we typically underwrite three to four years to get to a level of stabilization of the earnings profile of the asset. And then frankly, there's another couple of years of continued strong growth from there depending on the size of the asset, et cetera. There are certainly been time periods where we've seen much faster than that over the last several years, in particular. But kind of year in and year out that we're looking for. And obviously, three or four years is a long period of time, you're going to have demand and supply drivers within individual markets that a shift that for one in particular asset or otherwise, but I'd still point you to that kind of three or four-year time period.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay, great. Thank you.\nJoe Russell: Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments.\nRyan Burke: Thanks Rob and thanks to all of you for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Tom Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks Joe. We reported second quarter core FFO of $4.23 per share, representing a 1.2% decline compared to the same period in 2023, and in line with the same 1.2% experienced during the first quarter. Looking at the same-store portfolio of stabilized properties, revenues declined 1% compared to the second quarter of 2023. A relatively even mix of lower occupancy and rents drove that decline. The rent decline was primarily driven by lower market move-in rents, which were partially offset by better-than-expected behavior of our in-place customers. Our occupancy gap compared to 2023 narrowed to down 30 basis points at quarter end, outperforming our expectation on positive net move-ins. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 90 basis points in the second quarter. As our operating model transformation and solar power generation strategic initiatives reduced payroll, utilities and indirect costs, helping offset other line items. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool declined 1.6% in the quarter. Our operating margin remained healthy at an industry-leading 79%. The strong performance of our non-same-store pool continues, as Joe mentioned. With this pool at 83% occupancy and comprising 22% of our total square footage, it will be an engine of growth for the remainder of this year and into the future, which is a good segue into our updated outlook for 2024. We revised our same-store revenue assumptions and core FFO per share guidance to reflect lower move-in rents during our busy season, namely in May, June, and into July. We removed the more optimistic scenarios within our revenue growth range, which reflected the possibility of move-in rents reaching parity with last year during 2024. The assumptions underpinning the negative 1% growth scenario at our new midpoint are as follows; move-in rents, on average, down 12% for the full year, finishing in December with move-in rents down mid-single-digits. Our other assumptions are unchanged. Occupancy averaging down 80 basis points for the year and a consistent contribution from existing customer rent increases compared to last year. We also adjusted our 2024 non-same-store NOI outlook by $17 million at the midpoint to reflect later timing of acquisition closings and lower move-in rents similar to the same-store pool. Our outlook for the non-same-store pool is for a strong 32% growth this year at the midpoint. That strong growth is expected to continue with an additional $110 million of incremental NOI in 2025 and beyond from this pool. Based on those assumption changes, we have revised our core FFO guidance to range of $16.50 to $16.85 per share, an approximate 1% reduction compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance range. Our outlook for capital allocation in 2024 is unchanged. We will deliver $450 million in new development activity this year, a record year for Public Storage. We're seeing signs of activity in the acquisition transaction market, and we're both eager and well-positioned in pent-up activity services there. Our capital and liquidity position remains strong. We refinanced our 2024 maturities in April and leverage of 3.9 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA puts us in a very strong position. As Joe highlighted earlier, we are encouraged by positive momentum in many aspects of the business. We're confident in our trajectory as we move through this year of stabilization in 2024. So, with that, I'll turn the call back to Rob to open it up for Q&A. Yes. Sure, Steve. So, there's a couple of components there. I'll start with the first piece that you highlighted, which is, what are we seeing in markets? And we are seeing continued positive momentum in many of the markets that we've highlighted to date, the markets like the Mid-Atlantic, Seattle, San Francisco and we can reiterate those if helpful. But we're seeing improvements in move-in rents in those markets as well. So, a market like Seattle, for instance, was nearly flat on move-in rents for the second quarter already with improving trends there. The flip side, and we've spoken about this a good bit is that markets that were maybe more high flyers during the last several years have tougher comps and continue to have move-in rent growth that is more like down in the 20%, even higher than down 20% in many instances. Those markets are still in very good shape versus pre-pandemic in terms of their demand fundamentals, population inflows and the like, but are going to take a little bit longer to stabilize. And I'd say big picture, for move-in rents. We've seen a modest improvement year-to-date, right. If you look at the first quarter, move-in rents for us were down 16%, the second quarter down 14%. As we sit here in July, they're down 12%. So, the improvement is there. It's just more modest in terms of pace than what we had originally outlined in our February call. And as we sit here today, we're still calling for modest improvements here, but we've recalibrated that pace into the second half as well. Yes, sure, Juan. So, obviously, implied in the revised outlook is a number for the second half, right? And I think as you look at the first half, our same-store revenue growth was down about 50 basis points implied in the second half is down about 1.5%. So, I wouldn't get any more specific in terms of where exactly we're going to be the month of December or otherwise. And obviously, we'll give you 2025 outlook as we get into February. The one set of points that I would share is that we continue to be positive around the trajectory of both industry fundamentals as well as our own fundamentals as we sit here today. We've spoken about how this year is a year of stability and stabilization for the sector. There's reasons to be optimistic around future demand growth as we get through 2025 to 2027. And at the same time, that's going to be counterbalanced with declining deliveries of new competitive supply given the challenges in new construction today. So, we continue to be optimistic around the outlook for the business in future years without getting into any 2025 specifics. Yes. Sure, Nick. I can provide some commentary there. I did highlight that July move-in rents are down about 12% as we sit here today. So, again, sequential improvement from the first and second quarters there. On occupancy, we're closing the month down circa 40 basis points in occupancy. So, a touch below where we finished June, but in a narrower gap than where we started the year. Yes. Thanks. So, we continue to be encouraged by behavior from our existing tenants. And if you think about the existing tenant base and storage, right, a lot of the existing tenants we're speaking to today were move-in customers last year and the year before. And we continue to be encouraged by the performance of those tenants as they age with us and find value in our product in their marketplaces. And what we've seen from a trend standpoint is very consistent price sensitivity from that customer base. And at the same time, we've got an environment where we moved a lot more customers in the last year than we had in the prior year. And frankly, we've largely matched that sort of volume in the first half year-to-date, such that the contribution from more recent move-ins has been quite strong. And so we've been pointing to a relatively consistent overall contribution from that program to revenue growth in 2024 compared to 2023. And that, to your point, is unchanged from our original outlook we continue to be encouraged by that customer base. Thanks. Yes. So the first question around property taxes for the quarter, up 3.9% year-to-date, up 5.6%. I think our outlook is plus or minus 5% for the year in property taxes. So, right around what we're anticipating there. And really that's working through assessments that are still catching up to both NOI as well as property value increases over the last several years based on assessment cycles. What more interesting is your question around property payroll. I highlighted earlier around some of the operating model transformation that we've continued to embark upon over the last several years, and we've talked to in some more specifics around our Investor Day going back several years. Our initial expectations at that time were to utilize one of the elements that you highlighted, which is our digital leasing platform, which we call eRental, which today, about 70% of our new lease transactions are coming to us being signed digitally before a customer arrives at the property, and that's powerful. But that's allowed us to put a digital ecosystem around that. that has enabled us to think differently around both operational roles and staffing levels. And you can see that in the P&L. Initially, we had shared reducing property hours by about 25%. We achieved that at the end of last year. And so you can see here through this year, we've got continued optimization that's taking place. And we're not done talking about this. We think there's opportunity from here. So, we continue to be encouraged by that activity, providing a digital and consistent customer experience. While I've got the mic on. On expenses, I might as well highlight our solar power initiatives as well. And I highlighted in my prepared remarks, you can see utilities down 8% in the quarter also. We're on a path of putting solar on over 1,000 of our properties over the next several years. And you're starting to see that benefit in utilities as well. That obviously benefits both, our utility expenses, also our carbon footprint and the like. So, we continue to be encouraged by that initiative as well. Yes. That's a good question, Ron. I think there's a couple of components to talk through there. One is what Joe mentioned earlier around our own move-in traffic has been pretty consistent with last year, which was a very strong year. So, we continue to see good traffic on our side. But we're using tools in order to attract those customers, including increased advertising, et cetera. Looking at the industry overall, as we think about the impact to the competitive landscape in our local markets, demand is down year-over-year. One of the metrics that we can share with you is around Google keyword search volumes for storage-related terms. And we've highlighted that in the past as being down year-over-year. We started the year down year-over-year. We continue to be -- now the encouraging thing there is that the year-over-year decline is half today what it was at the start of the year. So, we're continuing to see signs of stabilization there, but I think that's contributed to the competitive move-in dynamic for new customers in many of our markets. Yes. So, a couple of components there. One, June was pretty similar, down about 12%. So, we saw a pretty good improvement from April and May into June and July, but nowhere near the pace or the magnitude of improvement that we were anticipating. And as you get into June and July, you're at the peak of the rents. And so that isn't a very important guidepost as you think about the rents through the remainder of the year. And it's also why those several months are so important as it relates to setting market rents for the year. In terms of the pace of improvement, we are anticipating moderation in that decline as we move through the second half of the year, but we have recalibrated that based on the June and July performance. And so we're starting from a different place than what we had originally assumed, but for modest improvement here. I think that still remains to be seen in terms of the ultimate pace, right? We've given you guidepost in terms of what our assumptions are through the remainder of the year. We've highlighted about the fact that this is a variable and competitive dynamic for new customer rates. I'm not going to speculate specifically around private operators and how they'll react. Thanks Michael. Yes, that's a good question. So -- we did see improvements in occupancy and more of an upward slope to occupancy through the spring here. based on the move-in activity that Joe was highlighting and frankly, really strong performance from the existing tenant base through the first part of the year as well. Heading into the back half we're anticipating if we did last year from an assumption standpoint that as you go up in the spring, you're likely to come down in the fall. And so that's what's underpinning some of that activity. And recall, we're talking about seasonal moves in occupancy that are much less than what we had experienced in the pre-pandemic time period. So, while we're talking about a little bit more decline in occupancy this year versus last year because of the rise in occupancy we saw in the first half, still nowhere near the seasonal decline that we saw in a typical year. Yes, that's a good clarification. So, that is on the in-place assets. And so as we think about the in-place NOI for 2024, you can add that $110 million to that to get to, in effect, our expectation for stabilization of that in-place pool. No additional capital required there. As we invest capital into the second half of this year, we'll adjust that number. And frankly, that will only be incremental upside from here. Well, the upside isn't likely to come into the same-store pool, right? As you think about it, we add properties into our same-store pool that are stabilized for both occupancy, rents and operating expenses. And so as we think about upside to stabilization, that will remain in our non-same-store pool but the stabilized properties over time will cycle into the same-store pool. . Thank you. Okay, there's a lot there, Todd. Let me take a step back and talk through how we think about the program because I think that, that will reinforce the drivers as we think about where we're going from here. So, I've consistently spoken about really two components to the existing customer rent increase side. I've already spoken on this call around the customer price sensitivity side of the equation, which has been very consistent. The other side that I think too, is around the cost to replace the tenants. And that component, right, the cost to replace tenant is influenced by the market moving rents, how long the space will remain vacant, marketing expenses, all those sorts of things play into that side. And over the last several years, that has been the component that has been more variable, both on the upside and then on the downside over the past two years. And so there isn't an over focus internally around preserving occupancy or otherwise. But as the cost to replace increases, the frequency and magnitude of increases will moderate. And then I'd add a third component because I've been speaking to it over the past year or so, I might as well add as a third component, which is the volume of tenants that are eligible for the program. And that's the piece that's been additive as we moved into 2024 around more recent tenants that have moved in that have been a positive offset. But there's no overt decisions around protecting or not protecting occupancy. It's more of an optimization around the rents that we can charge from our existing customers who are placing a lot of value on their units. Yes. yes, and there's more near-term tenants that are in the program. Yes, Ki Bin, you're highlighting both promotions as well as marketing spend. Let me maybe take the two independent. Those are two of the levers. In addition, obviously, the move-in rents that we are toggling back and forth in the competitive move-in environment. And we've been very active utilizing, frankly, both over the last several years. On marketing specifically, we've increased our marketing spend consistently over the last couple of years because we're seeing very good returns. And we speak regularly around the advantages of our scale and marketplace, providing customers a rich inventory set, the power of our brand, the customers are increasingly aware of in our markets and that efficacy continues today. And so as you look at the spend increase in the second quarter, and year-to-date, those have been very good returns associated with those investments and new customer acquisition, and we'll continue to use that lever as we move forward. given the good returns associated with it, and we anticipate that to continue into the second half. On promotional activity, there's a couple of things going on with that particular metric that you're looking at. One is, I'd highlight that about the same number of customers year-over-year have received promotions, maybe a touch more. But the reason you're seeing a decline in that metric is, it's a promotional activity versus our move-in rents. And as we've discussed, our move-in rents themselves were down 14%. And so just nominally the discount dollars and promotional dollars associated with giving, for instance, the first month for $1 is less on a nominal basis year-over-year, but that continues to be a vibrant tool we're using. Yes. Our rents today are in a similar territory to where they are, we're in 2019, depending on the market, right? We've got some markets that are a good bit above 2019. And we have some markets that are below 2019 as well. We've highlighted in the past around some markets that we feel like have overcorrected in terms of move-in rents and I'd reiterate that as it relates to 2019. Yes, I would characterize it, and Joe, you can chime in here, too. I would characterize it as we've had a sharp number of years in movement in demand, right? We had a sharp move higher and sharp move lower. And as I said, that metric is pretty variable depending on the marketplace that you're looking at. Some of the markets that Joe highlighted are impacted by new supply and so you have some of that competitive dynamic. But overall, I'd say the shift in demand lower and the tough comps of 2021 and 2022 have led to pretty competitive pricing activity amongst operators in the sector. And in many cases, that may have led to an overcorrection in marketplaces. But I think the positive component that you're highlighting is, if you think about the move-in rents today that we're charging versus discretionary income or consumers' monthly budget, it's frankly even more attractive today than what it was in the past. And so as you think about potential opportunity for that number through a cycle to move higher. I think it's more encouraging, frankly, given its more affordable today than it was in the past. And we're working through that stabilization of demand. And as an industry, we will get to the other side. Thanks. Yes, sure, Eric. Stepping back and looking at the last several years, we've spoken a lot around how length of stay really extended from 2020 to 2022. And that was a combination of longer length of stay tenants staying for longer as well as the need to replace those tenants with fewer new customers. So, from a mix standpoint, length of stay grew pretty sharply over that time period and was a big contributor to some of the pricing power and financial performance we had over that time period. Really, since then, we've been seeing moderation. And we've been really encouraged at the pace of that moderation, right? I think if I were to go back and listen to myself on these calls probably a couple of years ago, I maybe was anticipating a more rapid return to \"pre-pandemic sort of length of stays.\" And we've been encouraged by the fact that it has been several years of moderation in those numbers. And as we sit here today, length of stays on average continue to be longer than what they were in 2019. So some encouraging trends there. The second component of your question was just around vacate levels. And I'd highlight that our longer-term tenants tend to be stickier. They've gotten comfortable using their space. They have goods in there that have a use case of sitting in the unit for a long time versus maybe an apartment renter that's moving between one apartment and another and is using the space period of time, for instance, as an example, use case. And so the vacate frequency from those tenants is less. And so as you look at our vacate activity, really, in any given quarter, it's more concentrated within those customers that have been more recently joined the public storage customer base. Yes, I think that last point is probably the operable one, which is we haven't had a \"normal year\" for a number of years. But clearly, we recognize and have taken into consideration what you highlighted around last year being a very competitive move-in environment where moving rents for the industry did decline on a more accelerated path last fall. And our assumptions, clearly, based on a narrowing in the year-over-year gap is that we don't face that same sort of decline. But we're continuing to expect that it's a competitive moving environment in the second half and that move-in rents are below where they were last year. Thanks Eric. Well, one of the things that I've highlighted over the last couple of years around that forward metric based on period-end numbers, is that when things are moving around quite a bit, it loses some of its efficacy. And there's certainly we've started to provide a more robust transparency related to our outlook for the year on a financial terms with our guidance. And so I'd point you more towards the implied outlook from guidance than using any particular period end metrics 1 quarter versus the other, given how things have been moving around. But specifically, I'm not going to comment quarter-by-quarter guidance, right? We're giving you annual outlook. And as I noted earlier, the second half is implied to be down 1.5% on same-store revenue specifically. And we do have confidence in improving trends in many of our markets that it's going to lead to stabilization and then ultimately reacceleration across those markets over time. Well, I guess -- In -- I'm trying to think about the right way to think about this. There's no question that seasonally, we're at the peaks of rental rates. So, as we talk about what's going to play out through the second half and what's assumed in the outlook. The level of rents in the fourth quarter are going to be lower than where they are now, right. But as you think about the year-over-year differential, we did have a pretty significant move-in rent decline as we moved through last year. And just a reminder, last year's fourth quarter move-ins for us were down about 18% year-over-year. And so the comps do ease on a year-over-year basis. And so while we're expecting, as we do every year, that rents decline between here and where they are in December, the level of decline between now and December, we're anticipating to be more modest than what we experienced last year, which was really, frankly, a sharp decline. I would say it's primarily the comp dynamic, and we're expecting -- to decline as we typically would between a summer and winter [indiscernible]. I'd say overall, leasing activity has been very strong, really, across the board within the non-same-store pool. One of the things I highlighted right, obviously, the lower move-in rents impacts the whole portfolio, not just the same store. But as we think about actual lease-up pace, you can see a strong lease-up pace in our development, redevelopment vintages, which are probably the easiest place to see that lease-up pace. We continue to be encouraged by that. And as Joe mentioned, I think that's being supplemented by the fact that there isn't an overwhelming amount of new supply in these markets that we're delivering into. And because of that, the new activity that we are delivering is being well received in the marketplace, absorbed efficiently. And we think that, that helps both our non-same-store pool, but also the dynamics for the industry and the local marketplace of our same-store assets in those marketplaces as well. Yes, we typically underwrite three to four years to get to a level of stabilization of the earnings profile of the asset. And then frankly, there's another couple of years of continued strong growth from there depending on the size of the asset, et cetera. There are certainly been time periods where we've seen much faster than that over the last several years, in particular. But kind of year in and year out that we're looking for. And obviously, three or four years is a long period of time, you're going to have demand and supply drivers within individual markets that a shift that for one in particular asset or otherwise, but I'd still point you to that kind of three or four-year time period."

            "name": "Joe Russell",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our recent performance and updated views. Then we'll open it up for Q&A. Our second quarter performance exceeded our expectations regarding existing customer behavior and occupancy levels, but fell short on rents charged to new move-in customers. Move-in rents were down 14% with competitive pricing dynamics in many markets. That compares to down 6% in our original forecast. Accordingly, we have adjusted our guidance ranges to reflect more competitive market move-in rent conditions for the remainder of the year, which Tom will cover in a moment. Overall, we are encouraged by positive momentum in our business, including new customer activity, supported by a healthy consumer with a sustained need for more space at home and the effectiveness of our broad-based customer acquisition strategies. Occupancy trends outpacing expectations with positive net move-ins year-to-date. Our in-place customers are behaving well with good payment patterns, reduced vacate activity on a year-over-year basis, and strong length of stays. Our high-growth non-same-store pool, which comprises 542 properties and 22% of total portfolio square footage is leasing up quickly with NOI growing nearly 50% during the second quarter. Several markets within our portfolio are seeing month-over-month revenue growth improvement. Waning development of new competitive supply, which will be supportive to accelerating operating fundamentals. And the acquisition market, while still quiet, is showing some signs of broader activity. Based on these favorable trends and our strong capital position, we also repurchased $200 million in Public Storage common shares during the quarter. We continue to view 2024 as a year of stabilization across our portfolio. We are excited about our trajectory over the near, medium and long term. Now, Tom will provide additional detail. Okay. Sure. I'll start, Steve. From an acquisition opportunity standpoint, for the last two or three quarters, we pointed to the fact that there was a relatively active amount of inbound calls that we were in dialogue with a whole host of different types of owners, whether individual, small and in some cases, somewhat larger portfolios. That type of activities still at hand. What typically happens on an annual basis, you'll see more activity start to percolate in the second half of the year. We think that there is likely that type of activity ahead of us. There is a number of -- or there are a number of different owners that, for a variety of reasons, are in a position to transact, whether it's capital constraint related or need for recapitalizing either existing assets or pivoting out of any asset for any particular reason. So, we have a fair amount of activity that gives us a level of confidence that we're likely to meet the number that we guided to at the beginning of the year. Clearly, we'll see how that continues to play out. But we're encouraged by the amount of activity that's playing through as we speak. Now, from an alternative standpoint, your question around how do we think about the timing, the size, and the efficacy of actually buying back our own stock, that's typically something that we look at from a capital alternative investment standpoint. We felt for a variety of reasons, we had a good opportunity in the quarter. to buy back shares. Obviously, we've got plenty of capital to deploy. We felt it was a good opportunity for us to extract the value that we see in our shares. And as we go forward, we'll continue to look at that alternative as we always do. And with that, we'll see what plays through as we go forward. Thank you. Yes, I think, first of all, there's no question we need more transaction activity to either stabilize or reinforce where cap rates have trended to. If you look at the progression on cap rate change over the last two years or so -- say, two-plus years ago, we were probably looking at plus or minus 4% handles and it trenched to 5%. Today, we're probably looking at 6% handles for, again, transaction activity. But to your point one, we need to see and realize a fair amount of trading volume for those to stabilize. We clearly see the value from our standpoint, based on our cost of capital to transact plus or minus in that 6% range, but we're keeping a very close eye on what's coming into the market and what value creation you can extract, whether it's a stabilized asset or something that's unstabilized that clearly is going to have some lease activity tied to it as well. But again, we're well-positioned relative to our own cost of capital, the size and the magnitude of capital that we can deploy, and we'll confidently go forward with any opportunity that we see that makes sense, again, based on the value creation that we're seeing. Thank you. Sure, Jeff. Yes, we definitely keep a very close eye on the variety of demand factors that bring customers to us. Housing in general, obviously, is an important part of that overall acquisition opportunity. What has continue to be quite strong. I mentioned in my opening comments, the need for more space, whether you're an owner or a renter continues to be, again, a very active rationale or active reason to come to self-storage. Clearly, it was surfacing through the pandemic. We're far past that now. The different dynamic tied to needing more space needing more space at home is the affordability factor, whether you're a renter or an owner. There's clearly less activity going on in existing sale activity the counter to that and actually the driver that's 2-plus or times larger than home sale activity is renter activity. And those customer types continue to be quite good relative to length of stay, commitment to the space, affordability factors, et cetera. And we're really not seeing any erosion relative to that kind of activity, which has been quite beneficial to the acquisition opportunity that we've been able to keep moving activity quite vibrant. So, no real change there. And actually, as Tom and I have spoken to, we look at that as -- again a very key driver relative to the vibrancy of the business overall. We're just in a more competitive environment relative to what those initial move-in rates are. But the stabilization and the behavior of existing customers is quite good. Yes, sure. Again, I wouldn't say there's any sea change in the consistent view that we've had on national development deliveries, meaning on an increase on an existing stock basis. We're kind of in that mid-2% range or so. So, the development activity that seeing any particular market has been quite positive, meaning, it's not the same volume that we've seen certainly in prior cycles, and we don't really see any momentum coming back to the amount of volume that's likely to happen nationally. Like always, we're keeping a close eye on a handful of markets that might be a little too active relative to development activity. One example might be, for instance, the West Coast of Florida. There's quite a bit of activity going on there. Phoenix and Las Vegas on a percentage of existing stock have a little bit more activity than we'd like to see. But frankly, beyond that, we're very happy with the lack of new development activity coming into the markets. The headwinds around development activity are very consistent to what we've spoken about over the last several quarters. Cost of capital, timing for entitlements, risk around component costs, and then, again, the amount of time and projections that are going into rent levels and stabilization need to be factored in as well. So, with all that, we basically have a backdrop of very low development activity. On the flip side, for our own development team, it's given us a good opportunity to jump into a number of markets that's fueling the amount of development activity we particularly continue to drive. As Tom mentioned, we're looking at a record level of development activity in 2024, and the team is working hard to look for additional opportunities into 2025, 2026 and 2027. Thanks Jeff. Thanks Ron. Yes, Keegan, I wouldn't highlight any particular new or evolving level of stress and/or change in the pattern of both behavior from a payment standpoint, length of stay, the amount of activity that we're just seeing relative to even movement that we can assess based on any particular stress that's playing through on our own customer base. We've been pleasantly surprised that all the tools that we're using to keep, again, delinquency in good shape or continue to serve us well. And we're not seeing any new and changing risk factor tied to the consumer payment patterns that have been relatively consistent now for a number of quarters. Yes, sure. So frankly, we've had a pretty good run for the last few quarters with the improved size and complexion of our third-party management platform. So, today, we have approximately 375 assets in that program. 260 of them are open, and we have another 115 that are in a variety of different stages relative to development that we'll be opening over the next year or so. This quarter, we added 17. That puts us at year-to-date over 60 additional additions to the program. . So, again, seeing a good amount of activity, both small and frankly, some larger portfolios where we've got a number of existing clients that are actually expanding the number of assets they're putting into our program. So, it's continuing to serve us well relative to additional scale in many markets. Different things that can be very advantageous, not only to our clients but ourselves. So, we're continuing to see good growth in the program and putting a fair amount of resource into it as well with the public storage team that's wholly dedicated to that platform as well. So, again, good traction, and we see some good activity going into the second half of this year. You bet. Thank you. Yes, sure. The Board itself has a very committed and vibrant process relative to board composition skill and the collective amount of knowledge and wisdom that any phase of our Board configuration continues to serve the company as a whole. So, Maria is a great addition to that in many ways, not only based on her experience as a standing CEO of another public REIT, but also her knowledge relative to real estate. She sits on two other public boards as well. She's got very strong financial acumen, coupled with very strong history of delivering great shareholder value, et cetera. So, overall, we feel she's a great addition to the Board and look forward to her contributions with the rest of the board as it stands today. Thank you. Yes. First of all, just the overall health of that market continues to be very good, Jonathan. It's a market that we're not going to see any meaningful addition to supply just the trend that you're pointing to relative to the outstripped revenue growth that we saw in that market for a sustained period of time, and it's leveling off. We hope that we'll continue to see very good trajectory going into future periods. But we don't see some of the issues, certainly in Los Angeles that you might in other markets that have been more impacted value either supply or a material shift in overall demand, I would just say it's relatively stable at this point, and we'll continue to see how it performs. We're in very good shape relative to the quality of those assets. We see very strong occupancies. As I mentioned, no new and concerning dynamics from new supply. So, -- the other thing that supports L.A. over time is it is a high cost of living market, which again supports the inherent demand for public -- for storage relative to our particular portfolio there because, again, with great locations, great scale overall in the market, and we see good in-customer demand playing through. Thank you. Maybe Spenser, just on a headline portfolio standpoint, if you look at the larger portfolios that we've taken down over the last couple of years. I'd say they are all kind of in a similar range relative to either meeting or exceeding not only our underwriting, but we've seen good traction particularly in markets where we've been able to increase scale. And then most recently, the Simply portfolio, which touched 18 different states. Again, I wouldn't point out or call out any unusual negative trends. In fact, we're seeing continued outperformance relative to our own underwriting even in that portfolio that was multi-market based. So, just to reinforce what Tom was speaking to, we're continuing to see good traction and stabilization throughout that entire portfolio and definitely look at it as being a continued driver of growth going into future periods. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Partnerships. Thank you. You may begin. \nRyan Burke: Thank you, Rob. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, May 1, 2024, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.\n A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, supplemental report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to 2 questions. Of course, if you have additional questions after those 2, feel free to jump back in queue. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. \nJoseph Russell: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our recent performance and updated industry views. Then we'll open it up for Q&A. Our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations. As we anticipated, the new move-in customer environment remains challenging. However, we are encouraged by positive trends across our business, which include industry-wide customer demand improved sequentially through the quarter, the ability to raise our move-in rates as we enter the peak leasing season; strong in-place customer behavior, including longer-than-normal length of stay and lower delinquency rates; moderating move-out volume; improving occupancy and waning development of new competitive supply, a trend we expect will continue.\n As mentioned on last quarter's call, we were encouraged by month-over-month revenue growth reacceleration in certain markets, including Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Seattle. That momentum has continued. And additionally, we see accelerating trends in markets, including San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit and Minneapolis. We anticipate more markets will be added to this list across our portfolio over the next few quarters. These bottoming-to-improving trends are particularly important for 2 reasons: First, they are in stark contrast to 2023 when all markets were decelerating as we normalize from record performance in 2021 and 2022.  \n And second, they put us on track for improving company-wide financial performance in the back half of this year as embedded in our guidance. Additionally, our high-growth non-same-store pool assets comprises 538 properties and 22% of our overall portfolio square footage. With NOI growth approaching nearly 50% during the first quarter, these properties remain a strong engine of growth. Overall, we are encouraged by what we are seeing on the ground. The team is very focused on capturing new customer activity as we approach the busy season, which will help drive our performance for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail. \nH. Boyle: Thanks, Joe. Shifting to financial performance. We reported first quarter core FFO of $4.03 representing a 1.2% decline compared to the first quarter of 2023. Looking at the same-store portfolio, revenue increased 0.1% compared to the first quarter of '23. That was driven by rent growth, offset by modest occupancy declines. Move-in rates, adjusting out our winter promotional sale activity were down 11% in the quarter.\n Positive net move-in volumes led to a modest closing of the occupancy gap at quarter end to down 60 basis points. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 4.8% for the first quarter, largely driven by increases in property tax and marketing spend to drive move-in activity. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties declined 1.5% in the quarter. Our performance in the stabilized same-store pool was supplemented by very strong growth in our nonsame-store pool, as Joe highlighted.  \n With the nonsame-store assets at 81% occupancy in the quarter, we have confidence in outsized growth from that pool to come this year and into the future, which is a segue to our outlook for '24. We reaffirmed our core FFO guidance for the year with a $16.90 midpoint on par with 2023. The first quarter was in line with our internal expectations. And as we discussed on our last quarterly call, we anticipate deceleration of financial performance into the second quarter and with improvement in the second half.  \n Outlook for capital allocation remains intact with $450 million of development deliveries anticipated, which will be a record year for Public Storage and $500 million of acquisitions in the second half. The transaction market for acquisitions remains subdued with limited volumes given a volatile cost of capital environment year-to-date. We're optimistic that there's a pent-up level of transaction activity likely to come, and we're eager to participate when that does occur.  \n Finally, our capital and liquidity position remains strong. We refinanced our 2024 maturities in April with a combination of a 3-year floating rate note, a 15-year euro note and a 30-year reopening. Our leverage of 3.9x net debt and preferred to EBITDA puts us in a very strong position heading through the year.  \n So with that, I'll turn the call back to Rob to open it up for a Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. \nSamir Khanal: I guess, Joe, you talked about 1Q being in line with expectations. Maybe talk around April, kind of what you're seeing on move-in trends sort of general trends you're seeing in April? And I guess, how has April sort of played out versus your expectations? \nJoseph Russell: Sure, Samir. Yes, I would put April in the same context of sequential improvement that we saw through the first quarter, where again, we've seen overall expected top-of-funnel demand, expected move-in activity. We've been pleased by that. It's matching our expectations as Tom and I have outlined, the way the year is likely to play out. So no surprises. And I would say, a validation of the reacceleration in a number of markets that I pointed to in my opening comments. \nH. Boyle: Yes. And Samir, maybe, it's Tom here. Maybe I'll just provide a couple of data points on April as well. Similar trends, as Joe mentioned, on move-in rents into April, we are starting to increase those rents, as Joe highlighted, as we move into May in the peak leasing season. Existing customers performing quite well, something that Joe highlighted in his remarks. Move-outs were again down year-over-year in the month of April, occupancy finished the month down 50 to 60 basis points. So a pretty consistent April. And obviously, we're eager to get into May, June and July here, the peak leasing season of the year. \nSamir Khanal: Got it. And I guess just shifting over to the transaction market, I know you mentioned it was subdued kind of possibly with rates spiking here in March and April. I guess what gives you the confidence that you'll start to see sort of or transaction or opportunities in the second half? \nJoseph Russell: Yes, Samir, there's likely to be a range of motivations that's going to bring a seller to market. The fluctuation in those motivations has been up and down, obviously, as we've seen over the last few quarters with the volatility with interest rates, et cetera. But having said that, we've been in active dialogue with a number of owners that will likely transact sometime in 2024. I think they're trying to gauge more precise timing based on what may or may not be coming through the discussion. The Fed may be indicating relative to change in interest rates between now and end of the year, et cetera. \n But on one end of the spectrum, there are a number of situations that will require an owner to bring an asset to market, whether individually or in some level of a portfolio. So we do still anticipate some activity beginning to percolate. As Tom mentioned, it's been a pretty quiet couple of quarters, but the conversations that we've been having with a number of owners are giving us confidence that there's likely some pending trading activity that we may be able to capture, thus not changing our outlook for 2024 relative to the amount of acquisition activity we're likely to capture. \nOperator: Our next question is from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. \nKeegan Carl: Maybe first, just curious for your expectations in the housing market that you currently have embedded in your guidance, and if this has changed at all since your initial guidance commentary a few months ago. \nH. Boyle: Yes. Sure. Keegan, this is Tom. So I wouldn't edit any of the commentary that we had in February around any of the assumptions really heading into the peak leasing season here. We obviously just provided that outlook a little over 60 days ago. And as Joe mentioned and probably not surprisingly, providing that outlook 2/3 of the way through the first quarter. The first quarter played out very similar to our expectations. \n And I think that the range of outcomes very much intact there as well. And specifically to the housing market, we are not anticipating in any of the ranges a robust housing market. And based on where interest rates have moved, I think that's the right place to be as we sit here today as well. \nJoseph Russell: And again, just as a reminder, certainly, that demand factor is one, but it's one of a number that, particularly at this time of year can provide momentum and higher level of top-of-funnel demand, our view of a different customer cohort i.e. renters continues to be quite strong. So we're very pleased by the activity that's also coming from that type of customer. And with that, and then as your question alludes to a more subdued housing market at the moment, we still feel that we've got good demand factors that are going to drive the business going into a busy leasing season. \nKeegan Carl: Got it. And then shifting gears, maybe just a big picture question. I guess I'm just trying to figure out what it would take in the broader environment? If we think about our upcoming NAREIT meetings in a handful of weeks here, like what will it take for you guys to be more positive or optimistic tone. In other words, I'm trying to figure out what can go right in storage, given it feels like everyone is just focused on where weakness is going to persist? \nH. Boyle: Sure. Keegan, I'll preface some NAREIT meetings then. So I would highlight, maybe, 2 elements that we would be pleased to be discussing at NAREIT and I think would give us a positive tone. One of them, going back to Joe's commentary, is adding more markets to that list of markets that are reaccelerating, right? As we think about the bottoms that are occurring in many of these markets and reacceleration, we're a collection of 90 markets around the country, not a one-stop moving portfolio. And so adding more markets to that list gives us more and more confidence in terms of the outlook and the performance of the portfolio as a whole, clearly. \n The second thing, I'd maybe highlight, would be more dialogue, I think to the questions we were just discussing around capital allocation, more dialogue with sellers, not necessarily more transactions over the next 30 days, but more dialogue, more underwriting activity as we set up for what is traditionally a busier time period for self-storage transactions in the second half of the year, we'll start to have some of that dialogue here over the next 30 to 60 days. And Joe, I don't know if there's anything you'd add. No? Good. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citibank. \nEric Wolfe: Maybe just a follow-up on your last answer. You mentioned that you're seeing a reacceleration in revenue growth in increasing number of markets you talked about those markets, but just wanted a clarification on that. I mean does that mean that your year-over-year revenue growth is accelerating in those markets? Or does that mean that your -- as your occupancy kind of goes up due to normal seasonal patterns, you're seeing sequential month-over-month growth in revenue, which I think you would probably expect just given normal seasonal patterns. \nH. Boyle: Yes. Very good question, Eric, to clarify what we're meaning by that. So specifically, what we're speaking to is month-over-month improvement in year-over-year revenue growth. So if you think about -- pick a market, it's growing 1% in the month of February, in the month of March, it's growing 1.5%. That would be an reaccelerating market. So not a seasonal thing or revenue on an absolute basis going higher because of higher occupancy or things like that, but actual year-over-year growth improvement. \n And contextually, it's part of the opportunity that continues to play through in many, many markets. We mentioned waning supply. So we're also going into an environment where the competition factor in the vast majority of our markets continues to decrease. Again, as we're starting to see this reacceleration that's also, for the most part, in many markets with very little new supply coming in. That's too an additive factor relative to the amount of demand that we continue to see an opportunity to drive more customers into the portfolio. \nEric Wolfe: Got it. That's helpful. And then I just had a question on the sales activity. You talked about the impact on your move-in rents for the quarter. But was just curious what criteria you look at in order to determine why you should increase that sales activity. So if we look at last October or this March, is why did you decide to increase sales versus the other month, especially given some of the recent positive demand indicators that you're just talking about. \nH. Boyle: Yes. That's a good question, Eric. So we've run these sales consistently over time. And last year, we ran a number of different time periods. And in the month of -- tail end of February and beginning of March, we ran one as well. The primary reason is we had some inventory that we felt like we can move. And so the different points of the year, we'll try different promotional tactics, sales tactics to drive customer activity, pairing that with advertising and the like. We tend to see good traction there. We saw good traction during the winter season here, as we talked about, and we'll likely use -- continue to use promotional activity, sale activity and the like through the year this year, not dissimilar to what we did last year. \nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. \nJeffrey Spector: Great. In the markets that you talked about where you're seeing these accelerating trends, I guess, can you talk about that a little bit more, like what's driving that from your view and tie that into the comments that you did say, Joe, that the new move-ins do remain challenging. So I'm just trying to tie those 2 together? \nJoseph Russell: Yes, Jeff, maybe to start with the second part of the question. Yes, challenging on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, we're seeing a good trend up. So we hope to continue to see that build as we go into further months into the year, and our confidence grows month-by-month even through the month of April, as we've talked about. So that's 1 powerful component. \n Thematically, many of the markets where we're starting to see this reacceleration on the early side, were typically markets that were not the high flyers and the peaks of the pandemic era, so they haven't had to reset relative to the more dramatic rate increases and overall demand increases that we saw through the pandemic. So on the flip side of that, you're not hearing us talk about Florida, for instance. So Florida has got a ways to go before I think we'd add them into that reaccelerating bucket. \n But on a more active level and more dominant level across the portfolio as we've listed out market by market, we're starting to see that improvement, particularly where we've got markets that weren't those high flyers but seeing more consistent performance, and we're seeing to see -- we're starting to see that reacceleration as we speak. So there's more to come. As we've also talked to, so we're confident as the year plays out, we're likely to add to this list of reaccelerating markets. And again, as I just mentioned, with many of these markets not dealing with an abundance of new supply as well. \nJeffrey Spector: My follow-up then [Technical Difficulty] so you've revised their numbers a couple of times now. \nJoseph Russell: Sorry, you cut out. Can you repeat? I'm sorry, you cut out for a second. \nJeffrey Spector: My follow-up, Joe, is on supply. I was saying that we subscribed to Yardi, and I think they've updated that now a couple of times where this year is higher than last year, but expecting a decrease into next year. I guess, can you provide a little bit more on your supply forecast? Like are you seeing something different or the same for this year, let's say, and then for 2025 at this point? \nJoseph Russell: Yes, Jeff, if you step back, I mean I appreciate the way that Yardi attempts to track nationally, both development activity. And then more precisely, what I think can be more difficult is the reality of how many of those projects, actually, get -- put into production and then are likely to complete on a year-by-year basis. So we've been very consistent now for the last 2 to 3 years where we in our own development activity have seen the competitive factor of the supply taper down. \n It's tapering down in 2024. So I think I would say we have a bit of a different opinion if they're pointing some type of an uptick this year. What we see and has been very commanding on a day-to-day basis. And if you're actually doing development as we're doing on a national basis, the amount of headwinds, the amount of timing delays, the amount of complication market to market has not eased at all. \n Again, we've been very consistent about that. And then you layer on a, the cost of capital that Tom and I've been talking to as well as the unpredictability in certain markets relative to demand, et cetera, there's more headwinds than any developer on an individual basis is facing. And by virtue of that, you're seeing a downdraft in the amount of deliveries, which we think are going to continue going into next year and the year after. \n We're frankly looking at development if you're starting fresh in any given market that could take anywhere from 2 to 3 years just to get through an entitlement process right now. So just think about that from a calendar standpoint, that puts you out into 2026 and 2027 and there's really not an easy way to combat that. So the risk factors tied to development continue to increase for all the factors I just mentioned. And we're pretty confident that our lens into that activity is far more accurate than others. \nOperator: Our next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nTodd Thomas: Tom, I just wanted to go back to the guidance, which you affirmed, and it sounds like the quarter was relatively in line overall. I'm wondering, are you still anticipating move-in rents to cross the 0 threshold later in the summer and occupancy to remain down about 80 basis points in the year or has the mix shifted around a little bit following this quarter's and the April performance that you discussed? \nH. Boyle: Yes, Todd. No, I'd point you to all of that commentary that we had on the February call as intact as it relates to the assumptions that underlie the range there. And as you'd anticipate, the next 3 months are going to be important as to which directions we're heading on certain of those metrics. We've been encouraged by performance to date. And we'll have more to talk about ranges and things like that as we move through the year. \nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then following up on that, is there a scenario in which move-in rents remain a little bit weaker than you anticipated down double digits or high-single digits, but occupancy continues to improve and you end up closing that gap entirely. And if so, what would that look like? What would the sensitivity around the model look like for guidance purposes, if there was an outcome in that sort of direction? \nH. Boyle: Sure. There's -- I mean, there's definitely a range of outcomes and assumptions that you can make on the revenue modeling. I think what you're highlighting is, if you have better occupancy performance but worse rate performance. But if you end up in the same spot, could you end up in the same places you otherwise would have anticipated. Absolutely. \nTodd Thomas: Okay. And just last question then. One of your peers saw a slight uptick in vacate activity. And it sounded like that there was an expectation that there'd be some sort of continued normalization around vacates and in the length of tenant's days. Your vacate activity was lower in the quarter versus last year. And I'm just wondering, if you expect that to continue? Or do you see potential for vacate activity and the length of stay trends to normalize a bit more going forward? \nH. Boyle: So I think there's a couple of parts to that question, Todd. I think the first one is around length of stays and what we've seen trend-wise. And we've been really pleasantly surprised over the last several years at how sticky the length of stay has been when we were sitting here on calls in 2021, we were concerned that maybe there'd be a pretty quick return to normal or \"pre-pandemic\" length of stays, and we're now sitting here in 2024 still talking about longer length of stays compared to pre-pandemic levels. \n But we're certainly off of those 2021 and 2022 peaks. And so there has been a \"normalization\". But I think some of the factors that have led to longer length of stay are durable. We've talked about customers that are using storage because they ran out of space in their home, less housing turnover likely leads to longer length of stays. All these things can be a positive as it relates to length of stay. And so while we're off the piece, we still remain encouraged by customer behavior and the length of stays that we're seeing in the portfolio today. So it may be the first part. The second part is, how are we thinking about move-out activity and move-out activity, I think, in the midpoint case is for basically flat year-over-year move-out activity. So we're not anticipating a spike in that midpoint case. \nJoseph Russell: And then maybe just a third component from a macro health of customer standpoint with plus or minus 85% of our customers being consumers, employment trends continue to validate the economy is in very strong shape. We're not seeing any elevated level of stress play through that even takes us back to the pre-pandemic levels, i.e., they're better. Payment patterns, delinquency patterns, et cetera, are still in a very good zone. We're not seeing any new and undue stress that's coming through on the customer environment as a whole. So we continue to be very pleased and confident about our ability to see that level of stability with our existing customer base. \nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. \nEric Luebchow: Appreciate the time today. Just wanted to touch on same-store expenses a little bit. I saw slightly elevated growth in property taxes. I think you had guided to that being up about 5%. So maybe kind of is there any kind of seasonality to think about throughout the year in property taxes and then also marketing expenses up significantly. How should we think about how those trend throughout the year given the unique dynamics of this year with spring leasing coming up? \nH. Boyle: Yes, that's a great question. So as you highlighted, operating expense for the quarter was above our full year outlook. And so we are anticipating that overall operating expense trends will improve. And so you've hit on a couple of the drivers of that, and I'll elaborate on a couple of others. The first one, property tax, we still are anticipating property tax to be plus or minus 5% year-over-year growth for the year. The first quarter did have some reassessments that were earlier in the year this year that was kind of onetime related. \n On the marketing topic, similarly, if you look at marketing spend in the first quarter, it was pretty consistent with the fourth quarter, which is a little bit higher seasonally, we'd anticipate marketing spend both on an absolute basis, but also on a year-over-year basis to moderate a little bit as we move through the year, obviously, depending on customer demand activity and the like, but that's another driver. \n But I would also add 2 others. One is our capital investments that we're making in solar power on our rooftops, which has a myriad benefits for us, obviously, the environment and our customer base. And one of the factors there will be lowering utility expense. We had that in the first quarter, but that's going to continue as we move through the next couple of quarters. And then also the technology investments that we've made around our customer interaction now over 2/3 of our customers are coming to us and renting digitally before they ever show up in a property. That number continues to grow, and we've been very clear around some of the opportunities to utilize that for specialization and centralization of roles and lower payroll expense as we move through the year, and we'll see more of that heading through 2024 as well. \nEric Luebchow: Great. Appreciate it. And just on a -- for a follow-up, you mentioned some of the risks of development right now, you're seeing longer lead times for things like entitlement, higher construction costs, higher interest expense. So it seems like PSA is really leaning in now. A lot of your competitors may be pulling back. But do you have any change in your outlook to get to kind of an 8% NOI yield bogey within 3 to 4 years, which I think was your historic underwriting. Anything you can call out specific where the markets you're developing today, the supply conditions, the competitive intensity, why you're -- what gives you the confidence you can get to those type of returns? \nJoseph Russell: Yes. I mean we take clearly a multiyear view of that hurdle rate. It hasn't changed even out of some of the pressure points that we've spoken to. So we continue to see the opportunity to find very good land sites, assets that will, from a competitive standpoint, not be burdened relative to any undue risk. That's another thing that we factor in with the amount of data and the knowledge we have submarket to submarket that gives us the level of confidence we can get to that hurdle, if not higher. \n So really haven't changed any of our hurdle expectations and/or the risk that, that might convey relative to what could play out on a market-by-market basis. To your point, yes, there's definitely more things that we're evaluating relative to the cost, timing, rent level achievements, et cetera, that go into underwriting, but we're still confident that we're adding to and finding very good sites to continue to grow our scale in many, many markets nationally. \n So development team is working very hard to uncover those opportunities. Frankly, maybe another point to your question, we have a different and more advantageous competitive advantage. We're seeing more land sites that might be further into entitlement processes that we are interested relative to potentially accelerating some of those delivery hurdles that I talked about. So many factors in this environment actually played our platform quite well, and we continue to one by one take advantage of those. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. \nMichael Goldsmith: Given what you've started to see in some of the markets turning, bouncing off the bottom and starting to reaccelerate, does that mean that ECRIs in this market could also start to pick up? \nH. Boyle: Yes, certainly. I mean as you see momentum in a market, we've talked consistently about how we think about existing customer rent increases. One of the factors is certainly the cost to replace a tenant and as we see moving rate and demand activity percolating in those markets that will feed into our thinking about, well, should a customer maybe receive a higher magnitude or higher frequency of increase, so. Absolutely. And I think second piece of our existing customer rate increase models around customer performance, and we've been speaking in a couple of previous questions around how we continue to be encouraged by that behavior. \nMichael Goldsmith: And my second question is around the type of customer that's acquired through the sale process that you did, does that generate -- does the sale generate incremental demand? Or does it help you take market share? Does that customer have a different demographic profile of length-of-stay customer? I'm guessing -- I'm trying to get at is it would seem that there should be a higher customer acquisition cost for this customer, trying to determine if there is a -- how does that customer lifetime value look for that customer. \nH. Boyle: Yes, Michael. I'd say across the Board, different pricing, promotion and advertising tactics will lead to drawing more, a little bit different mixes of customers and the like to our stores. And so we pull those different levers throughout the year, looking to try to maximize NOI ultimately. So revenue less the advertising expense associated with it. And so we're toggling those levers, trying to maximize that outcome. And so as you look at a sale, for instance, it will draw more customers and we'll use some different tactics around pricing and promotion and advertising to try to optimize that overall lifetime value of the customer. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. \nSpenser Allaway: Consumer Health continues to be topical just given the economic backdrop. But I was just wondering specifically about the commercial tenant. Can you comment on the health or appetite of the business consumer? And how has that changed, if at all, in the last year? \nJoseph Russell: Yes, Spenser. I would say in light fashion, no stress points or any other headwinds that we're seeing from that type of customer. There's obviously a very broad range of user types, different industries, some are product-oriented, some are service-oriented, some are very specific to certain locations. But I wouldn't, in any way, characterize we're seeing any elevated level of stress, actually, still very good, consistent use of storage, particularly, as I mentioned, there may be certain factors that pull a commercial customer configuration into one property at a higher or lower level than another. But again, nothing that we've seen that indicates there's an elevated level of stress or concern. As the economy continues to be quite good, we're seeing actually still good demand factors coming from business users overall. \nSpenser Allaway: Okay. And then on the marketing front, just curious if the dollars being spent on advertisement are fairly comparable across markets or other regions or particular -- sorry, other regions like a particular focus where you guys are either trying to push occupancy or where you're seeing greater top-of-the funnel demand that might entice you to spend more? \nH. Boyle: Yes, Spenser, it's a good question. And maybe a follow-up to Michael's question on how we're managing pricing, promotion, advertising. All 3 are being utilized really at a local level to drive a combination of either traffic in the form of advertising or conversion rates related to pricing and promotion activity. And advertising is something that we can use either nationally or what we typically do is much more locally to support top-of-funnel demand in local markets where we're getting both a combination of good return on that ad spend but also supporting properties that would benefit from incremental top-of-funnel demand. So it varies pretty widely. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. \nDaniel Tricarico: It's Daniel Tricarico on for Nick. Following up on some of the earlier questions in your commentary, Tom, and sorry to harp on this. I know you've talked about ECRIs being a combination of price sensitivity and cost to replace, the latter now increasingly elevated today in relation to the discounted pricing strategy you're using. So my question is, how do you think about the magnitude and velocity for which move-in rate needs to improve so that the cost to replace or in theory, the roll-down effect is offset and revenue growth can reaccelerate again? Or is there another way I should be thinking about it? \nH. Boyle: There's a lot embedded in there. I think the first thing, I would say, is as you look at cost to replace, you all can see some of the elements that go into cost to replace pretty clearly based on our move-in and move-out rates. Some of them are different and related to how long we think a unit will be vacant, what the advertising spend may be associated with the unit, what the promotional activity may be around it and that's all managed at the individual unit level. \n And so big picture, one of the things we've highlighted this year is that we think overall contribution from existing customer rate increases will be pretty consistent with last year. And you said, well, how can that be if you think cost to replace maybe a little bit higher. And I'd say, well, there's another element that I add to what I just highlighted, which is the mix of the tenant base. So we had success in moving in a meaningful number of new customers last year above and beyond the prior year. Those customers tend to get a higher frequency of increase earlier on in their tenancy and that's contributing to performance this year of our ECRI program. And so I think there's a multitude of different components there. Cost to replace is certainly an important one. But as we look at the year, this year, we think overall contribution will be relatively consistent. \nDaniel Tricarico: Maybe a less convoluted follow-up. Could you share how you bucket the demand segments for the business, maybe to give us a better understanding of the current picture? Is the general like job and homemover 30% or 40% of demand and then the longer-term business customer 20% and then another cohort the balance? Any color you could share from any of your internal data would be great. \nH. Boyle: Yes, sure. So I anticipate that overall demand contribution this year is pretty similar to last year. And the way we've bucketed the contribution to move-ins last year was about 15%, 1-5 percent of customers that are coming to us because of an existing home sale related move and that was down from about 20% in a more typical year. So a relatively modest contribution. Customers that are moving and they're renters, either single-family or multifamily renters, tend to make up a larger percentage, call it, between 40%, 45% of the tenant base. \n And then you've got another group that we've consistently spoke of that's been elevated post-2020, and that's customers that have run out of space at home. That's been a consistently outpunching pre-pandemic levels and is likely to be more like 15%, 20%. And then as you go beyond that, I'd call it other. There's a whole host of interesting use cases as well as commercial tenants that will make up the rest. And so we continue to see good, obviously, move-in activity at our stores. And as Joe mentioned, we've been encouraged by that activity year-to-date. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. \nJuan Sanabria: Just on the acquisition front, can you remind us how much is assumed or baked into guidance for presumably accretion from the acquisition volume highlighted in guidance? And then kind of as a subset of that question, how are you guys thinking about Canada? I know the family -- the Hughes family has some assets there, does that prohibit you from potentially getting involved there? Or is there any time that the family may be looking for one reason or another to monetize their stake? \nJoseph Russell: Sure. Yes. So to again, point to 2024 guidance on acquisitions, we've pegged $500 million. Obviously, at this point in the year, it's going to be more back ended. But some of the commentary, Juan, earlier in the call relative to what we're likely to see with a range of different motivations from sellers, we've got, I think, good perception into the ways that we can get to that kind of acquisition volume as we sit here today. The Canada question, to your point around the Hughes family and their ownership and platform in that market, it does not impede our ability to go into that market itself. So there are no conflicts on either side for either party to continue to look at a range of investments in that market. So with that, no commentary relative to what the future may play out, but there are no constraints on our part. \nJuan Sanabria: Great. And then just a question on labor and FTEs, you guys, in your Investor Day, which is now a couple of years back, hit your targets in cutting down, I think, workforce utilization or cost associated about a quarter from prior levels. I guess where are you in further abilities to reduce FTEs or payroll costs? And could you just give us maybe a sense of kind of how the industry has changed in terms of FTEs per store maybe 5 years ago to where you are now to where you ultimately think you can end up going? \nJoseph Russell: Yes, I can speak to that in certainly our own platform. So the goals that we pointed to in our Investor Day presentation or achieved plus or minus a couple of years ago, so we were very pleased with the opportunity that we saw to optimize labor hours with many of the tools that supported that, particularly tied to our digital platform. What has played out from, again, the last 2 years through today and then even going forward, there's actually more to achieve. That comes from the continued improvement in our operating model, the digital tools that we're using not only for one type of day-to-day demand that comes in and out of a property, which is tied to move-in activity, but its overall customer support. We've rolled out a PS app that now we have about 1.5 million customers tied to. \n So that's direct account management that takes the burden off of property labor hours, very efficient for the customer as well. So it's a win-win in terms of not only time savings on our end of the spectrum but efficiency and consistency from a customer standpoint. We continue to look at very different and robust digital tools and optimization tools that give us the amount of clarity and trajectory that we're going to likely see with continued reduction in FTA hours. I think we're doing that in a very different way than the industry has done. You can look at some metrics that you can benchmark our performance to others. \n So Tom already mentioned that about 2/3 of our customers now transact with us digitally. That's far and excess of not only what the industry is achieving. But what level of accelerated performance we're getting from that channel and that level of interaction with customers directly. So a lot of good things that we're continuing to tackle on that front. \n With the amount of data that we have, we continue to look at different ways of continuing to optimize and bolt-on more, again, opportunities to not only drive down labor hours, but as importantly, maintain or increase customer satisfaction levels. So a lot of good things that we're continuing to invest in there and very confident about the trajectory we're on. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. \nRonald Kamdem: Just 2 quick ones. One is just on Southern California. If you could just provide just updated thoughts, it's still one of your best-performing markets. What's sort of the prospect of that starting to reaccelerate as you're sort of going forward and how is fundamentals trending on the ground? \nH. Boyle: Yes, that's a great question. So Southern California continues to be a strong market for us, both Los Angeles as well as San Diego. During the quarter, we were impacted by some storm activity and state of emergency restrictions that impacted the quarter's financial performance for a couple of months. But those markets continue to see strong customer activity, and we have confidence in those markets heading through the rest of the year. \nJoseph Russell: And just again to bolt on a comment, Ron, that we made in other questions. Again, very, very little competitive new supply. It's one of the most difficult markets to either a find land sites and work through entitlement processes, et cetera. Uniquely, though, it's the market at the moment, we have the most development activity nationally in. So we uniquely are finding some interesting opportunities to expand our portfolio right here in Southern California.  And to Tom's point, we're still seeing very consistent and good levels of activity. \nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then my second one was just a follow-up on the marketing spend question. Is it fair to say it's at the highest level in 5 years as a percentage of revenue as number one. And then can you talk about the breakout of that marketing spend inflation between just cost per click going up versus just more marketing being done if that makes sense? \nH. Boyle: Yes. So a couple of questions, components there. So the first quarter and fourth quarter, we tend to see higher percents of revenue as we think about supporting demand in quarters where we have seasonally more inventory to rent, and we get good returns in those quarters to do that. And then we typically see the second and third quarter marketing spend come down a little bit as a percentage of revenue.\n As you look at the quarter, yes, it was probably pretty consistent with some quarters we had back in 2018, 2019, maybe a touch under what some of them were, but a comfortable range as we think about the level of marketing support that we're providing the stores. As I mentioned on a previous question, that's dynamically managed around local demand trends and supporting the business. But I would anticipate from an absolute percentage of revenue that's likely to decline in the next couple of quarters like it did last year before coming up again in the fourth quarter to support higher inventory levels at the lower levels of occupancy we experienced in the fourth quarter. \nOperator: Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. \nCaitlin Burrows: Maybe just on acquisitions. It looks like subsequent to the quarter end, you had $34.6 million in acquisitions. So just wondering if you could talk about how these properties came about? Were they 4 separate deals? What type of seller? \nJoseph Russell: Yes. Individual sellers, Caitlin, small or deal-by-deal opportunities. As typically, we see there's a range of different seller types that were in dialogue very actively. So these were, again, individual owners. I would tell you, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to have a whole range of different conversations with different owner types, whether family owners, individual owners, institutional owners, but again, the deals that we've got either closed or under contract or just that very one-offs, smaller assets that fit well into certain markets that we're certainly interested in growing scale, et cetera. \nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just one on the move-in, move-out spread, it looks like it's flattened a bit. So do you have a view on whether we've hit the trough of that spread given where the move-out rates and move-in rates are at this point, and I guess, expectation going forward? \nH. Boyle: Yes. We would anticipate, Caitlin, that, that spread does narrow in the second and third quarters seasonally before widening out again in the fourth quarter. So not dissimilar from a seasonal trend standpoint to what I was speaking to related to advertising. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. \nKi Bin Kim: So I'm not sure if I missed it or not, but did you give an update on April move-in rate trends? \nH. Boyle: I did, Ki Bin. \nKi Bin Kim: Okay. I'll just go back in the transcript. When you look at the year-to-date changes in sequential rents, how does that compare to what you would consider a normal seasonal pattern, has been better or worse? \nH. Boyle: I'd say on a year-over-year basis, it's been pretty consistent, touch better than last year, which is what we'd anticipate. And obviously, we're anticipating that likely to continue here through the peak leasing season. We'll update you on that as we move through the next 3 months or so. \nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And on your CapEx, you have $150 million for the Property of Tomorrow program that's supposed to wind down next year. But just trying to get a better sense of it. I mean does it go to 0? Or is there a certain level that you might have to keep for a longer time? \nH. Boyle: No, it's going to go to 0. Probably some of the cash payments on the cash flow statement will continue into the first quarter or so of next year just as we wrap up the program and make our final payments. But ultimately, that will go to 0. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. \nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Just given some of your comments around improving trends in more markets. Could you talk a little bit kind of January, February, March, specifically around street rates kind of on a year-over-year basis. How that was improving throughout the quarter. Like do we kind of sort of like we're negative 15 and now we're like a negative 10 and heading towards 0 that's kind of embedded in some of your guidance going forward? \nH. Boyle: Okay. So there's kind of 2 parts to that question. One is the accelerating markets, and those accelerated markets are driven by a whole host of things and not just individually moving rents, right? But as we think about that, we highlighted on the previous call 2 or 3 markets that were accelerating at the time we were sitting there in February, and we added a handful of markets to that. So we're definitely seeing improving trends across that group of markets. \n I think your next question was just sequentially as we think about year-over-year declines in move-in rents and on the February call, I had highlighted that January, February move-in rates were down in the 10% or 11% ZIP code. And we finished the quarter and had April right around that same sort of level. Obviously, there's periods of time where it's a little bit better than that, periods of time where we're lowering rates to drive move-in volume. \n So it's been relatively consistent, which is what you'd anticipate really through the first part of the year because you're at the trough point of rents. And as I noted, we're at the point of the year now where we are raising rents now. And that's when we're likely to see some changing activity as it relates to those trends, as we've discussed in our outlook. \nOmotayo Okusanya: That's helpful. And then for ECRI increases, are they also kind of consistent versus what we've been seeing in recent quarters? \nH. Boyle: Yes, pretty consistent in terms of trends. With the exception of what I highlighted earlier around more newer tenants added to the program, given that strong move-in volumes last year. \nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. \nMichael Mueller: Sorry to drag out the call longer here. But what are some of the attributes of the markets where you're seeing the improvement that you flagged? Is it just less supply? Because it seems like that list that you rattled off was dominated by kind of bigger cities. And as a follow-up to that, is the momentum you're talking about? Is it better momentum in move-in rates? Or is it just more traffic-oriented? \nH. Boyle: Sure, Mike. I think there's a number of factors. You rattle off some of them that are contributing to it. We listed a series of markets. Each market is a little bit different. Certainly, supply plays a component in some of those markets, meaning a lack of supply, higher barriers to entry as Joe spoke to on certain of those markets. But I'd also highlight stronger demand trends, better move-in rent trends, better move-out activity. It's really a handful of different drivers that are unique to each market. \n But as you characterize them all, I would categorize them into markets that didn't have the same, really strong levels of growth in '21 and '22 and so don't have the same level of really difficult comps to come off of. And as Joe mentioned earlier, you can put Florida, for instance, as a big winner over the last couple of years is likely to take a little bit longer to normalize, but still has been a really strong performer over the last several years for us. \nOperator: Our next question is from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. \nBrendan Lynch: Maybe I could get your thoughts on what's behind the lower delinquency rates that you highlighted in the script. Some macro data suggests that consumers are facing some incremental challenges, but that doesn't seem to be what you're seeing. \nJoseph Russell: Yes. I would say, Brendan, on a macro basis, we still see a very healthy consumer base. We've got plus or minus about 2 million customers. So full spectrum of the economy at large and not really seeing any undue pressure market by market or again, that would indicate that there's some elevated amount of risk that's coming from relative to stress points, et cetera. I think you're hearing a fair amount of commentary even now that we're well into 2024 around consumer balance sheets, employment levels are quite strong. I think this is part of the angst that the Fed is having relative to their timing relative to tapering, et cetera. So the employment and behavior from consumers at large continues to be quite good, and we're very pleased by that, obviously. \n On a day-to-day basis, we're not seeing the type of range of when you see a customer go into some level of delinquency, et cetera, the pace and the nature of that pattern isn't as elevated as it was pre-pandemic. So keeping a very close eye on, but no material shift and continues to give us an outlook that the consumer environment is going to be quite healthy. \nBrendan Lynch: Great. That's helpful. And maybe just 1 more. You rent some TV ads in the quarter. Can you just talk about your thought process around when and where to use TV advertisement versus other types of advertising? \nH. Boyle: Yes. We did use a little bit of TV advertising. It's one of the things that we can utilize pretty uniquely in the industry, given our national scale and platform. And so that's something we will use periodically. In this case, we used it to advertise some of our promotional activity, which we saw a good reaction to in the quarter. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Burke for closing comments. \nRyan Burke: Thanks, Rob, and thanks to all of you out there for your continuing interest and time, and we'll talk to you soon. Have a good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our recent performance and updated industry views. Then we'll open it up for Q&A. Our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations. As we anticipated, the new move-in customer environment remains challenging. However, we are encouraged by positive trends across our business, which include industry-wide customer demand improved sequentially through the quarter, the ability to raise our move-in rates as we enter the peak leasing season; strong in-place customer behavior, including longer-than-normal length of stay and lower delinquency rates; moderating move-out volume; improving occupancy and waning development of new competitive supply, a trend we expect will continue.\n As mentioned on last quarter's call, we were encouraged by month-over-month revenue growth reacceleration in certain markets, including Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Seattle. That momentum has continued. And additionally, we see accelerating trends in markets, including San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit and Minneapolis. We anticipate more markets will be added to this list across our portfolio over the next few quarters. These bottoming-to-improving trends are particularly important for 2 reasons: First, they are in stark contrast to 2023 when all markets were decelerating as we normalize from record performance in 2021 and 2022.  \n And second, they put us on track for improving company-wide financial performance in the back half of this year as embedded in our guidance. Additionally, our high-growth non-same-store pool assets comprises 538 properties and 22% of our overall portfolio square footage. With NOI growth approaching nearly 50% during the first quarter, these properties remain a strong engine of growth. Overall, we are encouraged by what we are seeing on the ground. The team is very focused on capturing new customer activity as we approach the busy season, which will help drive our performance for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail. Sure, Samir. Yes, I would put April in the same context of sequential improvement that we saw through the first quarter, where again, we've seen overall expected top-of-funnel demand, expected move-in activity. We've been pleased by that. It's matching our expectations as Tom and I have outlined, the way the year is likely to play out. So no surprises. And I would say, a validation of the reacceleration in a number of markets that I pointed to in my opening comments. Yes, Samir, there's likely to be a range of motivations that's going to bring a seller to market. The fluctuation in those motivations has been up and down, obviously, as we've seen over the last few quarters with the volatility with interest rates, et cetera. But having said that, we've been in active dialogue with a number of owners that will likely transact sometime in 2024. I think they're trying to gauge more precise timing based on what may or may not be coming through the discussion. The Fed may be indicating relative to change in interest rates between now and end of the year, et cetera. \n But on one end of the spectrum, there are a number of situations that will require an owner to bring an asset to market, whether individually or in some level of a portfolio. So we do still anticipate some activity beginning to percolate. As Tom mentioned, it's been a pretty quiet couple of quarters, but the conversations that we've been having with a number of owners are giving us confidence that there's likely some pending trading activity that we may be able to capture, thus not changing our outlook for 2024 relative to the amount of acquisition activity we're likely to capture. And again, just as a reminder, certainly, that demand factor is one, but it's one of a number that, particularly at this time of year can provide momentum and higher level of top-of-funnel demand, our view of a different customer cohort i.e. renters continues to be quite strong. So we're very pleased by the activity that's also coming from that type of customer. And with that, and then as your question alludes to a more subdued housing market at the moment, we still feel that we've got good demand factors that are going to drive the business going into a busy leasing season. Yes, Jeff, maybe to start with the second part of the question. Yes, challenging on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, we're seeing a good trend up. So we hope to continue to see that build as we go into further months into the year, and our confidence grows month-by-month even through the month of April, as we've talked about. So that's 1 powerful component. \n Thematically, many of the markets where we're starting to see this reacceleration on the early side, were typically markets that were not the high flyers and the peaks of the pandemic era, so they haven't had to reset relative to the more dramatic rate increases and overall demand increases that we saw through the pandemic. So on the flip side of that, you're not hearing us talk about Florida, for instance. So Florida has got a ways to go before I think we'd add them into that reaccelerating bucket. \n But on a more active level and more dominant level across the portfolio as we've listed out market by market, we're starting to see that improvement, particularly where we've got markets that weren't those high flyers but seeing more consistent performance, and we're seeing to see -- we're starting to see that reacceleration as we speak. So there's more to come. As we've also talked to, so we're confident as the year plays out, we're likely to add to this list of reaccelerating markets. And again, as I just mentioned, with many of these markets not dealing with an abundance of new supply as well. Sorry, you cut out. Can you repeat? I'm sorry, you cut out for a second. Yes, Jeff, if you step back, I mean I appreciate the way that Yardi attempts to track nationally, both development activity. And then more precisely, what I think can be more difficult is the reality of how many of those projects, actually, get -- put into production and then are likely to complete on a year-by-year basis. So we've been very consistent now for the last 2 to 3 years where we in our own development activity have seen the competitive factor of the supply taper down. \n It's tapering down in 2024. So I think I would say we have a bit of a different opinion if they're pointing some type of an uptick this year. What we see and has been very commanding on a day-to-day basis. And if you're actually doing development as we're doing on a national basis, the amount of headwinds, the amount of timing delays, the amount of complication market to market has not eased at all. \n Again, we've been very consistent about that. And then you layer on a, the cost of capital that Tom and I've been talking to as well as the unpredictability in certain markets relative to demand, et cetera, there's more headwinds than any developer on an individual basis is facing. And by virtue of that, you're seeing a downdraft in the amount of deliveries, which we think are going to continue going into next year and the year after. \n We're frankly looking at development if you're starting fresh in any given market that could take anywhere from 2 to 3 years just to get through an entitlement process right now. So just think about that from a calendar standpoint, that puts you out into 2026 and 2027 and there's really not an easy way to combat that. So the risk factors tied to development continue to increase for all the factors I just mentioned. And we're pretty confident that our lens into that activity is far more accurate than others. And then maybe just a third component from a macro health of customer standpoint with plus or minus 85% of our customers being consumers, employment trends continue to validate the economy is in very strong shape. We're not seeing any elevated level of stress play through that even takes us back to the pre-pandemic levels, i.e., they're better. Payment patterns, delinquency patterns, et cetera, are still in a very good zone. We're not seeing any new and undue stress that's coming through on the customer environment as a whole. So we continue to be very pleased and confident about our ability to see that level of stability with our existing customer base. Yes. I mean we take clearly a multiyear view of that hurdle rate. It hasn't changed even out of some of the pressure points that we've spoken to. So we continue to see the opportunity to find very good land sites, assets that will, from a competitive standpoint, not be burdened relative to any undue risk. That's another thing that we factor in with the amount of data and the knowledge we have submarket to submarket that gives us the level of confidence we can get to that hurdle, if not higher. \n So really haven't changed any of our hurdle expectations and/or the risk that, that might convey relative to what could play out on a market-by-market basis. To your point, yes, there's definitely more things that we're evaluating relative to the cost, timing, rent level achievements, et cetera, that go into underwriting, but we're still confident that we're adding to and finding very good sites to continue to grow our scale in many, many markets nationally. \n So development team is working very hard to uncover those opportunities. Frankly, maybe another point to your question, we have a different and more advantageous competitive advantage. We're seeing more land sites that might be further into entitlement processes that we are interested relative to potentially accelerating some of those delivery hurdles that I talked about. So many factors in this environment actually played our platform quite well, and we continue to one by one take advantage of those. Yes, Spenser. I would say in light fashion, no stress points or any other headwinds that we're seeing from that type of customer. There's obviously a very broad range of user types, different industries, some are product-oriented, some are service-oriented, some are very specific to certain locations. But I wouldn't, in any way, characterize we're seeing any elevated level of stress, actually, still very good, consistent use of storage, particularly, as I mentioned, there may be certain factors that pull a commercial customer configuration into one property at a higher or lower level than another. But again, nothing that we've seen that indicates there's an elevated level of stress or concern. As the economy continues to be quite good, we're seeing actually still good demand factors coming from business users overall. Sure. Yes. So to again, point to 2024 guidance on acquisitions, we've pegged $500 million. Obviously, at this point in the year, it's going to be more back ended. But some of the commentary, Juan, earlier in the call relative to what we're likely to see with a range of different motivations from sellers, we've got, I think, good perception into the ways that we can get to that kind of acquisition volume as we sit here today. The Canada question, to your point around the Hughes family and their ownership and platform in that market, it does not impede our ability to go into that market itself. So there are no conflicts on either side for either party to continue to look at a range of investments in that market. So with that, no commentary relative to what the future may play out, but there are no constraints on our part. Yes, I can speak to that in certainly our own platform. So the goals that we pointed to in our Investor Day presentation or achieved plus or minus a couple of years ago, so we were very pleased with the opportunity that we saw to optimize labor hours with many of the tools that supported that, particularly tied to our digital platform. What has played out from, again, the last 2 years through today and then even going forward, there's actually more to achieve. That comes from the continued improvement in our operating model, the digital tools that we're using not only for one type of day-to-day demand that comes in and out of a property, which is tied to move-in activity, but its overall customer support. We've rolled out a PS app that now we have about 1.5 million customers tied to. \n So that's direct account management that takes the burden off of property labor hours, very efficient for the customer as well. So it's a win-win in terms of not only time savings on our end of the spectrum but efficiency and consistency from a customer standpoint. We continue to look at very different and robust digital tools and optimization tools that give us the amount of clarity and trajectory that we're going to likely see with continued reduction in FTA hours. I think we're doing that in a very different way than the industry has done. You can look at some metrics that you can benchmark our performance to others. \n So Tom already mentioned that about 2/3 of our customers now transact with us digitally. That's far and excess of not only what the industry is achieving. But what level of accelerated performance we're getting from that channel and that level of interaction with customers directly. So a lot of good things that we're continuing to tackle on that front. \n With the amount of data that we have, we continue to look at different ways of continuing to optimize and bolt-on more, again, opportunities to not only drive down labor hours, but as importantly, maintain or increase customer satisfaction levels. So a lot of good things that we're continuing to invest in there and very confident about the trajectory we're on. And just again to bolt on a comment, Ron, that we made in other questions. Again, very, very little competitive new supply. It's one of the most difficult markets to either a find land sites and work through entitlement processes, et cetera. Uniquely, though, it's the market at the moment, we have the most development activity nationally in. So we uniquely are finding some interesting opportunities to expand our portfolio right here in Southern California.  And to Tom's point, we're still seeing very consistent and good levels of activity. Yes. Individual sellers, Caitlin, small or deal-by-deal opportunities. As typically, we see there's a range of different seller types that were in dialogue very actively. So these were, again, individual owners. I would tell you, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to have a whole range of different conversations with different owner types, whether family owners, individual owners, institutional owners, but again, the deals that we've got either closed or under contract or just that very one-offs, smaller assets that fit well into certain markets that we're certainly interested in growing scale, et cetera. Yes. I would say, Brendan, on a macro basis, we still see a very healthy consumer base. We've got plus or minus about 2 million customers. So full spectrum of the economy at large and not really seeing any undue pressure market by market or again, that would indicate that there's some elevated amount of risk that's coming from relative to stress points, et cetera. I think you're hearing a fair amount of commentary even now that we're well into 2024 around consumer balance sheets, employment levels are quite strong. I think this is part of the angst that the Fed is having relative to their timing relative to tapering, et cetera. So the employment and behavior from consumers at large continues to be quite good, and we're very pleased by that, obviously. \n On a day-to-day basis, we're not seeing the type of range of when you see a customer go into some level of delinquency, et cetera, the pace and the nature of that pattern isn't as elevated as it was pre-pandemic. So keeping a very close eye on, but no material shift and continues to give us an outlook that the consumer environment is going to be quite healthy."

            "name": "H. Boyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. Shifting to financial performance. We reported first quarter core FFO of $4.03 representing a 1.2% decline compared to the first quarter of 2023. Looking at the same-store portfolio, revenue increased 0.1% compared to the first quarter of '23. That was driven by rent growth, offset by modest occupancy declines. Move-in rates, adjusting out our winter promotional sale activity were down 11% in the quarter.\n Positive net move-in volumes led to a modest closing of the occupancy gap at quarter end to down 60 basis points. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 4.8% for the first quarter, largely driven by increases in property tax and marketing spend to drive move-in activity. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties declined 1.5% in the quarter. Our performance in the stabilized same-store pool was supplemented by very strong growth in our nonsame-store pool, as Joe highlighted.  \n With the nonsame-store assets at 81% occupancy in the quarter, we have confidence in outsized growth from that pool to come this year and into the future, which is a segue to our outlook for '24. We reaffirmed our core FFO guidance for the year with a $16.90 midpoint on par with 2023. The first quarter was in line with our internal expectations. And as we discussed on our last quarterly call, we anticipate deceleration of financial performance into the second quarter and with improvement in the second half.  \n Outlook for capital allocation remains intact with $450 million of development deliveries anticipated, which will be a record year for Public Storage and $500 million of acquisitions in the second half. The transaction market for acquisitions remains subdued with limited volumes given a volatile cost of capital environment year-to-date. We're optimistic that there's a pent-up level of transaction activity likely to come, and we're eager to participate when that does occur.  \n Finally, our capital and liquidity position remains strong. We refinanced our 2024 maturities in April with a combination of a 3-year floating rate note, a 15-year euro note and a 30-year reopening. Our leverage of 3.9x net debt and preferred to EBITDA puts us in a very strong position heading through the year.  \n So with that, I'll turn the call back to Rob to open it up for a Q&A session. Yes. And Samir, maybe, it's Tom here. Maybe I'll just provide a couple of data points on April as well. Similar trends, as Joe mentioned, on move-in rents into April, we are starting to increase those rents, as Joe highlighted, as we move into May in the peak leasing season. Existing customers performing quite well, something that Joe highlighted in his remarks. Move-outs were again down year-over-year in the month of April, occupancy finished the month down 50 to 60 basis points. So a pretty consistent April. And obviously, we're eager to get into May, June and July here, the peak leasing season of the year. Yes. Sure. Keegan, this is Tom. So I wouldn't edit any of the commentary that we had in February around any of the assumptions really heading into the peak leasing season here. We obviously just provided that outlook a little over 60 days ago. And as Joe mentioned and probably not surprisingly, providing that outlook 2/3 of the way through the first quarter. The first quarter played out very similar to our expectations. \n And I think that the range of outcomes very much intact there as well. And specifically to the housing market, we are not anticipating in any of the ranges a robust housing market. And based on where interest rates have moved, I think that's the right place to be as we sit here today as well. Sure. Keegan, I'll preface some NAREIT meetings then. So I would highlight, maybe, 2 elements that we would be pleased to be discussing at NAREIT and I think would give us a positive tone. One of them, going back to Joe's commentary, is adding more markets to that list of markets that are reaccelerating, right? As we think about the bottoms that are occurring in many of these markets and reacceleration, we're a collection of 90 markets around the country, not a one-stop moving portfolio. And so adding more markets to that list gives us more and more confidence in terms of the outlook and the performance of the portfolio as a whole, clearly. \n The second thing, I'd maybe highlight, would be more dialogue, I think to the questions we were just discussing around capital allocation, more dialogue with sellers, not necessarily more transactions over the next 30 days, but more dialogue, more underwriting activity as we set up for what is traditionally a busier time period for self-storage transactions in the second half of the year, we'll start to have some of that dialogue here over the next 30 to 60 days. And Joe, I don't know if there's anything you'd add. No? Good. Yes. Very good question, Eric, to clarify what we're meaning by that. So specifically, what we're speaking to is month-over-month improvement in year-over-year revenue growth. So if you think about -- pick a market, it's growing 1% in the month of February, in the month of March, it's growing 1.5%. That would be an reaccelerating market. So not a seasonal thing or revenue on an absolute basis going higher because of higher occupancy or things like that, but actual year-over-year growth improvement. \n And contextually, it's part of the opportunity that continues to play through in many, many markets. We mentioned waning supply. So we're also going into an environment where the competition factor in the vast majority of our markets continues to decrease. Again, as we're starting to see this reacceleration that's also, for the most part, in many markets with very little new supply coming in. That's too an additive factor relative to the amount of demand that we continue to see an opportunity to drive more customers into the portfolio. Yes. That's a good question, Eric. So we've run these sales consistently over time. And last year, we ran a number of different time periods. And in the month of -- tail end of February and beginning of March, we ran one as well. The primary reason is we had some inventory that we felt like we can move. And so the different points of the year, we'll try different promotional tactics, sales tactics to drive customer activity, pairing that with advertising and the like. We tend to see good traction there. We saw good traction during the winter season here, as we talked about, and we'll likely use -- continue to use promotional activity, sale activity and the like through the year this year, not dissimilar to what we did last year. Yes, Todd. No, I'd point you to all of that commentary that we had on the February call as intact as it relates to the assumptions that underlie the range there. And as you'd anticipate, the next 3 months are going to be important as to which directions we're heading on certain of those metrics. We've been encouraged by performance to date. And we'll have more to talk about ranges and things like that as we move through the year. Sure. There's -- I mean, there's definitely a range of outcomes and assumptions that you can make on the revenue modeling. I think what you're highlighting is, if you have better occupancy performance but worse rate performance. But if you end up in the same spot, could you end up in the same places you otherwise would have anticipated. Absolutely. So I think there's a couple of parts to that question, Todd. I think the first one is around length of stays and what we've seen trend-wise. And we've been really pleasantly surprised over the last several years at how sticky the length of stay has been when we were sitting here on calls in 2021, we were concerned that maybe there'd be a pretty quick return to normal or \"pre-pandemic\" length of stays, and we're now sitting here in 2024 still talking about longer length of stays compared to pre-pandemic levels. \n But we're certainly off of those 2021 and 2022 peaks. And so there has been a \"normalization\". But I think some of the factors that have led to longer length of stay are durable. We've talked about customers that are using storage because they ran out of space in their home, less housing turnover likely leads to longer length of stays. All these things can be a positive as it relates to length of stay. And so while we're off the piece, we still remain encouraged by customer behavior and the length of stays that we're seeing in the portfolio today. So it may be the first part. The second part is, how are we thinking about move-out activity and move-out activity, I think, in the midpoint case is for basically flat year-over-year move-out activity. So we're not anticipating a spike in that midpoint case. Yes, that's a great question. So as you highlighted, operating expense for the quarter was above our full year outlook. And so we are anticipating that overall operating expense trends will improve. And so you've hit on a couple of the drivers of that, and I'll elaborate on a couple of others. The first one, property tax, we still are anticipating property tax to be plus or minus 5% year-over-year growth for the year. The first quarter did have some reassessments that were earlier in the year this year that was kind of onetime related. \n On the marketing topic, similarly, if you look at marketing spend in the first quarter, it was pretty consistent with the fourth quarter, which is a little bit higher seasonally, we'd anticipate marketing spend both on an absolute basis, but also on a year-over-year basis to moderate a little bit as we move through the year, obviously, depending on customer demand activity and the like, but that's another driver. \n But I would also add 2 others. One is our capital investments that we're making in solar power on our rooftops, which has a myriad benefits for us, obviously, the environment and our customer base. And one of the factors there will be lowering utility expense. We had that in the first quarter, but that's going to continue as we move through the next couple of quarters. And then also the technology investments that we've made around our customer interaction now over 2/3 of our customers are coming to us and renting digitally before they ever show up in a property. That number continues to grow, and we've been very clear around some of the opportunities to utilize that for specialization and centralization of roles and lower payroll expense as we move through the year, and we'll see more of that heading through 2024 as well. Yes, certainly. I mean as you see momentum in a market, we've talked consistently about how we think about existing customer rent increases. One of the factors is certainly the cost to replace a tenant and as we see moving rate and demand activity percolating in those markets that will feed into our thinking about, well, should a customer maybe receive a higher magnitude or higher frequency of increase, so. Absolutely. And I think second piece of our existing customer rate increase models around customer performance, and we've been speaking in a couple of previous questions around how we continue to be encouraged by that behavior. Yes, Michael. I'd say across the Board, different pricing, promotion and advertising tactics will lead to drawing more, a little bit different mixes of customers and the like to our stores. And so we pull those different levers throughout the year, looking to try to maximize NOI ultimately. So revenue less the advertising expense associated with it. And so we're toggling those levers, trying to maximize that outcome. And so as you look at a sale, for instance, it will draw more customers and we'll use some different tactics around pricing and promotion and advertising to try to optimize that overall lifetime value of the customer. Yes, Spenser, it's a good question. And maybe a follow-up to Michael's question on how we're managing pricing, promotion, advertising. All 3 are being utilized really at a local level to drive a combination of either traffic in the form of advertising or conversion rates related to pricing and promotion activity. And advertising is something that we can use either nationally or what we typically do is much more locally to support top-of-funnel demand in local markets where we're getting both a combination of good return on that ad spend but also supporting properties that would benefit from incremental top-of-funnel demand. So it varies pretty widely. There's a lot embedded in there. I think the first thing, I would say, is as you look at cost to replace, you all can see some of the elements that go into cost to replace pretty clearly based on our move-in and move-out rates. Some of them are different and related to how long we think a unit will be vacant, what the advertising spend may be associated with the unit, what the promotional activity may be around it and that's all managed at the individual unit level. \n And so big picture, one of the things we've highlighted this year is that we think overall contribution from existing customer rate increases will be pretty consistent with last year. And you said, well, how can that be if you think cost to replace maybe a little bit higher. And I'd say, well, there's another element that I add to what I just highlighted, which is the mix of the tenant base. So we had success in moving in a meaningful number of new customers last year above and beyond the prior year. Those customers tend to get a higher frequency of increase earlier on in their tenancy and that's contributing to performance this year of our ECRI program. And so I think there's a multitude of different components there. Cost to replace is certainly an important one. But as we look at the year, this year, we think overall contribution will be relatively consistent. Yes, sure. So I anticipate that overall demand contribution this year is pretty similar to last year. And the way we've bucketed the contribution to move-ins last year was about 15%, 1-5 percent of customers that are coming to us because of an existing home sale related move and that was down from about 20% in a more typical year. So a relatively modest contribution. Customers that are moving and they're renters, either single-family or multifamily renters, tend to make up a larger percentage, call it, between 40%, 45% of the tenant base. \n And then you've got another group that we've consistently spoke of that's been elevated post-2020, and that's customers that have run out of space at home. That's been a consistently outpunching pre-pandemic levels and is likely to be more like 15%, 20%. And then as you go beyond that, I'd call it other. There's a whole host of interesting use cases as well as commercial tenants that will make up the rest. And so we continue to see good, obviously, move-in activity at our stores. And as Joe mentioned, we've been encouraged by that activity year-to-date. Yes, that's a great question. So Southern California continues to be a strong market for us, both Los Angeles as well as San Diego. During the quarter, we were impacted by some storm activity and state of emergency restrictions that impacted the quarter's financial performance for a couple of months. But those markets continue to see strong customer activity, and we have confidence in those markets heading through the rest of the year. Yes. So a couple of questions, components there. So the first quarter and fourth quarter, we tend to see higher percents of revenue as we think about supporting demand in quarters where we have seasonally more inventory to rent, and we get good returns in those quarters to do that. And then we typically see the second and third quarter marketing spend come down a little bit as a percentage of revenue.\n As you look at the quarter, yes, it was probably pretty consistent with some quarters we had back in 2018, 2019, maybe a touch under what some of them were, but a comfortable range as we think about the level of marketing support that we're providing the stores. As I mentioned on a previous question, that's dynamically managed around local demand trends and supporting the business. But I would anticipate from an absolute percentage of revenue that's likely to decline in the next couple of quarters like it did last year before coming up again in the fourth quarter to support higher inventory levels at the lower levels of occupancy we experienced in the fourth quarter. Yes. We would anticipate, Caitlin, that, that spread does narrow in the second and third quarters seasonally before widening out again in the fourth quarter. So not dissimilar from a seasonal trend standpoint to what I was speaking to related to advertising. I did, Ki Bin. I'd say on a year-over-year basis, it's been pretty consistent, touch better than last year, which is what we'd anticipate. And obviously, we're anticipating that likely to continue here through the peak leasing season. We'll update you on that as we move through the next 3 months or so. No, it's going to go to 0. Probably some of the cash payments on the cash flow statement will continue into the first quarter or so of next year just as we wrap up the program and make our final payments. But ultimately, that will go to 0. Okay. So there's kind of 2 parts to that question. One is the accelerating markets, and those accelerated markets are driven by a whole host of things and not just individually moving rents, right? But as we think about that, we highlighted on the previous call 2 or 3 markets that were accelerating at the time we were sitting there in February, and we added a handful of markets to that. So we're definitely seeing improving trends across that group of markets. \n I think your next question was just sequentially as we think about year-over-year declines in move-in rents and on the February call, I had highlighted that January, February move-in rates were down in the 10% or 11% ZIP code. And we finished the quarter and had April right around that same sort of level. Obviously, there's periods of time where it's a little bit better than that, periods of time where we're lowering rates to drive move-in volume. \n So it's been relatively consistent, which is what you'd anticipate really through the first part of the year because you're at the trough point of rents. And as I noted, we're at the point of the year now where we are raising rents now. And that's when we're likely to see some changing activity as it relates to those trends, as we've discussed in our outlook. Yes, pretty consistent in terms of trends. With the exception of what I highlighted earlier around more newer tenants added to the program, given that strong move-in volumes last year. Sure, Mike. I think there's a number of factors. You rattle off some of them that are contributing to it. We listed a series of markets. Each market is a little bit different. Certainly, supply plays a component in some of those markets, meaning a lack of supply, higher barriers to entry as Joe spoke to on certain of those markets. But I'd also highlight stronger demand trends, better move-in rent trends, better move-out activity. It's really a handful of different drivers that are unique to each market. \n But as you characterize them all, I would categorize them into markets that didn't have the same, really strong levels of growth in '21 and '22 and so don't have the same level of really difficult comps to come off of. And as Joe mentioned earlier, you can put Florida, for instance, as a big winner over the last couple of years is likely to take a little bit longer to normalize, but still has been a really strong performer over the last several years for us. Yes. We did use a little bit of TV advertising. It's one of the things that we can utilize pretty uniquely in the industry, given our national scale and platform. And so that's something we will use periodically. In this case, we used it to advertise some of our promotional activity, which we saw a good reaction to in the quarter."
